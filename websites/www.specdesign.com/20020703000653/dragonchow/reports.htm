    </big></big><font face="Arial"><br>
    Recently, I attended a raid upon the lair of <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3283" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Lord Nagafen</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    a Necromancer, my job was vague at best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Providing
    some buff spells that were sure to be dispelled by the mighty dragon so that the spell
    effects of other buff spells would remain was the first part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Supplying other casters and clerics with mana was
    part two, and sending my pet off to attack ole Naggy was part three.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">All was going well, but we seemed a bit light on
    forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trusting in my raid leader, I was
    ready for a heated (no pun intended) battle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon
    the attack was launched, and the warriors charged forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Next was the casters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Landing a
    spell on Lord Nagafen is darn near impossible for a Necromancer, so I was jogging back and
    forth to heal and mana pump as I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon
    the warriors, shadowknights and monks started dropping, and the healers were being
    summoned by the Lord of Fire to meet their deaths in the lava pits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, I had cast Dead Man Floating on them
    and they remained above the damage of the lava.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    the dragon also has very sharp claws, and they were torn to bits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>The casters were next, and I knew my moment of
    death was upon me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a quiet stillness
    that comes from wanting only to hurt your foe before you die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it is because you have accepted your
    death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it is tension of the moment,
    allowing you to see each second as it passes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, my pet was still alive and swinging and I knew I had time to make Lord Nagafen
    pay for my death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I quickly launched into a
    spell casting furor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One spell resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>Two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lord Nagafen is burned with acid!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Success!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Midway
    through the next spell casting my pet died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>Assuming that I was next, I interrupted my casting
    at the same time I was summoned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tearing
    through my Steelskin, Lord Nagafen attacked with the absolute certainty that I would die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as the magical barrier dropped, I was able to
    put up another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Impenetrable but taxing as it
    was, I knew I could not maintain it for long and decided to put some distance between me
    and the dragon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as my barrier dropped, I
    began to feign death in hopes of fooling the beast into thinking he had already done me
    in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was summoned to his feet and destined
    to be his next meal.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>Perhaps it was that quiet stillness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it was my secret desire to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What ever it was, I was glad for it because I was
    able to maintain my concentration and finish the spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Immediately, the dragon lost interest in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He saw me as just one more corpse for snacking on later and moved deeper
    into his lair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I lay there
    undecided.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Do I run now or wait for help?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking down at the bodies around me, I began to
    drag them to a safe spot for a cleric to undo Naggy&#146;s handiwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several trips later, Naggy saw my efforts and
    roared his disapproval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By this time I had
    recovered my energy and was able to pull off the same trick as before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it was 4 times that he had attempted to kill
    me and I had survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps this is a
    sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I just got lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can decide for yourself, but I like to think I
    am just that damn good!</font></p>

                was an unusually warm and sunny day in Iceclad as I trudged through 
                the knee deep snow making my way past the gnoll camp toward the 
                distant tower. The Tower of Frozen Shadows it was called by the 
                locals, or TOFS for short. I had never been there before, but 
                the guild leader of Dragonchow had called for a raid upon it and 
                I was answering that call. I had also never been on a raid before. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All I knew of raids was what I heard over the guild speak channel 
                on Friday nights. Usually the great Warlord Radalas was barking 
                orders while others were reporting mana levels. It all sounded 
                very exciting, but I was always too young to join. This time however 
                Swifthand had called for a 30-40 level assault on TOFS, and I 
                was eager to be apart of it. Not only would this be my first guild 
                organized assault, it would also be my first meeting with many 
                of the legendary names of Dragonchow.<br>
                <br>
                I reached the tower under the cover of invisibility. It was a 
                bit dank and drab inside, but I was out of the wind at least. 
                In the tower&#146;s antechamber I found my wife Sarenia, the 36<sup>th</sup> 
                level Erudian Enchantress, and MrPain, the 36<sup>th</sup> level 
                Iksar Warrior. Now, having done some research about the guild 
                I knew MrPain, was also none other than Teroth Castille the Duke 
                of Dragonchow, (our sovereign&#146;s brother). We sat together 
                in the cold flagstone awaiting the others, while Sarenia made 
                small talk, or flirted with MrPain, I honestly can&#146;t tell 
                the difference anymore. It wasn&#146;t long before His Lordship 
                Swifthand Silvereyes entered and stood upon the stone dais above 
                us and observed the assembled troops. He left swiftly (perhaps 
                it was the source of his name) muttering something about getting 
                a cleric. Then, unseen, and unannounced I turned to find a human 
                beside me clad in silver armor, with a bushy brown mustache. It 
                was Radalas the Great, hero of Kael. I immediately bowed before 
                him, when I noticed someone from the Allegiance of Faith had also 
                arrived and was sitting quietly in the shadows. His name was Salfadorn 
                a high level cleric. <br>
                <br>
                </font> 
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Swifthand returned and 
                  with him came Medikar, and Dharius, a 29<sup>th</sup> level 
                  cleric. It was then that the King explained his intent. He was 
                  forming a 30-40 level group to fight in the tower as a training 
                  exercise, while having the higher level guild members standing 
                  by as our safely net for when we got ourselves in trouble. It 
                  was important that we newbies learned the proper art of group 
                  play for when we get old enough to join the true raids. Soon 
                  Drukinpinoch, a 36<sup>th</sup> level shadowknight arrived and 
                  we began fighting. Our intent was to obtain the first key that 
                  would allow us access through the mirror (portal), to the next 
                  level up. At first we were sloppy, at least I was. Cramped quarters, 
                  and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>lots of mobs 
                  made it hard to determine how best to assist the group. It didn&#146;t 
                  take long before we had two sets of keys, and off we went to 
                  the second level. </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>This 
                  was the library. Several ghostly students were busy at their 
                  desks scribbling away, and when we arrived the librarian seemed 
                  upset and told us so by attacking. Poor MrPain held her off 
                  while<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nuked and 
                  Dharius healed, and Sarenia kept the rest at bay. We fell into 
                  a better rhythm here, until Swifthand pulled the whole room 
                  at once causing Salfadorn (I think, or perhaps Saladar made 
                  a cameo appearance) to cast a powerful spell killing the entire 
                  lot at once. This happened a few times and resulted in a net 
                  value of one blue bub per area nuke.</font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Dharius 
                  obtained the teacher&#146;s Syllubus, as did I and Sarenia managed 
                  to get one of the student&#146;s homework (all nice caster items), 
                  but then things went deadly. Sarenia was singled out by one 
                  of the ghosts and killed. In attempting to help her I gained 
                  the agro and was being slaughtered. Dharius attempted to help 
                  but was killed himself before he could. All three of us died 
                  in short order. We were all quickly resurrected however, an 
                  interesting experience&#151;Sarenia had never been rezzed before 
                  and I only once. </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Despite 
                  gaining tremendous experience, and three nice items, it was 
                  then decided that we should do something truly insa&#133;I mean 
                  challenging. We were going directly to the top of the tower 
                  and face <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5604" style="color: rgb(128,128,255)">Tserrina&#146;s</a> 
                  power openly. This was where my life took a bad turn, or perhaps 
                  more accurately I turned the wrong way. </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>We exited the 
                  tower and appeared at the base amidst a handful of stone guardians, 
                  little spinning tornados of rocks that hit for about 60 points 
                  of damage. Everyone had bolted away very quickly, while I stood 
                  hesitating my next move. I had a fifty fifty chance I figured. 
                  The door back into the tower, the safety of a zone was only 
                  a short distance away, but which way, left or right? Sarenia 
                  shouted for me to go left. (assuming I was facing the tower, 
                  problem was, I was facing away from the tower.) I turned left 
                  and began running around the base picking up more and more stone 
                  tornados as I ran, thinking the door had to be there any second. 
                  My seconds ran out however, and my spirit left my body. </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I was 
                  dead for quite sometime as Radalas and Swifthand search for 
                  my corpse. I was hearing various reports and chatter about feeding 
                  my body to the Gnolls and Iksars finding Euridan tastes remarkably 
                  well. I became really concerned when they announced they did 
                  not have enough pieces left to resurect. &nbsp; Sarenia began 
                  her search for a new husband and set her eyes on Indra but Purti 
                  said he was taken.&nbsp; Finally I was found and resurrected. 
                  I appeared at my body at the base of the tower, with Switfy 
                  and Rad on either side of me. I immediately looted. No sooner 
                  had I finished than I was attacked by more of the same whirling 
                  stones. I noticed that Swifty had dragged my corpse and I was 
                  now standing right in front of the door. All I needed to do 
                  was take two steps and zone. When I tried to move however, I 
                  was unable. I was so weak from being mostly dead, I couldn&#146;t 
                  even managed the two steps. I had a beard with Storm Giant&#146;s 
                  strength and tried firing that off to boost me enough to fall 
                  into the door, but it failed to free me. I died shortly there 
                  after, and can still hear Swifthand&#146;s mournful cry in my 
                  dead ears as he yelled, &#147;NO!&#148;</font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>My spirit 
                  remained in the ether, nether land for quite some time. It was 
                  during this time that Drukinpinoch and Dharius left us though 
                  I don&#146;t know why or how. I watched the clouds passing by, 
                  for quite sometime and began to grow concerned&#151;something 
                  wasn&#146;t right. I started to feel a desire to go into the 
                  light, when I was finally resurrected. This time I looted, and 
                  as soon as I could move dove into the door. </font></p>

                  a 60<sup>th</sup> level warrior.&#148; &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We all 
                  looked at Radalas in horror. What happened - we were all amazed 
                  for what could destroy our 60th level hero. &quot;About 12 to15 
                  dervishes&quot;.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;They

                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We dusted ourselves off 
                  and there were a few moments where we looked for new, higher 
                  level recruits to help us tackle the top of the tower. Soon 
                  we were off once more. We reached a new mirror and no key we 
                  had worked, but now a new guild member joined us. Crymrych a 
                  shape shifting Dwarven rogue made quick work of picking the 
                  lock and suddenly we were all on the top level of the tower. 
                  We fought for a brief time, killing a few bats, then we were 
                  ordered to go invisible and follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
                  &nbsp; </span>We walked along a treacherous polished stone parapet 
                  to the right side was a spiral staircase; to the other was a 
                  sheer drop. To my shock Medikar and Radalas jumped off. <br>
                  <br>
                  &#147;But isn&#146;t there a stair?&#148; I started to say, 
                  when out of fear of losing the group I jumped as well seriously 
                  twisting my ankle at the bottom. Off we went again, this time 
                  down a narrow corridor with arched openings on either side. 
                  I was bringing up the rear (no doubt due to the pain in my ankle), 
                  when my invis dropped unexpectedly. I was attacked. Several 
                  bat swarmed me at once, apparently they have a fondness for 
                  Erudian blood. In retrospect I should have stopped and died 
                  in the corridor, but not realizing the power of the bats, and 
                  perhaps over estimating the prowess of my comrades, I ran to 
                  them assuming they would make quick work of the cute little 
                  rats with wings. Indeed when I heard Radalas shout, &#147;DIE 
                  ELD!&#148; I thought he it was calling a warning to the others 
                  that I was in trouble and needed help, when in fact he really 
                  wanted me to drop dead. Not clear on the situation I didn&#146;t 
                  understand, but I would soon learn. <br>
                  <br>
                  By bringing the bats into the otherwise safe room, I lead the 
                  death parade for my party. One after another they dropped, death 
                  and carnage was everywhere. Sarenia died next, and Radalas, 
                  MrPain and Crymrych fought valiantly, side by side in a suicide 
                  battle that managed to buy Medikar the precious few moments 
                  he needed to camp out. I must say I was very impressed with 
                  the teamwork, skill and courage displayed in that desperate 
                  hour. More was to come. <br>
                  <br>
                  Once more I found myself hovering in limbo watching the clouds 
                  and listening to the chatter of my loved ones in the guild.&nbsp; 
                  Purti was in a group somewhere and frustrated with her Cleric.&nbsp; 
                  Apparently he had taken up pulling and was neglecting is healing 
                  responsibilites.&nbsp; Mirer and Purti had an ongoing conversation 
                  how there should be no &quot;battle clerics&quot; and the disasters 
                  that becomes of them.&nbsp; <br>
                  </font></p>
                <p><img src="images/tofs2.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="432"><font face="Arial">Ironically 
                  during this conversation Medikar came back into the tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                  Alone and lacking mana he faced a vampire from the bat that 
                  was slain by the group before they all died.&nbsp; Alone he 
                  waged a battle while we from our external vantages gave him 
                  encouragement and moral support.&nbsp; Minutes seemed like hours 
                  while we awaited the fate of our last remaining survivor.&nbsp; 
                  Finally news - &quot;It's going to be close&quot; &nbsp; we 
                  heard him say - we held our breath.&nbsp; Victory&nbsp; at last.&nbsp; 
                  Sarenia shoulted across the guild &quot;Medikar is the mightest 
                  battle cleric!&quot;&nbsp; Purti replied &quot;Please tell me 
                  you are kidding.&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Well there were unusually 
                  circumstances&quot;.&nbsp; Sarenia replied.&nbsp; We could all 
                  now breath again.&nbsp; In time we were all resurrected by Medikar, 
                  and clustered in the tower. <br>
                  <br>
                  We now found ourselves in a small empty room.&nbsp; Radalas 
                  would go out and pull in a bat.&nbsp; Battle would rage on for 
                  what seemed like hours Sarenia and I would do our feeble small 
                  parts but the bulk of the battle on this level was clearly in 
                  the hands of our more experienced brethern.&nbsp; Finally a 
                  bat died only to bring forth a vampire. &nbsp; More fighting 
                  and healings and eventually it too died.&nbsp; A single battle 
                  with one took what seemed like 10 minutes although it probably 
                  could have been just a 3 or 5 in any case it became clear why 
                  I was commanded to die.&nbsp; Doing one was very difficult when 
                  we had 8 - 12 of course we could not survive.<br>

                  Several more battles raged on and then about this time Drukinpinoch 
                  requested to rejoin us. I thought back on the trials and deaths 
                  that got us up there, and wondered, how on earth would that 
                  be managed. It couldn&#146;t be, and we had to carry on without 
                  him.<br>

                <p><img src="images/tofs3.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="432"><font face="Arial">Radalas 
                  gave some quick instructions on the do&#146;s an don&#146;ts 
                  of facing Tserrina. Tserrina is the queen of the tower, a nasty 
                  vampiress with 100 percent resistance to magic, and a bad attitude. 
                  We began to think of her as Sarenia's evil twin.&nbsp; Rad began 
                  pulling bats, which spawned vampires at their deaths. My job 
                  was to snare the vamps and avoid aggros while nuking. At last 
                  I seemed to get the hang of this, although none of my snares 
                  held. Then to my surprise I DINGED 38, and lo and behold the 
                  snares began to work. <br>
                  <br>
                  At last a bat exploed and out came the dreaded Tserrina.&nbsp; 
                  Knowing we could do little agains her Sarenia and I did what 
                  little we could.&nbsp; Sarenia would add damage shields and 
                  speed buffs to the melee fighters and add a rune here and there 
                  only to be eaten away by a single hit from the dreaded beast.&nbsp; 
                  Suddenly Sarenia went linkdead I did all that I could - cast 
                  my feeble O&#146;keils, damage shield on the fighters. The battle 
                  was long and hard, with Salfadorn, and Medikar casting heals. 
                  Eventually she fell with a hideous cry. A moment later Sarenia 
                  reappeared. <br>
                  <br>
                  I&#146;m back, did I miss anything?&#148;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Tserrina&nbsp; dropped her staff, and it was unanimously decided 
                  that Sarenia should receive it. Eventually Medikar had to leave 
                  to wrap presents for his daughters birthday. &nbsp; He left 
                  us in Radalas capable hands and we continued to do battle.&nbsp; 
                  As the hours wained on Radalas annonced that after the next 
                  3 bats he would be leaving.&nbsp; We killed the first two and 
                  now we were down to the final battle of the night.&nbsp; <br>
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><br>
                  We waited as the last bat got lower and lower in health.&nbsp; 
                  Sarenia yelled out &quot;Come on evil sister be there, be there&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  The bat died and once again we were faced with Tserrina's evil 
                  wrath.&nbsp; Once again the epic battle was waged our brave 
                  guildmates pounded the evil queen and once again Sarenia went 
                  Linkdead.&nbsp; Just as before only minutes after the evil queen 
                  died - in pops Sarenia.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  I'm back, did I miss anything again?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Coincidence perhaps. But perhaps Sarenia and Tserrina cannot 
                  exist in the same plane together. Hoping for a robe but instead 
                  we got her necklace. Most of the guild was unimpressed but it 
                  was a far cry better than anything that Eldeberon and Sarenia 
                  presntly had so we were grateful for the gift. With that we 
                  called it a night with one last port by myself for the group 
                  to the dreadlands. <br>
                  <br>
                  In conclusion, TOFS was a wonderful time, at least speaking 
                  for myself and Sarenia. We both gained a level each, and learned 
                  much about teamwork in general. Sarenia also managed to walk 
                  away with a nice new necklace, the powerful staff of Teserenia 
                  and the Student&#146;s homework, while I had acquired the teacher&#146;s 
                  syllabus, which filled an empty slot in my inventory. Mostly 
                  however, and more importantly, it was just a whole lot of fun.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have 
                  now been on three forays into the Tower of Frozen Shadow (TOFS) 
                  in Iceclad, and I think I am finally starting to understand 
                  what goes on there. I know, with 209 intelligence and a head 
                  as tall as the Highhold Pass cliff, you'd think I'd catch on 
                  quicker, but I am still a relative newbie to the guild. Regardless, 
                  for good or ill, right or wrong, this is what I have concluded 
                  from my experiences in the haunted tower. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To begin with ToFS's 
                  is a death trap. It has multiple mobs that swarm and few ways 
                  out. The few exits that do exists port you outside the tower 
                  where hungry snow dervishes are waiting in droves to pummel 
                  you. Because of the key system, if you die you might never be 
                  able to claim your body. As a result TOFS is a VERY scary place. 
                  As such it is the prefect place to scare the cr -- I mean, &quot;train&quot; 
                  new DC recruits on tactics and group play. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dragonchow has, in 
                  point of fact, been using ToFS's as a training ground. The idea 
                  is to take mid-level members, who may, or may not have had much 
                  experience with grouping or raiding, and hone their skills to 
                  a quality where they will be an asset to a &quot;real&quot; 
                  guild raid, rather than a hindrance. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The technique is 
                  to have two groups, one high-level and one mid-level. The high 
                  level is there only to support the mid-level in he event of 
                  emergency (and no doubt to obtain a good belly laugh at the 
                  sorry antics of the less experienced). The mid-level group is 
                  designed to be comprised with proper melee, caster, healer elements 
                  and then let loose on the second floor to fight as they wish. 
                  The high-level group watches the action and offer helpful suggestions 
                  as to how we can improve our performance. I have always found 
                  their suggestions to be considerate and politely delivered, 
                  (which I am very impressed with considering the political delicacy 
                  needed to offer advice without sounding like &quot;Hey! What 
                  are you an idiot! How did you get to level 40 pulling that crap!&quot; 
                  ) and, for me at least, very helpful -- as I rarely group with 
                  melees and needed the advice. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the mid group 
                  gets a rhythm down, and initial rough edges are smoothed, it 
                  is time to take on a greater challenge. I do believe Radalas, 
                  (who was part of two of the TOFS adventures I have been on), 
                  has something of the &quot;sadistic prankster&quot; in his nature. 
                  With the intent of preparing the new recruits (perhaps a poor 
                  choice of term as some of the mid-level players have high level 
                  mains who have been in DC for some time now, but you get my 
                  drift), to be able to face the worst case scenario Radalas has 
                  purposely trained us with a horde of ghostly students--and I 
                  mean a train! I believe he has pulled the entire library on 
                  us before. Radalas' version of the Cobiashi Maru test. Keep 
                  in mind he has several high level clerics standing by to give 
                  full rezzes if anyone dies. Although it might appear that way, 
                  he's not <i>totally</i> insane. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This last Sunday 
                  DC held a Training Raid on ToFS. Sylen was the leader of the 
                  raid. It was his first time as leader and I believe Radalas 
                  was providing him guidance. So we newbies, were being lead by 
                  a raw lieutenant into the dreadful tower. Sylen, I felt did 
                  a great job, albeit he seemed a tad under confident, apologizing 
                  for delay and poor organization, but honestly I felt he was 
                  doing fine. I have run small groups myself and understand the 
                  insane difficulties involved in getting everyone in order in 
                  a timely fashion. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ToFS always seems 
                  to start in chaos. I say it &quot;seems&quot; to, but appearances 
                  can be deceiving. There is no organization on the first floor 
                  because none is needed. The high level members busy themselves 
                  killing the mobs to obtain the keys needed, while the rest are 
                  waiting for the late comers to arrive. The newbies feel confused 
                  because they have little to do and no direction, but that soon 
                  changes, and I was relieved when Sylen began to announce teams. 
                  I rather felt like I was back in school being picked for dodgeball. 
                  As usual I was picked last and then switched between teams (lol). 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/tofsrevisited2.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="335">We 
                  went to the second floor, where we practiced pulling a few and 
                  had no problem at all. So we quickly moved on to the third floor. 
                  We fought there until we had such a good rhythm it was getting 
                  boring. Radalas must have realized this, or maybe &quot;he&quot; 
                  was just getting bored-still I like to think Rad honestly was 
                  trying to strengthen our sense of self-confidence and force 
                  us to learn how to act in dire peril. It is, after all, far 
                  better to practice proper defensive procedures when you have 
                  an army of high level clerics standing by than when you are 
                  without a safety net. So it was Radalas' intent to push us to 
                  the limit. He began by training the ghosts from the second level 
                  up to us. He failed however bringing but one measly student. 
                  So he then came up with a nastier plan. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He proposed that 
                  we all go up to the fourth floor, an area that I think, Rad 
                  thought, we were incapable of holding at our level. So we all 
                  went up, but Rad (I assume) secretly ordered that the high-level 
                  group would remain behind. He abandoned us purposely to see 
                  if we would sink or swim. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The moment we all 
                  arrived and none of the high-level party did, Sarenia and I 
                  knew what was going on. It was obvious and not altogether unexpected. 
                  Still things got very tense. I don't know what Rad was thinking 
                  exactly, I haven't had the opportunity to discuss his intent 
                  or expectations but I suspect he was looking to see if members 
                  would panic, run, gate, abandon comrades, freeze up, etc. After 
                  we all died I am sure he would have resurrected us all and perhaps 
                  then explained what we did wrong and how we could have done 
                  things better. However that was not the case.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the astonishment 
                  of all, we few, we proud, we brave little Dragonchows stood 
                  our ground. We zoned in and faced wave after wave of pops, and 
                  held them off in cool, courageous fashion. Few, if any of us, 
                  had ever been to this level (I know Sarenia, Cabbz and I had 
                  not), and had no idea what to expect and yet every one of us 
                  acted in perfect teamwork. The invisible shadows were a big 
                  surprise. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pawur, the ogre shadowknight, 
                  stood steadfast before us fending off the onslaught! Jaszire, 
                  the shaman, stood beside him clubbing with his staff. Sarenia, 
                  the enchantress, cast rapid fire mez and stuns to keep the hounds 
                  at bay. I, the wizard, timed my nukes to avoid agros and wiped 
                  out the berserk stage of the fight. Cabbz, the shaman, healed, 
                  buffed and defuffed, and occasionally joined the melee. Tanjure, 
                  our cleric, adeptly kept us all alive with heals. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When at last the 
                  others joined us, we showed hardly a scratch, as we sat around 
                  a massive pile of undead corpses. Rad was impressed I think, 
                  and perhaps a bit disappointed to.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I can't kill 
                  you guys,&quot; he told us, &quot;You're just too good!&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which left us all 
                  feeling pretty damn proud I think.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was getting late 
                  then and we all called it a night, a night without a single 
                  death. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if you ever decide 
                  to take TOFS 101 with professor Radalas, keep in mind you will 
                  learn a lot, assuming the lesson doesn't kill you. </font></p>

                  came and helped with this training exercise. Special thanks

                  time to do little more than play nurse maid to the rest of us.

                  way) they are not fashionable but they do allow me to run fast 
                  and it was such a grueling experience to get them.&nbsp; Still 
                  I wanted something more fitting for my feet something pretty 
                  and delicate -- I wanted crystal slippers and Crystal Caverns 
                  held just the big bad spider who would give them to me.&nbsp; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We had just arrived at the site when we got a tell from Cabbz 
                  -&quot; what were we up to?&quot;, &quot;Hunting spiders in 
                  CC&quot; was our reply.&nbsp; &quot;Need any help?&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  I respond &quot;Well only if it is the right kind of help - 
                  did you get a tell from Crisbie that he is coming?&quot;&nbsp; 
                  This is a long running gag with us Crisbie is by far one of 
                  the worst and most immature players we've ever had the displeasure 
                  of grouping with and he has been the butt of our jokes for a 
                  long time.&nbsp; &quot;Of course we want you along - come on 
                  down&quot; and shortly we were joined with our dear friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  We worked the hallway and although the shear number of spiders 
                  was overwhelming we did quite well and were able to clear it 
                  and keep it clear without too much trouble. &nbsp; Finally it 
                  was all clear and we peaked in the room.&nbsp; There is the 
                  queen surrounded by 4 minions.&nbsp; Ah certain death but I 
                  know she has my shoes so we start to plot strategies. &nbsp; 
                  A plan is hatched where I attempt to mez her and run most of 
                  the mobs to the dwarf town leaving Cabbz and Eldeberon to mop 
                  up the queen.&nbsp; It will most certainly mean death but we 
                  might take her with us.&nbsp; Finally we decide we need help 
                  and turn to our guild.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A quick glance shows 
                  no one in our zone or anywhere near it.&nbsp; Shoot! we are 
                  on our own.&nbsp; Then Eldeberon sends a tell to Freyana - All 
                  he says is Sarenia and Eldeberon need some help and without 
                  inquiring any further she responds &quot;OMW&quot;.&nbsp; Once 
                  again we are amazed and impressed by the generosity of the home 
                  we now call guild.&nbsp; She is all the way on the moon but 
                  drops what she is doing comes to Thurg for a bind then meets 
                  up with us at the spiders.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By this time we have 
                  to clear hall trash again and we do it easily.&nbsp; Then two 
                  escape and head for the queen and Freyana jumps in the water 
                  to finish them off.&nbsp; Unfortunately we got an unexpected 
                  argo and the next thing we knew the queen and countless spiders 
                  had descended upon us.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle ensued 
                  and although we fought desperately we did not have time to prepare 
                  and it looked grim.&nbsp; The Queen was dead and Freyana was 
                  able to loot the corpse but not before dying herself.&nbsp; 
                  In the end Eldeberon, Cabbz and Freyana lay dead and I only 
                  escaped by a gate at the last moment. &nbsp; Now I have to live 
                  with the guilt.&nbsp; I survived while my comrades fell. &nbsp; 
                  Not only that but I had dragged Freyana away for assistance 
                  and got her killed in the process.&nbsp; Needless to say I felt 
                  terrible.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the good side 
                  there was a very nice Cleric next door at the geos who was more 
                  than willing to help us out, and a short time later we had 3 
                  rezzes and were back at it again.&nbsp; About this time we noticed 
                  another DC in the zone. Kendrick had just popped in and we asked 
                  if he would like to join.&nbsp; He did and now we were poised 
                  to do some serious damage which we did.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We laid waste to 
                  the area. Spider bodies stacked up like cord wood. The queen 
                  and here other high level arachnids died left and right.&nbsp; 
                  Between Freyana's Mana song and my Clarity we were always at 
                  full mana and nothing stood in our way.&nbsp; Several queens 
                  were killed but no shoes still we were having fun with good 
                  comrades.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly while we 
                  were cleaning up some yard trash a monk runs by.&nbsp; When 
                  our battle is done I look into the room and there he is KS'ing 
                  our queen.&nbsp; How rude I thought and we started a conversation 
                  with him. &nbsp; Soon the whole zone chimes in that he has been 
                  KS'ing their areas as well. &nbsp; His name is Fosgate and a 
                  member of the Guardians of Light. The conversation wages on 
                  in ooc and it is apparent that this guy although high level 
                  has the mindset of a newbie wanting only self gratification 
                  and no thought or care for others or a sense of &quot;nice play&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such behavior should 
                  not go unchecked. &nbsp; Freyana finds an officer in the guild 
                  and reports him.&nbsp; I also speak to Morloc (the officer) 
                  that he should have a talk with Mr. Fosgate since he obviously 
                  needs to be taught better manners than he showed.&nbsp; Morloc 
                  asks me if I can get to a Wizzy spire sometime that night - 
                  &quot;Yes I can but why I ask?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&quot;I'll 
                  give you your glass slippers.&quot; &nbsp;he says.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now at first I'm 
                  impressed that this guild member will make good on bad done 
                  by a member of his guild.&nbsp; But then I think it is not his 
                  responsibility to clean up after another's mess.&nbsp; I thank 
                  him for his kind offer but inform him the loot is not the point.&nbsp; 
                  The point is how unenjoyable Fosgate made this evening for me, 
                  my teammates, and several other people in the zone.&nbsp; I 
                  politely decline his offer though thank him for the sentiment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Morloc informs me 
                  I'm not the first to complain about Fosgate - then why don't 
                  you boot him I say.&nbsp; He says he has no proof so what can 
                  he do.&nbsp; I offer to send him a copy of the log I turned 
                  on as the conversation became unpleasant.&nbsp; He gives me 
                  his e-mail.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With that excitement 
                  done we continue to kill Kendrick brings in his monk. Too young 
                  to receive experience but she had a good time whacking on spiders 
                  with Freyana.&nbsp; They were like two women killing machines 
                  putting the best of any male melee to shame.&nbsp; By 2:00 am 
                  we got our last queen pop. &nbsp; Still&nbsp; no slippers but 
                  overall a good time had by all (With the exception of Mr. Fosgate 
                  who I plan to be &quot;watching&quot; in the future and doing 
                  what I can to expand his reputation to those around him to see 
                  him for what he truly is an immature and selfish little man). 
                  We picked up 3 crystaline robes, a web shield, a spider fur 
                  choker, the queens pally weapon, and lots of runes, gems and 
                  pages to keep Eldeberon and myself busy. &nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So in conclusion 
                  I would like to thank Freyana and Kendrick/Kixim for their assistance 
                  although we did not get the shoes I got to spend time with some 
                  guild mates I've not fought with before and I enjoyed your company 
                  and your skills.&nbsp; Also thanks to Cabbz who is always a 
                  welcome pleasure to any group I have with him.&nbsp; If you 
                  see him about tell him how great&nbsp; DC is and that he has 
                  to join up.&nbsp; And if you happened to See Fosgate in a zone 
                  warn those around you to beware and be ready to /ignore - he 
                  can be quite annoying, although the other /ooc's to him are 
                  quite entertaining.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well that's it for 
                  me until next time. &nbsp; I bid you farewell.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Having met 
                  up in Burning Woods, near the Skyfire pass, we prepared to do 
                  battle. The first run at ole Ixi was with 65 people of 50th 
                  level or higher. The first pull was long and arduous as Leifanng 
                  pulled the giant elemental to the camp. Shouting 'Here I come' 
                  and 'Party Time' rang out several times as she made her way 
                  to us. Soon the beast was in sight. </font></p>

                  the second to last task before his Epic Reward. Several people 
                  left as we were more then a match for Ixiblat'Fer. The second

                  With one more to go, and 45 minutes on our hands, we lost several

                  the city of Thurgadin working on his Phenofocus quest when he 
                  bumped into Woodweaver. We started an impromptu game of tag, 
                  (Which Woody reminded me he would win since he had track), then 
                  I got a /tell from a stranger requesting to be ported to Emerald 
                  Jungle. I did so and then gated back. No sooner had I returned 
                  when I received another request. Having the spell already loaded, 
                  I agreed to port him too, and Sarenia went along for the ride. 
                  She really wanted to return to Lower Guk, but I didn't feel 
                  comfortable going down there with just the two of us. Instead 
                  we thought we would wander EJ, as we had never visited there

                  Soulsapper and engaged in fighting, however Sarenia hadn't time 
                  to memorize her fighting spells and things went badly. No deaths, 
                  but a bit of a scare. While recovering, I received another request 
                  for a punt and sent them on their merry way (big night for ports 
                  and punts). Then we explored EJ. A trakraptor jumped us from 
                  behind. Roots failed, miscommunications lead to mistakes and 
                  Sarenia and I gated out. I appeared in front of the Thug bank 
                  with just a nib of health. The fact that I was alive was all 
                  that saved me from depression and frustration. I started playing 
                  in less than a good mood and then two simple encounters that 
                  should have been easy kills, nearly resulted in our deaths. 
                  I wasn't happy. Then as I sat there collecting my thoughts, 
                  I noticed I was being bandaged. I stood up and looked and there 
                  was MrPain. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Who did this 
                  to you? And do we need to deliver some payback?&quot; He said 
                  with that devilish Iksar grin of his. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This made me feel 
                  a little better. Running into an unexpected friend usually does. 
                  I tried to thank MrPain only to receive an AFK message. Apparently 
                  someone was visiting MrPain and he had to travel down five flights 
                  to open the front door because his elevator was broken. I had 
                  to pause there and reflect on the size of house MrPain lives 
                  in, and how a thirtysomething Iksar warrior can afford such 
                  a palace-perhaps he is subletting from Teroth. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Healed up. I tried 
                  to forget EJ and resumed my Pheno quest. As part of it I needed 
                  to pick up a rock deep in the Wurm Cave. So casting invis I 
                  headed down. I picked up the item, which is very heavy and encumbered 
                  me, and began to waddle out. No sooner had I done this when 
                  my invis broke without warning and I was facing three wurms 
                  and who knows how many littering the exit corridor. I tried 
                  to gate, but that is difficult when three 16 foot wurms are 
                  playing handball with your body against the walls of their cave. 
                  I gave up on casting spells and fired off my Jboots and tried 
                  running the gauntlet out. He's at the twenty, the forty&#133;oh! 
                  He's down! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Needless to say I 
                  was whacked dead. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok, now I was pissed. 
                  I had, had it. Scalezz had agreed to go with Sarenia to Lower 
                  Guk, and I told her that was good because I wasn't. I could 
                  see it was just one of those times when everything was going 
                  to go wrong. So I decided I was logging for the night. At least 
                  I would log right after I retrieved my body. (I never can understand 
                  those who log leaving their unlooted bodies.) So here I am back 
                  in front of the Thurg bank, depressed and irritated, and who 
                  do I see? Woody. Wait, I think, Woody is a druid, and my Jboots 
                  are on my body. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Woody! Do you 
                  think you can step outside and give me a sow?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sure,&quot; 
                  he says. &quot;Humm. You don't look so good. You die?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We exited Thurg and 
                  I wait for Woody to cast sow. I am going to get my body and 
                  call it a night. Go sulk somewhere, watch some mindless television, 
                  or just kick the dog. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woody casts his spell 
                  and I am levitated. Oh that's nice, I thought, he is giving 
                  me levitation as well. What a guy. I continue to wait for the 
                  sow. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You die?&quot; 
                  someone by the name of Kinowin says.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yeah&quot;, 
                  I reply, thinking he must be looking at the naked Erudian and 
                  laughing.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Get a rez?&quot; 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No,&quot; my 
                  short answers reflected my mood. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm still waiting 
                  on the sow, but Woody is just sitting there. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Will you at 
                  least port us to Guk?&quot; Sarenia asks now that Scalezz has 
                  joined her. Both are sitting just outside beyond the waterfall. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Of course, 
                  just let me get my body first,&quot; I tell her. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is taking Woody 
                  so long? I mean I have heard Druids are rumored to be a bit 
                  flighty, but this just wasn't like Woody. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You want me 
                  to follow you?&quot; Kinowin says to me.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Follow me? I turn 
                  around and see a little halfling. What? was he offering to come 
                  help me fetch my body? I don't need help, dragging my body, 
                  I thought, all I need is the sow. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woody then suggests 
                  giving me something (I forgot what) saying, &quot;you could 
                  use that to pay the cleric for the rez.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pay the cleric? Was 
                  Woody arranging a rez for me? Was that what was taking him so 
                  long? I didn't-wait a minute. I spun around and looked at the 
                  halfling again. I /whotarget him and discovered he was a 55th 
                  level cleric. Doh!</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Are you offering 
                  me a rez?&quot; I asked.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yup,&quot; 
                  He says. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I slap myself. I'm 
                  an idiot. &quot;Thanks so much. Just wait here and I will drag 
                  my body to you.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I now turn to Woody, 
                  and think, for all the godsakes where is the freaking sow? &quot;Woody? 
                  Can I have that sow now?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; 
                  he asks.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I read this dumbfounded. 
                  Is Woody on drugs? Of course I want the sow, isn't that why 
                  I dragged your butt out here in the first place? Of course I 
                  didn't say that, after all he was doing me a favor, even if 
                  it was taking an incredibly odd length of time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then I read a message 
                  from Woody, something about &quot;&#133;levitation, &#133; something&#133;faster 
                  than sow. Look at it&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I glance down at 
                  the tornado icon, and the little candle ignites above Eldeberon's 
                  head. I had heard about Dead Man Floating being several buffs 
                  in one, I had no idea Druids had a similar spell. So Woody HAD 
                  sowed me, in fact he had gone several steps beyond just sowing 
                  me. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am an idiot. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So off I ran. I found 
                  my body and dragged it back. The cleric rezed me. Already I 
                  was feeling better, although several degrees more foolish. I 
                  reached into my coin purse. It was filled with plat from the 
                  earlier ports. Now I am not terribly familiar with resurrections. 
                  As a rule I don't seek them out. In fact, Eldeberon had his 
                  first performed on him not too long ago in TOFS by Medikar who 
                  didn't charge. So I really didn't know how much to pay. I grabbed 
                  up 50 plat and held it out to the cleric, who promptly refused. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Don't even.&quot; 
                  He says to me. &quot;Consider it repayment for your work on 
                  the website.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Website? I looked 
                  closer at the cleric. No tag. Humm.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ok who are 
                  you?&quot; I ask.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is Bashi, 
                  Ghrack.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly things were 
                  making a lot more sense than they were seconds ago. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aside from feeling 
                  like a fool, I had my body and hadn't lost much experience at 
                  all, nor was I even out any money. Thanks to DC, I was suddenly 
                  feeling much better. I thanked Kinowin, and returned to the 
                  bank in Thurg to drop off the terribly heavy rock I got in the 
                  Wurm Cave, and while there I spotted Woody again. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">/poke &quot;you're 
                  it&quot; I said and ran for the waterfall. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sarenia, Scalezz 
                  and I then went to Lower Guk. Now, most of you read the earlier 
                  account of our previous visit with a full team, so my expectations 
                  of repeated deaths with just the three of us casters was, I 
                  felt, not unfounded. To my amazement, we reached the Sage Room 
                  and cleared it. Then we went and cleared the Executioners Room 
                  and obtained a Hood. Then we cleared the halls, then we returned 
                  to the Sage room and cleared it and obtained the chord/belt. 
                  Then we cleared the hallways again. During all this Sarenia, 
                  Scalezz and I repeatedly were going LD. In fact, it seemed that 
                  all of us couldn't stay in the game at the same time. Regardless, 
                  we three silly little casters, with no real healer or melee, 
                  ruled in Lower Guk, where none of us had ever really fought 
                  before. (when ever we went too far away from the Sage room searching 
                  for pulls we would get lost). </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end, after 
                  little more than an hour and a half we ported out of Lower Guk 
                  with two nice drops, almost a gold in exp and no deaths. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What was almost a 
                  night of dog kicking misery turned out to be a great evening, 
                  and I attribute it all to the kindness and support of the guild. 
                  Thanks all. And a special thanks to Woody and Kinowin for their 
                  generosity and patience to a stupid, pissed-off wizzy. Oh yes, 
                  my dog thanks you to :)<br>

                <p align="center"><font size="6"><i><font size="4">Alas Poor Brodda, 
                  his Epic did not go well</font></i></font></p>
                <p align="center">by Eldeberon</p>
                <p>On behalf of our beloved miniature rogue, Dragonchow turned 
                  out in number in Kithcor forest with one intent--to kill the 
                  General. His name is General V`ghera, a Dark Elf who cons red 
                  to level 60s. He has 32000 hit points, hits for 200, procs for 
                  500, and has an incredibly powerul harm touch. Not the kinda 
                  guy you want to meet in a dark forest, but one our intrepid 
                  Rogue needs to slay for the last part of his epic. </p>
                <p>Now I don't profess to be the most informed participant involved, 
                  and at level 47, I was there mostly to report on the events, 
                  and play Jimmy Olsen. Nevertheless I did manage to get a few 
                  whacks in, and even scored a critical blast against the old 
                  general&#133;but I am getting ahead of myself. As I was saying 
                  I wasn't running the show, and can't be certain all that was 
                  happening, but I was there, and this is how things seemed to 
                  me.</p>
                <p align="left"><img src="images/epic1.jpg" width="515" height="389" align="left">Radalas 
                  called all available, 50s and above Chow to Kithcor. A large 
                  number arrived and it was the first time I had seen many of 
                  the faces that went with the names. For me it was like being 
                  at the Oscars. Oh look there's Leifanng! I loved her in &quot;Feign 
                  Death II&quot;, and over there is Uniqe, and oh my, the man-of-the-hour 
                  himself, Brodda! Oh dear, I didn't know he was bald! And he 
                  seemed so much taller in guild speak.&quot;</p>
                <p>We all assembled at the zone to WC, and there Rad listed out 
                  groups. </p>
                <p>&quot;Ok guys listen for your group. First person on the group 
                  is the group leader.&quot;</p>
                <p>I sat and waited impatiently for my name. So many great heroes 
                  together in one place I wondered who I'd be grouped with?</p>
                <p>&quot;Group 1 Purti Tyrrund, Leifangg, medikar, candywen, Iilae.&quot; 
                  Radalas barked. &quot;Group 2 Sunu, Macey Salfadorn Bolvi Radalas 
                  Akkera'. Group3 Salavar Klothe Mllopare Sebon Teroth Indra. 
                  Group 4 Brodda Crux Chaintalker Enilate Exavier Uniqe&quot;</p>
                <p>There was a pause. Everyone forming their assigned groups. 
                  I looked at Rad and blinked. Rad spotted me and nodded. &quot;Eld 
                  and Slej you guys will be alone, so group together but try not 
                  to gain agro. You are welcome to try your lure spells Eld&quot;</p>
                <p><img src="images/epic6.jpg" width="770" height="310"></p>
                <p>Slej? I looked around. Finally I spotted Slejhamyr, a 46 level 
                  halfling and invited him. I had never met Slej before. He wasn't 
                  even on the guild member's listing, but he seemed a pleasant 
                  fellow.</p>
                <p>&quot;What class are you?&quot; I asked.</p>
                <p> &quot;Druid&quot;, Slej replied. &quot;A gimp one at that. 
                  Brodda's been my best RL friend for about 16 years, so I wasn't 
                  allowed to miss this.&quot;</p>
                <p>I suppose we were both gimps, what ever that was exactly, and 
                  I immediately felt a kinship with my little brother in arms. 
                  Perhaps because of his casual humility, or maybe it was just 
                  because he was the only one in the zone who was a lower level 
                  than I. &quot;We'll be the last ones alive you know,&quot; I 
                  told him. &quot;And we'll be the ones to bring the general down.&quot; 
                  We both had a good laugh. </p>
                <p align="right"><img src="images/epic3.jpg" width="518" height="321" align="right"></p>
                <p>The army--and army it was--no greater troop of warriors has 
                  been seen since the sacking for the city of Troy, moved out. 
                  We marched to the north and west until we reached the tunnel 
                  of Rivervale, and there Radalas set our standard. The golden 
                  dragon on the blue field flapped defiantly in the misty haze 
                  of the stained evil forest. In the distance the sound of creatures 
                  moved. From my youth I had been so trained to fear these trees 
                  that even a bixie drone's buzz made me shiver. I crept up the 
                  hillside near the zone exit and huddled tight. Radalas our fearless 
                  leader stood in front like Achilles of old, arranging the troops. 
                  Brodda, with his shinny little head, strode up and down thanking 
                  those he saw for attending. Each one in turn offering him comments 
                  of good luck. </p>
                <p>&quot;Who is main slower and main chanter?&quot; Medikar inquired.<br>
                  &quot;Main chanter is Candywen main slower is Akkera,&quot; 
                  Radalas explained<br>
                  &quot;Okies will die for Brodda&quot;, Akkera said.<br>
                  &quot;No, no.. we'll have none of that Akky,&quot; Brodda replied.</p>
                <p>Now if I get this correctly, there is a cabin in the Kithcor 
                  forest that houses a band of very nasty Dark Elves. The idea 
                  is to clear the cabin, but leave one dark elf behind for the 
                  rogue to trade his &quot;box&quot; to. After this the General 
                  spawns in the house, and needs to be trained to the waiting 
                  army. The &quot;Brigader&quot; is the best one to leave in the 
                  cabin since a rogue can sneak up behind the Brig, trade, and 
                  be in a position where the general won't immediately see him, 
                  thus allowing him to re-hide. With this in mind the monks were 
                  sent to pull individual mobs from the cabin. Tyrrund and Leifanng 
                  did the dirty work here. </p>
                <p>The first mob was War Priestess T`zan. The army clustered around 
                  her and began to battle. I assumed she would drop in seconds, 
                  yet five minutes seemed to go by and still she stood. I watched 
                  her health fall and rise, fall again only to rise again. I tried 
                  casting my lure spell, only to have it resisted over and over. 
                  Clearly it seemed I would be of no use here. Another dark elf 
                  also showed up by the name of Advisor C`zatl, and things were 
                  heating up. Then as the priestess was low in health I cast again 
                  and to my surprise she took damage! Ah-hah! Perhaps there was 
                  a link. Unfortunately by that time I was out of mana. The DC 
                  killed the Priestess, but Klothe and Sebon were dead. </p>
                <p><img src="images/epic4.jpg" width="518" height="281" align="left"></p>
                <p>&quot;Well so far I have done nothing except debuff one,&quot; 
                  Slej told me miserably. I was pleased to report I had managed 
                  to actually do damage. Weak and feeble certainly, but some. 
                  With Slej, I was starting to feel more like one of a pair of 
                  LOTR hobbits in the battle of Gondor than an Erudite wizard. 
                </p>
                <p>Next came Tasi V`ghera. This time I held back and waited until 
                  I saw the health bar drop below half, then I began to nuke. 
                  The first blast hit for full damage!</p>
                <p>&quot;Akky down!&quot; Leifanng cried. And somewhere in the 
                  havoc of the field below me Akkera fell dead at Tasi V' ghera's 
                  feet. </p>
                <p>I began casting Enticement of Flame again Tasi V`ghera was 
                  hit by non-melee for 360 points of damage. Tasi V`ghera succumbed 
                  to the enticement of flame. Then the dark elf fell and I saw 
                  the amazing message, <i>&quot;You have slain Tasi V`ghera!&quot; 
                  </i>I was stunned, but in a good way.</p>
                <p>&quot;I actually got a couple of blasts on that one!&quot; 
                  Slej told me. </p>
                <p>Slej left my group then and I tired to re-invite him thinking 
                  he had left accidentally. </p>
                <p>&quot;I'm the healer in one of the other groups now&quot; Slejhamyr 
                  told me, then added fearfully,&quot;Somebody gonna die&quot; 
                </p>
                <p>I was alone in my group of one. Sylen had been apart of the 
                  group for a brief while, but left. </p>
                <p>A few more dark elves and a few more deaths-Iilae and Indra 
                  fell. Then in came the Adjutant D`kan</p>
                <p>I began casting Enticement of Flame.<br>
                  <i>Adjutant D`kan was hit by non-melee for 360 points of damage</i>.<br>
                  <i>Adjutant D`kan succumbed to the enticement of flame</i>, 
                  and once more the message, &quot;<i>You have slain Adjutant 
                  D`kan!</i>&quot; I cheered my own success, then I looked upon 
                  the field and saw the cost.</p>
                <p>&quot;Uniqe LD&quot;' Brodda told us<br>
                  &quot;Dang...' Radalas cursed<br>
                  &quot;Slej and Teroth down,&quot; reported Salavar.</p>
                <p>Slej! Not Slej! I looked down and saw the little guy's body. 
                  Poor fellow. I consoled myself with the knowledge that at least 
                  it was quick. The good news was Brig was alone. It was finally 
                  time for the main feature, time to face the General, but there 
                  was a catch. In order to trade his box, Brodda needed to have 
                  invisibility cast on him after he opened the trade window, but 
                  before he traded. Iilae was sent in to invis Brodda, but something 
                  went wrong.</p>
                <p>&quot;Are you casting invis on me Iilae?&quot; Brodda asked 
                  Iilae.<br>
                  &quot;Yes, trying to,&quot; Iilae replied.<br>
                  &quot;It says I am protected, yet am not invis.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;lilae he needs to be in our group,&quot; Tyrrund told 
                  them.<br>
                  Brodda began laughing. &quot;It's the little things that get 
                  ya.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Lol I cant invis poor broddy,&quot; Iilae said.</p>
                <p>Being part of Brodda's group, Exavier was sent in, but was 
                  killed when an undead spotted him. <br>
                  It was then that Brodda was told to forget the invis, make the 
                  trade and take the death. He tried, and died, but the general 
                  never popped. Brodda was dragged out and rezed, and went in 
                  again. The lucky thing was he still had the box.</p>
                <p>Everyone gathered again and went in for a second try. Exavier 
                  went forward to invis once more, but the Brig appeared and killed 
                  him.</p>
                <p>Brodda slipped up behind the Brigader, and deftly, as the master 
                  thief he is, he began the trade. &quot;In trade window now.. 
                  he's scowls. I need invis now!'<br>
                  From outside the cabin Tyrrund shouted, 'turn in'<br>
                  Leifanng echoed the sentiment, 'turn in'<br>
                  Tyrrund then reconsidered, 'no'<br>
                  Brodda, with sweat dappling his shinny head whispered, 'cannot 
                  trade until it's not KoS.. must be invis, or all for naught'<br>
                  Radalas said, 'agreed'<br>
                  Tyrrund sighed and nodded, 'he will lose his piece'<br>
                  &quot;Bleh&quot; Leifanng exclaimed, &quot;brodda down!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;God damn it!&quot; Radalas cursed swinging his sword at 
                  the blades of grass before him. Everyone in the vicinity took 
                  a step back from him. <br>
                  Brodda announced, &quot;still have piece.&quot;<br>
                  Gryphin shouted, 'whats goin on?'<br>
                  &quot;Leif drag ex and brodda,&quot; Radalas ordered.<br>
                  Leifanng said, &quot;someone get an inviser with brodda&quot;<br>
                  Radalas said, &quot;or leif drag ex and ty drag brodda&quot;<br>
                  Leifanng replied, 'I'll get ex'</p>
                <p>I felt stupid just sitting there. They needed a caster who 
                  could cast invis. I might not be able do much damage to the 
                  mobs, but I could cast an invisibility spell. Besides, if I 
                  died in the process, the group wasn't loosing anything. </p>
                <p>I asked Radalas, &quot;Do you want me to group with brodda 
                  and invis him and that way if I die who cares?&quot;</p>
                <p>Radalas told me, 'no.. its not that... just a few bad turn 
                  of events'</p>
                <p>Brodda returned to position once more.</p>
                <p>Is there time to drag ex back to camp?' Leifanng asked.<br>
                  Tyrrund said, 'ok leif and I rdy'<br>
                  &quot;No leif keep ex there for now,&quot; Radalas said. &quot;Lets 
                  do this soon... rez timer on corpse about to run out'<br>
                  Brodda called out, &quot;turning in!&quot;<br>
                  Radalas said, &quot;quickly but do it carefuly&quot;</p>
                <p>There was a pause, and everyone held their breath. </p>
                <p><br>
                  &quot;General V`ghera!&quot; Brodda shouted.<br>
                  &quot;Cool!&quot; Radalas cheered.<br>
                  &quot;Pull!&quot; Brodda yelled.<br>
                  Leifanng was heard to say, &quot;Great.&quot; Then&#133;</p>
                <p>General V`ghera shouts<b> 'I shall end this treachery now! 
                  First you, you insignificant, worthless } , then that ill-spawned 
                  Stanos, and finally Joren. '</b></p>
                <p>The General was coming. </p>
                <p><br>
                  We all held fast to our positions before Rivervale, as the General 
                  was lead to Radalas' waiting arms. Radalas took a firm footing 
                  in the deep piney thatch, and raised his sword. The General 
                  came charging into the glade, furious. Radalas stepped forward 
                  and swung. The sound of metal on steel rang harshly, and the 
                  battle began. </p>
                <p><img src="images/epic2.jpg" width="755" height="337"></p>
                <p>The cleric maintained heals on Radalas. They fought toe to 
                  toe, swing for swing, with Rad's health rising and falling. 
                  Behind him the clerics prayed, but it wasn't long before the 
                  general left Rad and turned on Sunu. Sunu dropped like a stone. 
                  It returned to Rad and before long Rad fell. </p>
                <p><img src="images/epic5.jpg" width="763" height="346"></p>
                <p>&quot;Damn! That guys is no joke!&quot; Enilate cursed. &quot;'I 
                  went down before I could hit mend.&quot;</p>
                <p>The general's health was dropping and I began to cast. My spells 
                  began to hit. His health was dropping, but so were many of the 
                  DC. Bodies were starting to pile up. Blood was running everywhere. 
                  I wiped the sweat from my brow, tried to block out the screams 
                  from down below and cast again. </p>
                <p>&quot;OOM&quot; Macy cried in despair <br>
                  Medikar said, &quot;remedy heal on Leifanng&quot;<br>
                  From the afterlife Radalas continued giving directions, 'keep 
                  Leif alive!'<br>
                  Medikar said, &quot;Remedy heal on Leifanng&quot;<br>
                  General V`ghera shouts 'Another cur dies! With fodder like this, 
                  we shall have no problem conquering all these pale fools. '<br>
                  General V`ghera shouts 'Another cur dies! With fodder like this, 
                  we shall have no problem conquering all these pale fools. '<br>
                  I began casting Enticement of Flame.<br>
                  General V`ghera shouts 'Another cur dies! With fodder like this, 
                  we shall have no problem conquering all these pale fools. '</p>

                  My spell fired. <i>General V`ghera was hit by non-melee for 
                  439 points of damage. I delivered a critical blast! (439)</i></p>
                <p>The General was down to just a tad bit or red left, but few 
                  Chow were still standing. Only Leifanng and a couple others 
                  still remaind in the fight.. The rest lay dead like fallen leaves 
                  beneath the evil trees.</p>
                <p>General V`ghera shouts 'Another cur dies! With fodder like

                <p>Another DC dead</p>

                  '</p>
                <p>Leifanng feigned death.</p>
                <p>Suddenly the field was clear. Except for the general. The General 
                  slowly turned. He was covered in the blood of the Chow. He looked 
                  up the hill to where I stood, and grinned evilly. My blood went 
                  cold as I saw my death in his eyes. Running was useless. I was 
                  out of mana, and had nothing left. I raised my feeble staff. 
                </p>
                <p>&quot;DRAGONCHOW!&quot; I cried and charged. </p>
                <p>General V`ghera pierces YOU for 74 points of damage.<br>
                  General V`ghera slashes YOU for 285 points of damage.<br>

                  Returning to home point, please wait...<br>
                  LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
                <p>I woke up with Sunu standing over me. &quot;Did we win?&quot;</p>
                <p>The news was bad. The general was never killed. Brodda lost 
                  his box, and will have to start his epic over. Most everyone 
                  at the site was killed. It was late, and after the resurrections 
                  and after punting those who needed it, DC called it a night. 
                  It was my first &quot;real&quot; raid, and it had been bloody, 
                  but I suppose that is why they call it Bloody Kithcor. While 
                  I feel bad for Brodda, I am pleased to have served what little 
                  purpose I could, and it was an honor to die with such distinguished 
                  company. Long live Dragonchow!</p>

                  until now I had grown accustom to raids being rather mundane 
                  camps of repetitive slaughter and looting. Air however, was 
                  different. Instead of being a distant aid to the course of events, 
                  everyone was able--or perhaps forced is a better term--to be 
                  equally invested in the event. This was no slaughter camp, but 
                  rather an adventure shared by all. This quest, this journey, 
                  lead by an insane, sadistic, floating, halfling guide took us 
                  through the looking glass into Verant's twisted version of a 
                  high altitude Disneyland. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had never 
                  been on a Plane of Air raid. I had never been to a plane of 
                  any kind. As a matter of fact, I never expected I would ever 
                  managed to reach to the lofty heights of planular conquest, 
                  but to my pleasant surprise there I was. Salladar ported us 
                  up, &quot;us&quot; being a handful of Dragonchow, the first 
                  batch of the incoming invasion force. We few stood around, slack-jawed 
                  gapping at the odd scenery. The Plane of Air seems to be a surreal, 
                  dream-like vision of eight islands, not floating in the sky, 
                  but hanging from one another by huge iron chains. You port into 
                  the lowest of the islands from which you need to proceed up 
                  this dangling chandelier. The question of course is how? The 
                  islands have no stairs and the chains don't look too promising. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the 
                  bulk of the raid force was assembled, we were turned loose on 
                  the maniacal fairyland of pixies who's ever constant tinkling 
                  sound eventually drives waiting visitors into a bloodlust that 
                  demands that each and every Tinkerbell be slaughtered without 
                  mercy. Then their princess is killed, and then He shows up.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He, is none 
                  other than Sirran the Lunatic. An incredibly powerful halfling 
                  that quad hits for 2000+, and who will attack anyone who speaks 
                  a single word. Each member of the raid needed to hand him the 
                  two items each was required to loot off the slaughtered pixies, 
                  and in return receive a key to the next island. </font></p>

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get to 
                  the next island you jumped in and clicked on a dish shaped transport 
                  pad, not unlike the Alice in Wonderland Teacups and Saucers 
                  ride in Disneyland-except it is shaped more like a dogs water 
                  dish. Instantly you appear on the next island up. In our case 
                  this was an island filled with wizard familiars gone bad. The 
                  little red-winged imps came at us from all directions. Valiantly 
                  we fought. Some members tragically fell off the island! At last 
                  we were down to just a handful of defenders and two imps. Salavar, 
                  the last of the tanks, fell in battle. That was when I heard 
                  the distant voice of Radalas ordering the remaining survivors 
                  to jump. That's right jump off the island. Trusting to providence, 
                  and having little choice, I jumped. What a rush. I plummeted 
                  straight down and splash landed in the East Freeport bay. The 
                  force of the fall drove me several feet under water. That was 
                  worth the price of admission right there, and we all got back 
                  in line to try it again. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rad soon 
                  had the group reorganized, and to our relief the mobs on the 
                  islands have a very slow spawn time. We finished off the last 
                  of the imps, each of us looting more items for the next key. 
                  Then we killed the boss mob and who do you think appears? That's 
                  right, the loony little halfling cracking jokes and begging 
                  for anyone to make a comment. He seemed surprised at our fast 
                  progress, and that we had gotten so far, and gleefully mentioned 
                  that he antisipated more fun to come. Which was my clue that 
                  he expected we would all die on the next island. Again, now 
                  that the island was devoid of any living mob, we all turned 
                  in items and got keys. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up went 
                  again. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Island three, 
                  was safer. Still a barren world but sporting a snazzy mosque-like 
                  temple. Harpies were the kill of the day, and we again obtained 
                  more key items. All the while other drops were occurring. Fine 
                  items, spells and quest pieces.</font></p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/air4.jpg" width="662" height="497"></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon the 
                  island was nearly clear of mobs, and we were down to the mob 
                  boss and his friends. Once again, as in Chardok (and no doubt 
                  many other places), Liefanng was asked to volunteer for hazardous 
                  duty and there wasn't a dry eye in the group as we watched her 
                  walk valiantly past the ranks responding to the call. She and 
                  Radalas had fun playing with the harpies and floating eyes for 
                  a bit, before eventually singling out a decent pull. In the 
                  meantime Modi, Steddy and I discovered that summoned eyes worked 
                  differently in the plane of air, and could fly and gain altitude. 
                  <img src="images/air5.jpg" width="410" height="310" align="left"></font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sirran returned 
                  after the mob boss was killed, and once more, having ridthe 
                  island of all living creatures, we <i>very quietly</i> obtained 
                  our keys. </font></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Higher and 
                  higher we climbed, and it was still early when we reached the 
                  fourth island. Only it was empty. No doubt the island had yet 
                  to respawn from some previous group, and without mobs, no keys 
                  could be obtained. The raid stopped there, not due to defeat, 
                  but apparently because the inhabitants of the islands had heard 
                  word of a bunch of unstoppable killers on the approach and they 
                  all left. Well that at least is the story I am sticking to. 
                  Having nothing else to do Rad gave the ok to cannonball off 
                  the island. Unlike Disneyland however, there was no 45 minute 
                  wait in roped lines for this demon drop thrill ride. You just 
                  walked to the edge and off you went screaming all the way. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Splash!</font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fun as it 
                  was, I still feel unfulfilled however, like reading a book only 
                  half way. I really wanted to know where the heck Sirran was 
                  leading us, why, and what lay at the end of the sojourn. Perhaps 
                  another time.</font></p>

                  last Saturday night Sarenia and Eldeberon were invited to visit 
                  Howling Stones by Radalas, along with us came the Verds and 
                  Cabbz our old friend from Spirit Guardians. With Radalas as 
                  our guide we casually strolled our way through the dungeon gaining 
                  exp like we were 35 again, and obtaining a rare item reputed 
                  to be worth 15k. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then Rad, 
                  exhausted from a long day, left us. Ssmacki was expected to 
                  replace Rad, but the poor monk made a wrong turn and died enroute. 
                  Then, after Verd Rezzed him, having RL issues to deal with Ssmacki 
                  reluctantly sent his regrets and we were on our own. We knew 
                  it wasn't the brightest thing to attempt to stay and fight when 
                  we were down one melee, but we were having such a good time, 
                  and we all wanted to see how we would fare on our own. All of 
                  us I believe were first time visitors to HS, (I think one of 
                  the Verds had been there but it was the first time for the other 
                  :P), but Rad had been a good guide and explained much. So we 
                  cinched up our armor and robes and fought our way back inside. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howling

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The five 
                  of us, inched our way in until we passed through the painting 
                  and dropped in on four mobs. We beat them off, and laughed at 
                  our survival. This was no longer a casual stroll, no longer 
                  a well ordered Rad lead slaughter-fest&#133;this time we had 
                  to think, and think fast.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tensions 
                  rose as we pushed deeper, trying to remember the way. There 
                  was little room for error and we needed all our strength to 
                  survive so Sarenia and Cabbz summoned their pets, and in order 
                  to engage the lazy enchanter pet, Sarenia took on the odd roll 
                  of group puller. Strange technique I know, but one which Cabbz, 
                  Sarenia and I were well aquatinted with from our days as a trio. 
                  Verd and Verd were skeptical at first until he saw Sar's pet 
                  hitting in rapid succession for 50s. Then in an attempt to clear 
                  a hall, we pulled three. This was a handful, but not a death 
                  sentence&#133;then the four behind us repopped. Facing seven 
                  at once was down right terrifying, but that's why we had an 
                  enchanter. The team went into extreme skill mode and everyone 
                  was pulling 110 percent just to stay alive. The tide of battle 
                  was turning in our favor, with Sarenia's successful mezzing&#133;then 
                  Sar went LD. Her uncontrolled body wandered between two mobs 
                  and was killed. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That's

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle 
                  waged on however. Cabbz went into root/park mode keeping myself 
                  and the Verds alive. Verd wailed on the vicious mobs, and Verd 
                  frantically medded and healed. Three, left, two left, I only 
                  had enough mana for an evac. One left. We threw everything we 
                  had on the last one, killed it, and collapsed laughing at our 
                  success. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This

                  would be proud,&quot; Sarenia said after the rez.</font></p>

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We pushed 
                  on and after several rough battles returned to the site where 
                  Rad had left us. We cleared the halls and were about to call 
                  it a night having gained over a gold in exp and unknown as yet 
                  treasure, when Verd found he couldn't open a locked door. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we had 
                  seen Rad open the door many times, but we could not. That's 
                  when Cabbz shrewdly devised a means of opening the door without 
                  a key. It worked well and the mobs came rushing out there were 
                  several, but nothing we couldn't handle, but fate had other 
                  plans and Sarenia abruptly went LD again. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This time 
                  two mobs attacked the cleric and quickly killed him. Sarenia 
                  was on her way back in, and I hoped to return her to the group 
                  before casting evac. Verd was dropping fast, and so was Cabbz. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Invite

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sar popped 
                  in, but Verd, the leader was too engaged to notice.</font></p>

                  Sar!&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't 
                  know if Verd saw the message, or if he did invite and some bug 
                  screwed it up, but as I began Evacing, with Sar still not joined, 
                  Verd died. I had hoped to at least save Cabbz who was still 
                  barely alive. The mobs closed on me, but the spell held, only 
                  when it was over I alone stood at the Zone In . Cabbz, the Verds 
                  and Sarenia were dead. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowing 
                  I couldn't survive at the zone in alone for long, and knowing

                <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It looked

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The Howling 
                  Stones Extravaganza Month enters its second week as we find 
                  our intrepid adventurers finally entering the West Wing. You 
                  may recall in our last episode, seeing that they had obtained 
                  their keys Radalas, took pity on Eldeberon and Sarenia and offered 
                  to show them Howling. He recruited a cleric and warrior in the 
                  from of two dwarves, Verd and Verd, and together with Cabbz 
                  they explored much of the North Wing. Then Rad left, and those 
                  remaining attempted to retrace their steps and were nearly all 
                  wiped out, requiring the guild to mount a major rescue effort. 
                  Since that time the two Erudian casters and the two, only mostly 
                  insane Dwarves, have befriended each other and taken it upon 
                  themselves to conquer the ancient crypt of Chrasiss.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">During the 
                  past week they persuaded the likes of Seung, Scalezz, Klothe 
                  Nanadawen, Swifthand, Brodda, Teroth, and Indra to join their 
                  obsessed campaign. Scalezz was nearly left behind when she fell 
                  asleep inside the dungeon, but outside the group. Shouting at 
                  her simply didn't help. On a different occasion, Indra, who 
                  only came to help Sarenia and Eldeberon who were foolishly trying 
                  to hold the zone-in by themselves, fell through the tapestry 
                  while pulling, trapping himself inside and his only companions, 
                  the Erudians, outside. Whereupon, the two gung-ho casters rushed 
                  to his aid and were promptly killed, while Indra escaped back 
                  to the zone-in through the underground tunnels with nary a scratch. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Then came 
                  Sunday night. It was the end of the Siren's Grotto raid, when 
                  Sarenia and I brought up the subject of getting a team together 
                  to go to Howling Stones. </font></p>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;HS! 
                  HS! HS! HS!&quot; Verdarillian chanted, and Nanadawen and Seung 
                  joined the forming group. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;Do we also need a tank,&quot; Verdarillian asked.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;Yes,&quot; 
                  Sarenia replied, &quot;but you can come anyway Verd.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;Ah, ya cut me Sar, ya cut me deep!&quot; replied the dwarven 
                  warrior. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We had our 
                  six, so off to HS we went. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The windswept 
                  grassy plain above the canyon was empty of the usual bothersome 
                  mobs. This brought back bad memories. Earlier that day the Verds 
                  were on their way to the canyon and caught the attention of 
                  a rhino. I rooted the beast, snared it, then since it broke 
                  the root quickly I simply jumped off the cliff, and began to 
                  levitate down pleased with my genius at avoiding the animal. 
                  I could just imagine the rhino's disappointment as it stood 
                  helpless upon the precipice watching me casually descend into 
                  the canyon-WHAP! Something hit me. I looked around and saw nothing. 
                  It hit me again. I pointed my nose down and flew to the bottom 
                  of the canyon, and there to my disbelief was the rhino. Whap! 
                  Whap! Whap! I was killed. Hearing about my death Verdarillian 
                  the cleric, coming to my rescue, forgot to get levitated and 
                  fell to his own death. (He was not the first cleric to do so 
                  that day as it turned out.)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;What is it with you clerics?&quot; I said. &quot;Clerics 
                  can't fly,&quot; then I thought for a second, &quot;&#133;but 
                  rhinos can!&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  We all entered Howling Stones and discovered, to our shock, 
                  other people there. A high level group from the Black Sun guild 
                  was in North Wing ahead of us, but after speaking to them, I 
                  obtained their permission to play through. Despite their higher 
                  levels, they were unsure about zone. In return for first access 
                  to the West Wing Key Room (WWKR), we lent support and information 
                  to Black Sun, and even teamed up for a &quot;mini raid&quot; 
                  on the WWKR. Once it was cleared out we showed Black Sun where 
                  to obtain their own key to the WWKR. Then we slipped inside 
                  the WWKR, leaving Black Sun to farm everything else. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;Ya think it's such a good idea to camp inside the room?&quot; 
                  Sarenia asked hesitantly. <br>
                  &quot;Sure why not?&quot; Verd replied. <br>
                  The spawns, that we had killed together with Black Sun twenty 
                  minutes before, repoped in fast succession. Alone this time 
                  and trapped inside the locked room the ensuing battle was fierce. 
                  <br>
                  &quot;Evac?&quot; Nanadawen looked at me pensively as the mobs 
                  began to mount. <br>
                  &quot;Hold on,&quot; I replied counting. Three Prye Golems, 
                  two bile, three, no, four skeletons. &quot;Mana?&quot;<br>
                  &quot;I'm still full!&quot; Sarenia replied. <br>
                  &quot;Cleric?&quot; I called.<br>
                  &quot;60&quot;, Verdarillian said. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  With Verd covered in splattering golem goo, Seung slowing, and 
                  Sar mezzing, Nanadawen and I began to blast away. And soon the 
                  room began to empty. Hoots of stunned success went up among 
                  the group. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;We are one kick butt group man!&quot; Nanadawen shouted, 
                  as the smoke began to clear and revealed a stack of mob bodies. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;I love you guys!&quot; Verd said, still dripping in goo 
                  and bone splinters. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  I looked at the pile then back at my mana and was bewildered 
                  that it was still 50 percent! Then I realized our entire party 
                  had received Candywen's KEIs buff just prior to leaving the 
                  SG raid. We were overflowing with mana. If we hadn't had KEIs 
                  the battle might not have been won. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We cleared 
                  the room six times before the Crypt Keeper spawned and we got 
                  the key to the West Wing. Then we informed Black Sun the room 
                  was there's and that the spawns were nicely broken up and the 
                  first would spawn in exactly five minutes. We then returned 
                  to the Zone-In where to our surprise we found HS was filled 
                  with people. There was an unheard of twenty people in the zone! 
                  Luckily none were in the West Wing. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We looked 
                  at the door to the West Wing. None of us had been there. None 
                  of us had even heard rumor of what was beyond the door. None 
                  of us had a map. It was now nearly midnight EST on a Sunday 
                  and most of the DC masters who had HS keys had logged for the 
                  night. Rad, Sunu, Swifty, Teroth, Indra, they were all gone. 
                  There would be no help for the rest of the night. We were on 
                  our own. </font></p>
                <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&quot;Bah!&quot; 
                  Verd retorted to Sarenia's hesitation to enter. &quot;You must 
                  have confidence girl!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Verd's right!&quot; I said, and saw the little dwarf puff 
                  up in his armor. &quot;Nanadawen let's show our support for 
                  Verd's skill by not even memming or evac spells. We won't be 
                  needing them!&quot;<br>
                  Verd blinked. &quot;Ah, well, thanks guys, but...&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Just kidding Verd.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  We entered carefully. Initially the West Wing was much like 
                  the North Wing. We cleared the room, but before proceeding further 
                  I summoned my conjured wizard's eye and sent it ahead to scout. 
                  I counted the mobs, searched the rooms and traveled ahead down 
                  the halls, zig-zaging as I searched for traps. I approached 
                  a small rug and a moment later my eye plummeted. It fell into 
                  a terribly deep pit filled with several nasty mobs and sharp 
                  rocks.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> <br>
                  &quot;Safety tip Verd, avoid the rugs.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  We pushed on through the tapestry and committed ourselves. Not 
                  since I was in single digits with my first character--when I 
                  still thought you had to pay for passage on the ship out of 
                  Freeport, and that the bandits in Gfay were a group of high 
                  level players afk at their &quot;camp&quot; which was complete 
                  with tents--was I so totally immersed in the game. Any mistake, 
                  any accident could cause a disaster of incredible proportions 
                  and everything ahead was a mystery. You could hear the breathing 
                  of the golems ahead, smell the dust and decay of a century of 
                  Iksar abandonment. The torches pots flickered, the shadows danced 
                  fearfully, and the world of Norrath was again a living breathing&#133;dangerous 
                  place. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Step, by 
                  step we moved in. Verd, with his bravado, taking on all obstacles 
                  in his path; pausing now and again for me to send in my eye. 
                  We carefully cleared our way. Then in a moment of sheer cruelty 
                  on Verdarillian's part, he let Verd die. I can only speculate 
                  at their childhood. How they must have prematurely grayed their 
                  mother's beard. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Verd dropped 
                  dead. With no melee and at least three mobs to deal with I cast 
                  evac. We popped up at the zone-in, minus Verd of course. Now 
                  what? Fighting back in without Verd would be problematic at 
                  best. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;Can anyone summon corpse?&quot; Sarenia called out, &quot;Will 
                  pay.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Consent me.&quot; The voice was strange and nearby. A 
                  dark elf dressed all in white stood in the shadows of the zone-in. 
                  No sooner had Verd consented when the stranger vanished into 
                  the West Wing door. In less than a heartbeat it seemed, she 
                  returned with Verd's body in tow, and dropping it ran off. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
                  &quot;Wait!&quot; Sarenia cried. &quot;We want to repay you!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;No need,&quot; she replied.<br>
                  &quot;But&#133;how on earth did you do that? Why didn't the 
                  mobs argo you? How did you drop down beyond the tapestry and 
                  then get back out? I don't understand.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;I am uber,&quot; was all she said. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">We took 
                  this as a sign we should stop for the night. I gathered all
