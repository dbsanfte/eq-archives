          <br>
          <i>Author&#146;s Note: The following is a true story that occurred two 
          weeks ago just before leaving town for 9 days. The text in italics are 
          my RL thoughts and surroundings.</i></font></p>
        <p><br>
          <font size="4">When World&#146;s Collide</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>It is 4:45 on Wednesday afternoon and I have not 
          logged in to play in several days. Furthermore, I do not see an opportunity 
          in the near future. I need my fix, but one problem: I am at work. Solution: 
          Close the door . And so here I go, next stop &#150; Dreadlands.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The sun was high over the barren tundra better known 
          to the citizens of Norrath as the Dreadlands. A weary and forsaken place, 
          the very ground quietly groaned under the burden of the heat and the 
          oppressive inhabitants that roamed about with no agenda save destruction 
          and death. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Being careful not to expose himself, Shaaker moved silently 
          through the shadows of Karnor&#146;s Castle, an awesome relic of wars 
          long since fought. Through the mourning of the wind, he strained to 
          hear the faint yet clear call of someone in need of a healer. (So-and-so 
          says out of character: &#148;Group looking for healer&#148;) As he took 
          off his boots to empty them of the sand, he called back, &#147; Well 
          met, I am a Shaman of the 37 season, learned in the healing ways. Tell 
          me where you are hiding and I will come to you.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">&#147;Avail yourself of haste, young Shaaker, we are 
          near the Northeastern ruins and our party is weary and bleeding badly&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">With lupine movements, Shaaker dashed over fallen columns 
          and walls, his eyes affixed on a lonely outpost of ruins. As he approached, 
          the wind gave way to the sound of blade against bone, of armor being 
          battered by brute power and the desperate involuntary cries of pain. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">&#147;No time for pleasantries, Barbarian. Heal us!&#148; 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Shaaker paused for the brief second, in awe of the melee 
          before him. Warrior, monk, paladin and wizard, all heavy with sweat, 
          blood caked on their faces, hands and clothing. The warrior held a large, 
          furious, two-handed battle-axe, unlike anything he had ever seen; its 
          arch across the sky as it raced to its target was enormous, like a silvery 
          rainbow of steel and death. Sidestepping the Rager, Yeti and Widow, 
          Shaaker silently cursed as he cast his heals upon the warrior, &#147;Damnation, 
          blood escapes from his ears, death is at hand.&#148; Focus, concentration, 
          quickness; all necessary elements for a shaman to heal and heal rapidly. 
          Images of past mistakes and failures haunted Shaaker (sorry Rad, Sall, 
          Fea, Jaka, Eald. Damn, who HASN&#146;T died on my watch?) even at that 
          moment when the spell effects impacted the warrior and it became clear 
          that yes, all would live.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Drained of his energy, the Shaman sat with his back 
          to the wall as the three fighters dispatched the last of the abominations. 
          Before the corpse of the Tundra Yeti slapped against the dust, all were 
          sitting, thankful for the victory and the respite from the fighting. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After salutations and introductions were properly done, 
          yet before the shaman was fully restored (65m), the warrior leapt to 
          his feet, kicked up a small cloud of dust and disappeared into the horizon. 
          The remaining group actually felt the ground beneath them shaking before 
          they caught sight of the brute cresting the horizon in full pursuit 
          of the warrior. The stench of its fur made the paladin retch as the 
          beast approached their camp. Yet without hesitation the members fell 
          upon it, quickly dispatching it. And with renewed energy, the warrior 
          was once again off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">For seemingly hours, Shaaker constantly healed and enhanced 
          the warriors and wizard with a combination of potions, bandages, incantations 
          and the magical arts. ( Awesome experience) Indeed, his efforts became 
          so intense at times that his spirit-self was eating away at his body-self, 
          sapping his life force slowly away. (Constant cannibalization) </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Nonetheless, it was a glorious time of mayhem and vengeance 
          as the company of five played havoc upon the foulest of Norrath&#146;s 
          beasts. But off in the distance, rolling and building, unseen to all, 
          a collision of destruction and chaos was gathering together to drown 
          the meager group. Like so many times before, the warrior, blood still 
          fresh on his helm, headed out into the wasteland in search of prey. 
          Just then Shaaker&#146;s thoughts were interrupted by greetings from 
          beyond the Dreadlands. (Sall, in a rare mid-day appearance, logs on 
          and says hello) Allegiance-bearers, fellow adventurers bound together 
          by a mystical force that allowed them to speak to each other using only 
          their thoughts. (Guild chat) Closer than blood brothers, they had shared 
          too many travels to count and the presence of even one Allegiance-bearer 
          in battle gave comfort and security to Shaaker. Rising from seat, the 
          barbarian was preparing to welcome the brother and inquire about his 
          recent journeys when disaster was unleashed. Before his thoughts could 
          be collected, the shaman&#146;s heart stopped as the warrior hoarsely 
          cried out, &#147;Prepare yourselves, for today you shall have either 
          death or victory, for retreat is not an option!&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">No truer words were uttered that day because behind 
          him four beasts of differing size and power pursued him, all equally 
          furious and determined to crush our beings. (Really, really, really 
          bad pull) It was then that Shaaker lost his sight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>The knock at my door was soft and I still jumped 
          out of my seat. As it opened I hit the monitor power button and whirled 
          around to see my bosses smiling face. &#147;Ah, Matt, I need to talk 
          to you about the Florida property,&#148; he says as his sits down in 
          front of me. My inner voice is screaming out: &#147;Who is Matt and 
          where the hell is Florida??!!!!&#148; I nervously shift around and say 
          &#147;ok&#148;. (What was I going to say? &#147;Go away, my barbarian 
          shaman is engaged currently in a battle to the death and other people 
          are depending on me and by the way I am doing this on a company computer 
          on a pirated fax line from Accounts Receivables and yes, I am still 
          on the clock&#148;?)</i></font></p>
        <p><i><font size="4">The next 45 seconds seem to last an eternity as he 
          begins to open up a folder and hand me some documents. My mind is racing: 
          Do I &#147;/q&#148; or not? I figure that unless I get back ASAP they 
          will die (remember we are at the NE ruins and only the warrior has SoW), 
          so I decide to wait it out. My thinking is that if they die I should 
          die with them and besides I may yet get back in time.</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font size="4">In the background, I can faintly hear the groans 
          and cries from group members as the battle rages and I am here talking 
          about property lines and general warranty deeds. Just as I feel all 
          is lost, the intercom crackles and my boss is paged, &#147;Mr. Scott, 
          you have a call holding on your line&#148;. He walks to the door and 
          as he leaves tells me, &#147;Sorry about this Matt, but I need to take 
          this call.&#148; &#147;Oh, by all means&#148; I reply in my nicest business-tron 
          voice. The second he leaves, I hit the monitor power on, leap up, close 
          the door and pray that I am not staring at the &#147;LOADING&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133; 
          &#147; message.</font></i></p>
        <p><font size="4">Suddenly vision returns to the barbarian and all about 
          him was pain. Moving without delay, he begins to heal and heal and heal 
          again. (I get off four heals) One by one, the swordsmen feel bolstered 
          and with renewed commitment they stand their ground. The wizard, while 
          nearly untouched, is beginning to show weakness as he drains his spirit-self 
          in the melee. Not a single creature had fallen, when suddenly darkness 
          again surrounds the shaman, paralyzing him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>This time, no knock, the door just opens. I have 
          positioned my chair to block the monitor and as I swing around to my 
          desk I discreetly hit the power button again. &#147;Sorry, that was 
          not for me after all&#148;, says my boss. ARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH &#150; I 
          scream at the reality that I am surely dead and the others as well. 
          I could fake passing out or vomit on the desk but that would just bring 
          more people. Please, please, please, please GO AWAY! Then suddenly hope; 
          as my boss is sitting down, another executive (higher than my boss) 
          sees him and asks him if he has a second to talk. &#147;Sure, you need 
          me now?&#148; he asks. &#147;Yes, if you don&#146;t mind.&#148; My boss 
          heads out the door and it looks like I am saved, but then disaster: 
          they have only moved 5-8 feet from my doorway and are talking there. 
          Feeling the adrenaline begin to pump, I say screw it and turn on the 
          monitor, trying to position my chair to block anyone from seeing the 
          action. So there I am, door wide open, screen coming clearer and the 
          two men who could crush my career blithely talking away about some irrelevant 
          issue like employee misuse of the Internet.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The light and vision sear Shaaker&#146;s mind: the wizard 
          gasping his last breaths as death cackled, the warrior and paladin fading 
          as well and the monk no longer standing. (The bastard monk had FD&#146;d 
          and everyone except me was 1 bubble of health or less.) At their feet 
          lay two of the gruesome brutes; a third was bleeding freely from his 
          ears and nose, blind with pain and embracing the grave. But the last 
          creature, a Rager, was a frenzied windmill of claws, spit and blood. 
          Cries for healing, for renewed stamina, and even for mercy created a 
          cacophony of sorrow that shook the barbarian&#146;s soul. (In all CAPS, 
          the warrior had repeatedly said, &#147;SHAAKER HEAL!!&#148;) Working 
          with an unknown furor, Shaaker healed the wizard just as his body was 
          collapsing under the final blow. Assured of his safety, the barbarian 
          then cast healing spells upon the warrior and the paladin. With that, 
          the beast descended upon the shaman, the one who was cheating him of 
          his victory and next meal. However, the beast&#146;s fury was his undoing, 
          for as he was attacking the healer, both warrior and paladin moved in 
          from behind and dispatched him with an efficiency that only comes from 
          rage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As the bodies lay rotting in the hot sun, Shaaker apologizes 
          for the unexplainable blindness and loss of abilities. (/g &#147;Very, 
          very sorry all, bad patch of &#145;technical difficulties&#146;, I need 
          to log. Just glad no one died.&#148;) Not one among the group argued 
          with him as he offered to leave the group and seek rest and greater 
          healing within the safety of ruins. And with that Shaaker ran to a secluded 
          and safe corner, thanked the Tribunal for his life and that none had 
          died, and promptly went to sleep. </font></p>
