        <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drip... Drip ...Drip</font></i>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hatchling Jarok bit down 
          forcefully with his scaly snout, a long piece of twine stuck in his 
          maw, his visage in a fierce grimace. Silently, he submerged his black 
          head, and gracefully started swimming towards the underwater channel 
          out of Cabalis. Clamped firmly in tow, a long strand of rope tied to 
          a dwarf-sized barrel that had been left in the Cabalis waterway by some 
          careless Klok. Jarok struggled mightily with the first sweep of his 
          long arms and slowly progressed into a rhythm perfected through a thousand 
          like pulls.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His seventh pull of the day, 
          Jarok muscles were taut and twitched vigorously. His goal was to get 
          the last barrel to the underwater vortex, where all the garbage would 
          be flushed deep into Warslik Woods, and beyond that, the vast waterway 
          of Timorous Deep. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This young iksar has spent 
          the better part of 7 years keeping the Cabalis waterways clear of crates, 
          barrels, and refuse. Hatched from an inconspicuous grouping of eggs, 
          Jaroks lot in life was manual labor and monotonous movements. Neither 
          strong, quick, nor sturdy, Jarok was forced into the channel sweeping 
          position by the Toilmaster, who gave out like tasks to the ordinary 
          hatchlings of the Empire. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under Cabalis caste system, 
          Jarok was not destined to battle for the mighty Iksar Empire. Genetically, 
          Jarok was physically inferior. His tail was shorter than most of his 
          brethren. The length and girth of tails on all hatchlings were measured 
          early in their lives, theoretically offering a more balanced and efficient 
          body structure for combat. Those with the most prominent appendages 
          were shuttled into the melee schools of the empire, training them to 
          explore and defend the spacious lands near the capital city. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But a short tail was wonderful 
          for maneuvering through sharp watery turns....</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Swish, swish, swish...</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps Jarok greatest attributes 
          were mental rigidity and an uncanny ability to look past his daily drudgery 
          and complete his tasks with unparalleled focus. Day in and day out, 
          Jarok was the first and last hatchling to begin and end his daily sweeping. 
          When others got distracted by newly discovered insect hives or were 
          preoccupied tormenting a goblin torchbearer who fell into one of the 
          Cabalis many cisterns, Jarok would proceed unblinkingly. Neither love 
          nor passion compelled him, but more of an unexplainable desire to feel 
          whole by completing his tasks. It was this imperfect discipline that 
          kept him mentally and physically even. That and his short tail.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day, Jaroks fate would 
          change. As he was maneuvered through the western waterways of town, 
          Jarok meandered passed the Dark Temple. This temple was without light 
          and without sound. Unexplainably, this area of the city rarely held 
          refuse of any kind. The dark water seemed more ominous and still then 
          the rest of the busier thoroughfares. The air was heavier and moister, 
          and the aroma was that of spices and dust. Surprisingly, as Jaroks small 
          red eyes were peering out of the water, measuring the height of this 
          shadowy structure, he noticed a small cask bobbing against a bent ladder. 
          He raised his head a bit, his ears surfacing slightly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Clink, clink, clink. </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ever diligent to his task, 
          Jarok sped efficiently towards the cask, barely expending any energy. 
          As his clawed hands grabbed the rough edged cask, a raspy voiced hissed 
          to him, &quot;Young one, you toil and toil everyday, and yet sseem to 
          never complete your tasksss, for yet another day bringss yet more rubbish. 
          Do you not wish to ssee your effortsss be rewarded in ssome way?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jarok peered where the voice 
          came from and saw a smallish robed figure crouched at the top of the 
          side of the ladder. Bright yellow eyes beamed out at him from underneath 
          a dark red velvety hood. Jarok paused, cocked his head as if straining, 
          and slowly licked the moisture from the creases of his eyes with his 
          long scaly tongue. Again, the raspy voice uttered at Jaroks inaction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Come brooding... let 
          me tell you of our sstory. Hsss....&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jarok took one long look 
          at the cask, and caressed the wood lovingly. He then placed it down 
          and rested it against the ladder, bobbing once again. and proceeded 
          upwards. He followed the robe figure into the dimly lit alcove of the 
          Tower entrance. He never looked back.</font></p>
