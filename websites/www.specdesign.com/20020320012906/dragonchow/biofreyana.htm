        <img src="images/biofreyana.jpg" width="235" height="389" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's 
        been a good long while that Freyana has had the privilege of singing her 
        song. In the beginning, in the high treetops of Kelethin, she learned 
        what it&#146;s like to fall to your death. Urm&#133;I mean she learned 
        the value of knowing when to play an instrument and when to sing. Ah but 
        life was simple then, gather up the bat wings and prance around like a 
        cute little bard without a care. An orc was just a thing out of legend. 
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Not too much time had passed and many nighmares had come to pass, when 
          she met up with the likes of Dharamsala, a filthy little gnome following 
          the even more repulsive path of the necromancer. Although he was the 
          most unlikely of companions for this elvish bard, they became a fierce 
          duo. One day the fire kinda left the old gnome though. Freyana never 
          knew if it was all the fishing, the tinkering, or the plain drunken 
          stupor that overtook him but Dharam&#146;s essence somehow passed on 
          to an upstart cleric of the Tier&#146;Dal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          It was not long before the tired muse woke up to realize that this upstart 
          had become a Scarypriest. It seemed as though little had changed when 
          the pair were united, except of course that a cleric and bard have a 
          much easier time finding companions then a filthy little gnome and said 
          bard.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          It was through this steadfast and mighty companion of Freyana&#146;s 
          that she had the pleasure to meet the likes of a group known as Dragonchow. 
          The good fortune and friendships that were formed have been sung all 
          over Norrath. <br>
          Even after a couple bouts of indecision by the apprehensive wood elf, 
          when she had trouble deciding whether to go on adventuring or retire 
          to the warmth of a good orc burning, her new companions still welcomed 
          her back with open arms and ready smiles.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Such is the good fortune of this minstrel. Giggling her way through 
          life, trying to inspire others to perform to their best.</font></p>
