    Recruiting Policy</span> </big></big></big></p>
    <hr SIZE="1">
    <p><big><em>Dragonchow has the following rules for recruitment:</em></big><br>
    <br>
    1) You must be at least lvl 20 on your main. This level requirement demonstrates to us
    that you have a minimum basic understanding of and a minimum basic knowledge of the world
    of Norrath that we feel is necessary in a guild member.<br>
    <br>
    2) You should group with some of our current guild members and find someone who feels that
    you are a good fit for Dragonchow and would be willing to sponsor you.<br>
    <br>
    3) The sponsor will then post that they are sponsoring you and are willing to be
    responsible for them. This person will be your mentor / primary link / judge on whether
    you are or not behaving as a responsible Dragonchow member. They will be the folks who say
    nice job or tone it down a notch.<br>
    <br>
    3) At this point you will be guild tagged and on a trial basis for 30 days (possibly up to
    60 days) to see if Dragonchow is what you were looking for and for us to evaluate whether
    you are what we are looking for. We encourage you to group with as many members of the
    guild as you can to either make a good impression and / or to see if these are the folks
    you want to hang with. We encourage you to chat, ask questions in /gu. We encourage you to
    attend random incursions or raids. All of these things will help you decide if we are the
    folks that you want watching your back and vice versa.<br>
    <br>
    4) Any member of Dragonchow who has a positive experience with the recruit is asked to
    post under the Recruit discussion section. Any negative comments should be forwarded to
    officers who will also note it if they feel it is warranted in the Officer Section. <br>
    <br>
    5) After the trial period the officers will decide upon full membership at the next
    officer meeting.<br>
    <br>
    6) All real life friends and family of current Dragonchow members are also required to
    undergo the trial period, but will have a 'legacy' status.<br>
    <br>
    7) All former Dragonchow members who wish to return are welcome unless they were removed
    by an officer for cause. They may still return but they would need to demonstrate that the
    behavior that they were removed for has changed.<br>
    <br>
    These are our general policies / guidelines on Recruiting.<br>
    <br>
    Thank You for showing an interest in Dragonchow and good luck on your journeys.<br>
