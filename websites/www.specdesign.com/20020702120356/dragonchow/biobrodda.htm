        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda Sixfingers was born unto 
        darkness in the depths of Ak'anon.. early on his steps took him down the 
        path of thievery. Ophaned at a young age, his parents were taken by a 
        roving band of slave traders from Velious to the infamous Gnome Skin Armor 
        factories (He'll never forget seeing his Mom's &quot;Tinkerers do it in 
        a toolbox&quot; tattoo on a pair of Gnome arms worn by a druid in North 
        Freeport). In the ghettos, he would steal a couple of coppers here, a 
        bit of silver there, maybe a Word or two.. anything to keep food in his 
        belly and Gnomish Spirits in his flask. It wasn't until that fateful day 
        he snatched the scalp off the head of an Orc Pawn and handed it back him 
        without the Orc ever blinking an eye that he knew his true calling. He 
        applied for membership and was accepted into the local Rogue guild, The 
        Deep Muses. An adept student, his skills grew at an alarming rate. Thanks 
        to the extra finger he has on each hand, he had a distinct advantage in 
        any skill involving meticulous work with his hands. Quickly he learned 
        all his Guildmasters had to teach him (or so he kept telling himself). 
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Alas, poor Brodda suffered 
          from wanderlust, his eyes were always on the horizon. No family to keep 
          him in Ak'anon he decided to leave his homelands behind and seek his 
          fortune (Hahahahahahahaahaaha!). After several levels of strife and 
          turmoil in the various wastelands of Norrath, he had the priviledge 
          of meeting Krintog. After several hours of talking with the elderly 
          monk, he presented Brodda with an opportunity. Complete a series of 
          quests and he would be granted membership in the Plaguebringers. Brodda 
          accepted his charge and went forth, a new focus in his life. The quest 
          was to redeem himself as a rogue and complete the first half of the 
          Burning Rapier quest, the Gem of Stamina trial. Being quite low level 
          for such a quest he did as much as he could relying only on himself, 
          but as with all great accomplishments, he could not finish this alone. 
          Asking Krintog for help, they devised a plan. Together they stormed 
          the gates of Mistmoore Castle in the dead of night. Many a sleepy and 
          confused Dark Elf met in Innoruuk's Hall of the Dead that night. Then, 
          crashing through a pair of glass doors, they came upon the final target, 
          a renown poison researcher and accomplished brewer known as the Homo 
          Enologist. The battle was fierce for she was mighty! Although she fought 
          well, a monk and a rogue were the only two standing in that courtyard 
          when the dust settled. At last, his quest finished, Brodda was accepted 
          into the Plaguebringers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brodda, ever thankful for 
          his luck, made several life long friends in his new guild. One of these 
          was Tyrrund, an iksar monk around the same level. Becoming fast friends 
          they explored new lands, fought many battles together and shared in 
          adventures too numerous to recount here. In the background at this time, 
          the Plaguebringers started having a few internal problems and several 
          of it's members were moving on to different guilds. Most of the friends 
          Brodda made during his time in the Plague moved to a new guild, Dragonchow. 
          Tyrrund asked him to join Dragonchow, but he still gave his loyality 
          to Plague. Then, one day upon waking from his camp, Brodda found himself 
          without a guild at all. The Plaguebringers had disbanded in the night, 
          exiting his life as fast as it had entered it. Having no where else 
          to turn, Brodda decided to follow his friends and asked to be considered 
          for membership into Dragonchow. Much to his delight they accepted him 
          into their ranks (a curse? a blessing? this has yet to be seen...).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Brodda is now home.. his 
          tenure with Chow has been the happiest and most educational time in 
          his life. The people of Dragonchow have heaped upon our hero (pause 
          for laughter) huge quantities of kindness and generosity for the past.. 
          omg, year or more? They have dazzled him with their honor, precision, 
          teamwork, ferocity in battle and the ability to stay cool in the most 
          hopeless and dire of situations. This is Brodda's creed now. He has 
          completed the Burning Rapier quest and is now a fully redeemed rogue. 
          Helping others, giving all he can for the benifit of Chow, displaying 
          honor and integrity on the battlefield and off, even sacrificing himself 
          if the need arises.. this is what he lives for. He also enjoys a good 
          laugh, something Chow delivers on a daily, if not bi-hourly basis. Apparently 
          he has also taken a vow of poverty for reasons unknown, even to himself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There is no telling where 
          the Fates will lead our tiny-tiny friend Brodda, but doubt not that 
          it will be Swifthand and his intrepid band known as Dragonchow... may 
          Bristlebane smile upon them all.</font></p>
