        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&#147;6 Steps To 
          Becoming A Dragonchow Member&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          We have put a new recruitment process into play, and recruits who wish 
          to join Dragonchow, may have a few extra steps to go thru than the old 
          process called for, but we are hoping this will ensure that we recruit 
          quality individuals, looking for a quality guild. PLEASE read the following 
          carefully as it will walk you thru the steps you need to take to become 
          a member of Dragonchow.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new recruitment process 
          is as follows:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 1</b>: Is Dragonchow 
          Right For You, Are You Right For Dragonchow?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carefully read our <a href="greathall.htm">Guild 
          Description</a> , <a href="code.htm">Code Of Conduct</a> and <a href="recruitment.htm">Recruitment 
          Requirements</a>, to be certain you are considering the right guild 
          and that you are eligible. If Dragonchow looks like the kind of guild 
          you would like to call home, post your &quot;Request for membership&quot; 
          as a New Topic on this page Membership Request .</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 2:</b> Getting A 
          Sponsor.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All recruits must have a 
          Dragonchow sponsor. If you already have a sponsor, he or she must post 
          in the Recruit Sponsorship thread. If you do not have sponsorship, look 
          for Dragonchow members in the game that are of a similar level, let 
          them know you are considering joining the guild and ask to group with 
          them. This allows you to see first hand what DC members are like, and 
          lets us evaluate how good of a fit DC would be for you. After grouping 
          with one or more members, if you still feel you want to be a Dragonchow, 
          ask one of those you grouped with if they would be willing to sponsor 
          you, and post a sponsorship for membership. Also you might want to try 
          posting in your, request for membership thread that you are seeking 
          a sponsor, and would like to group up with members to get one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 3:</b> Password and 
          Information Page</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If one of our members agree 
          to sponsor you, the member will then need to post their sponsoring for 
          membership for you. After you have been sponsored, your sponsor will 
          give you the password to the extended family section of our chat board. 
          Begin a post in the Current Applicants thread, introducing yourself, 
          then cut and paste our&quot;Tell Us All About You&quot; Information 
          Page. Complete our questionnaire, answer it as honestly and thoroughly 
          as possible. Our RTM&#146;s will look over the Bio/Questionnaire and 
          will be expecting to hear from you either via the message board, in 
          game thru tells or using our /join dcrecruit chat channel to schedule 
          grouping sessions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 4:</b> Grouping Sessions 
          With Recruitment Team Members</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will now be asked to 
          make arrangements with our recruitment team members (RTM's) for 6 sessions 
          of grouping with some of them. Each session must be at least an hour 
          or longer and you must group with at least 2 different RTM's. A continuous 
          6 hour grouping DOES NOT equal 6 separate grouping sessions. Grouping 
          before guild request for membership was submitted, will not be accepted 
          as sessions. Raids/Questing/Guild Events do count as a session, provided 
          the 1 hour or more has been achieved. To view a list of our RTM's, and 
          RTM grouping availabilities go here Raid Team Members and Available 
          Times<br>
          Also please feel free to visit the &#147;Raid Invitations&#148; forum 
          once you have the password, so you can see what and where we are raiding, 
          and join us for a few raids.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 5:</b> Completing 
          Sessions and Evaluations</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After your 6 sessions have 
          been completed, the RO (Recruitment Officer) will evaluate the reports 
          of the RTM's and make the decision to tag or not to tag you in, if the 
          evaluations are neither negative, or positive, and a decision cannot 
          be made, the RO will decide if a recruit needs a few more grouping sessions, 
          an interview, or other arrangements, that will determine if you will 
          Dragonchow will be a good choice for you, and you for DC.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Step 6:</b> Probationary 
          Period</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once tagged you will then 
          be on probation for one month. If, after that time, you are still a 
          member (assuming you haven't done, or failed to do anything that would 
          cause the guild to reconsider your application for membership), you 
          can consider yourself a Full Member.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for your interest 
          in Dragonchow, and good luck on your recruitment! </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dragonchow Recruitment FAQ&#146;s</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Want to find out about becoming 
          a dragonchow. This is a good place to start.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What kind of guild is dragonchow?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are a &quot;family&quot; 
          guild. Not an &quot;uber&quot; guild. We raid frequently but you are 
          not required to attend. We do this mainly to get epic items and equipment 
          upgrades for our members. We also do it for &quot;the fun of it&quot;. 
          Many people would not get a chance to experience zones like Fear/Hate/Air/Kael/Temple 
          of Veeshan if they did not attend raids.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do I have to be a certain 
          level to join?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You have to be at least level 
          20. Although most of our players are in the 50 - 63 range. At the lower 
          levels you may have trouble finding DC to group with except in the form 
          of alts. (And most of our alts are in the 35 - 45 range). If you are 
          in the 47 - 63 range there are lots of DC for you to play with.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do I need a certain level 
          of resists to join?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bah... That is an uber guild 
          question. At DC we don't care about your equipment. There are some raids 
          that for safety reasons are resticted without the proper gear but in 
          general when you join DC you will be going places and doing things to 
          get you the resist gear you will need to visit these places.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you do open recruiting?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will NEVER see DC shouting 
          in a zone -- Dragonchow looking for new members send a tell. We are 
          an &quot;by invitation only guild&quot;. That does not mean that if 
          you don't know any DC now you can't join. What it does mean.... Hey 
          get to know us and see if we are &quot;of a like mind&quot;. If you 
          think you may be interested in dragonchow join the channel dcrecruit 
          when you log in. Here you will find DC and other recruits that are looking 
          to group together. It is a great way to meet DC and after you meet some 
          of us and make some friends finding a sponsor will be easy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do I have to fill out 
          an application?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't think of it as an application. 
          Think of it as a &quot;getting to know you&quot; fact sheet or a Bio. 
          We don't disqualify people based on information presented there. We 
          truly don't care about your level or your gear. In the past we use to 
          &quot;interview&quot; new recruits and ask them questions like... Why 
          do you want to join Dragonchow? And.. What do you enjoy most about the 
          game. But it was getting too hard for our officers to &quot;play&quot; 
          and &quot;type&quot; so we put it down in application for so they could 
          review the information in &quot;non game time&quot; and so that recruits 
          could &quot;think&quot; about their answers a bit and not feel like 
          they are being put on the spot. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do I have to group before 
          being accepted?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pre-joining grouping 
          is as much for you as it is for us. It really is just a &quot;getting 
          to know each other&quot; kind of thing. You will meet us and get to 
          know us and visa versa. If after these grouping sessions you decide 
          &quot;DC is not the right place for you&quot; or visa versa, then we 
          don't have any hard feelings about joining the guild then leaving etc. 
          Again it is just another way for both you and the guild to &quot;try 
          each other on for size&quot; </font></p>
