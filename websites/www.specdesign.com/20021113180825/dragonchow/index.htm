                            the past I have learned all kinds of new tricks by 
                            just seeing screen shots of how other people set up 
                            their hot keys, chat windows and such. Since the new 
                            UI was introduced people have been customizing their 
                            interface to their own personel taste and style, downloading 
                            and installing new skins and in some cases creating 
                            their own. I think it would be very interesting to 
                            see how other Chow see the world. So take a screenshot 
                            of your interface--even if it is the old one--and 
                            mail to me at dragonchow@specdesign.com, and I will 
                            see about posting some of these. It will be entertaining 
                            at least and I suspect educational to many. After 
                            getting some posted I will create a link to the chat 
                            board so people can discuss what they see in the event 
                            they have questions like: How the heck did you get 
                            a spawn timer on your interface like that? Where did 
                            you get that nifty in game map system? How did you 
                            make your hot buttons into inventory slots? You can 
                            move the palettes around?</font></p>

                            go to the Roll Call area and edit your post with your 
                            current level, your alts, and your main. We would 
                            really appreciate it if you designated your &quot;main&quot; 
                            rather than forcing us to guess. Be sure to list your

                            have obtained your epic you could list that as well--we 
                            can put a little star next to your name to indicate 
                            how cool you are =) Also, if you are an officer it 
                            would be helpful if you listed which of your characters 
                            are officers. If you haven't ever posted to the Roll 
                            Call please do so at once. All new members should 
                            post to the Roll Call--if you don't know how, contact 
                            your sponsor, or just about any Chow member, and they

                            -- Thurs, Karnor's Castle. Last night the planet's 
                            aligned, cats and dogs were sleeping together, and 
                            Ssmacki AND Kixim both obtained their Pawbuster pipes 
                            for their epics. This pipe has alluded Ssmacki for 
                            close to 5 months, and Kixim was into his 5th week 
                            in their struggle to obtian this item off a rare spawn 
                            who pops in a heavily camped room in KC. Ssmacki may 
                            still need to under go counciling to deal with the 
                            months of trama of being locked alone in KC, but there 
                            is hope that he can now return to normal society again.

                            appology to those who came to KC expecting a major 
                            raid. A full KC raid was never the intention. The 
                            focus of this night was to obtain the pipes, and only 
                            a single group or two was needed--as it turned out 
                            less than that as an exsisting group needed to be 
                            &quot;infiltrated&quot; to obtain the camp (even I 
                            couldn't get in =P). The wonderful turnout of support 
                            from DC was great but more than was needed however, 
                            the added assistance of having so many DC nearby to 
                            assist in such things as rezzes and escorts to the 
                            camp, did greatly increase the shot at getting the 
                            pipes. So while the impromptu raid on VS did not fully 
                            materialze everyone's presence DID make a huge difference 
                            and made this night a wonderful success. For a more

                            bracers (Extended range III) Really good experience,

                            group that when they leave let us know. This worked 
                            the last time when we got the camp and bottom line

                            shortly there after Masive joined the party, and with 
                            his added power and zone knowledge, we were shoved

                            Enchanters and Shadowknights. It lasted nine hours 
                            on Saturday as the intrepid band comprised of three 
                            groups snaked their way through unknown territory 
                            to the bottom of the abyss. The raid achieved the 
                            goal of obtaining no less than 3 enchanter epic pieces 
                            for Sarenia, Fenelane and Enusur, but alas the Sk 
                            and Shaman mobs were not at home. (A special thanks

                            wedding of two guild members, Lyzzerd and Minimoretocome, 
                            both Iksars, was a very strange event. In the first 
                            place, the location for the ceremony was The Arena, 
                            a zone off Lake Rathetear whose sole function (well, 
                            aside from weddings) is to serve as a Player vs Player 
                            site. Due to the late arrival of some guests, the 
                            early arrivals, including Haghoula, passed the time 
                            by attacking one another and getting drunk. </font></p>
                          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Once 
                            the ceremony finally began, there was some additional 
                            trouble. One of the guests, Aend, went link dead, 
                            so his character kept attacking people (especially 
                            Haghoula, who earlier had cast Vampiric Curse on him, 
                            a DoT). She had to repeatedly root him, but finally 
                            some audience members got tired of his attacks and 
                            simpy slaughtered him--right there in front of the 
                            bride and groom. Then the bride went link dead, creating 
                            a general round of laughter and many jokes. </font></p>

                            was most disturbing was the end of the ceremony. Instead 
                            of &quot;you may kiss the bride,&quot; it was &quot;KILL 
                            THE GNOME!&quot; Fortunately, this was not a reference 
                            to yours truly, but another of Haghoula's race (Brodda). 
                            The guests, bride and groom began to pummel the Gnome, 
                            beating him senseless and leaving him dead. Cake and

                            killed Thrakin Griffen, and obtained Jeb's Seal. Unfortunately,

                            for, and then cranking out Protection of the Cabbage

                            sometime. It makes the shawl quest look simple. The

                            you always wished there was a link on the website 
                            to EQ Guilds or EQlizer, a direct link to the General 
                            Discussion section or a downloadable spreadsheet of 
                            all the guild members listed by level, class, race, 
                            and shoe size. Perhaps you want to know how to get 
                            that really cool picture of you soloing Nagafen on 
                            the site, but you don't like using email, and you 
                            can't find me online, but still want to comment on 
                            the website. If that is the case here is a little 
                            thread on the chat board so you can have an easier 
                            means to let me know what you like and don't like.
