    <p></font><font size="3">The roots of the DC stretch back to a previous guild known as the
    Plaguebringers. This reasonably large guild, headed by the Guildleader, Talnic, was
    disorganized, with weak leadership that allowed young members to misbehave with impunity.
    Talnic was growing weary of the mantle of leadership and apathy was growing in its wake. </p>
    <p>At this same time a group of Iksars were growing discontent with the Plaguebringers. In
    addition to the lax management, they found themselves left out of guild events, since such
    events were held in &quot;good cities&quot; where worshipers of Cazic-Thule are not
    welcomed. One of these Iksars, a charismatic lizard named <a href="bioswifthand.htm" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Swifthand</a>, had a vision for a better guild; a guild made
    up of friends who would work together to help each other and have fun. Well liked by all,
    Swifthand gathered to him twenty of his most trusted Iksar friends, and broke away from
    the Plaguebringers. So it was, in the winter of the first year of the new millennium,
    Dragonchow was born. </p>
    <p>Not long afterwards, Talnic, tired of being Guildleader of the Plaguebringers,
    dissolved that guild. Now it only exsists in the memories of those who knew it. </p>
    <p>The early days of Dragonchow were joyful for the young Iksars, who created, the now
    mostly forgotten tradition of &quot;Kill the Guildleader Day&quot;. Despite its malevolent
    sounding title, this was a gathering of the guild for fun, and a means of getting to know
    each other better. </p>
    <p>Over the months alliances were established with many other guilds, most notably with
    the Saryrn Guild Alliance (SGA) but these associations have been left dormant as of late
    due to previous bad experiences during multi-guild raids where other guild&#146;s selfish
    attitudes, and poor organization left DC with a bitter taste for such endeavors. </p>
    <p>At it&#146;s one year anniversary, Dragonchow has more than 50 members (not including
    alts). </font></p>
