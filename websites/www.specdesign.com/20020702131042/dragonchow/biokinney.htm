        <p>Kinney grew up in a small town with other magicians. The Arch mages 
          would teach the younger ones about Gods and spells, but Kinney never 
          believed in the Gods. She chose the way of the agnostic. When the Arch 
          mages found this out, Kinney was cast out from her beloved town. Teaching 
          herself in the way of the magicians and wandering the lands looking 
          for a place to call home, she wondered to herself that maybe she should 
          believe in the gods. Then she met a handsome man named Exavier, who 
          she fell in love with right away. He took her to his home called Dragonchow. 
          They took her in with open arms. From that day on she knew she did not 
          have to believe in the Gods, she believed in the love of the people.<br>

        <p>Lindsay was a beautiful shaman who loved her warrior husband, Faladaor. 
          They fought side by side in battles for good and love. One night Faldaor 
          was called to battle without her. Months passed and there was nothing 
          from him. One day a man came to her door with a letter from him. The 
          last one he wrote before he was killed. He wrote &quot;my dearest love 
          you must sign up in Dragonchow and fight for the good and remember that 
          I will always be with you. With tears in her eyes, she packed her bags 
          and said her last good byes. From that day on she walked the earth helping 
          others who are in need.<br>
