    by a superstitious mother, in to the wild woods of kelithin ; for she was born with a
    seers eyes. one blue and one green. She was found by a changeling wolf. a wolf that was
    neither human nor wolf but part of each; twisted by wild magic&#146;s that course threw
    the land .she raised the child as one of her own pups and taught her the languages of the
    animals and the ways of the wild woods and the wet lands. as she grew older, Dormare
    started seeing things. at first she thought they were mere dreams, but then they would
    come to pass. not understanding what they were she spoke to her mother. The changeling
    knew of such things as visions but had no way of teaching her. the changeling went deep in
    to the forest and found an old wise water oaktree buy a serene pond. there she asked the
    trees hymradan (tree's spirit or nymph) to teach her strange ugly beautiful child to see
    with clarity and control. to help her see the light of the dawn and not be frightened any
    more of something she could not control. the spirit agreed as long as Dormare was still
    pure and under the age 15. as Dormare was only 13 that would give her 2 years to study and
    train; and since she was still pure never having ever meet neither elf or any humanoid
    race before the changeling agreed also. Thus began the road that lead Dormare threw the
    next few years. she learned quickly from the hymrada and learned to love Tunare. the
    spirits lord and creator. she learned the ways of druids and of the wet lands. how to be
    even more quiet and undetectable when you are traveling. her visions still can but never
    bothered her any more for she had learned how to tell which one were destined and which
    ones weren&#146;t. the next years were wonderful by the water oak's pond and peaceful.
    Then unexpectedly one night she awoke from a very powerful and scary vision. of death,
    destruction, plague, pestilence , and war. she knew that these thing would come to pass if
    not changed. she knew she must go into the world and find others to help her turn the tide
    of war. her changeling mother granted her the gift to change form to a wolf at will to
    help her on her quest. the hymradan gave her the gift of travel threw spells called ports
    that she could learn as she traveled. Dormare left a life of peace she had known to go out
    to a world of people places and things she had only dreamed about. In her travels she met
    a creature she liked. its name was Indra. She learned he was called an iksar and as of an
    evil people though he was not. He convinced her that he was not to be killed and turned in
    to her next and newest vest. Thus he brought her to Dragonchow. a group of other beings on
    the same quest she was on. to help stop the destruction she saw in her dreams. and she
    believes that they can. together </font></td>

    at heart. At her parents behest she went to enchanter school at an early age. There she
    prospered well. Learning quickly and competently. she was always a bit flighty and easily
    distracted but her intelligence was always high. if bothered enough by someone they could
    easily pull her away from one task to help them at another before she was finished with
    the other. viewed as odd she tended to be a bit of a loner. While on the circuit given to
    her by the Enchanter School she found those she crossed were often won over by her
    generosity and big heart. knowing that she really cared about what happened to them. one
    day as she came upon one of the many villages she tended, she witnessed the massacre of
    the inhabitants of the village. among the inhabitants of the village was her lover and
    some distant family members. Her heart broken by the murder of her loved ones, she turned
    on the encroaching fiends. an army to her ,but nothing more then a band of high way
    thieves call the &quot;circle of the unseen hand&quot;. Enraged, she raised power in to
    her hands and cast a spell so terrible in its power that she killed them all in one
    magnificent blast. she awoke a week later in an infirmary. The nurses told her that after
    she struck down the invaders, she collapsed in to a coma. the nurses explained she
    suffered from channeling to much power the her experience would not allow. Avengaline had
    now lived up to her name, and vowed that she would no longer allow thougs to persecute
    hapless farmers and peanuts any more. with the help of long time friends and associates of
    Dragonchow, a group of people that had nearly the same goal as she. Avengaline has now
    gone out in to the world with her friends and colleges to lands unknown to strike out at
    the &quot;circle of the unseen hand&quot; someday she shall be victorious.</font></td>
