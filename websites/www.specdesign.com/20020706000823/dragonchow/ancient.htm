    <p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial"><big><big>Many</big></big> <big><big>of you
    have heard the legends</big></big>&#151;the drunken tales of seafarers slurring their
    words in some East Freeport tavern&#151;talking foolishness about an elusive Ancients
    Cyclops who is supposed to have in his possession the Ring of the Ancients. The great
    ring, the key to the quest for the spectacular Journeyman Boots&#151;boots that can make
    you run like the wind with nary a click of the heels. Ah yes, I am certain you have heard
    the fables before, but I am here to tell you that myth and legend they are not, for I have
    seen the AC with mine own eyes. I helped to slay the great beast and with my own hand I
    took from its body the coveted ring. This is my story&#133;</font></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;<big><big><big><big><o:p></big></strong>I</big></big></big>t<strong>
    </strong>began Saturday afternoon...</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">For sometime now I have known about the existence
    of Jboots and told myself that one day I would try and get a pair. I assumed they were
    something only high level adventurers could obtain, but on a lark I went to the Dragonchow
    Guild Library and checked out the book on Items, looked up the ring and discovered to my
    shock that the quest was listed at level 35! (In retrospect I doubt this unless the 35<sup>th</sup>
    brings a full group with him). Elated I quickly gated to the Eastern Wastes and ran to my
    wife, the Enchantress Sarenia, who was busy, sitting in the snow on the Dragon Bridge,
    crafting some bit of jewelry. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Jboots!&#148; I shouted nearly slipping on
    the snow.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Excuse me?&#148; Sarenia said looking up.
    &#147;Did you say Jaboots?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;No, Jboots! Journeyman Boots, we can get
    them!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Oh, honey don&#146;t be silly, we
    couldn&#146;t possibly get Jboots yet.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;No, we can I have researched the whole
    thing. All we need is 325 plat, well in gold of course, a Shadowed Rapier&#151;we got one
    of those in South Karana with Darsus not too long ago remember? Of course it went poof the
    moment we fell asleep&#151;I hate it when things go poof! The only real problem is getting
    the Ring of the Ancients.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>At this point Sarenia began to laugh
    hysterically.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;What?&#148; I said. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>She only laughed harder.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I waited tapping my foot in the snow.
    &#147;Oh, quit it will you?&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Honey that ring is just a myth. People have
    gone after it before and have never been heard from again. Now why don&#146;t you go back
    to snaring your little Uthork Hunters. You like snaring the Uthroks remember?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I rapped my fingers on my Stein of Moggok
    and glared at her. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Sarenia stopped laughing. She put down the
    earring she was working on and faced me. &#147;Ok dear, tell me what you found out.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island1.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I knelt down beside her and began drawing
    maps in the snow. &#147;The Ancient Cyclops is the one who has the ring we need. He has
    only been seen in South Karana, South Ro, and on the Island of the Ancient Cyclops in
    Ocean of Tears. Spotting him in South Karana is so rare that hunting him there is absurd.
    South Ro is so heavily populated, and since you never know where he might appear, the
    chances of catching him alone are astronomical. No, I think our best hope is the Ocean of
    Tears. He lives on an island there.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Sarenia blinked her eyes and smiled at me,
    &#147;And am I too assume I have a ticket on the next ship leaving the Freeport harbor and
    that you have already memorized a translocation spell to send me there?&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Well, yes.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You&#146;re so
    predictable.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;So we&#146;ll do it?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Hummm, no sense us both wasting out
    time.&#148; Sarenia stood up, shivered and surveyed the bleak landscape of the Eastern
    Wastes. &#147;You are almost to your next level. You should stay here and get the
    experience you need, as for me&#133;a little vacation to the islands actually sounds
    rather nice. Velious is a nice enough place to visit, but I don&#146;t want to freeze to
    death here. Ok, I&#146;ll tell you what, I will go ahead and scout things out. If it looks
    hopeful I will call you.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Woot!&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Sarenia looked at me puzzled. &#147;What does that
    mean anyway?&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;You know, I have no idea, but everyone in
    the guild seems to like saying it when something good happens. Right now however it means
    I&#146;m gonna get me some Jboots!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The warm southerly breezes were blowing out
    of the west that afternoon, as Sarenia sailed the Ocean of tears. She sent word ahead and
    asked about the AC and it&#146;s availability. She received the reply that no less than
    three adventurers were in line waiting for it. They asked if she wanted to be put on the
    list. She sent word back that she did. When Sarenia arrived on Sisters Island the elvish
    islanders greeted her warmly, with Kiola Nuts&#151;a local custom I think. She looked into
    renting a little catamaran but all they had left at the dock were paddle boats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hating paddle boats Sarenia rolled up her robe and
    swam the inlet. The Island of the Ancient Cyclops appeared before her as a small mountain
    thrusting up out of the sea shrouded in a thick mist. Rising above the fog she could just
    make out the broken remnants of a stone building on the top of the island&#146;s high
    point. What it once was she couldn&#146;t tell for now all that was left was a shattered
    ruin covered by moss and lichen. Sarenia reached the beach and wrung out her clothes and
    looked around. The island was oddly silent. No sounds of birds, no chatter of rodents. The
    place was deathly still.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island2.jpg" alt="island2.jpg (18271 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;How dreadful,&#148; she thought,
    &#147;not at all the vacation paradise I was expecting.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>She wandered along the beach until she heard
    the sound of voices. There, not too far away, were several people sitting on the sand. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You all wouldn&#146;t happen to know
    where I might find the Ancient Cyclops would you?&#148; She asked. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Aye, we would,&#148; said one of them.
    &#147;He pops here right before us. You must be Sarenia, or number three as you&#146;ll be
    known here. I am Kiross, 57 enchanter, I am number one.&#148; He bowed. &#147;Back there,
    the 39<sup>th</sup> necro is Brumael, he&#146;s number two and that&#146;s his buddy the
    mage is Windrover&#151;he&#146;s just here to help. The 57<sup>th</sup> ranger there,
    Evenstarr, is number four. He&#146;s after you.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Kiross sized up Sarenia for a moment.
    &#147;You here alone?&#148; he asked. &#147;You look kinda young to be soloing the
    AC.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;My husband is a wizzy, he&#146;ll port
    in when I need him. Actually we are trying to get the boots for him. As an enchanter I can
    usually get SoWs easily enough as most druids and shamans are eager to trade me for
    Clarity.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;I see.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;But wait, I thought I was number four?
    I was told I was on the boat at least.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Just then a cyclops appeared before their
    eyes. A huge powerful beast that shook the ground beneath its feet. The one-eyed freak
    spotted the group and bellowed, &#147;I&#146;ll spill your blood to make my bread, and
    grind your bones when you are dead!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>He charged attacking wildly, but the group
    had pets guarding the beach and after a few quick spells the monster fell with a deafing
    thud. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Hehe, never get too far. Now where
    were we,&#148; Kiross said, &#147;Ahh yes, you were number four, but Goreldar killed his
    AC, won his ring and left.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Really? Great! So how long until the
    next one?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>There was a disturbing silence among the
    adventurers. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;What? Did I say something wrong?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>After a time Brumael spoke. &#147;No one
    knows how long he will take to return, but best estimate is about 4 to 12 hours.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Oh dear.&#148; Sarenia gasped. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;I hope you like Kiola nuts,&#148;
    Windrover said, cracking one on a rock and eating it. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The afternoon slipped by, hours passed.
    Every six minutes a new spawn appeared, Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops,
    pirate&#133;no sign of the Ancient. Then it happened. All at once he appeared. He conned
    40<sup>th</sup> level, and was no harder to take down than any of the others. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Kiross looted the ring, but remained behind
    to help the others with their efforts. Now Brumael was up. He and Windroaver moved to the
    front line and the wait began anew. Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops,
    pirate&#133;Then they all heard foot steps scampering up the sandy hill. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Hello! I am Zenren,&#148; a little 49<sup>th</sup>
    gnome wizard greeted them. &#147;I am here to kill the AC.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;So are all of us, my friend you will
    need to wait in line.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Line? Line?&#148; He seemed put out.
    &#147;But I am a wizard, I could just KS the next one and be done with it hehe.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The looks on the adventurer&#146;s faces
    went grim. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You could,&#148; Sarenia told him,
    &#147;If you wanted to be a bastard, and have us broadcast that you are a KSer to each
    zone we enter.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Hummm.&#148; He pondered this.
    &#147;Ok can I join your group then?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>He joined then sat down beside them briefly
    then got up and ran around them several times, kicked sand in Kiross&#146; face and
    laughed at him. Kiross looked annoyed.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;This is really boring.&#148; Zenren said at
    length. &#147;I am going to have to go soon, can I have the next one?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The party laughed at him.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Very funny Zenren,&#148; Sarenia said.
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;What was funny?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You don&#146;t find humor in what you
    just said?&#148; Brumael asked. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;No why?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>&#147;Because we have all been camping here
    for hours, and there is no way we are going to just hand you the next AC.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You know I could just KS it.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;You mentioned that before.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The gnome sat down and fidgeted. He ran down
    to the water and back. &#147;How long does it take?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;We don&#146;t know,&#148; Brumael
    replied.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;This really sucks.&#148; The gnome
    fidgeted some more.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Meanwhile, I had finally achieved my goal of
    dinging 40, and thought it was high time I joined Sarenia at the camp. When I arrived the
    mood there was somber. The only one talking was Zenren, and he wouldn&#146;t stop. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&#147;I&#146;m
    going AFK brb.&#148; Zenren told us and sat down in the front row. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>No sooner had he said this than a powerful
    Cyclops popped. Perhaps it was divine justice, karma or just good fortune, but the monster
    went right for Zenren. Pets were sent on it, and spells were cast, but when the smoke
    cleared both the Cyclops and Zenren lay dead. No one had wished him dead, but there was
    little remorse. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Wtf!&#148; Zenren&#146;s spirit
    shouted. &#147;I said I was AFK!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Sorry guy,&#148; Brumael said.
    &#147;He went right for you, there was nothing we could do.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Bullshit! You could have cast
    fear!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Tried, he resisted.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;That&#146;s bullshit! Get me a
    rez!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island3.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;There is only one cleric in the zone
    and they are AFK right now,&#148; Kiross said. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The group really didn&#146;t want the gnome
    back and hoped he might leave. Zenren left the group without a word, then after about an
    hour they saw that Zenrens&#146; body was gone. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;He&#146;s sitting over there
    invisible.&#148; Kiross told them. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We all put see invisibility up and it was
    true Zenren sat on an adjacent hill. The party sent him tells, but he refused to reply.
    Then another Cyclops popped, and immediately Zenren cast a damage spell on it. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Ah-hah!&#148; Brumael exclaimed,
    &#147;So he intends to KS the AC from us!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We prepared for an all out damage war on the
    AC when two GMs arrived on the scene. Brumael had petitioned them and they arrived in mere
    minutes. They talked to the gnome, and Brumael went over to discuss the situation. Brumael
    offered to allow Zenren to stay, as long as he stopped trying to KS. In the end however,
    Zenren, clearly nervous by the presence of the two GMs logged and was not heard from
    again. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops,
    pirate, Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops, pirate, Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops,
    Cyclops, pirate, etc.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The time began to drag. It was now 10:00 at
    night. No sign of the AC. The conversation had dried up. The hunt stopped being fun for
    everyone. With so much time invested no one was giving up. Sarenia decided to make the
    most of her time and swam across the inlet back to Sister&#146;s island there she
    purchased a fishing pole and bait for everyone at the camp, as well as several bottles of
    beer. She swam back and handed them out to each of the group&#146;s members. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;We shall have a fishing contest!&#148;
    She declared. &#147;Who ever gets the most fish when the bait runs out wins. Oh, and be
    careful with the beer if you aren&#146;t used to it.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Thoo Laate!&#148; Brumael slurred.
    &#147;Woooww, neaver trried this befhore!&#148; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;WOot! Inetlegence is 46!&#148; the Mage
    said.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Sarenia drank as well, but since her days of
    drinking kobold loot in Stoneburnt, it didn&#146;t effect her. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Tthiss is the graetest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>camp evver!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Hours later the hangover set in and things
    quieted down once more. It was nearly 2:00am now. Sarenia had fallen asleep about an hour
    ago, and I decided enough was enough. I headed to bed, but Sarenia woke up and stuck
    around for a few more placeholder kills. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Ok, I will leave after two more. Too
    tired.&#148; She told the rest. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island4.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Then POP! The Ancient Cyclops was there
    grinning stupidly at everyone. Everyone grinned stupidly back with bags under their eyes.
    Sarenia roused me from sleep. Adrenaline rushed back in. Suddenly everyone was very awake.
    The battle went as before and was over in seconds. Brumael looted his ring. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Kiross and Evenstarr left as did Windrover.
    Brumael fitting the huge ring onto his wrist and smiling happily, paused at Sarenia and
    myself. &#147;Humm. You two gonna be alright?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;We are going to try and get some guild
    mates to help us.&#148; Sarenia told him. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Ok,&#148; He said, &#147;Listen
    I&#146;ll tell you what. I am going to go get the boots, then I will swing back here and
    see if I can&#146;t help you out. After all you were there for me all night.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Thanks,&#148; we said. Then he was
    gone and we were all alone on the island. It was our turn.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We went over battle techniques and prepped
    for combat. When the next Cyclops appeared. He was yellow to us, and the fighting ensued.
    We killed the first Cyclops fine, but he was white. When the second appeared he was yellow
    and things went bad. Snaring, rooting, and nuking. Sarenia tired to mez him only to be
    told she can&#146;t mez this creature. With mana depleted. I medded, but Sarenia died.
    With my last bit of blue I threw my last nuke and he dropped. Sarenia awoke on the other
    side of the island and walked back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Ok, that could be a problem.&#148; She said.
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;We need help,&#148; I said. &#147;While we
    could continue to let ourselves die and then return and attack with full mana, I think
    there is a better way.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;But who in their right mind would be
    willing to undertake such a quest starting at 2 am?&#148; Sarenia asked.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We called out to our guild and to our
    surprise two answered the call. Scalezz the 45th necromancer Iksar and Drukinpoinch the
    Iksar warrior. What they were doing in Thrugadin at 2:00 am, I have no idea, but they were
    willing to come help. I gated to the Great Divide, and picked them up and ported us to
    North Ro. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;How&#146;s your faction here?&#148; I
    shouted to them over the dry whistling winds of the Ro desert.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Not good,&#148; they replied. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Ok, we&#146;ll go invisible and
    through the tunnels just to be safe. Have you done this before?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>The both shook their heads, &#147;I have
    practice sneaking on boats in Overthere though,&#148; Druk said. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;This will be a little different,&#148;
    I told them. So with the two in tow I lead the way into the tunnels of Freeport and worked
    my way to the secret ocean outlet. There we levitated to the Shark Rock and awaited the
    coming of the ship. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Humm.&#148; Scalezz said.
    &#147;there&#146;s no guard on the dock, just a feeble, defenseless fisher girl. Why
    don&#146;t I just kill her?&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;You Iksar necros are all alike.&#148; I told
    her. &#147; I honestly don&#146;t care, just don&#146;t get killed.&#148; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>A nasty gleam came to Scalezz&#146;s eyes
    and a grin to her thin lizard lips, but just then just then the ship appeared and in the
    dead of night we slipped aboard. We jumped off at the Sister&#146;s isle as well, and swam
    toward the Ancient&#146;s Island. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Meanwhile, Sarenia was holding the camp
    alone. Hiding from the spawns and letting them depop, until at last Brumael, true to his
    word, returned sporting a new pair of Jboots and showing them off. We all formed a new
    group and began to tick off the new spawns. Boredom set in faster at 3:00am than it did at
    3:00pm. Brumael called it a night. Drukinpoinch needed to log for a while, but now the
    minutes were weighing far too heavy. It was nearly 4:30am. At last, Scalezz admitted she
    was getting way too tired to keep the camp up, and Sarenia and I admitted defeat and
    camped at nearly 5:00am. Exhausted and depressed we fell asleep. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The next morning we woke up at 9:00am and found,
    as expected, someone else was already camping the AC. His name was Taladhan, and he was a
    good sort, and offered to send us a tell when he was through. So Sarenia and I ported back
    to the Eastern Wastes and hunted Uthorks again. The frozen land never looked so good. It
    was about 1:00 that Taladhan called to tell us he had his ring, and we gated back to the
    island. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island5.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We called again to the guild and this time
    Masive the ogre warrior responded. He was in the Dreadlands and I ported him, to North Ro,
    then just as the night before I lead the big brute through the tunnels of Freeport to the
    ship. It dipped noticeably when he stepped aboard despite the levitate spell. We reach the
    island just as Sarenia was hiding from another spawn and together we polished him off.
    Masive could only stay a short time, and soon he had to leave, but he wanted to try
    soloing one just to see if he could. So Sarenia and I sat back and watched. Masive engaged
    a nice 40<sup>th</sup> level Cyclops and was doing pretty well, he had the beast down a
    good quarter or more, but the beast had him down three quarters. When at last he gave the
    word, Sarenia and I jumped back into the fight and finished it, and Masive said goodbye to
    us and camped. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It was just us again, but in watching
    Scalezz fight the night before, Sarenia had an idea. She would use fear on the Cyclops and
    hope I had enough mana to snare and nuke it to death. The pop came. The fear worked and
    while mana was getting low it looked good. Then just at that moment Scalezz appeared<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>out of no where and came to our aid. We finished
    him easily. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It was now around 2:00pm on Sunday, we were
    still a bit tired, but we had the camp to ourselves and the firepower to hold it! Things
    were finally looking hopeful. Still I kept wondering what ever became of Druk, as he was
    probably trapped on the island. I hoped he would log in so I could punt him back to Kunark
    or Iceclad. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops,
    pirate, Cyclops, ogre, pirate, Cyclops, Cyclops, pirate. The march went on and on. I
    started to remember Sarenia&#146;s words at the start of this. &#147;People have gone
    after the Ring and were never seen again.&#148; I was starting to see why. It was nearing
    dinner time, when moral was at an all time low that unexpectedly the AC popped. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>&#147;Calm down,&#148; I shouted as I felt
    the air tense with the charge of mana about to be released, &#147;Just wait. Take a
    breath. Check your shields!&#148; This was it, what we had been waiting for and I
    didn&#146;t want everyone rushing into the battle out of excitement and make stupid
    mistakes. We had waited far too long to screw up now. Besides he wasn&#146;t going
    anywhere. In fact, the great one-eyed giant was just standing there with his back to us
    staring off at the ocean. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>For a moment I pondered what he was
    thinking. Was he bewildered at his short life, that had an expectancy of about 48 seconds
    on a good day? Was he cursing the ring he possessed that brought death to him over and
    over. Was he looking out across the see dreaming of a place where greedy little fiends
    didn&#146;t slaughter him over and over for the same silly ring? Of course he might just
    be thinking of crossing the inlet for a Koila nut and sister sandwich, after all he was a
    Cyclops not Socrates.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>In one abrupt blast, like a massive tidal
    wave, the fury of 19 hours of pent-up camping was released upon the unsuspecting giant.
    Snare, fear, dot, nuke, nuke, nuke! The Ancient Cyclops was knocked back. He<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>spun on his enemies and charge up the beach. Fear
    drove him up the slope of the island toward the ruins. Nuke, nuke, nuke! In a blaze of
    fire, ice and poison, the great AC staggered, groaned, and fell, first to his knees where
    he hovered for a brief moment. His eye, twisted up with pain and agony, looked at each of
    us in turn, then closed for good, and the ancient monarch of the island toppled over and
    fell with a deafing collapse. &nbsp;<o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="images/island7.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="240"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We all stood there in shock for a second. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Do we roll?&#148; Sarenia and Scalezz asked
    in unison.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">There was a brief discussion, then Scalezz told
    us, &#147;You have camped this for two days, while I have only been here for about 6
    hours. I think you should have it.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It was a generous offer, too generous for us
    to take with out some offer in return. &#147;We will stay and see that you get one as well
    Scalezz.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Take it El,&#148; Scalezz&nbsp; told
    me. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I approached the body. I lifted the lifeless
    hand, and removed the huge ring and placed it on my wrist. At long last the Ring of the
    Ancients was mine.</font><img src="images/island6.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Evenstarr returned to the island shortly
    after and joined our group. We waited through several more pops. Evenstarr went fishing
    and caught a pair of soggy sandals. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Can I have those?&#148; Scalezz asked. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;You are joking,&#148; he said. &#147;To
    wear?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Yes.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Good lord!&#148; Sarenia stammered and went
    to inspect Scalezz. &#147;No shoes or gloves!&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">With plenty of people to hold the camp I returned
    to my bank where I had ingredients for Gem Inlaid Gauntlets, and using my gate spells
    quickly completed the quest and gave Scalezz the gloves. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>&#147;The boots you will have soon
    enough.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Again time dragged on. It was 8:30 at night
    before the AC showed up again. We killed him and Sarenia told Scalezz to loot. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;But you don&#146;t have yours
    yet!&#148; the Iksar said in shock.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;I will be happier if you get a
    pair,&#148; Sarenia told her. &#147;I would hate to think we dragged you here and tortured
    you for 10 hours and you had nothing to show for it. It is getting late and we all need to
    sleep, and I want you to have it.&#148;</font><img src="images/island8.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="240"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Scalezz thanked Sarenia heartily, and looted
    the ring. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;Excuse me,&#148; Evenstarr said.
    &#147;Would any of you be willing to stay and help me get mine? I can&#146;t solo
    him.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We were all surprised. Evenstarr was a 57<sup>th</sup>
    level ranger. But he was right, we had seen him in battle doing only 11 and 12 damage.
    Exhausted we nevertheless agreed to stick around for a while hoping he would get help to
    replace us. We stayed with him until 10:00pm, but now we were totally wiped out and we bid
    Evenstarr farewell and goodluck. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>(On a side note, the next morning we
    logged in to find Kiross camping the AC. &#147;what are you doing here?&#148; Sarenia
    asked. &#147;Did Evenstarr get his ring?&#148;</font></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;This is Evenstarr,&#148; he
    replied weakly. &#147;I am using his character to hunt.&#148;</font></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;What time is it where you
    are?&#148;</font></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;4:30am,&#148; Evenstarr replied in
    a horse voice. &#147;God, this sucks.&#148;)</font></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>It was on Tuesday that Scalezz, Sarenia and
    I traveled to South Karana to kill the Shadowed Men to obtain the rapier needed to
    complete the quest. First we stopped at the bank and withdrew 3250 gold. Then heavily
    encumbered by the coin we waddled to the Shadowed camp and easily obtained two Shadowed
    Rapiers. We then swam through the lake of Rathe to Rathe Mountains and began the hunt for
    the source of the Jboots&#151;Hasten Bootstrutter. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We stumbled upon Mylo (Jarok), in the giant
    hills who was apparently mining platinum off the local, wealthy giants. He joined our
    group and used his track skill to survey the area, but there were no fresh signs of the
    little gnome anywhere. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;I do believe the &#145;a drakes&#146;,
    are placeholders for Hasten,&#148; Sarenia explained, so off we went killing green drakes.
    &#147;Also Madaline the Unkept, and Brother Zeptyl are also placeholders. We need to kill
    them all, except if Zepthyl pops leave him alone. He is a level 60 monk and you would need
    three groups of 55 plus to take him.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>In between drake hunts Mylo would pull a
    hill giant. The loot, as usually, was wonderful, as each giant drops 5 to 45 plat per
    kill. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;This place is great!&#148; Scalezz
    told us. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Yes, Drasus first showed it to me,&#148; I
    said, &#147;It is the land of milk and platinum.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Hehe,&#148; Mylo chuckled. &#147;Drasus and
    I were just here recently and we fought on the hill. It was very chaotic!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>As if he heard his name mentioned Drasus
    contacted me and wondered if we needed help. At the time Zephyl was up and would take some
    time to despawn so I ported to the Dreadlands and picked up Drasus. On the way back we
    crossed paths with a little gold robed NPC gnome in Lake Rathe. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Drasus paused and nudged me and winked.
    &#147;Wanna kill the little guy?&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;Humm. Why?&#148; I replied. He seemed
    harmless enough. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Alas I had forgotten Drasus was an evil follower
    of Cazic-Thule. &#147;For fun.&#148; He replied.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I conned the little guy blue and seeing no reason
    not too replied, &#147;Well, ok.&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I began to cast a spell and the next thing I
    remember was being revived by a beautiful cleric, which Drasus had called. He felt very
    guilty despite the fact that it wasn&#146;t his fault. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>At the same time things had gone badly in
    the nearby mountains. Mylo had logged briefly and in that time Scalezz and Sarenia had
    challenged five hill giants to a fight. Scalezz died in the encounter.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>At last we were all untied in Giant Valley,
    Scalezz, Sarenia, Mylo, Drasus and myself, and we proceeded to lay waste to the area
    killing anything that moved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mylo continued
    to kept an eye out for signs of Hasten. It took longer than expected and with each loot,
    Scalezz and I got heavier. There were some close calls which made it exciting, but soon we
    were itching to find the elusive gnome. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;We aren&#146;t getting anywhere with
    the quest,&#148; Mylo told us, &#147;But I&#146;m having a blast!&#148;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Mylo spotted tracks made by Madiline the
    Unkept and off we went as a team running behind Mylo like dogs on a scent. We found and
    killed her. It was now midnight and still no hasten. It was back to giants killing when
    suddenly&#151;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;HASTEN! FOLLOW!&#148; came the two
    barked shouts from Mylo and off he ran. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>All across the zone came shouts of
    &#147;Hasten&#146;s up!&#148; as people who knew our quest began to sound off. Being too
    encumbered to move fast Scalezz and I soon lost Mylo who was intent on finding and hailing
    Hasten to nail him down. Mylo caught the little bugger and shouted out the location.
    Scalezz and I waddled slowly wandering around trying to find the rest of our party. At
    long last we found the group clustered around a little gnome dressed in black. His name
    was Hasten Bootstrutter. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I hailed him but he offered no key words, so
    holding my breath I cleared a space in my inventory, handed him 3250 gold, a Shadowed
    Rapier, and the Ring of the Ancients, and closing my eyes pressed the trade&#133;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Tat da da daaa!</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Such a wonderful sound rang in my ears. I
    looked<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>down and there they were the Jboots.
    Scalezz arrived and did the same. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&#147;WE HAVE THE BOOTS!!&#148; I shouted to the
    zone.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Slipping them on my weary feet I fired them
    off. They left a streak of red sparks behind and while running I fired them off a few more
    times, casting with them is instantaneous.Then Scalezz and I did the Dance of Joy around
    the others, and thanked everyone involved. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We punted and ported everyone back to where
    they needed to go and called it a night. It was 1:00am. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>And so ended the greatest and longest
    quest-adventure Sarenia and I have ever endeavored to make. And I would now like to extend
    my deep gratitude to those who assisted us in this trial, and let them know I won&#146;t
    forget them and that I could never have achieved the boots with out their assistance and
    aid. So here&#146;s a toast to Sarenia, Scalezz, Drukenpuinch, Masive, Mylo, Drasus and
    Brumael (who though not a guildy did stay to help despite exhaustion.) Thank you
