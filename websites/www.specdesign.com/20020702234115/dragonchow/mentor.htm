          to be a Caster at a Raid</font></font><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          by Teroth</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99CCCC"><br>
          <i>&quot;Watch Aggro!&quot; - Yeah, right!</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a caster, you 
          have the power to kill swiftly. You have the ability to lower the mob's 
          abilities and boost your allies abilities to an insane degree. You can 
          Buff/Debuff/Heal/Nuke/DoT your way to major aggro in a very very short 
          period of time. You also have the worst hitpoints and AC in the game. 
          So how do we balance this? Not an easy task, here are some things to 
          remember when raiding and aggro is a problem.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Baubbles. This 
          summoned item from a Mage is invaluable to managing hate at a raid. 
          Trying two identical raids, the only difference being the Baubble, Teroth 
          discovered how important this item can become. using the same spell 
          timing with the same spells, on the same mobs, teroth took damage at 
          one raid and didn't at the other. Care to guess which one he didn't 
          take the damage on? Several Manaskin/Steelskin spells into the one without 
          the Baubble it was quite apparant that this one item can turn the tide 
          on hate. Make sure you get your mage to summon one, or you will have 
          hate issues.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Timing. Slow? 
          Malo? Tash? Cripple? Snare? Misc necro Spells? All high hate spells 
          that require expert timing to land without getting whacked. If you are 
          getting hit, you cast too early. It is as simple as that. &quot;But 
          if I wait until the mob is at half we will never see experience.&quot; 
          Too bad. Raids are not about experience-and caster groups at raids with 
          a Necro landing his DoT's right can still see experience without deaths(See 
          Teroth's group for the last several raids.) Wait until the resistance 
          debuff is called out (which we should see more of) before casting your 
          high hate spells, so that they are more likely to land, and thus avoiding 
          the added hate of a recast.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Pets. Sometimes 
          pets are not appropriate. Depend on your pet for a good portion of your 
          damage? Gonna have to bite the bullet on this one and go without at 
          least until the raiding party is stationary - for some raids, you are 
          to never make a pet. &quot;Why?! My pet does so much to help!&quot; 
          He also cons much lower then you. The reason there are level restrictions 
          on raids is usually about aggro ranges. Your pet most likely falls under 
          this level restriction for any raid you will go on. If you are allowed 
          a pet and he disappears on you...Camp! Camp fast and announce it to 
          the Raid Leader. Necros can FD and go linkdead - the rest should just 
          camp right away. When that pet dies, whatever he ticked off is coming 
          looking for you. If you are planted in the middle of the raiding party, 
          this will most likely spell W-I-P-E-O-U-T.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Spell Stacking. 
          When your spells don't take hold, find out what is conflicting. Odds 
          are your are flip flopping with another caster on his or her line of 
          spells. The mana gets spent in full when the spell does not take hold, 
          and not even Specialization lowers the cost. It can be pretty costly 
          to have half your casters wasting 300-400 mana every fight. With the 
          added component of Disease to slow spells, this makes stacking any other 
          Disease based spell trickier.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Resists. When 
          a mob resists your spell, DO NOT CHAIN CAST UNTIL IT LANDS! Call out 
          a resist and wait for the aggro to shift again before casting. Casting 
          Slow on a mob 5 times in a row is a sure way to hold the aggro and die. 
          That is right. I said DIE. Casters survivability in an up close and 
          personal encounter with a Raid level mob...well I think we have all 
          figured that out the hard way at least once.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. DO NOT RUN. Casters 
          who get aggro'd and run endanger the whole raiding party. No one person 
          is so vital to the success of a well built raid that his death will 
          cause a wipeout. If you run, you can pick up adds. Adds return to the 
          raiding party and will most likely kill them, or in the least cause 
          more deaths. Our instincts tell us to cut and run when being attacked 
          for 250 points of damage, but dying on the spot is better then causing 
          adds - ANY day of the week. High level rezzes make the recovery from 
          such a death minor, so take your medicine and use what you learned about 
          the timing of your spells when you return to the raid. Short of the 
          Invulnerability spells from a Necro or Cleric, Rune spells and the Shieldskin 
          counterparts are invaluable to keeping you alive - once. Do not recast 
          while being swung at. These are all major taunt spells, because seemingly 
          mobs hate it when they cannot do damage to you. Invulnerability works 
          like an Evade and the mob will shift aggro, just wait the full duration 
          of the spell or you may get hit again and that spell will not be available 
          for quite a while. </font></p>

          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">1. Learned awhile 
          ago that Tashan is a high argo spell - who would have thought. But of 
          course it is needed so that other spells land so what do you do??? Do 
          you cast it get an argo then wait for fighters to get the argo back? 
          Do you wait until a certain amount of hits points are gone than throw 
          it - say 1 bub of health? I assume you should notify the group once 
          the Tashan has landed - should they not cast until it does in order 
          to avoid lots of failures?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">2. How does memory 
          blur and reoccuring amenisia play in? I've been scared to use memory 
          blur since it seems like the idea is for Radalas to work really hard 
          at gaining the argo and I don't want to wipe the slate clean so that 
          his hard work becomes undone. Reoccuring amensia clears the hate list 
          every 6 seconds. Is using these a good or a bad thing? I've<br>
          often thought I should throw a memory blur and since Radalas is out 
          front doing the big damage dealing that he will immediately jump to 
          the front of the list. Do I throw it only when someone who should not 
          have the argo gets it - say a <br>
          shaman or a cleric? Do I throw it all the time or do I never throw it? 
          Enquiring minds want to know. <br>

          <br>
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
          1. Tash line spells - Tash has the most effect when the mob is being 
          cast on, so if the casters are holding for the assist call or half life 
          you should be in no hurry to land this right away. Since I don't have 
          the same line of spells some of this is from the outside looking in. 
          I would first try waiting for the assist call. At this point the mob 
          has been well taunted and, and the Tash shouldn't pull the mob onto 
          you. If it does, just grin and take the damage till the next successful 
          taunt from the main assist. This will kick him to the top of the hate 
          list and you should be fine.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">2. Aggro will happen, 
          but the goal is to lose the aggro right away. In one raid, Teroth was 
          summoned by 12 mobs in a row and took no damage. The reason he took 
          no damage, is that by the time he was summoned the main assist had taunted 
          his way back to the top of the hate list. I think in one instance I 
          went invulnerable because I was expecting the hate (5 dots will do that 
          ;b ) but I took that into account when I started casting and had a plan 
          to evade. In some cases I will run at the main assist when I know I 
          will have aggro, so he stays in range for taunt. Just try not to pull 
          the mob around too much or the tanks cannot taunt it off of you. Trust 
          the taunt. Love the taunt.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">3. Mem blur spells 
          - at a raid, not a good idea in my opinion. This is a great line of 
          spells for avoiding a fight, but in the case of heated raid level combat 
          it is bad - very very bad. Here is why: DoT's become the top of the 
          Hate List. Evade from the rogue is negated at the point of blur. Taunts 
          are forgotten. Recurring Amnesia+DoT death=no loot. That is right. DoT 
          kills that yield no death are always the reult of a mem wipe or aggro 
          wipe. As long as I appear on his hate list, I will have a corpse to 
          loot. As soon as the list is empty and he dies from an existing spell 
          effect the corpse disappears. Here is the problem (and I think that 
          VI can fix this if they would just bother to,) DoT damage and death 
          comes before hate. This means that the mob will die before the DoT puts 
          me back on the hate list. As a result, the mob just dies outside of 
          combat - which yields no corpse to loot. They have corrected the pure 
          DoT kill bug, where the corpse was popping unless melee damage or DD 
          spell damage was done - but not in the case of one tick before death 
          the mob gets mind wiped.</font></p>

          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">A big thing that 
          Teroth didn't mention which most of us just natural understand and accept 
          is that Shammies, Enchanters and Bards DIE. We die a lot, more so Shammies 
          and Chanters as Bards (those bastards) get to wear some HP+ armor :P 
          Course Bards are mostly useless til they get Occlusion of Sound at 55 
          but :P </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Folks used to ask 
          me why as a Shammy I didn't have more Wis Armor than AC armor and my 
          answer was so I don't get hurt so much when I get hit and so I can cast 
          thru being hit. This is also why at certain times you swap out to resist 
          armor for when the AE spells are doing a lot more damage then melee 
          on you. AC or Resist is your friend not just that extra Wis or Int. 
          +1 Wis/Int = 10 more mana till post 200. What can you do with that 10 
          more mana if you are Dead?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">The bottom line 
          as a caster or any class is Managing Your Aggro which is a matter of 
          judging WHEN to cast your spells and knowing what sort of heat you are 
          going to draw.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Does Mob X really 
          need a Tash, Malo or Slow? or are the tanks taking it down without it? 
          Sometimes casting it on every mob is just a pointless drain of mana 
          as if you get a weird uber pop you are now useless no?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Did the spell bounce 
          twice? is it really needed or is it a luxury? Do I think it will stick 
          the next time because if not, don't bother.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">An Enchanters primary 
          debuff is Tash, but the first spell cast after the Mob is pulled is 
          going to be Malo or more likely Slow from a Shammy. If Slow sticks Golden, 
          if not Shammy is gonna try a Malo on it during which beat or between 
          the beats you can pop a Tash as the Shammy or main Assist is gonna own 
          the Hate List. Your Tash bounced? No Problem a second or two after it 
          lands the Shammy or Main tank gonna re own the Mob as long as you don't 
          pull it away from them. Take a hit and back away a step, the mob should 
          turn back to the main Assist. Taking that step or two back generally 
          moves you out of the 'I am standing closest to Mob' aggro as well as 
          that not insignificant spell aggro you just dropped on it. If you survive 
          the next blow step away again, if you haven't lost aggro by the second 
          step then stand still and pray a heal is incoming. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Tash, however, is 
          primarily for those after half Health Nukes that kill the mob before 
          it CH's or Heals itself or before it Gates. Rarely is it MUST have but 
          in those instances KNOW you are gonna own some hate and pray that your 
          support healers can keep you alive. These instances are generally Boss 
          / Uber Mobs and remember that the 2 or 3 main Tash / Malo folks are 
          all gonna be chain casting it til it sticks so aggro wont stay long.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Mem Blur is an interesting 
          and dangerous thing. As Teroth said DoT's don't go away though the Hate 
          List does and if the DoT's kill it the Servers treat it as an NPC killed 
          by an NPC leave no corpse kill. Mem Blur is for those critters you are 
          Mezzing and Parking. Mezz, Root, Mem Blur or Mezz Mem Blur. Generally 
          if the critter is still close to the main mob it will look for Social 
          Assist and attack on the Main Mob Hate List, but sometimes it just looks 
          for 'Closest Tidbit to Me' Aggro. Sometimes, however, it will path back 
          and grab friends and sometimes it will assist main and call for friends 
          on the /social Aggro chat channel. This might mean a call on the Z-axis 
          which means above or below you as the Server does not check Line of 
          Sight on Monsters just on players. If a critter is within the set x,y 
          range then it MIGHT assist. However this is why you play a chanter ehh? 
          You wanted to learn these things and play crowd controller :P Nothing 
          to see here move along.. that spot well it was a chanter :P</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">So you dropped a 
          high aggro spell and wanna DIE? Sit down IMMEDIATELY. Yeppers you might 
          have lost that aggro back to the Main Assist or the next Nuker but heck 
          sit down and teacher will call on you again. Sitting down is treated 
          by the server as a major modifier to the hate list. This is why we don't 
          sit on pulls and why you should stand for a few seconds or rounds after 
          you cast that Call on Me Next spell.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">And finally, if 
          you drop below a full bubble of Health you might be standing but you 
          are DEAD. If you are a healer and heal yourself well hopefully when 
          you get hit as the heal lands it will leave you above a Bubble so that 
          the Hate list will get checked again for who is next otherwise expect 
          that LOADING PLEASE WAIT... You did train Bind Wounds didn't you? because 
          that does NOT get treated by the server as sitting down and at 201 you 
          can bind for 100 points up to 70% of your Health or at least 50 points 
          up to 50% of your Health at 200.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Klothe</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
          ps: I figured I should mention a trick we debuffers use when no one 
          is looking. Its called using a lower level version of the spell getting 
          it to land then getting a higher level version to stick. Malosi 175 
          mana -60 resists, Malaisement 100 mana -37 resists, Malaise 60 mana 
          -15 resists which means 4 casts or 7 casts or 11 casts for the same 
          amount of mana wasted. Or lead off with Malaisement if it bounces once 
          and lands the 2nd time its about the cost of one Malosi which is now 
          likelier to stick now. I only revert to this when absolutely necessary 
          as most resists are level based not resistance based sadly , but it 
          is a viable trick. Course this is where having a bard around is handy 
          as they are on 6 second pulses for the resist debuff songs if they take 
          at all :P </font><br>

        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Call of the Hero 
          is not allowed in this zone, but summon corpse is. This means that there 
          is a more expensive way to get someone to the deeper part of the zone 
          without keys then a simple CoH chain. This will take a camp out cleric 
          parked at the zone (or a volunteer to take a ride with the wizard when 
          he goes to pick up the late comers.) A necromancer with Conjure Corpse 
          (preferred for the stackability of the coffins and price as well.) The 
          Wizard for rides in (of course.) and finally a rezzing cleric with the 
          raiding party.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The group should 
          be made of the Wizard, Necro, and if needed the cleric for zone in rezzes. 
          When given notice that it is time to pick up more, the Wizard leads 
          the group and invites the Necro (and if need be the Cleric.) The Wizard 
          jumps down to EFP and picks up the passenger(s) before porting to PoA. 
          At this point the cleric should also ride along if not parked at the 
          zone in already. The passengers will need to die at the Zone In island. 
          Do not duel, as this could aggro the Quest hall. Do not use AoE spells, 
          as this could aggro the Quest hall. Do not attack the Keymaster, as 
          moving him out of place can fubar the ability to get keys from him for 
          the Quest Hall. Go tap on a fairie and take your hits like a trooper. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you die, the 
          rez should be incoming as you finish zoning. Once rezzed to Island one, 
          you will need to leave your corpse available for summoning. You can 
          either leave something on the corpse, or you can &#145;freeze&#146; 
          it there. Freezing requires that you loot your corpse of all items and 
          stay in the loot screen until it times out. Do not hit the Esc key, 
          or the Done button. Just sit there and touch nothing until you automatically 
          stand up. This is another good reason not to duel. If you duel, your 
          rez timer may not be long enough for this screen to timeout. Once timed 
          out, consider your corpse (&#145;c&#146; &#145;/con&#146; or right-click) 
          and notice how the rot timer continues but the rez timer does not. Now 
          you have a corpse that can be summoned again and again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once your corpse 
          is ready to be summoned, the Necro who has been hiding in your group 
          this whole time will summon your corpse to the raiding party. A cleric 
          there will rez you and you will join the party. This is what is known 
          as &#147;Ghetto CoH&#148;. The cost of the compoinent to port to Air, 
          and the coffin combine to almost 100pp if you travel alone, so timeliness 
          and ownership of keys is very important if you wish to vist here often.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFCCFF">Keys 
          to PoA</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Keys have recently 
          stopped rotting the moment you zone out of the Plane of Air. As a result, 
          you can now collect and save your keys for future use. Keys up to Island 
          4 require only a single good group to obtain them. Though the more the 
          merrier, getting these four keys will help you in the long run. I recommend 
          getting them when you get the chance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Island 1, you 
          have the choice to go to the Nobles, the Quest Hall, or Island 2. The 
          key to each of these places can be bought from the Keymaster. Since 
          fighting on Island 1 can mess up the ability to zone safely in if you 
          aggro the Quest Hall, just buy the key to Island 2. Obtaining a key 
          from Islands 2 and up requires killing the main mob and turning in a 
          specific Nodrop piece that drops off of all of the island&#146;s Mobs. 
          When you kill the main mob, Sirran the Lunatic will spawn in his place. 
          Hand Sirran the key loot and get the key to the next island.</font></p>
        <p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFCCFF">Sirran 
          the Lunatic</font></p>
        <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sirran will make 
          or break your trip to PoA. He quad hits for 2000+ and will aggro everyone 
          he sees once you tick him off. Hails or anything else in the /say channel 
          may provoke him, so it is best to not use Hails or say anything in the 
          /say mode the whole time you are in Air.</font></p>
