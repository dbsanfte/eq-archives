    Beginnings<o:p></o:p>...</span></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It began
    long ago, over a year in fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I emerged from
    my initiation as a Necromancer with the fire of adventure burning in my soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After my meeting with The Harbringer, I ran to the
    Field of Bone to seek my fortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though you
    may think my eagerness foolish, I had but a few meals worth of supplies and would need
    restocking soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With not even a pet to aid
    me, I struck out against the vermin that threaten to infest Cabilis even as I draft this
    bit of history. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Scaled wolf pups, scorpions,
    and spiders of varying sizes fell at my whim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Around
    5<sup>th</sup> level, an odd thing happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
    Iksar Warrior, handed me a ring that increased my intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thanked him for his gift, but was unaware of the
    value of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To say my experience with such
    things was limited would be an understatement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    encounter with anonymous generosity has stuck with me to this day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It was
    when I reached 6<sup>th</sup> level that a monk named <a href="bioswifthand.htm" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Swifthand</a> noticed me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Through some connection in another life, he was compelled to give me guidance and
    support.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave me a tunic made from flayed
    wurm skin to wear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though hardly proper
    attire for a Necromancer, this tunic was special.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    afforded me an extra spell and absorbed damage when taken, while allowing me some
    protection from being struck at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I
    progressed through the levels, Swifthand handed me more items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A pair of earrings and a face mask that I still
    wear to this day, some bracelets that boosted my magic and enhanced my body&#146;s
    durability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>One rainy
    day in the Field of Bone, I found myself lost amongst the trees and wandered into a new
    area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Emerald Jungle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The jungle seemed inviting at first, despite the
    gloominess that tree cover provided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little
    was I to know that I would have my first encounter with&#133; A DRAGON!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His presence alone was enough to make my scales
    crawl, even before I knew why they did so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
    someone had ticked off this mighty being and ran right past me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I turned from watching his fleeing backside, I
    was face to face with IT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A mighty roar and I
    was facing Cazic Thule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With an air of
    amusement, The Faceless one threw me back to the world of the living, where I found myself
    naked and without spells at my disposal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I
    retraced my steps as best as I could and found the jungle again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not long before I was able to locate my
    former body and retrieve the gear and treasure I had amassed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time I had no idea how significant tNext
    stop was the acquisition of maps and learning to sense the direction I was headed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was also the reason for my addiction to SoW
    potions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though I have sought counseling for
    this problem, I have been told that the only true cure is the acquisition of a might steed
    to carry me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Soon I was
    travelling all over Kunark in search of adventure and treasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Making Kurn&#146;s Tower my own, I rapidly outgrew
    those hunting grounds and moved on to The Lake of Ill Omen, Warsilk&#146;s Woods and The
    Overthere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually Dalnir became my new
    home, and I spent 7 glorious levels hunting there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
    I outgrew Dalnir, it was on to the adventure of a new continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon I was an expert at traversing the long
    distance between Kunark and Vellious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave
    many a tour of the route to Thurgadin, where the dwarves are hesitant with outsiders but
    grant them the benefit of the doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
    continued obsession with hunting Giants for sport yeilded me a great legend among these
    dwarves, and a certain notoriety with the Giants themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently, my legend has spread to the dragons of
    Skyshrine, and I am now welcome to visit there anytime I like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>THE GUILD<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I was sitting
    at the bank in Cabilis, celebrating my promotion to 20<sup>th</sup> level when I received
    a summons from Swifthand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;Meet me in
    the Field of Bone, your destiny awaits.&#148;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    turned out that Swifthand had belonged to a guild named &#147;The Plaguebringers&#148; and
    had left due to some internal issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
    looking to form a new guild, but lacked the discipline to keep track of everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told him I would be glad to help, and quickly
    created tools to keep track of everyone and their abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our numbers swelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Soon, I
    recruited the druid called Hangs (alt) to act as my emissary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His ability to travel the realms was much greater
    then mine, so he was granted officer status to act strictly at my instruction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He eventually gave up adventuring altogether and
    is now serving as my broker, as well as emissary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Since then, I
    have seen the guild roster swell and diminish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members
    were leaving to join battle with others of their level of ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were after the big treasures and DC just
    wasn&#146;t up to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, my reaction
    was to be insulted by this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How would we ever
    be able to gather enough power to go on these grand adventures if everyone left the guild
    once they reached a high enough level?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon I
    came to realize that life is like that sometimes, and getting stuck in a rut is normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did not begrudge them their thirst for bigger
    adventures.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Many times the roster seemed
    full enough to begin organizing some larger scale adventures of our own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every time, more members left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The important thing to remember is &#147;Once a
    Chow, always a Chow.&#148;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Former members
    like Angyl and Kappaphi constantly invited Chow members to band together with them in
    adventure and kept their ties with the guild strong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Though their affiliations outside of Dragonchow change, they keep coming
    back to the fold. I am still unsure which friends I have made because of Dragonchow or
    which Dragonchow members became my friends first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Other members
    offered to improve upon the tools I had already created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>When Klothe joined us, we gained a trade skill junkie who also wished to add
    some organization to the guild, despite the constant trickle of members to other guilds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About this time, I became a bit disillusioned with
    the concept of truly large Dragonchow raids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    legend of Dragonchow has grown throughout Norrath, and even to the far reaches of
    Vellious. I was at a retreat for Iksar Heretics, which was great, when I received a
    message from Swifthand that a merger was being discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Radalas was interested in not only joining the two guilds under the name
    Dragonchow, but was ready to start leading raids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I attended a
    Kael raid with Radalas and was impressed with his ability to keep things moving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next was Siren&#146;s Grotto, where I not only
    enjoyed the raid, but managed to walk away with some nice gear myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A couple more Kael raids followed, and now my
    dream of being able to walk among the dragons of Skyshrine unchallenged has become a
    reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dragonchow is now ready to fulfill
    its destiny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">THE STUDENT AND
    THE TEACHER<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">As an officer,
    recruitment was within my purview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I took
    recruitment seriously, since I did not wish to be associated with the wrong sort of
    people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I happened upon a young Necromancer,
    some 4 or 5 levels below my own about the time I started hunting giants for sport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had many questions, and seemed very likable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I soon invited him to join Dragonchow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">When I received
    a message from Swifthand that he had acquired some new jewelry and would like to trade for
    some Forest Loops I had acquired, I instructed him to give the jewelry to young Jarok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though I needed one of the items to complete my
    set, I saw that Jarok was more in need then myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    was rapidly approaching the point where I could get those items on my own anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jarok flourished, and soon passed me by in
    ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His talent and determined nature
    proved more then worthy of the faith I had in him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
    this day, my investment in him has continued to pay off in friendship and support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">PERSONAL
    PHILOSOPHY<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I find life
    comes easier when you make the lives around you easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>When someone gives me his/her friendship, I find that I am unable to not
    help them out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I talk to and adventure with
    my friends because they are my friends, not because of what they can do for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I take every opportunity available to me to
    benefits my friends, sometimes at a cost to my own progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though I look forward to achieving 60<sup>th</sup>
    level, it will come in time and rushing the trip takes away from the journey.<o:p></o:p></span></td>
