    <p><big><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1 Everything is camped. <br>
    2 Your corpse will always end up halfway inside a mountain, nowhere in sight of the roads,
    or under a tree. <br>
    3 The skeleton in front of you is there to distract you from the kodiak approaching behind
    you. <br>
    4 If your attack is going really well, you are in an ambush. <br>
    5 If the MOBs are within range, so are you. <br>
    6 The tougher MOBs invariably attack on two occasions:&gt; when they're ready. when you're
    not.<br>
    7 One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely too many. <br>
    8 The MOB is not retreating; it's just going to get its friends. <br>
    9 The MOBs you never encounter when armed and buffed always appear during your corpse run.
    <br>
    10 The MOB you've been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after you leave. <br>
    11 Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people to attack. <br>
    12 Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last, and don't ever volunteer to do
    anything. <br>
    13 For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. <br>
    14 The greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a&gt; plan. <br>
    15 When the going gets tough, the tank gets linkdead. <br>
    16 A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long. <br>
    17 Your buffs will fade when you need them the most. <br>
    18 Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. Whenever you are low on mana, every
    spell fizzles. <br>
    19 When in doubt, gate. <br>
    20 There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br>
    21 The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to how good it looks
    on you. <br>
    22 The item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br>
    23 The item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br>
    24 The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you were offline. <br>
    25 The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who didn't know the
    definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br>
    26 The item you'll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br>
    28 The item you accidentally drop will be the most valuable/powerful/important item you
    carry. <br>
    29 If you can afford it, it's not for sale. <br>
    30 If you want two of them, it's a Lore item. <br>
    31 If you want to sell it, it's a No Drop item. <br>
    32 The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as PMS. Coincidence? <br>
    33 Even greens kill. <br>
    34 Backstab means never having to say you're sorry. <br>
    35 A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br>
    36 Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br>
    37 Trains have the right of way. <br>
    38 If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid. <br>
    39 The guards are never there when you need them. <br>
    40 The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly proportional to your eagerness
    to log on. <br>
    41 No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a twink. <br>
    42 Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest bidder. <br>
    43 A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does it in the Kelethin
    treetops. <br>
    44 Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature's way of telling you to slow down. <br>
    45 Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br>
    46 The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion you are just by
    looking at you. <br>
    47 Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the pig joke when
    someone asked for a SOW. <br>
    48 Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last names. <br>
    49 The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br>
    50 It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; spelled
    backwards.<br>

    <font size="3"><p>So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of
    a sudden I see the message &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;. </p>
    <p>Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb
    (hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly
    informed at best. Boy was I ever wrong. I switch out of 1st person into an external
    camera, and what did my wandering eyes behold? Only myself and the petitioner. So I says
    to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; </p>
    <p>(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like There I was, in skeleton form,
    carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown
    skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid
    or a shaman.) </p>
    <p>I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; </p>
    <p>Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot;
    (um..pardon..I meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;) This is where I discovered the
    &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? There's NO WAY IN
    CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard,
    right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl. Well, needless to say, I
    couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly
    begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best to deal with
    this tricky situation. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;. </p>
    <p>Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped
    up! I couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you
    dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole&quot; </p>
    <p>Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;what are they&quot; </p>
    <p>Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... Petitioner asks, &quot;can
    you buff my hps my hp sux&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you
    would probably want.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me dick&quot; </p>
    <p>Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. I say, &quot;Why do you need a
    sow?&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my
    level&quot; </p>
    <p>Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;?&quot; Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key
    conveniently located nearby other various and sundry communication facilitators. </p>
    <p>I didn't answer him. </p>
    <p>He repeats, &quot;??&quot; </p>
    <p>Found it twice...good for him. </p>
    <p>He repeats, &quot;???&quot; </p>
    <p>Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. I say, &quot;You are
    NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple
    of months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;?&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;!&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;?&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;,&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;wtf&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;????&quot; </p>
    <p>I don't respond. </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; He lost the question mark button
    again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his feet. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since
    they began randomizing zone locations.&quot; My guild is hysterical at this point. And I
    haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. Just snippets. </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;@#$% I just got off the boat&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says &quot;why&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation
    spells.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; </p>
    <p>I nod. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by
    color.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;thx&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when I got this char&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;why&quot; Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair,
    guy. Mixed in with your collection of boogers. </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; </p>
    <p>He says, &quot;oh&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; </p>
    <p>He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. He
    says, &quot;yeah&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; </p>
    <p>Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. </p>
    <p>A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes I still haven't heard from him. Getting
    curious I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; No reply. No reply at all. [Yes,
    I'm a Genesis fan... ] Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. I tell
    petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do I go.&quot; Right idea....wrong punctuation
    mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. </p>
    <p>I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense
    Heading'?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;no&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; It was a
    guess, but an educated one. </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;found it&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;north&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path
    turns north. When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;ok&quot; Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked
    his Felwithe faction up. </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;sumbody told me I shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; </p>
    <p>Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some
    trouble, just keep running.&quot; </p>
    <p>Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. </p>
    <p>A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was
    expecting. I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; As if I didn't know.... </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;east wtf???&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;?&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;how can I tell&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 'You
    have entered [zone]'.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; </p>
    <p>After smacking my head against my monitor.... </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;. </p>
    <p>Get this.... He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; </p>
    <p>I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse
    back.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot; </p>
    <p>/ignore petitioner </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>THE CLERIC'S TALE</strong></font></p>
    <font size="3"><p>Here comes some idiot Dark Elf running past me, running straight down
    the road that is going to lead him to Felwithe. I scratch my head, and being the nosey
    sort of Dwarf that I am...I send him a tell. I tell the DE, &quot;Wait&quot; </p>
    <p>DE tells me, &quot;?&quot; </p>
    <p>I sigh into my ale as I take another longt draught off of it before running up to him
    and saying, &quot;Ye really don't wanna go messin around over there with them High Elves'
    They look like pansies, but they aint.&quot; </p>
    <p>The DE stands there with a vacant look on his face for a few minutes before just
    running away. Do a /who on the DE and find out he's 31st level. Ok, so maybe he knows what
    he's doing. I've seen Ogres in North Freeport, after all. I go back to drinking my ale.
    Out of curiosity, I send him another tell a few minutes later. I tell the DE, &quot;Not
    gettin' into any trouble over there are ye?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE tells me, &quot;STFU !@#$% roleplayer&quot; </p>
    <p>I sigh into my ale again, finishing it off. Ah, tis the season of the twit. I stand up
    and head towards Felwithe to resupply my ale. Just as I get to the gates of the ugliest
    city on Norrath, what do I find but a dead dark elf and a pair of guards snickering and
    cleaning their weapons. Now this is priceless. I do a /who on the poor soul and see he is
    in Burning Woods. Being the sucker that I am, I feel compelled to rez the twit...after
    all, I am a !@#$% roleplayer and I roleplay a !@#$% cleric...albeit a !@#$% grumpy one. I
    sit down to mem Reviviscene and while I am waiting for it to refresh I send the DE a tell.
    I tell the DE, &quot;Would ye like a rez?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE tells me, &quot;no i want a !@#$% sow dumbas i have to run south to get my corpse
    back so dont be a dick and just sow me plz&quot; </p>
    <p>I look around for an ale but unfortunatly Brell hates me at this moment in time, so I
    simply reply. &quot;If I rez ya, ye wont need to run south to yer body. You will appear at
    yer body. I am not standing near you, I am standing near yer corpse.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE tells me, &quot;d00d rez plz&quot; </p>
    <p>As I sigh I look at my Holy Symbol of Brell and sigh &quot;I'm gonna get a stout named
    after me right?&quot; and I tell the DE &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; but I get
    no reply. No reply at all. So I say it again &quot;Consent me so I can rez ya&quot; </p>
    <p>DE tells me, &quot;ok you can rez me&quot; </p>
    <p>I sit down again at this point. I have no ale and this is gonna take awhile. I tell the
    DE, &quot;Type /consent and my name&quot; Being a smart dwarf I tell the DE,
    &quot;/consent Cleric_01&quot; and say again &quot;Just like that&quot; before he can make
    my head hurt more. Sure enough, I recieve consent to drag his corpse. So I stand up and
    get ready to drag the corpse when suddenly I am denied permission to drag his corpse. I
    begin to think like him and I think &quot;WTF?&quot; So I tell the DE, &quot;No...just
    type it once. One more time. That's it. Dont type it again&quot; thinking that as soon as
    I get this over with, I can go buy more ale and my head will stop hurting. I recieve
    consent and I quickly drag it towards the zone since this is the direction the guy was
    going anyway. I get the body by the zone and cast Rez on it, comforted by the fact that I
    am one heal away from being done with this guy. </p>
    <p>The naked DE appears in front of me and I stand up to cast my final spell of this
    exchange when he says to me &quot;your that !@#%% roleplayer&quot; and then a moment
    later, almost as an afterthought &quot;thx&quot; Compelled at this point, I ask &quot;Why
    were you running into Felwithe when you are KoS?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;I was going to burned woods&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Burning Woods?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;no dumbass i go there when i die i want to hunt burned woods&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Who told you to go hunting in Burned Woods, inside Felwithe?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;some dick who wouldnt sow me&quot; and then &quot;will you sow me plz,
    its for a CR&quot; </p>
    <p>I stand there drooling on myself for a moment, trying to catch up. I havent had an ale
    in a good 20 minutes at this point, so I am starting to see spots. </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;dont be a dick just sow me before they move the zone again&quot; </p>
    <p>I stare at the lad and ask &quot;Move Burned Woods? Again?&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;yea&quot; </p>
    <p>I finally snap and say, &quot;They aren't going to move it again. Once they moved it to
    Western Wastes, with all the snow, it stopped burning.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;i saw a burning tree&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Exactly my point. Now if they would only move Burning Woods there it would
    stop too and people wouldn't go there when they die.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;can you sow me, its for CR&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;sow doesnt work in IC until you get past EW and then it will work for CR's
    only until you get to WW, then ask the first person you see for sow there.&quot; I add as
    an afterthought &quot;Sometimes they look like flying blue things but they can sow&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;wtf???&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Allow me to use smaller words. You do not need a sow yet. Do what I say
    and you'll get there right away.&quot; and then &quot;Sit down and mem the spell Bind
    Affinity&quot; </p>
    <p>DE is silent for a bit and finally says &quot;its red&quot; as he is standing up </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;I am glad they covered Colors this week. Now target yourself and cast this
    spell. &quot; He just stands there for a minute, so I add &quot;it will r0ck&quot; and he
    begins to cast the spell, binding himself behind the guards at Felwithe. I feel somewhat
    better already, maybe I dont need ale. </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;it said bound&quot; and begins to giggle </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Now sit down and mem the spell Iceclad Gate. This will r0ck even
    more.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;this one is green&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;You're damn good at those colors man&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;thx&quot; </p>
    <p>When the DE stands up I say &quot;This is going to take you to Iceclad Ocean. It's an
    ocean so that's why they moved Burned Woods there....to put it out.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;what about sow&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Remember that sow wont work until you are on a CR in WW. In fact you
    actually run faster in snow if you set the RUN button to WALK. Do that now.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE says, &quot;ok&quot; </p>
    <p>I say, &quot;Now cast Iceclad Gate....the Green one. Remember to run straight out of
    where you appear and dont stop swimming until you hit Burned </p>
    <p>Woods.&quot; </p>
    <p>DE begins to cast a spell and I zone in to get my ale....remembering that the Ignore
    list cures most headaches that ale cant and feeling somewhat better about going back to
    Sebilis. </p>

    <font size="3"><p>Moral of the story EBay...Just Say No! </p>
    <p>Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened. I tell
    petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;wtf? where you been&quot; </p>
    <p>I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; </p>
    <p>My conscience somewhat eased... I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot; </p>
    <p>I scratch my head a few times. I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; </p>
    <p>He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes
    this week&quot; </p>
    <p>I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing
    shortly before my dog dialed 911. </p>
    <p>He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; </p>
    <p>That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife. Yea you may think
