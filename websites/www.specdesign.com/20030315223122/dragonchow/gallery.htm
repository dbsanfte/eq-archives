        going thru some old photos and came across this one.. my retired necro 
        dharamsala's first day meeting, medikar, enilate, and indra.. notice indra 
        not tagged into chow yet (nor was I) and about to get jumped by a pop 
        in Dalnir's drop room. note the old school pink squares around money on 
        ground too. back when the fighting baton was something to write home about, 
        and the possibilities of losing all your gear in dalnir was actually a 
        possibility. <br>
        <br>
        Heh hope you enjoy it,<br>
