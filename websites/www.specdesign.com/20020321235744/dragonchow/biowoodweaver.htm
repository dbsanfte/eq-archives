    Thistlehand- came to being in the folds of Tunare during hard times. Orcs had been
    attempting to exterminate the wood elves of Tunare for along time and due to this raging
    war was left orphaned. The druids of Tunare took this young one into their own and thus
    began his path. Trained in the ways of nature, born of a will to wander Woody as he became
    to be know left his homelands at a young age to roam wherever the winds took him. Amongst
    his roaming he came upon many a being and race, some kind and some very evil. This
    troubled the druid that such disparities existed among the peoples of Norrath that he
    try'd to help. Couldn&#146;t they all see Tunare's greatness and love? Apparently not but
    in attempts by himself to help the evils see the greatness of Tunare he was overwhelmed
    and found he needed allys to help him in his cause and he could help them after all
    wouldn&#146;t Tunare wish all beings to unite? <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This ideal brought him to an Iksar of all things, named <a href="bioswifthand.htm" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Swifthand</a>. Struck by the odd difference in this monk,
    evil by race but good in nature appealed to the druid and he had friends of similar
    nature, a sense of Tunare's will was at work here thus Woody found a home. Woodweaver is
    lvl 53 as of 1/23/02. Teasing I call him the no drop druid..think about half his gear is
    no drop now. Woody goes to most raids, fills in whatever roll is needed at the time, being
    jack of all trades, king of none..tho spell specialization is in alteration
    (heals/buffs/ports). As of late I have not been leveling very much in lue of working my
    alt char. I tired of soloing so much and druid races at high levels don&#146;t find too
    many groups that want a so-so healer when a shaman can heal the same and haste/sow or
    cleric that can super heal/rezz and ac/hp much better.</font></td>

    very unusual wing powered ship. Having just arrived in a place the shipmates called
    Firiona Vie, she was taking stock of her surroundings. Tales abound about the strange
    dragon like creatures that roamed these lands. She had thought she may have seen a few in
    the past but was drawn to find out more after all did not the Elder Spiritist Grawlf tell
    her as an full apprentice of the KatiShar she was to bring as much information of the
    changed lands of Norrath as possible. It was quite an undertaking the members of the
    KatiShar were taking. To attempt to document all the changes since the great rift pulled
    their homeland out of the actual ground of Norrath and placed it on the Luclin moon. Now,
    since the means to travel back to the ancient lands exist, all the VahlShir were busy
    trying to both prepare for what may or may not come and to learn as much as possible about
    the old races. </font><p><font face="Arial">&quot;Well its getting late&quot; Jazsire
    thought, best to find some lodging for the night. She mused over her own short life in
    relation to the great history of Norrath itself. Born of simple parents, father a pottery
    merchant and her mother, 2nd aid to the KatiShar. Jazz (as she likes to be called) only
    recently anointed apprentice now roaming for information with her parents concerned
    blessings. She opened a door to what seemed an empty hut, entered and closed the door
    behind her. </font></p>
