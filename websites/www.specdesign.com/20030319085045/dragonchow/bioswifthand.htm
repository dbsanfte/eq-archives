    Cabilis a year and a half ago. The viscous froglok slaves there were the death of him many
    a time, but eventually he made his way into the Field of Bone, and quickly developed his
    fighting skills. At lvl 5 he managed to acquire a full set of curscale armor, and he was
    very happy to be fully clothed, with armor he quested for himself! <br>
    <br>
    At lvl 24 he had mastered Field of Bone, and even the dreaded Kurn's tower, and ventured
    into the giant fort in Warsilk Woods! Oh what a dangerous and exciting place it was, and
    marvelous loot dropped off the dreaded forest giants. He soon gathered over 12 forest
    loops, a rare and wondrous earring, 2 of which he wore proudly. Even after giving several
    away to friends, he was able to sell enough to equip himself much better, he soon had a
    full set of cured silk armor, platinum black pearl jewelry, and 2 fighting batons! What an
    impressive young monk he had become, all through hard work! <br>
    <br>
    He was invited into a Kunark Guild called Plaguebringers. He was very quickly made an
    officer, and took his duties very seriously, and was a great service to the guild. But he
    had many friends outside the guild as well as many who left the guild, and after much arm
    twisting by his many friends, he formed a new guild himself, which he called <a href="history2.htm" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Dragonchow</a>! <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of the name was two-fold. The first was to remind us all that by no means are
    we the top of the food chain, that most of the creatures in this realm are able to tear us
    apart if we try and fight them alone, that is why we must work together, as a family,
    because united as one, even a mighty dragon can be destroyed! The second was as a reminder
    to himself, of the day in the Lake of Ill Omen, when a dragon appeared right out of the
    lake! (Halloween 2001 GM event) This foul beast killed Swifthand several times, but he
    went after it anyway, dragging away the corpses of those it slew so that they could regain
    their gear, feigning death at the very feet of the monster, feeling it's rank, hot breath
    upon his face and skin. Between this painful day and several unlucky encounters the
    previous day, he went from lvl 32 to lvl 30! For he knew of no cleric high enough level
    and willing to cast resurrection upon him. So the name Dragonchow is a personal reminder
    for him to keep his own humility. Since that day he has made dozens of new friends, and
    watched the guild he started flourish, as well as had several fantastic adventures, he has
    even gotten the killing blow on 2 great dragons! But alas has no dragon loot to show for
    it. He still endeavors to this day to better himself, yet keep his humility. The struggle
    continues, but he has many great friends to aid him in his battles. And it is his friends
    that he values above all other things.</font></td>
