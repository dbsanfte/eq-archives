        <p><img src="images/com.jpg" width="461" height="346"><br>
          Sunday night a handfull of Chow assisted the Prima Vi guild in part 
          of the Shaman epic. Ealdiien, Kinney and Xislitik (of Prima Vi), played 
          important roles as their fire pets were all that stood between us and 
          a fiery death. We succeed in taking down the epic mob, but it failed 
          to drop the item, the Prima Vi Shaman, I believe his name was Renoir, 
          is petitioning. Other members in attendance were: Swifthand, Macey, 
          Sarenia, Ripto, Brodda, Indra and Eldeberon.</p>

          This last weekend Leifanng obtained her epic. I wasn't there, but the 
          action took place in LOIO and resulted in a victory. Congradulations 
          Leifanng! After the Epic was won, the party moved over to Kael. </p>
        <p><b>KAEL SUNDAY</b><br>
          On Sunday Radalas led another raid on Kael. About 11 DC were on hand 
          for the raid, as was Meaolan an old AoF Associate of Radalas. The raid 
          lasted several hours, with no major problems. There were only a very 
          few deaths despite obtaining adds on more than one occasion. Another 
          successful blow against the evil Frost Giants!</p>
        <p><b>PHENO FINISHED</b><br>
          After the Kael Raid, several people we kind enough to linger in Wakening 
          Lands to help me finish my Phenofocus quest. Despite having a brief 
          problem locating the elusive genoid in question, the quest was finished 
          successfully in short order. </p>

          <br>
          We will be hosting a Chardoks Royals raid on Saturday 11am EST on 4/14. 
          Our main focus will be to hit the overking room and if we can move fast

        <p>We will need everyone level 50+'s support on this one and expect the

          of the loots that will drop are very nice items and I encurage everyone 
          to try and attend as a Chardok Royals raid is like no other raid DC 
          have done before.</p>
        <p>The main focus is to get our high level clerics (Sunu, Macey, Verdarillian) 
          with their epic cleric piece. While on our way to the king, depending 
          on the turnout we may visit the prince for a chanter epic piece but 
          this depends on the number of people attending. </p>
        <p>You will need your resist gear on this raid so please dont forget to 
          bring them with you!!! </p>

        <p><b>Kael Raid Report</b></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/kael1.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
        <p>This last Saturday morning Radalas lead another Kael raid. My first. 
        </p>
        <p>Initially the groups were: </p>
        <p>Group 1 Pull group Ghrack, Kinowin, Exavier, Swifthand, Ripto'<br>
          Group 2 Radalas, Sunu, Purti, Mllopare, Bolvi'<br>
          Group 3 (CoH group) Teroth, Ealdiien, Woodweaver, Minitanquette'<br>
          Group 4 Iilae, Eldeberon, Sarenia, Rancore'</p>
        <p>Others such as Klothe, Chaintalker and Redline joined later</p>
        <p>Some good loot was acquired, some of which was a robe Exaiver received, 
          chain leggings Purti won the roll on, a pair of leather pants, a diamond, 
          and 2 scale leggings.</p>
        <p>Sarenia and I, being the babies of the raid, and in the same group--which 
          also had the smallest number of members--I assumed we would be of little 
          help. Surprisingly, our Lilae-led group managed to gain experience on 
          several occasions. Once even while we were down to a mere party of 3, 
          due to a Linkdead member! I was therefore pleased with my performance 
          until I was asked to punt. I slipped and hit the evac gem above the 
          punt spell. My whole party appeared bewildered in South Ro. Doh! So 
          much for appearing the suave dark Erudian intellectual type</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Phenofocus Quest</b></p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/pheno.jpg" width="403" height="302"></p>
        <p>With the help of those members of the guild who remained behind after 
          the Kael raid, Sarenia was able to complete her Phenofocus quest. After 
          taking down three giants in Wakening Lands she obtained a Phenofocus: 
          (AC 5, Int 10, Mana 40, Char 5, Dex 3, Sv Magic 5, Sv Poison 3, Sv Dis 
          3, Sv Fire 3, Sv Cold 3). She almost lost her chance when she got turned 
          around in the forest and wandered lost while the loot timer was counting 
          down. Our friendly wolf Rancore saved the day by tracking her and leading 
          her back. Good boy Rancore, you deserve a scooby snack.</p>

        <p><img src="images/old.jpg" width="403" height="302"> </p>
        <p>After Oldive came to the rescue of Sarenia who died in Lake Rathe, 
          Sarenia and Eldeberon attempted to assist him with the first part of 
          his Epic. After fighting multiple dangerous goblins, deep underwater, 
          in near total darkness for hours, Oldive went LD. Sar and El continued 
          the fight for about 45 minutes. Then with fish scales running out, and 
          still no sign of Oldive, sad to say, we ported out. We wish you better 
          luck next time. <br>

          ac was going up around 3 or 4 points with every 1 point of defense raised. 
          She got over 50 ac there and wants to go back again lol.</p>
        <p>The spot is in the Grimling Forest Acrylia Caves on Luclin, right at 
          the zone line to the yet uncharted (by Freyana anyway) Acrylia Caverns 
          dungeon...50+ and dangerous for exploring without a group I'm told. 
          <br>
          Grimlings do not see invis and are 40ish mobs...conned blue and aqua

        <p><b>Guk adventure</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>Tuesdays' foray into Lower Guk was, well, as Steddy/Klothe put it, 
          &quot;Guk is filled with both good and bad&quot;. While we managed to 
          obtain one of the desired items, and helped a new friend get part of 
          his epic, Tuesday also saw carnage on a horrific scale. Sarenia and 
          I were joined by Swiftpain, MrPain, and Moureve, and we did fairly well 
          at the onset camping the Sage. The winds of fate began to blow against 
          us however, as we were finally over run. Evacs only managed to save 
          &quot;<i>some</i>&quot; of the party. Then on a corpse run gone bad, 
          we faced a TPW (total party wipeout). Then as if word of our plight 
          was carried by the wind, Chow members started popping up. Bashi, and 
          Dormare arrived first, then Sunu came to help with the rezzes, and finally 
          Radalas, and others. Soon Lower Guk was filling with sympathetic DC 
          who assisted with our corpse recovery and resurrections. Of special 
          note was a player named Mini Me who, despite not being a Chow, was exceedingly 
          helpful fetching corpses and as an escort. It was Mini Me who we repaid 
          by making certain he got his epic item-which was obtained at the cost 
          of Sarenia's death. </p>
        <p>Quote of the night: <i><br>
          &quot;I've never seen a pile of corpses this big before--I am making 
          a cemetery&quot;</i><br>
          -- Mini Me after dragging all the dead bodies to a central spot for 
          Sunu to rez.</p>
        <p>Discovery of the night: Did you know that a wizard's Ro Evac took you 
          to &quot;South&quot; Ro? Always wondered what that pyramid was for.</p>
        <p>Thanks to those who came, and to those who dropped what they were doing 
          to help, and my apologizes for not getting a screenshot of the corpse 
          pile. </p>

          night Eldeberon, Sarenia &amp; Cabbz had the pleasure of gaining Kixim 
          and Astaldo's company as we continued to hunt the Spider Queen. The 
          skill level of Chow players is amazing. Despite our two melees being 
          only 32 and 37 respectfully, we managed to kill the queen and her entourage 
          repeatedly with no deaths. We had many exciting close calls, gained 
          much experience, shared hilarious conversations and won many wonderful 
          items, but never saw the wondrous crystal slippers. </p>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong><b>Jesse the Wurm</b></strong></font></p>
        <p>Last night I encountered the most intelligent AI I have yet seen in 
          the game. While fighting wurms in GD with Sarenia and Cabbz, we were 
          pulling them out of their cave, and killing them with no problem. Then 
          we pulled &quot;Jesse&quot; (my name for him not Verant's). The most 
          impressive wurm--no the most impressive mob--I have ever fought. He 
          seemed to be a typical Ancient Shardwurm. I pulled him and he blasted 
          me over and over with nasty spells cutting my health down. I was almost 
          dead when Cabbz (a shaman) healed me. I then turned and began massively 
          nuking. I delivered several powerful blasts and brought him down to 
          where he had no visible health. Suddenly he heals himself. I had never 
          seen a wurm do that before. In a few seconds he was at full health. 
          Again I nuked, and again he healed just before we could deliver the 
          killing blow. Running out of mana I nuked him again until he was near 
          death, then I watched as Jesse cast another spell. The first spell failed, 
          (never saw a mob fail at a spell before either), then he cast a second 
          spell of the same kind...and vanished. </p>
        <p>Now in the past wurms have displayed a nasty habit of poofing; that 
          is to say they teleport for no good reason to the mountainside above 
          the cave entrance. No spell causes them to do this and it seems more 
          like a bug than a natural defense. It is only an inconvenience however, 
          as you simply chase them up there and finish the job, but this wurm 
          never appeared above the cave like the others. He was simply no where 
          to be seen. I still had him in my target window and was concerned he 
          would heal himself again. Sure enough his health surged up. Damn! I 
          sat down and tried to med, hard to do when you are in such a fowl mood. 
          And as I sat there staring at the target window a sudden realization 
          stole over me. The wurm hadn't poofed. </p>
        <p>I know from experience that you can't accurately tell changes in the 
          health of a mob unless you are near it. So the wurm couldn't be up on 
          the mountain. Jesse had to be close by. That's when it hit me--Jesse 
          hadn't teleported he had gone invisible! To test this theroy I stood 
          up and fired off my Staff of Temperate Flux--this is a clickable debuffing 
          item. Sure enough the staff took effect. The bloody wurm was standing 
          somewhere right next to us medding and healing! I have to say I was 
          impressed. </p>
        <p>I cast a nuke spell at the invisible creature and it did full damage. 
          I began to cast a second when I went link dead. Shortly afterwards Sarenia 
          went LD too. When we returned Sarenia discovered she was standing naked 
          in Gfay--she was dead. The wurm had found her LD and killed her. I was 
          starting to think Jesse could cast Linkdead spells too. I had to gate 
          to port Sarenia back from her bind spot, and I am disappointed to tell 
          you that we never did manage to find or kill that wurm. Yet it is interesting 
          to know that Jesse is still out there, somewhere. One day we hope to 
          find him and finish our dispute one way or another. </p>
        <p>(btw the name &quot;Jesse&quot; is in deference to the infamous bear 
          from Northern Exposer)</p>

        <p>We would like to extend our thanks to Freyana and Kendrick for their 
          assistance in helping us last night. Sarenia, Cabbz and I were fighting 
          in the Spider Hall in Crystal Caves and wished to challenge the might 
          of the Spider Queen, but knew we didn't have the strength. I told Freyana, 
          (who was on Luclin), that we needed help, and without even asking for 
          what, she replied &quot;OMW&quot;. Kendrick, who was in the neighborhood 
          only to drop something off with his monk, dropped what he was doing, 
          and also came to our assistance. Despite receiving no experience and 
          little loot, Freyana and Kendrick played until 2 am EST helping us take 
          down the Spider queen. Just one more reason we can be proud to bear 
          the DC tag above our heads. Thanks a lot guys! </p>

        <p>Friday night our good friend Drasus, the Iksar Shammy, left us for 
          military service which will keep him occupied for at least a year. Sarenia 
          and I attempted to hold a surprise farewell party for him in West Commons 
          late Friday, but few DC's were still on. Nevertheless, Sarenia got Sylen 
          to show up and I, through deception, ported Drasus into WC. Sarenia 
          passed out beer to all, and shortly afterwards we were attacked by Dragoon 
          Zytl. With intelligence hovering at an average of 43, and eye sight 
          blurring badly, we all did battle with Zytl and his pet. Sarenia had 
          to gate, and poor Drasus nearly died, when suddenly I realized I was 
          targeted on Zytl when I thought I had his pet--who was beating the crap 
          out of me. It was a comedy of errors that left us sprawled drunk laughing 
          and bleeding on the dew covered grass near the wizzy pyramid in WC at 
          one o'clock in the morning. Could there have been a better send off? 
          I'm not sure.</p>

        <p><b>Mrpain's Goonie Adventure</b><br>
          <br>
          <i>From the diary of Mrpain:</i></p>
        <p>It was a normal day in the Overthere. Occasional rain, fog, and Goons 
          roaming the zone. Accompanied by Swiftpain, Drasus, Seung, Scalezz and 
          Drukinpinoch (With Lindsay and Kinney watching over us) - I was hunting 
          Sarnaks at the ruins. Making pretty short work of these atrocities, 
          we cleared out the wandering wildlife to pass the time.</p>
        <p>It was about then that we heard the call &quot;Goons are out!&quot; 
          and begain discussing the possibility of facing one. It was then decided 
          by the group that we would actively seek out one of these intolerant 
          beggars and make an example out of him. Dragoon T'Vem was the closest, 
          so Drasus walked up to him and got his attention. T'Vem had little clue 
          what was waiting for him just over the next rise.</p>
        <p>Once he crested the hill, he saw Scalezz. The necromancer was quick 
          to deal damage to T'Vem through the use of his lifetapping spells. This 
          enraged T'Vem and he proceeded to chase Scalezz around the field with 
          blood in his eyes. While the rest of us attempted to catch T'Vem from 
          behind, it proved very difficult to follow his movements. Occasionally 
          hitting him from behind, and calling &quot;STOP!&quot; to Scalezz, we 
          finally got his attention and Swiftpain, Drukinpinoch, and myself proceded 
          to beat him up. The pets added in and the battle raged.</p>
        <p>As the Shamans worked furiously to keep us healthy, Swiftpain and I 
          split his attention to lessen the urgency of their spells. Soon T'Vem 
          was looking a bit ragged and torn. All the while, Scalezz continued 
          to drain his life. We fought him with renewed ferocity when the shamans 
          begain calling out &quot;Out of Mana!&quot;. Fortunately, Lindsay was 
          nearby and was casting heals herself.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, standing over the body of Dragoon T'Vem, someone mentioned 
          that the Goon Death Squad doesn't take too kindly to one of their own 
          being taken down. We decided that discretion was the better part of 
          valor and looted quickly as we headed out of the area. Soon the bulk 
          of us (the ones without Feign Death) were in the Frontier Mountains. 
          When we were sure that they had forgotten about our battle with T'Vem, 
          we met back at the ruins again and continued hunting.</p>
        <p>Now with the effort involved with killing one of these Dragoons, one 
          would think they would have something worth looting. Truth is, this 
          military midget left behind a Long Sword and a bad taste in the air 
          -- what the softskins call 'smell'. Other then the bragging rights to 
          having faced down a Dragoon, there wasn't much yield from our struggle.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of good treasure, I found great enjoyment in ending 
          his reign of terror. Shouts of relief came up accross the zone as he 
          fell, and the fame of Dragonchow was spread once again. Now to move 
          on to his boss - General D'Veers!</p>

          and I really wanted to see if we could do this with just one group.</p>
        <p>The group consisted of myself, (Radalas 60 War) Enilate (55 Monk) Sunu 
          (56 cleric) Candywen (57 Enchanter) Bolvi (52? War) and Purti (55 Shaman). 
          Well not only did we do well, we also got some really great drops!</p>
        <p>Sunu got a Plate Bracer, while Bolvi walked away with a Plate helm. 
          I ended up with a Silvery Belt of Contention (haste belt) and Purti... 
          oh Purti..... she got a Chain BP! (apologies to Candywen and Enilate 
          for not getting anything)</p>
        <p>Gratz to Purti and all the other winners! Im planning to run a few 
          more of these pickup raids here and there outside of our regular Kael 
          raids so be ready!</p>

          <font color="#FFFFFF">According to this site's Members list (which is 
          most likely not accurate) Dragonchow has: 50 members and 216 Characters 
          (alts and mains)</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Of those 216 their are: 27 Druids, 27 Shamans, 
          26 Warriors, 17 Monks, 16 Enchanters, 15 Clerics, 15 Shadowknights, 
          13 Rogues, 12 Bards, 12 Necros, 12 Wizards, 8 Mages, 6 Paladins, 5 Rangers,

          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>TALK TO ME</strong><br>
          To date, only Woodweaver and Swifthand have sent in any submissions 
          to this site. Woodweaver's contribution is evident on his bio page, 
          while our beloved Guild Leader is graciously assisting me in creating 
          a definitive history of the guild, which will be posted as soon as it 
          is done. Keep in mind that while this site may look pretty, its energy 
          and function comes from guild members. The more information I can post 
          about what members are doing, and what is happening in Dragonchow, the 
          more enjoyable this site will be to visit. For example: I heard rumors 
          that in the Naggy raid the raid was wiped out except for one lone member 
          who defeated Nagafen in solo combat! Who was this person? This Dragonslayer? 
          Was it a Chow? What actually happened? <br>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>VACATION DELAYED</strong><br>
          Sarenia and Eldeberon's long anticipated vacation to Velious was cut 
          short when Drasus invited us to hunt giants with him in Rathe Mountains. 
          Being poor, the promise of untold wealth was simply too enticing to 
          ignore. So after killing only three snow cougars near the dock, Sarenia 
          and Eldeberon ported out and joined Drasus. We will most likely stick 
          around Rathe as long as Drasus (or other guild members) are available 
          to assist us (as I don't think we can hunt these red giants alone).

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>PORTRAIT TAKING</strong><br>
          For those of you wishing to send in pictures of your character, here 
          is a helpful tip: Try standing near a wall, then change to camera view 
          and rotate the camera until it hits the wall. This will push the camera 
          close to your character so you can take a nice close-up. Then rotate 
          yourself for the right angle, and hit the minus key on your keypad. 
          Zip it, (with Winzip), and attach it to your email. For those of you

          there was talk of a guild war. More of a series of jokes than a talk 
          really. The conclusion was that the guild was behind Brodda, and ready 
          to make any sacrifice for his honor, but then Sylen (at least I think 
          it was Sylen), went and spoiled the fun by resolving the problem and 
          fostering peace in our time.</big></span></font><span class="Normal"><font color="#8080C0"><big>&nbsp;
