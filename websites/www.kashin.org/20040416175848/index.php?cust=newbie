        (and I'm willing to bet you've never played a game quite like this), things 
        will prove to be rough. But the good news is that <u>everyone</u> has 
        gone through this. So don't be discouraged if you're dying -- a lot. Tanarus 
        is a different kind of game because you're playing real people, and just 
        like in the real world, some people are more skilled than others. Upon 
        starting out, you'll probably run into a whole lot of people more skilled 
        than you. But given time, your skill will increase. The game is not overly 
        complicated, but it does require a grasp of the game's foundations. This 
        Getting Started guide will walk you through some of the more "foundational" 
        aspects of Tanarus, equipping you to experience the more complex strategies 
        of the game. So once again, don't expect to jump in thinking your reign 
        of terror has begun on the unsuspecting masses -- you'll be quite humbled, 
        to say the least. We hope this Getting Started guide provides a foundation 
        for you to fully enjoy Tanarus. Have fun! </font>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The beginner chatroom 
        is somewhat similar to the Command Center. The difference is that this 
        chatroom is divided among different beginner arenas. By default, you always 
        enter the first arena's chat room. Pilots whose name is colored yellow 
        on the roster to the right can begin talking to you and will likewise 
        receive your messages on their end. Pilots whose name appears in any other 
        color (red, green, blue or gray) are actually in the arena playing with

        press the buttons with color names to whisk yourself away to the team 
        color of your choice. Only five players are allowed on a team, so if you're 
        not getting a response from any of the buttons you pressed, check to make 
        sure that team is not full, or in fact, the entire city is occupied. If 
        the city has an available opening, then you'll soon see a special "loading" 
        screen and you'll find yourself looking at the home base configuration 
        screen. Congratulations, you're now ready to put together a tank and roll 
        out into the battlefield. </font>
      <p> 
      <font color="#FF0000"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Home 
      base</font></b></font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The home base configuration 
        screen is where you formulate your attack plan. Five tanks are available 
        which serve as a basic template design. For the purposes of this guide, 
        we'll have you use the default tank, the Vanguard. Never mind the intricacies 
        of the different tanks, or even that of the Vanguard for now -- we'll 
        concentrate on getting your Vanguard equipped and out exploring and fighting. 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The all-purpose Vanguard 
        is great for beginners and veterans alike, but how you configure your 
        tank for the role it will play is what sets the veteran apart from the 
        newbie (a 'net term for anyone who's new at something -- not necessarily 
        negative but often used in a negative fashion). A great configuration 
        for beginners is what we call the "Reserve Power" Vanguard. Just click 
        the LOAD button at the bottom right of the configuration screen. If it's 
        not loading in the modules, then equip the following: </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Phase Multiplier, 
        Shield, Shield Boost, Stealth, Reserve Power, Supercharager. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With this configuration, 
        your tank is equipped to not only fight and take damage, it's also ready 
        to fill your battery back to a full tank when you run out of juice (twice 
        even!). When you're ready to roll your tank out, press the "Enter" button 
        at the button. Now for a public service announcement: we wish to remind 
        you to remember your team color because any tanks you see of that color 
        are your teammates. Do not fire on these tanks! This might sound obvious, 
        but you can't imagine how many times a beginner has entered an arena and 
        upon seeing a tank for the first time (or second time, or third) gets 
        carried away with excitement and begins damaging a friendly tank. If you 
        do this, be prepared for some teammate retaliation. Just remember your 
        color! (And if you're one who intentionally resorts to this type of cheap 
        thrill, be prepared to make enemies real fast) </font>
      <p> 
      <font color="#FF0000"><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving 
      around</font></b></font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You'll find yourself 
        at what is effectively your home base. You can move your tank just like 
        you'd imagine a tank would move by simply pushing your joystick in the 
        desired direction. You can move forward or backward, take a turn while 
        in motion, or even pivot in one place. You'll notice that your forward 
        motion is much faster than your backward motion, and you can measure your 
        speed by watching the velocity meter at the lower right of the screen. 
        But that's only half the story -- you'll also want to get familiar with 
        using your turret. You can adjust your turret (i.e. your view) by pressing 
        A to swivel left, D to swivel right, W to swivel up and S to swivel down. 
        If you need to re-center your view, press the X key. If you hold down 
        SHIFT while swiveling your turret, you'll get a "precision aiming" effect 
        allowing you to fine tune your movement at the cost of a much slower response. 
        This is great for when you need to accurately get someone in your sights 
        who is at a far off distance. Precision aiming works both on turret and 
        tank movement, so don't use precision aiming if you're trying to move 
        somewhere quick. </font>
      <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/images/newbie2.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0" align=RIGHT hspace="5"> 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You'll notice that 
        your turret's facing is represented by a graphic at the lower part of 
        your screen. Swivel your turret left or right and you'll notice the graphic 
        will reflect your turret's actual facing. The Vanguard is capable of 90 
        degree lateral movement in either direction, which means you can cover 
        an arc of a full 180 degrees to the front of your tank. If you swivel 
        your turret up or down, a meter to the lower left represents your turret's 
        angle in relation to the horizon. Again, you can get more precise movement 
        by holding the spacebar and then swiveling either up or down. In the case 
        of the Vanguard (and most other tanks), you have a much higher angle to 
        work with when swiveling up as opposed to swiveling down. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What's important 
        to note is that survival hinges on your ability to use the combination 
        of tank movement (the joystick) along with turret movement (the keyboard). 
        Your ability to move in one direction while facing another is a skill 
        you'll do well to master for many reasons. Among these an increased "situational 
        awareness" and the ability to fight while moving, to name just a few.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Go ahead and take 
        a stroll through the arena, being careful to watch your radar for enemies 
        (upper right of screen). Tanks are represented as solid squares of the 
        appropriate color. Now don't rely too heavily on radar, since some tanks 
        can actually configure themselves with modules that enable them to hide 
        from radar, but be mindful of any tanks you do see. The radar display 
        can be toggled with the F3 key to show greater distances. You can toggle 
        up to three different radar ranges, but unfortunately, there's no indication 
        of how far out you're seeing; you'll have to rely on relative distance 
        to the other blips you see on radar to know just how far in or out your 
        radar is set. As you travel about, keep an eye on your feed meter and 
        your battery level, both located at the lower left of your screen. Think 
        of the battery level as your fuel tank. Moving and firing causes you to 
        consume battery power, and when your tank hits empty, it's in big trouble. 
        Should you experience an empty battery, all systems on your tank shutdown 
        save for your ability to move. But if that weren't enough punishment, 
        your ability to move is severely hampered, and your tank comes to a veritable 
        crawl. If there ever was a time to be called a sitting duck, it's when 
        you've got an empty battery. We'll let you imagine the consequences of 
        running on empty in the middle of a heated battle. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But all's not lost! 
        The feed meter is there to help you manage that precious fuel so that 
        you can avoid becoming a sitting duck. At this point, we'll take a turn 
        in our guide: no longer will we call it fuel; instead, we'll now refer 
        to it as energy. To avoid a no energy situation, you have what is called 
        a feed meter which allows you to track how much energy is coming into 
        your tank (or how much is being drained beyond the normal consumption 
        of energy required for your tank's operation). Unlike the real world (where 
        most of us live, hopefully), tanks in Tanarus can be constantly supplied 
        with energy in order that they never run out. What's important is your 
        proximity to an energy source. When your feed meter is in the positive 
        (to the right of center, colored blue) your tank is receiving energy from 
        a source, or as the case may be, from many sources. Your closeness to 
        the source, or even the strength of the source will affect your input 
        of energy. The closer you are to a source, or the stronger a particular 
        source is, the greater your input of energy, and your feed meter will 
        reflect this. You've probably noticed that your feed meter started out 
        very high when you were at home base, but as you traveled further out 
        into the city, it began to drop, even to the point of being in the negative 
        (red, and to the left of center). It doesn't matter if you're a veteran 
        or a beginner, going into the red on your feed meter is never a good thing. 
        You can bring back your feed to the positive by getting close to an energy 
        source, which will always be your home base (so remember where it is!). 
        Of course, there are other sources of energy, but if there ever was an 
        energy source you could count on, it would be your home base. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So what are these 
        other sources of energy? Well, they take the form of recon stations and 
        satellites. If you press F2 you'll notice a grid that represents the current 
        city. This map doesn't show buildings or structures, but instead shows 
        sources of energy and the position of friendly tanks only. You'll notice 
        your home base as being located in one of the four corners as an appropriately 
        colored hash mark. You'll also notice the home base of all the other teams 
        in the city. Remember, home base is always in the corner, but what are 
        those other hash marks located in ordered parts of the city? Those are 
        recon stations, and they serve as a mini home base of sorts. These recon 
        stations supply power to your tank, similar to your home base (though 
        as not as strong) and they allow you to configure your tank, and repair 
        damage just like home base. The difference is that these recon stations 
        can be captured by the enemy (thereby rendering it useless or even deadly 
        to you until you re-capture it); don't allow you to switch to a new tank; 
        and don't allow the equipping of certain modules. In effect, recon stations 
        are a smaller version of home base when it comes to their capabilities, 
        and they can be quite temporary during the course of the game. Any hash 
        marks that are colored white represent neutral recon stations. Any neutral 
        station is incapable of supplying energy until it is captured, but is 
        able to equip and repair any damaged tank, whether its yours or the enemy's. 
        Think of these neutral recon stations as non-partisan bases whose services 
        are available to anyone, friendly or not. We won't worry too much about 
        capturing recon stations and making them your own, but instead will focus 
        on the power these recon stations give (and take!). </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Just like home base, 
        recon stations supply energy that directly affects your feed indicator. 
        The closer you get to a friendly recon station, the greater your energy 
        input. However, should you approach an unfriendly recon station or unfriendly 
        home base, you'll notice a drop in your energy input. Get too close, and 
        you'll notice a drain indicated by your meter going into the red. This 
        energy is not being transferred anywhere per se, but rather is seeping 
        from your energy feed. Often times, you'll be traveling in the city with 
        an idle energy feed; you're precariously balanced between your own energy 
        source(s), and the source(s) of the enemy's, and have wandered into the 
        "stalemate" of energy input. Should you stay at idle for too long, you 
        might find yourself in trouble, simply because the energy you're spending 
        to move is not being replenished with any type of positive energy feed. 
        It might take a while for your battery to completely drain, but with enough 
        firing of weapons, or any other type of module activated, they'll eventually 
        take their toll on your tank. Fortunately an idle energy feed means you're 
        not far from getting to a precious recon station, so you can quickly get 
        to some much needed energy. This is also a good time to note that the 
        Vanguard configuration we recommended is actually quite suited to the 
        empty battery experience. Should you find yourself with a dead battery, 
        your Reserve Power module will kick in, filling your battery then disappearing 
        from your inventory. And since you've taken the added security of a Supercharger, 
        you'll have twice the holding power of a non-supercharged tank. </font>

        lucky, go ahead and take on an enemy tank. Now before you get yourself 
        into a whole lot of trouble, weigh out whether you have enough power in 
        the area to fight (remember, you consume a lot more energy when you begin 
        firing) and whether the odds are in your favor. Avoid a two on one (you 
        being the one, of course, otherwise go for it!) or any number beyond that. 
        For now, stick with a one on one or better yet, jump into a fight in progress 
        that has favorable odds. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> You'll notice what's 
        called Armor and Crits (Critical for short) on your dash with a number 
        to go along side these. Your Vanguard has an Armor value of 60 and a Crits 
        value of 60. Protecting both of these is your shields, which you happen 
        to have because you picked the shield module when equipping your Vanguard. 
        But before we discuss shields, we'll talk about Armor and Crits, because 
        these are available to all tanks, unlike shields. Let's say your shields 
        get breached. When this happens, you begin taking damage to your Armor. 
        When your Armor is brought to zero, you begin taking damage to your Crits. 
        When your Crits hit zero, you're dead. There's no difference between Armor 
        and Crits in that both are affected the same way by weapons, but they 
        are separated in order to give you an idea of the seriousness of your 
        tank's condition. Taking armor damage may not be all that harrowing but 
        watch your crits go down, and you're probably thinking it's a good time 
        to excuse yourself from a fight. As a beginner, start thinking about beating 
        feet home when you start taking significant armor damage. If you wait 
        till you're taking crits damage, you'll probably regret it. And you'll 
        be surprised how fast those numbers go down when you start taking damage. 
        The moment you start taking damage to your crits, your tank begins to 
        spew white puffs of smoke. You don't see this on your end, but your enemies 
        do and then all those documentaries you ever saw about how lions will 
        divert their attention to a wounded prey will take on new meaning. If 
        your crits get seriously low, you begin to spew black smoke. You're in 
        serious trouble at this point. All eyes are definitely on you. Likewise, 
        keep an eye out for enemy tanks with the same symptoms. White smoke means 
        they're hurting; black smoke means they're just about dead meat. Armor 
        and Crits do not replenish unless you enter a recon station or home base.

        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fortunately, what's 
        keeping you from experiencing armor and crits damage is your shields. 
        You'll notice a graphic at the center of your dash showing a bird's eye 
        view of a tank. To the front and rear is a colored band representing forward 
        and rear shields. Since your shields are on, the band will be a complete 
        circle but it is in fact a two part display. When these shields are fully 
        charged, they're colored white but as they take damage, they move from 
        white, to yellow, to various shades of brown, and then a variety of reds. 
        When the shields are completely knocked out, you won't see any shields 
        at all. When a shield goes completely down, it won't begin recharging 
        until 3 seconds go by, at which time it will slowly move back up the color 
        scheme until it finally reaches white again, assuming you're not taking 
        damage on that particular shield. With that in mind, it's quite possible 
        to take armor or even crits damage, then to have your shields charged 
        back up so that you can make your escape without suffering fatal damage. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In order to maximize 
        your survivability, you need to learn how to dynamically alter your shields. 
        You can do this by pressing the Q or E keys. If you press Q you'll distribute 
        shield power to the forward shield at the cost of deducting an equal amount 
        from the rear shield. The same holds true if you were to press the E key, 
        in which points are added to the rear shield at the cost of equivalent 
        points taken from the front. It's a good idea to learn how to transfer 
        shield strength between the two sides, especially if one side is receiving 
        the brunt of the damage. To equalize shield distribution, press the = 
        key. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With all this in 
        mind, go ahead and jump into a fight. You might not win, but at least 
        you'll understand what's going on. To target a tank, which will aid you 
        in determining a tank's shield damage and who's driving it, hit your C 
        button to cycle forward (Z cycles back). A targeted tank turns into a 
        solid white square on your radar, and on your visual display will have 
        a yellow arrow above it. You'll also notice that the pilot's name and 
        his shield status (whether on, damaged or off) and what team he represents 
        by the color of his name. If you happen to notice that a tank appears 
        visually, but does not appear on radar, then be aware that tank is using 
        a Stealth module: he'll neither appear on radar nor will he be picked 
        up by your targeting system (which means you'll never be able to tell 
        his shield status). Now observe your shield damage and what's happening 
        to your tank when engaging in a fight. Remember to always keep moving 
        and use your turrets. Watch your power and how your enemy is responding. 
        And if you die, ask the person who killed you what exactly happened. They 
        might tell you something you didn't know or might even hand out a tip. 
        There are lots of tactics when it comes to fighting, and that's covered 
        in our tactics section. We obviously can't anticipate the many ways one 
        can die (you may die from someone who wasn't even in the fight!) but learning 
        these basics will help you along. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Should you win the 
        fight or need to make some repairs, go ahead and drive over to a recon 
        station or your home base. You'll see a white square (or in the case of 
        home base, an appropriately colored one) on the ground. When you drive 
        over this, you'll see an R appear on the upper right of your screen near 
        your radar display. When you see this, hit the enter key and you'll be 
        taken to the familiar configuration screen. If you've sustained damage 
        to your armor or crits, these will quickly be replenished. And if you've 
        expended any reserve powers, these will also be replenished as you watch 
        your battery indicator slowly fill up. Wait till it stops filling up entirely 
        before you leave. It might even fill up and then start over again, reflecting 
        spent reserve power modules that are being replenished. Now spending time 
        repairing or equipping your tank leaves you vulnerable to damage because 
        even though you're on another screen (and not necessarily "in the city"), 
        your tank is still visible to the enemy. Worse yet, when you're in the 
        configuration screen, your shields are automatically dropped! So if you 
        notice you're taking damage while configuring your tank, or you actually 
        die while in there, it's because something was shooting you. So be careful 
        when running from a fight and entering a recon station -- someone might 
        follow you and wait for you to enter before they finish you off! </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Have fun exploring 
        the rest of the game. You've probably noticed there are more tanks and 
        more modules to experiment with and we encourage you to check them out. 
        You can dig further into our strategy section for more advanced information, 
        or you can experiment on your own. There's a lot more to Tanarus than 
        what's covered in this Getting Started guide, so be sure to read what's 
        available in our Strategy section. </font>
