>change that..but I'm supposed to rant, 
>hmmm, what to rant about..lets see, 
>the fact that 2 lvls are 
>easy and then the next 2 
>are hard...no, that won't do... I 
>know, my latest journey. 
>I think that the boat rides are 
>too long. i mean, I was 
>stuck on a boat for a 
>long time, and I'm patiently waiting 
>to get to freeport, as so 
>i can go and try my 
>hand in the befallen area, I'm 
>lvl 10, and i knew I 
>saw something about this nifty npc 
>who gave mad exp around that 
>lvl, and so I was like, 
>ok, what harm can be done? 
>so, after a few tries of 
>getting on the boat, we are 
>on our way. Pulling out of 
>the kladim docks, I stand on 
>the prow of the boat and 
>shout ooc for all to hear 
>"I feel so free!" so we 
>zone into the ocean of tears, 
>and I happily run around the 
>boat looking for everything I possibly 
>could. I see some rocks off 
>to one side and go to 
>take a closer look, and I 
>hear this sound and see these 
>lil dots there, and I checked 
>them and they were alluring sirens! 
>They were yellow, atleast one was, 
>but i thought it best for 
>me to leave them there. The 
>rest of the trip went by 
>slowly, there was this little village 
>on an island, and then we 
>got to east freeport, except for 
>me. for some reason, when I 
>zoned, I zoned too far, all 
>the way back to something called 
>my "desktop" well, I hurriedly tried 
>to get back, but alas I 
>found myself exiting freeport, and worse 
>of all it was as if 
>I was rooted on the prow 
>of the ship! I twisted and 
>turned, and alas, until we entered 
>in the ocean of tears again, 
>I couldn't move. but wait! we 
>had just zoned, how far could 
>it really be? So i ran 
>back and jumped off the edge, 
>and swam in the direction the 
>backside of the ship had been. 
>Well, I kept swimming, and swimming, 
>and got a rank of swimming 
>and about 5 more ranks of 
>swimming...but whats this, my little yellow 
>bar is going down, oh but 
>look, it went back up when 
>I gained that rank! this won't 
>be a problem...as long as i 
>keep gaining ranks, i could swim 
>forever...but whats this? I'm getting encumbered? 
>from what? all I'm doing is 
>swiming (who cared I had like 
>3 bronze weapons on me, and 
>a shield) look, that bar is 
>almost gone...what will I do...lets try 
>and cast gate...I hurried to my 
>spell book to mem it, and 
>then swam back to the top...quickly 
>cast it...oh look I'm sinking...no problem, 
>my gate spell will get me 
>out..your spell was interupted...what! I thought 
>there was not Z movement! oh 
>well, have more energy now, I'll 
>continue to swim...look, I'm almost tired 
>again and I'm encumbered again....I wonder 
>how deep this ocean really is, 
>if I can get to the 
>bottom, I'll have no problem getting 
>out of here...so boldly I put 
>my head down, and try and 
>swim to the bottom, someone had 
>said it was reallu deep, but 
>I'd hoped it was an exacturation, 
>I swam and saw blackness, so 
>I stoped swiming, so if anything, 
>I was just sinking, and I 
>cast..and the next thing i know, 
>my exhausted and starved body was
