>I am not sure if many of 
>you group with enchanters, if you 
>dont, TRUST ME, FIND ONE, and 
>become that players BEST PAL! Enchanters 
>are AWSOME to group with, what 
>with there buffs and de-buffs, AND 
>they have the only charm left 
>in the game. ADD to this 
>the fact that enchanters have a 
>spell called CARITY, THIS spell increases 
>your mana regen. Add to this 
>your Alure of Death, and you, 
>my fellow necro, are a mana 
>machine. NO MORE!!! Last night, while 
>in the pit in Thule, I 
>was with my enchantress pal, she 
>had clarity on her to fellow 
>necros. After a battle, I cast 
>Alure of Death, after a bit, 
>I noticed my mana not shooting 
>up like it used to. Hmmmmm, 
>I wondered, what is wrong, I 
>get up, and notice that ALure

>maybe the spell failed to cast, 
>since that patch before last, my 
>fizzle rate is WAY UP. I 
>cast it, and get "the spell 
>fails to take hold". I recast 
>Alure 10 TIMES! EACH FAILED, same

>necromancer to try Alure, to see 
>if it works, he is a 
>couple lvls above me(I of 30th, 
>he 32 lvl). SAME THING! 
>SO, those that think I was wrong 
>before, ONCE AGAIN, Verant proves that 
>they HATE necromancers! I think they 
>must want everything to be Tolkenisk 
>and have only npc necromancers, and 
>the rest of the players to 
>dance around singing happy songs. It 
>seems that every other patch cuts 
>either the Shadowkinghts, or us down 
>AGAIN! If this is not fixed 
>(Word loss, reasurch pets,no mix of 
>ALure and clarity,total nerf of Screaming 
>Terror) I say we protest a 
>weekend. We start one Friday, ALL 
>DAY, every necroamncer on EVERY server 
>send petitions and bug reports on 
>how they seem to be out 
>to cut our legs off. I 
>know, some will say," You just 
>are a ******, EQ loves us, 
>and is not out to get 
>us" Well, why is it that 
>allmost every patch, they nerf us 
>a little more? They broke spells, 
>and took months to fix, they 
>took our Charm, and gave us 
>Screaming Terror. When they realized we 
>had a us for it, the 
>nerfed that. They STILL have not 
>fixed the DoT bug. THIS is 
>a MAJOR problem, imagine if a 
>Wiz used a line of DD

>the kill, ding, no corpse, no 
>exp? You think this class would 
>be quite? HELL NO. Wizards bitch 
>about others having some spells that

>because 1 SPELL is a MAJOR

>they made our pets buyable, and 
>made Lich a quest, which I 
>am SURE it is, I would 
>not be so pissed.   
>Add to thsi the fact that 
>they wiped out our 29th and 
>34, and so on non-stack words, 
>and you have got to realize 
>Verant doesnt give a damn about 
>us! YES, I love being a

>VERY hard on us. WHY? Someone 
>please answer me why? 
>But, back to my final point, on 
>the Friday of our protest, we 
>ALL send bug and petitions on 
>how they have messed with us 
>AGAIN. IF, nothing is done, the

>WIDE necro sit out. EVERY NECROMANCER 
>sits out of EQ for a
