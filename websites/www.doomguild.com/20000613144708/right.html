Recently <a href="tetilio@doomguild.com">Tetilio</a> (aka Coramdeo in EQ) was elected as the GM of the EQ Faction of DOOM.  I've done some minor cosmetic changes to the main page.  Also, Zadkiel's Character Database has been removed from the links list. <br><br>

I've done some recent work on a minor redesign of this page.  I'll be announcing Guild hunts ( both LOK and EQ ) here, so if there is one please make sure I know about.  In addition, a link has been added on the left to Rasputin/Zadkiel's wonderful creation of a Character Database.  If you have lost or forgot your password please <a href="mailto:zadkiel@doomguild.com">email him</a>.
