Greetings..<br><br>
Welcome once again to a new issue of The Necromonitor!  I'm terribly sorry for the delay, but I've recently moved, started a new job, and am having internal guild problems to boot.  But I still hope to get a new issue out before you get too restless..:)  There is some neat info on the Update that was recently enacted, with many changes to benefit Necromancers.  I for one am pleased with it thus far.  How about you?<br><br>

This was in a recent Producer's Letter, and is of immense interest to Necromancers:<br><br>
<i>I wanted to talk a little about the upcoming zones we’re working on. The first of these new, free downloads will be the Temple of Solusek Ro, a smaller dungeon of sorts which will be rich in quests. The second will be Paineel, home of the Heretics, situated south of Toxullia Forest. Once this zone is online, Erudite Necromancers will start in their city. And finally, the Hole, which will be a mid to higher level dungeon underneath Paineel.</i><br><br>
However, it would seem this zone is going to be more dedicated to Erudite Necromancers, and not Necromancers in general as previously thought.  I'll be sure to keep you updated.<br><br>

Thanks to Mortuus for this early look at this Level 49 DOT..<br><br>
It seems to do about 60 damage or so for 20 ticks ( 2 minutes ), for a total of roughly 1200 damage over 2 minutes.  A very nice complement to the Level 49 Cascading Darkness ( 800 DOT ) indeed.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
The petition has been sent in to Verant.  Thanks to all who have added their name, the final count was well over 1,500 individual names.  With any luck we will start to see a change over the next few updates.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Screaming Terror</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Screaming Terror is a fear-based spell that was recently added to replace the Charm spell.  Screaming Terror will not only fear your target, but it also has the ability to wipe the target's hate list.  It appears that both aspects of this spell are able to be resisted, and there is no way to tell unless your target comes back for you.  Beware, do not use this spell in conjuction with DOTs, unless you want the target to come back.  There will be no way the hate list is wiped with DOTs in effect.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
<b>Invisibility versus Undead</b><br><br>
This is a level one spell.  It is a limited invisibility which grants invisibilty to only the eyes of the undead.  A few notes on this though.  First, higher level undead can see past this without any problems, so before passing a powerful undead.... con it... if it is anything but indifferent, it can definitely see you!  Second, your pet is undead... if you go invis to undead, your pet will kill itself *mumbles about making this mistake a couple times*.  Many times undead are accompanied by Necromancers... these are not undead so will not be fooled by your tricks... beware!   This is however an excellent spell to assist in exploring undead type dungeons and the all too common corpse recovery in places like Befallen, Unrest, and Najena.  It is one of the few Necromancer spells we can cast on others. 
<br><br>
<b>Hungry Earth</b><br><br>
A spell of legend, or so it seems.  This spell can finally be researched using the words Materials and Spirit.  The Hungry Earth spell is in essence an Undead only root spell, but with the added benefit of doing a bit of Direct Damage when first cast.  At level 35 it does approx 40 points of damage plus the Root effect.  Now the lower then 34 level necromancers have a root type spell in their arsenal!    A special note, the satisfaction you feel at tossing 2 or 3 DOT's on an undead that is stuck and can't chase you... ahhhh.  Try it! Fun!
