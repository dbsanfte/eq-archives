      <TEXTAREA NAME="body" ROWS="15"
        COLS="50" WRAP="virtual">>First off I would like to have 
>a question answered (since you brought 
>it up). I keep hearing the 
>phrase "we are masters of the 
>undead" or "we kill undead fast". 
>My question is what sets us 
>apart from everyone else with the 
>undead? 
>We have one DD undead only spell 
>and it's not like it does 
>more dmg than anyone else. Actually 
>does less dmg than the other 
>DD spell we have and wiz's 
>(don't know about other classes) can 
>still out dmg us with undead. 
>
>Invis to undead. I don't keep up 
>with other class's abilities that much 
>so we may be the only 
>class with this. 
>We have an undead pet. 
>Charm undead. Doesn't all the other charm 
>type spells work on the undead 
>as well? When we had regular 
>"Charm" (if I remember correctly) it 
>also worked on the undead. 
>Spook the dead. Fear works on the 
>undead. 
>Lull undead. Don't enchanters have similar spells 
>that work on everything including undead? 
>
>Keep in mind here that this is 
>really a question rather than a 
>rant. I'm not the type that 
>compares every little bean with the 
>next class. I enjoy the necro 
>and use what I have. But 
>I am curious about this and 
>would like it explained to me. 
>
>On to the points you wanted raised. 
>I think it all depends on 
>your definition of a "group". 
>No doubt the necro is great for 
>solo play. But I really don't 
>see how we are useless to 
>groups. I think people are to 
>stuck on the clich'e group of 
>tank(s), healer(s) and wiz(s) where indeed 
>the fight is over before it 
>actually starts and granted, they're plenty 
>of circumstances where this combo of 
>classes will shine. 
>But I've also found that two necros 
>are highly effective. I mean you 
>have 2 tanks, 2 healers and 
>2 casters rolled up in 2 
>people. Granted this combo will not 
>take out lady vox but they're 
>are still plenty of rooms this 
>combo can take. 
>Secondly, I have two wiz friends who 
>I fight with alot (lvl 29 
>to 30). Either myself and one 
>of the two wiz's fight together 
>or all three of us (depends 
>on who is on at the 
>time). To be honest with ya, 
>we are all equal in our 
>rolls. They suffer without me and 
>vice versa. And talk about a 
>powerful group. At 24 and up 
>me and one wiz were taking 
>out Cyclops's and some spectres or 
>holding Najena's room after it was 
>broke in. At 29 the same 
>two man combo were taking out 
>griffens. If we go into dungeons, 
>we MAY pick up a tank/healer 
>depending on the difficulty of the 
>room we are trying to break. 
>
>When neither of those guys are on, 
>I find myself quite useful to 
>a group. I have plenty to 
>offer. I can bring an extra 
>tank (my pet), I can cure 
>disease, I can do a few 
>important buffs and I can cast 
>some mean shit etc. 
>Anyone can sit here and pick apart 
>what I've said. "Well, x-class can 
>do this or x-class can do 
>that". So what? If they can 
>do it and get into a 
>group, so can you. Maybe my 
>tune will change once I hit 
>34+ or 40+, dunno. I can 
>only draw from the experiences I've 
>had thus far.
