        COLS="50" WRAP="virtual">>-------------------------------------------------- Necromancers, at Level 20, gain a 
>spell (Harmshield) that grants brief invulnerability. 
>However it is still possible that 
>you can be stunned while using 
>this spell. How can one be 
>stunned while invulnerable..?  -------------------------------------------------- 
>think about that for a moment.... lets 
>say you are invincible.. ok, so 
>nothing can scratch you, or break 
>you, but you still have to 
>breath and walk normally, if something 
>hits you so hard that you 
>are knocked down, you are effectively 
>stunned for a short amount of 
>time, but you aren't hurt, you 
>were just knocked down, and the 
>time it takes to get up 
>is the stun time, this makes 
>sense to me, and I have 
>no problem with stunning while invincible.. 
>think about it.. hmmm 10 aviaks 
>on me, all my own size 
>nad they are hitting me.. im 
>not 400 tons, so i fall 
>over alot when they bash me 
>but they dont hurt me, 
>there, is my point.. think about it 
>a bit 
>-------------------------------------------------- Necromancers, being the bane of society, 
>are forced to travel often under 
>the cloak of Gather Shadows. However, 
>this spell is completely unreliable for 
>travelling through hostile zones. Thus, the 
>effectiveness of the spell at night 
>should be enhanced.  -------------------------------------------------- 
>Ok first off, necromancers are not vampires, 
>or creatures of the night, not 
>in the slightest.. necromancers are meant 
>to be masters of the dead 
>and undead, rogues and shadownknights, some 
>clerics, warriors, monks, can also worship 
>the same gods as necros do, 
>and do evil things and be 
>"banes" of society, perhaps instead of 
>giving necromancers an overall boost in 
>their ability by making all they're 
>stuff more powerful at night.. give 
>us levitate!! then we can easily 
>go through hostile places while invis, 
>and less people would complain about 
>not having teleport spells... druids, shamen, 
>wizards, magicians, enchanters, all have the 
>levitate spell and gate, which should 
>be two things that all pure 
>casters get. 
>-------------------------------------------------- With being Masters of the Undead, 
>Necromancers should have some form of 
>spell not unlike Wolf Form for 
>hunting against Undead creatures.  -------------------------------------------------- 
>
>yes we do need something that we 
>can keep active for long periods 
>of time.. im thinking that at 
>level 44 or 49 we get 
>a spell that turns us into 
>a skel, that way we can 
>benefit from undead effective spells like 
>level 39 augment death, and renew 
>bones.. thus we could have some 
>form of shape change, but it 
>would be very high level, and 
>very very useful... 
>one thing that i would very much 
>like verant to do.. would be 
>to have the option to permanently 
>shape change into a skeleton, maybe 
>a one shot potion that you 
>can only use if you are 
>a necromancer and level 50, and 
>do some insane quest.. maybe getting 
>the head of rival guildmasters, from 
>various wizard guilds etc... 
>-------------------------------------------------- With the DOT being the Necromancers 
>main weapon in his/her arsenal, the 
>Darkness line of spells' resistances is 
>unacceptably high. Blue con enemies consistently 
>resist the spell, either forcing the 
>caster to attempt to recast and 
>waste valuable mana, or to change 
>his strategy in the midst of 
>battle, often with dire consequences.  
>-------------------------------------------------- 
>The enchanters have the same problem with 
>their multi effect dot spells. live 
>with it... it our only line 
>of spells that gets resisted on 
>a regular basis... i use blood, 
>poison, and disease lines mostly.. and 
>they barely get resisted, plus as 
>someone has pointed out the higher 
>level you are, and the lower 
>level of ht spell you use 
>are directly proportional to the resist 
>rate.. so if you are level 
>50 and use cascading darkness on 
>a level 50 monster, it will 
>have less chance of workin hten 
>level 4 clingin darkness, however, why 
>one would use the shitty level 
>4 spell is beyond me.. nonetheless 
>its a moot point.. spells get 
>resisted..... look at a wizard's board 
>"my spells ALL get resisted too 
>much by green things and im 
>level 39 blah blahj blah" 
>-------------------------------------------------- Necromancers, needing to rely on their 
>pets for success in Norrath, have 
>an intensely difficult time finding their 
>Pet spells. After Level 24 it 
>is impossible for a Necromancer to 
>purchase their pet spell from a 
>vendor. Thus, the research components needed 
>to research their spells should be 
>more widely available. Necromancers do not 
>have the kind of spells that 
>other pet-using classes have to achieve 
>effectiveness in their journies to rid 
>the world of Norrath of baddies. 
> -------------------------------------------------- 
>I agree, keeping all of the hard 
>to get things on spectres is 
>nice .. if you can kill 
>them regularily.. but it is tough,..... 
>i spent 2 weeks looking for 
>words of neglect and still no 
>luck 
>-------------------------------------------------- Since EverQuest was in Beta there 
>have been horrid tracking problems with 
>pets in dungeons, thus making travel 
>through them a chore, if not 
>an impossibility. This issue needs to 
>be addressed and fixed posthaste.  
>-------------------------------------------------- 
>This is true for all classes with 
>pets.. once again, our shaman buddies 
>will be helped by this as 
>well, so not really a necromancer 
>specific isssue here..
