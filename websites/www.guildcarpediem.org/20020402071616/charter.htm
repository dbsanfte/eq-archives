<h1><b><font color="#FFFFFF">What We Expect From Our Members:</font></b></h1>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align="justify"><font size="4"><b>F</b></font>irst
and foremost our guild is a family and every member of the guild should take
pride in that fact. With that in mind, we expect all members of <i>Carpe Diem</i>
to actively participate in the guild. Because we believe that most characters
within the game of EverQuest in many ways are just a reflection of the person
playing, we view our guildmates as friends. To that end, we should stop at
nothing to help our guildmates out in time of need, never let our pride get in
the way of another’s happiness, and above all else, show respect to each and
every person not just within our guild but throughout Norrath.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align="justify"><font size="4"><b>F</b></font>urthermore
we believe that <b><font color="#993366">Honor </font></b><font color="#000000">(Respect,
Admiration, Credit, Reputation)</font>, <b><font color="#993366">Valor </font></b><font color="#000000">(Spirit,

and <font color="#993366"> <b>Loyalty</b>   </font><font color="#000000">(Faithfulness,
Devotion, Allegiance, Trustworthiness, Reliability, Dependability) </font>should be at the very foundation
of every decision we make and everything that we do. These very basic principles
are what make us strong as a guild and will make us known and respected
throughout Norrath. In order to achieve these principles, one must strive to
fight for justice with a fair and even hand, be willing to sacrifice -&nbsp;
even at the cost of ones own life, and show compassion towards those in need.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align="justify"><i><b><font size="4">C</font></b>arpe
Diem Sodalitas</i> was never founded to be a &quot;raiding&quot; guild.&nbsp; We
do not have plans to one day be &quot;uber&quot; in the usual sense of the
word.&nbsp; Our goal is to maintain a level of closeness that cannot be matched
by many in Norrath.&nbsp; <i>Carpe Diem</i> has been specifically designed to be
a guild in which we can all appreciate each other for who we are and appreciate
the experiences and interactions we have within the game.&nbsp; Each and every
one of us likes to see new places, do new things and get experience but that is
not always our main focus.&nbsp; &quot;Seizing the day&quot; means different
things to different people. To some it may mean guild raids, to others it may
mean just sitting somewhere and chatting all night. However, as a whole, <i>Carpe</i>
is not a guild that focuses its attentions on raiding.&nbsp; Because our
philosophy is what it is, we have a closer bunch of people than most guilds who
truly enjoy each others' company. Sure sometimes there are frustrations but most
of the time we are experiencing them together which gives us something to bring
us closer as a guild.&nbsp; Will we raid? Yup! Sure we will. Will we get
experience? Yup! Sure we will. Will we have a good time in the process?&nbsp; <b>Absolutely!</b>&nbsp;
There will always be sights to be seen, many mobs to fight, and in time, we will
see it all and do it all.&nbsp; But in the meantime, it doesn't hurt to stop and
smell the roses.</p>
<h1 align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>What We Expect From Our Officers:</b></font></h1>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">W</font></b>hat is a Guild Officer?</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">W</font></b>e see the function of a guild
officer to be something of great responsibility. Being an officer is not
something that someone should enter into lightly because it means always putting
the needs of your guild members ahead of your own. A guild officer should be
nothing more than an extension of the guild leader. This means that an officer
should be intimately knowledgeable of the charter and rules of the guild. They
should be made to feel comfortable in enforcing them and while they should not
wear their rank on their shoulder, they should both be mindful and proud of the
fact at all times. An officer should feel comfortable in assisting the leader in
leading the guild and ruling with a fair and even hand. Being an officer is not
a popularity contest - and having the title of &quot;Officer&quot; does not
immediately make you popular. With that said, it <b>is</b> important that the
officer be liked as well as respected. They should not be afraid to address
issues and enforce the bylaws of the guild even if it is an unpopular decision.
An officer should be able to not only take directive but give it as well.
Likewise, an officer should always be aware of guild needs and wants and help to
contribute in any way possible to realize them.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer should be mindful of
the following guidelines at all times:</p>
<p align="justify">1. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>bove all else, keep in mind
that <b><font color="#993366">Honor</font></b> (Respect, Admiration, Credit,
Reputation), <b><font color="#993366">Valor</font></b> (Spirit, Bravery,
Courage, Nerve, Boldness) and <b><font color="#993366">Loyalty</font></b>
(Faithfulness, Devotion, Allegiance, Trustworthiness, Reliability,
Dependability) are the basis for everything that we do. This means that an
officer should strive to maintain a very high level of these three traits not
only within himself/herself, it also means they must strive to maintain that
same level within the members of the guild.</p>
<p align="justify">2. <b><font size="4">M</font></b>embers needs should always
come before an officer's needs. If a member needs something and it is a
reasonable request an officer's duty requires them to drop what they are doing
(if what they are doing is not guild related) and handle it. Reasonable requests
are requests such as resolving disputes between members, disputes with other
guilds or players and other issues that might help out a guild member in need.
It does not require officers to do things such as port on demand, camp things
that lower level people might not be able to get, give things that an officer
might have that someone else wants etc. These acts are things that are to be
done at the discretion of the officer and are not required.</p>
<p align="justify">3. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer should take an
active role within the guild that goes beyond what they might do as a typical
member. This means actively involving ones self in guild chat, any events that
the guild plans, and helping out with any special programs that the guild might
have (such as guild bank etc). In the event that an officer cannot make a guild
planned event, they should be sure to be very active within guild chat enticing
other members to come to the event.</p>
<p align="justify">4. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer should be very
active on the forum. Merely checking the forum regularly is not enough. An
officer should feel free to post new topics - even if it is something simple in
order to help spark conversation. Since our guild is based on a family type
philosophy, it is important that our family speak with each other. And it is
very important that our family see that officers are very actively involved.</p>
<p align="justify">5. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer should take part
in all officer meetings. Granted, sometimes real life issues come into play,
however, officers should make it a priority if to attend the meetings as this is
one of the few chances everyone gets to handle the issues that are presented to
the guild at that time. We do not have meetings all that often so it is
extremely important that the officers make use of the Officer's Forum. It is our
connection to each other. If there are issues that need to be addressed, ideas
that could be of use to the guild, or requests for anything from each other -
the Officer Forum is the place to do so. Just an hello is sometimes all that is
needed.</p>
<p align="justify">6. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer is a friend to the
guild. This means that they are a friend to <b>all</b> those in the guild. An
officer only needs to exercise his status as an officer or someone in a position
of authority in the event of a problem. Otherwise it is the duty of each officer
to strive to establish lasting friendships with other members of the guild. This
includes making sure that all members feel valued and appreciated within the
guild. Saying hello to them when they log in and goodnight when they log off is
simply not enough. As officers, we need to try to establish a bond with each
member of our family. We also need to encourage all members to actively want to
establish that bond between themselves and every member of the guild.</p>
<p align="justify">7. <b><font size="4">A</font></b>n officer should feel like
an extension of the guild leaders. This means that they should not be afraid to
enforce rules as handed down by the leaders. Furthermore an officer should not
hesitate to carry out any request given by a guild leader. An officer is
expected to think for him/her self. This means that the guild leaders will rely
on the best judgment of an officer and fully support the officer in any decision
made by that officer.</p>
