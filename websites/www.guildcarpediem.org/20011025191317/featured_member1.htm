        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">I </font></b>started my online
        gaming experience with Ultima Online quite sometime after it was
        released. A real life friend purchased it and asked me to join him in
        the world of Britannia, and the game was fun.....for a time. I soon
        realized how much of an impact other people had on each other in this
        type of game. Hard earned gold that took many hours to obtain was taken
        away in seconds by greedy children that knew how to &quot;hack&quot; the
        trade window. I was stolen from, ruthlessly killed and laughed at by
        other players that were far stronger than I. My account was quickly
        cancelled with an oath to never return to this type of game.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">W</font></b>hen Everquest was
        released....I laughed! Their was simply no way I was returning to the
        type of game where people preyed on each other. I had been looking for
        something, anything, where people HELPED each other. It didn't exist.
        All people cared about was killing each other and taking things that had
        taken others days or even weeks to acquire. More power to them....but I
        was not going to be involved.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">I</font></b>t was not until later
        that I realized how the Everquest servers were set up. This threw new
        light on the situation and after some very careful research about this
        game I decided to give it a try. My friend purchased it as well and
        together we first set foot upon Norrath. At first things went well but
        after achieving a few levels together we found we would be needing
        others to group with in order to progress. Two more friends of ours
        decided to buy the game and join in our adventures and once again the
        game became enjoyable. It was something to look forward to in the
        evening hours =)</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">W</font></b>e had no idea what lay
        ahead for us in the weeks ahead. We found out in order to fight
        successfully each of us had to be there. The warrior (tank), cleric,
        enchanter and wizard. If the warrior had a date that night we found
        there was no reason to play at all as we simply could not survive. The
        next night the enchanter was absent and we were overwhelmed by sheer
        numbers of MoBs and slaughtered. Simply put we could not all play at the
        same time, therefore why play at all. We simply could not achieve
        anything unless all members were there to contribute. We attempted to
        add other members to our group but we leveled far too slowly for one of
        them and she decided to travel another road. Yet another member was
        forced to quit Everquest due to lack of time to play. Even my friends,
        with the exception of one, became casual gamers only playing once or
        twice a week and then one of them left for good. I became forced to rely
        on pickup groups in order to gain any experience and most of the time
        all these groups did is argue and bicker among themselves. The game was
        no longer fun =(</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">H</font></b>owever, something had
        happened while fighting in a pickup group near the spires in South
        Karana. Something had happened to me that was very strange. I had found
        a friend. As most of you know I don't post very much and I talk even
        less so most people find me to be very anti-social. I have had some
        really bad experiences with people so I have found it best to just not
        talk much. My newfound friend seemed not to mind and unlike me it seemed
        everyone in Norrath was her friend. She was known and loved by all. I
        had met Rainfeather.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">I</font></b>n the days ahead, she
        introduced me to two other wonderful people with whom I would begin to
        share a strong friendship with. Their names were Supajeenyus and
        Melodious Sunnyskies. I readily accepted an invitation to a guild they
        were starting and asked that my friend, (the one that had always been
        there for me) be allowed to join too.<font SIZE="2"></font></td>
