<h1 align="center">&quot;...Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one
less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.&quot; -- &quot;The Road
Not Taken&quot; by Robert Frost</h1>
<p align="justify">There are many places along life's highways when a person
comes to a crossroad... Carpe came to that crossroad a long time ago.&nbsp; When
we were first putting together our ideas and goals for the guild, we decided
then and there that Carpe would be like no other guild.&nbsp; We would strive to
become the ideal guild - a family atmosphere where people came before the
game... and yet in game we would be able to raid effectively and stealthily.&nbsp;
We knew that we would not have the numbers or class make up that other &quot;uber&quot;
guilds have, therefore we had to depend on our mental capabilities - to plan
ahead, think of all possibilities, and to execute with precision... all the
while without sacrificing our beliefs of the individual at the keyboard - the
friendships we form -&nbsp; being far more important than any loot we can
acquire in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Choosing YOUR path in EverQuest</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Verant didn't say it would be easy to become level 60, grab
  all the best loot in the game, and continue to spend &quot;fun&quot; times
  with all the people you have met in Norrath.&nbsp; This page is an attempt to
  describe the changes you will face when you reach that magical Planar level.&nbsp;
  This is not a subtle change, and they don't warn you about this when you start
  your characters.&nbsp; It is a change that can either drive you to attain
  level 60, or make you so frustrated with high level characters that you give
  up all together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="4">Leveling from 1-45</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Going from level 1 to level 45 is basically a consistent
  process.&nbsp; Not much changes with fighting style, how many people you fight
  with to get experience, the looting policies, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Some people embrace the change.&nbsp; They like raids.&nbsp;
  They like being around more than one group of people.&nbsp; They like the
  chaos and bigger mobs. They understand that to get all of this stuff, they
  have to work more toward a schedule and not just &quot;show up when I feel
  like it&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Some people resist the change.&nbsp; They like the idea of
  coming to Norrath whenever it suits them - no schedules to keep or mandatory
  raiding policies to follow.&nbsp; They don't understand why they don't get
  experience in the Planes, or why they have to help other people get items
  (epics) and they don't get anything of their own.&nbsp; They get impatient
  when raid leaders spend time organizing groups or when they don't get in the
  &quot;experience group&quot;.&nbsp; They have been able to do this for 45
  levels, why change game play strategy now?</p>
  <p align="justify">How you choose to move forward post level 45 will directly
  reflect the kind of guild you would do best in.&nbsp; Carpe Diem has been
  dealing with the issues of &quot;What kind of guild are we&quot; since we
  first realized our planar capabilities.&nbsp; There is no middle road here
  folks, and the explanation for that is listed below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="4">What changes at level 46?</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Basically, the answer is simple.&nbsp; It no longer
  requires only ONE group to take down a mob, or to succeed in a zone.&nbsp; It
  oftentimes take 2 or 3 or 8 full groups of people to succeed in a certain area
  of Norrath.&nbsp; The Planes of Hate, Fear, Growth, Sky, etc. were all
  designed for RAIDING - meaning multiple groups of people must go in order to
  succeed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">What are the complaints that some guild leaders hear from
  their members at around level 46?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="justify">Why isn't my group getting experience?
    <li>
      <p align="justify">Why is it taking so long for us to get started?
    <li>
      <p align="justify">Why are epic quests so hard?
    <li>
      <p align="justify">Why do I have to help others with their epic quests?
    <li>
      <p align="justify">Why didn't I get any loot today?</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">This brings with it lots of issues.&nbsp; Experience only
  goes to one group of people instead of to all that participate in killing a
  single mob.&nbsp; The loot that drops here is rare, so if 54 people show up to
  a raid, it is not likely that 54 pieces of loot are going to drop.&nbsp; It is
  VERY VERY common for people to go on a planar raid, and come back with NO loot
  and with LESS experience than when they left (because you can die a lot in the
  Planes).&nbsp; This causes SO MUCH FRUSTRATION - don't blame it on your raid
  leaders - Verant designed it this way.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>So ... it is time to choose your path</b>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="justify">You can resist the way Verant has designed the game for
      post level 45 and continue to level and group and get loot as you have
      done for the last 45 levels.&nbsp; You would be more inclined to join a <b><a href="#The Family Guild:"><font color="#800000">FAMILY
      GUILD</font></a></b>.
    <li>
      <p align="justify">You can accept that your game strategy has to change -
      if you change with it, so too will your &quot;monetary&quot; rewards.&nbsp;
      You would probably do best in a <b><a href="#The Raiding Guild:"><font color="#800000">RAIDING
      GUILD</font></a></b>.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="justify">You can decide that you don't like being placed in a
      box.&nbsp; You are not a mouse in a maze.&nbsp; You can break the Verant
      barrier!&nbsp; THAT'S what Carpe Diem has decided to do.&nbsp; We will
      forever be a family oriented guild that can raid... and raid well!&nbsp;
      We strive to be the <b><a href="#The Ideal Guild"><font color="#800000">IDEAL
      GUILD</font></a></b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#800000"><a name="The Family Guild:">The
Family Guild:</a></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">What are the characteristics of a Family Guild?&nbsp; The
  people in these guilds have one thing in common - they like to have FUN!&nbsp;
  They like to talk a lot!&nbsp; Guild chat is usually a constant flurry of
  chatter and jokes.&nbsp; Impromptu little raids tend to spawn up all over the
  place.&nbsp; More often than not, you will see many of the higher-level
  characters in this guild helping out the lower-levels.&nbsp; These guilds like
  to get together for Nekkid Gnome Runs and parties at the Arena.&nbsp; Weddings
  are commonplace in guilds such as these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Strengths of the Family Guild lie in it's people.&nbsp;
  Guild members are genuinely helpful to their fellow guild members.&nbsp; Doing
  things on the spur of the moment is commonplace - they don't live much by
  schedules.&nbsp; There generally aren't a lot of rules to follow in the Family
  Guild.&nbsp; The focus of these guilds is to enjoy yourself, and rules such as
  raiding requirements or time you spend in Norrath generally gets in the way of
  the fun.&nbsp; In addition, the participation requirements for leadership in a
  Family Guild are not nearly as strict as they are in a Raiding Guild.</p>
  <p align="justify">The Weaknesses of the Family Guild lie in its
  &quot;End-Game Progress&quot;.&nbsp; Due to a lax attitude on raid
  participation or punctuality, Family Guilds have a consistent problem in
  making raids work.&nbsp; Since there are generally no requirements for
  attendance, larger raids are difficult to schedule appropriately, harder to
  get started, and even harder to finish successfully.&nbsp; Members of Family
  Guilds can go and come as they please, so having the necessary people there to
  run the raid from start to finish is a seldom occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Because of this inability to have consistently successful
  raids, the turnover rate (or rate at which members leave for other guilds) is
  relatively high for Family Guilds.&nbsp; Many high level people are attracted
  to the family atmosphere of these guilds, but frustrated at their lack of
  in-game progress, and will leave to find other guilds that can provide the
  loot and new zones that they are hoping to experience.&nbsp; Family Guilds can
  get very put-out with this, claiming that those who leave are &quot;obsessed
  with loot&quot;, and &quot;good riddance to you anyway!&quot;.&nbsp; But the
  Family Guilds that have this attitude have failed to notice that Verant
  designed the game for incredible loots at this level, and encourages
  characters to attain the most they possibly can.&nbsp; Family Guilds need to
  understand that if they do not provide their members a way to get their epic
  weapons or keys to the best zones in the game and the best loot, that <b>THEY
  WILL LOSE HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE</b>.&nbsp; It is just the nature of the beast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">What are the characteristics of a Raiding Guild?&nbsp;
  These are the guilds on your sever that people generally refer to as &quot;uber&quot;.&nbsp;
  They have all the best loot, take on all the best zones, and are the envy of
  all the 14 year olds who want to check out Veeshan's Peak next week when they
  hit level 46.&nbsp; You will constantly see these guilds battling dragons and
  gods and can wipe out a Plane in less than a few hours.</p>
  <p align="justify">The Strengths of Raiding Guilds lies in it's efficiency and
  progress.&nbsp; Raiding Guilds in general are very structured - lots of rules,
  with required attendance at raids and punctuality guidelines.&nbsp; Some go so
  far as to require a certain number of hours a day that you play on the game,
  or certain times of the day that you are logged in.&nbsp; Guild chat for
  Raiding Guilds is reserved primarily for raid communication, and there is a
  lot less &quot;fun&quot; chat than you would see in a Family Guild.</p>
  <p align="justify">Raiding Guilds have a lot to be proud of.&nbsp; Members of
  these guilds kill the top mobs with efficiency, obtain the best loot, and make
  raids work on a consistent basis.&nbsp; Members of Raiding Guilds are the
  first to get their epic weapons.&nbsp; They like to go for the brass ring -
  NOTHING is too big for them, and they will do anything in their power to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Raiding Guilds are not without their weaknesses though.&nbsp;
  Due to their &quot;constantly on&quot; behavior, they oftentimes lose sight of
  the human experience behind each of the character.&nbsp; Generally speaking,
  Raiding Guild members are gruff, to the point, and always down to business.&nbsp;
  They don't have the patience for repeated failures, or people who don't know
  how to play their characters.&nbsp; And they have no problem saying to your
  face that you messed up!&nbsp; This impatience and assertiveness can cause
  problems in the guild, especially for those members who still focus on fun as
  the overall goal of the game.&nbsp; It's no longer &quot;just a game&quot; to
  many Raiding Guilds.&nbsp; Real life takes backseat to game obligations.&nbsp;
  Shape up or Ship out is the new motto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
