access his account log on and rez them immediately.&nbsp; <b>This is to stop
now.</b></p>
<p><b><font size="4">T</font></b>here are 3 persons in the guild other than Ben
himself who have access to Ben. Melo, Supa, and Aamon. It is solely up to those
3 as to whether or not Ben will be logged in to rez a guildmate. Normally, if at
all possible, we are happy to log Ben on - especially Supa and I because we have
a 3rd computer to do this from. Aamon, however, is forced to log off and then
log back in. This is time consuming so be prepared to wait a bit for him.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">A</font></b>gain, logging Ben on is not an obligation that
is owed to you. Do not demand it. Do not throw a fit if Ben is not logged on. Do
not threaten an officer or other member of this guild.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">I</font></b>t is not that we do not want to rez you.
Ideally we would love for every guild member to always get a rez. However, there
are times when it is either impossible or will have to wait. If you are told to
wait, then you have a choice. Either do so patiently or go find your own rez
from an outside source.<br>

  <p><b><i>Quote:</i></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="right">
  4. I have noticed lately that there has been a bit more begging or asking to
  be PL'd or items given to equip you. I want to say a few words on that. First
  of all, we are not a guild that just PLs it's members for the sake of getting
  high levels. We will help you with a new character as much as we can - and
  that may or may not include watching over your newbie bottom while you try to
  take on 4 mobs just because you have Rimmon's wonderful buffs. I am working on
  the guild bank (I know - very slow in coming but I have been sort of
  preoccupied). This bank will be of a great help to most secondary characters.
  But we will NOT beg for help nor will we expect it of others simply because we
  asked. Each member would love to be able to drop what they are doing - and
  many do - just to be able to help when the call comes in. However, they are
  not at anyone's beck and call. To abuse the friendship that we all have by
  demanding or repeatedly asking so that the person being asked feels so guilty
  that he/she relents is NOT acceptable Carpe behavior.<br>
