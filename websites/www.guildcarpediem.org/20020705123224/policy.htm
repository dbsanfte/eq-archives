      <h1 align="center"><b><font color="#800000">RAID ETIQUETTE</font></b></h1>
      <p align="justify">1. First and foremost,<b> be on time</b>. It is highly
      recommended that you get there at least a half an hour before raid time to
      make setting up groups easier and possibly send in a scouting group ahead
      of time. We have plenty of porters to help get people to raids. However,
      if no porters are on, it is your responsibility to get to the raid,
      whether that means donating for an outside-the-guild port, or running it
      the old fashioned way.&nbsp; Please do not come on at the scheduled raid
      time and expect someone to come fetch you. It's not going to happen.&nbsp;
      <b>The event will have an official starting time called by the leader -
      that means that unless the leader says so, no others may join after that
      time.</b></p>
      <p align="justify">2. When you get to the appointed meeting spot, <b>keep
      your mouth shut and your ears</b> (eyes I suppose in this world we type
      in) <b>open</b>. Have patience with those setting up the raid, and show
      some respect. No wandering around trying to get in some exp while we wait,
      no dueling, no goofing off in general. If you guys want play days, we can
      set those up. Raids are when things get down to business.</p>
      <p align="justify">3. <b>Use the designated chat channel for the raid.</b>
      We may have guests from outside the guild on the raid, and they need to be
      kept just as informed as we are. Even if the raid or event is only going
      to be <i>Carpe</i> only, it helps to have all directions given in the
      designated chat channel with questions being asked in guild (if only <i>Carpes</i>
      are attending). I would prefer that if groups have been formed, you direct
      your questions to your Group Leader as they may have an answer for you
      without involving the entire raid. Do not hound the Raid Leader or your
      Group Leader with tells. They have enough to deal with during these
      situations. That being said, if you have a question please ask it. Better
      to be bothered with a question than to have to do an extensive or even a
      single corpse run.</p>
      <p align="justify">4. Once groups are called, buffing will start. <b>Do
      not start hounding</b> the chanter for clarity, or the cleric for symbol,
      or anything else. If you are a buffer, and have questions as to what buffs
      are needed for the current situation, ask. Otherwise, get buffing. If
      someone misses a buff after it seems that everyone is ready, let your
      Group Leader know. They are the ones that will keep the raid leader
      apprised of the readiness of the group.</p>
      <p align="justify">5. <b>Know your role!</b> We have an entire section
      dedicated to knowing what your role in a raid should be. If you have
      questions about what you should be doing, ask ahead of time. As always,
      direct questions to your Group Leader first.</p>
      <p align="justify">6. <b>Pay attention! </b>Nothing is more frustrating
      than having to repeat instructions five times because someone is not
      paying attention to the task at hand. Listen closely when the plans for
      the raid are being laid out. If you have questions, direct them to your
      Group Leader. If we work together, things will go a lot more smoothly.</p>
      <p align="justify">7. <b>Do not go AFK for extended periods of time.</b>
      If you need to go afk, let your Group Leader know. GL's let the raid
      leader and their group know if they need a quick afk.</p>
      <p align="justify">8. <b>Do not train the raid.</b> If you are pulling,
      and think you've bitten off more than the raid can handle, die. Plain and
      simple. Do not bring the entire mess right on top of the rest of us. We
      should have clerics available to rez you and get you right back in the
      raid. The death of one is a lot easier to recoup that the wipe out of an
      entire raid.</p>
      <p align="justify">9. <b>Do NOT whine.</b>&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Plain and
      simple.&nbsp; I do not want to hear someone whining that they are not
      getting exp.&nbsp; If you want exp, go find an exp group and grind, that's
      not what we are raiding for. Loot? I don't even want to hear any
      complaining about it.&nbsp; ML's will be assigned for each and every
      group. What does that mean? That means that one person per group will be
      looting the kills that their group got the exp for. The only loot that
      will be given out during any raid will be No Drops. Droppables will be
      dealt with at the end of the raid unless otherwise stated by the Raid
      Leader. Ninja looting will not be tolerated. In general, <i>Carpe's</i>
      loot policy is Need Before Greed. If any loot rules will be in effect
      other than our standard NBG policy, they will be stated at the beginning
      of the raid.</p>

      entire conversation has changed from fun to unease.<br>
      <br>
      As a general rule, guild discussion of an idea is great. But when it boils
      down to just two or so people arguing in guild chat about something the
      rest of the guild either does not want to participate in or has already

      it to log into the game and watch as people continually argue over every
      comment mentioned? How relaxin is it to see other guild members talk down
      to one another? How enjoyable is it to be forced into the position of
      either turning off guildchat entirely to avoid a few who refuse to show
      respect for the entire guild?<br>
      <br>
      If any guild member has an issue about the content of guildchat they are
      to:<br>
      <br>
      a: Take it up with that member IN TELLS in a civil manner (it is however,
      appropriate for guild members/officers to SAY in guildchat to take it to
      tells...if the offending party does not, send them a private tell,
      otherwise see point b)<br>
      <br>
      b: If resistance is met, contact an officer in game or email the guild
      leader immediately upon logging. You are responsible for maintaining your
      OWN dignity in all matters of guildchat. Do not continue to participate in
      negative modes of guildchat...contact an officer.<br>

        4. I have noticed lately that there has been a bit more begging or
        asking to be PL'd or items given to equip you. I want to say a few words
        on that. First of all, we are not a guild that just PLs it's members for
        the sake of getting high levels. We will help you with a new character
        as much as we can - and that may or may not include watching over your
        newbie bottom while you try to take on 4 mobs just because you have
        Rimmon's wonderful buffs. I am working on the guild bank (I know - very
        slow in coming but I have been sort of preoccupied). This bank will be
        of a great help to most secondary characters. But we will NOT beg for
        help nor will we expect it of others simply because we asked. Each
        member would love to be able to drop what they are doing - and many do -
        just to be able to help when the call comes in. However, they are not at
        anyone's beck and call. To abuse the friendship that we all have by
        demanding or repeatedly asking so that the person being asked feels so
        guilty that he/she relents is NOT acceptable <i>Carpe</i> behavior.<br>

      <br>
      1. Porting guild members is not required. Just because your character has

      2. Polite requests for porting should be honored when it is convenient for
      the person doing the porting. We are a family and family should help each
      other out. But once again, it is not required.<br>
      <br>
      3. Abuse of members who can port will not be tolerated. Just because a
      guild druid or wizard is on does not mean that you (the non porting
      member) can badger and beg and plead until you get your way. If you ask in
      guild for a port and are told to either wait or that it is not possible at
      this time, there is no reason to be rude, angry, and/or argumentative. And
      constantly asking to be ported here and there is a form of abuse. You can
      tell in guild chat if a guild porter is busy or not. If they are, then
      seek other ways to travel. Take a boat. Run. Walk. Ask a non guild porter.
      Send tells to our allied guilds. No matter what, be respectful...to our
      guild, other guilds, and total strangers. Porting is not owed to you for
      any reason.<br>

      There are times when exceptions are made - and if you feel that your case
      is an exception then ask in guild chat if a guild cleric could help you.
      If you are told no, there will be no begging, guilt tripping, or tantrum
      throwing. You are not owed a resurrection.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      The use of Ben for resurrecting has gotten out of hand. Members who know
      him personally are demanding that those of us who can access his account
      log on and resurrect them immediately. <!--EZCODE BOLD START-->
      <b>This is to stop now.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->
      <br>
      <br>
      There are 3 persons in the guild other than Ben himself who have access to
      Ben. Melo, Supa, and Aamon. It is solely up to those 3 as to whether or
      not Ben will be logged in to resurrect a guildmate. Normally, if at all
      possible, we are happy to log Ben on - especially Supa and I because we
      have a 3rd computer to do this from. Aamon, however, is forced to log off
      and then log back in. This is time consuming so be prepared to wait a bit
      for him.<br>
      <br>
      Again, logging Ben on is not an obligation that is owed to you. Do not
      demand it. Do not throw a fit if Ben is not logged on. Do not threaten an
      officer or other member of this guild.<br>
      <br>
      It is not that we do not want to resurrect you. Ideally we would love for
      every guild member to always get a resurrection. However, there are times
      when it is either impossible or will have to wait. If you are told to
      wait, then you have a choice. Either do so patiently or go find your own
      resurrection from an outside source.<br>

      If you have a second infraction that is more than 30 days apart from your
      first infraction, you will be treated as if it is your first infraction.
      However, if a pattern develops, or the infractions are severe enough,
      appropriate actions will be taken.<br>
