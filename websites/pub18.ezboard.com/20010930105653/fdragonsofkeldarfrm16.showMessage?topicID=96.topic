We initially had only 6 of the 12 people signed up, but Nottaa called a friend and we had the assistance of Briarose 50+ level druid.  This gave us a warrior, wizard, cleric, druid, necro and enchanter in the group and the druid tagging along with us.<br>
<br>
At 6:15am we were not the first group trying to get there, but the other group was stuck at the zone having already suffered some losses, so went past them.  About 3 spawn areas in a guy came running past us with about 5 imps on his tail.  We evac'd and tried again.<br>
<br>
This time we made it to the spawn point and set up camp.  We killed the placeholder and several of us took a break before the expected spawn time.  Just as everyone was getting back we had 2 imps spawn on us killing Briarrose and our necro (who were the two highest level folks there).  The rest of us toughed it out, killing one imp and had victory in sight against the other imp when another imp and a greater kobald wandered through.  Nottaa's last words before dying were &quot;Evacuate now&quot; and we did.<br>
<br>
Coffins were purchased in Paineel (something I did not know you could do), rezs were performed and we tried again, but never made it back to the spawn point.  Briarose died a couple more times and I died (I would not consider it to be a real DoK event if I didn't die) but everyone got rezs.<br>
<br>
We didn't get any GEBs, but everyone considered the raid to be sucessful.  We all had a great time, I got 7 and a half blue bubbles of experience (I was the lowest level person there - in a tie with the druid) AND we learned some lessons.  We also had some problems that maybe someone can give suggestions on:<br>
<br>
What I learned:<br>
- Be early at all cost!  No matter how hateful the hour of the morning is.  There were 4 of us at the ring on time.<br>
- If you are a large race, shrink potions are as essential as peridots.  We had some bad problems trying to get Nottaa shrunk as her 10 dose shrink potion dwindled to nothingness.  Every evac, every rez, etc... means another shrink.  As an alternative I have offered to get Bearbane to the raids when I go in order to shrink folks.  Unless you have 2 shamen signed up or you are positive at least one will be there, buy shrink potions.  They make wonderful Christmas presents.<br>
- Enchanters should add to their raid homework reading up on how hard mobs are to mez.  At one point Nottaa was trying to keep me alive by switching targets becasue I my mez was resisted about 4 in 5 times on mobs.  This made it hard when the mez finally did go off.  Any suggestions?  Should I have waited before trying to mez them?  Is this just a hazard of the profession?<br>
- Don't go to bed 2 hours before your first big raid and think you will get any sleep.  A sleep deprived enchantress is nobody's friend -- including their own.  Near the end I was having a hard time concentrating and even clicking on the targets.<br>
<br>
What we did right!<br>
We got there with 7 people!  Obviously, we did something very well.  We had a nice mix of folks.  We did not train others in the zone (thank you Mr. Running-man in blue).  We were ready for the probability that the camp would be taken and had other plans.  We all stayed around until everyone was rezd and safe.  We all had fun (this was the feedback I was getting). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/unottaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nottaa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/6/01 9:34:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.thekevster.net/misc/saureye.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: GEB raid in Sol B</span><hr size=1> I really did have a great time!<br>
<br>
It was fun.  I learned a lot too.  It seemed at every evac, we picked some others up and sadly lost eledaar.  We think he fell asleep at the keyboard!!!<br>
<br>
I wish we could have gotten boots for everyone, but maybe next time.  <br>
<br>
I would like to do this again and maybe host a howling stones key raid too.  GEBs is so hard to get to in my opinion and while we were going up, there is always competion.  It's a race to the room.  It's crazy.<br>

I think the raid went pretty good, though I want to gain 44 by the time this is attempted again so I have 4 more levels behind me for slows.<br>
<br>
Don't know about mez, but here is how slows went for me:<br>
<br>
Imps: 3-4 tries<br>
Lava Duct Crawlers: 1-2<br>
Lava guardians: usually 1<br>
Lava beetle 1-2<br>
<br>
This should be a lot better at 44. <p>Jaeden Avengarious<BR>

Sounds to me like you learned VOLUMES in raid procedure.   It might have been a tad ugly, but you will draw on that experience for a long time to come.  (*cough* been there, had to have my body summoned)<br>
<br>
For you &quot;Extra Size&quot; ladies (or men), yes, shrink is a MUST.  It is...........well.....amazingly hard for some folks to get beside or past you to hit a MoB.<br>
<br>
If you raid, be timely.  I'll leave this subject alone before my military background comes screaming back from the past.<br>

I called the others at 5:45 when i was logging on, so it worked out well.  And, we lost Eledaar due to sleep deprivation but, Runn logged in just in time and we picked him up when Eledaar fell asleep.  Fenrix logged on later and sat around waiting for us to evac again!  Well, that worked, cuz we did evac and then gained Fenrix and Jae!  Jae was a great help with the shrinks!  I love shamans!!<br>
<br>
Anyways, I have to sleep.  Hate raid in the AM.  Man, I really need to get exp. one day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jae, I'll look into the howling stones key raid.  It would be perfect for me to host, but I want to check into it more before I set a date.<br>

I went to the Efretti spawn at 49 (and made 50 there!) and didn't have much trouble with mezzing.  I see it a lot in Seb where I will fight some higher level mobs (Krups, Illis) where they are level 49-52ish.  At 51/ 52, I had a very tough time keeping them mezzed, or mezzing them at all.  Now, it is much, much easier (at 54).  So I would say a few more levels and it will be easier.  Tash also seems to help some, but I would chalk it up mainly to levels. <p><html>

Tash is a must if you're getting a lot of resists.  If you have a shaman along and the shaman slows in tandem with you mezing you can bounce the mobs back and forth till mez sticks.  I've talked to a lot of high level, long time enchanters and they swear that cha has NO benifit on mezzing, it's all based on level.  Having only had my cha up beyond 120 recently I tend to agree with their mezzing/cha views.  When I have problems getting a mez to stick I'll tash it after the first resist right after I've stunned it.  The only problem with stunning a target to tash it for mez is that all our stuns are ae effect and bring out the agro on all mobs.  As long as the person healing me is prepared I can stun/tash/mez for crowd control.<br>
