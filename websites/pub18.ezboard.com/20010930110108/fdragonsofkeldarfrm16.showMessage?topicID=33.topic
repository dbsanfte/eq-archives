I TRULY hope many more also post from their experiences in this zone.  This will be a long post.  I need a caster to make a post here, for I don't know which spells work and do not work.<br>
<br>
General Information about the dwarves:<br>
They cannot be mezed.  They also have extremely high magic resist in general, and aggro very easily on the casters.  It seems that the casters have to wait a great deal of time before nuking so they do not aggro.  All mobs randomly drop rare spells, always drop Icewell Shields, and Velium weapons of some sort or another.  All can dual wield, and when dual wielding should be considered a much greater threat.<br>
<br>
Icewell Sentry - Lowest level (45-48) hits for 130 tops.  Located on the bottom floor and outside the keep. Drop Royal Frosted Velium Boots and Gloves.<br>
Icewell Sentinel - Higher level (50-54) hits for 180 tops.  Located on the second floor of the keep.  Some are named.  Drop Royal Frosted Velium Arms, Helm, an Bracers.<br>
Watcher Scots (Or any other names) - Higher level (56-57) hits for up to 230.  Drops Royal Frosted Velium BP and legs.<br>
Royal Guards (Named) - Higher level (56-57) hit same as Watchers.  Drop nothing significant.  Give Tormax faction.<br>
<br>
The "uber" items drop off the Three named that are all 60+ mobs.  The Chamberlain, the Seneschal, and the Dain.  I have fought all but the Dain.  The Chamberlain hits hard, but is not hard to take down with 3 groups.  The Seneschal hits incredibly hard, and has as much hp as the Chamberlain, and requires much more people at sub 55.  Both mobs are tanks, and do not really cast.  The chamberlain casts some, but mostly melees (I never got hit by a spell, but he drops caster items).<br>
<br>
Right Moat or Right CY-<br>
The ideal place to do a raid for the dwarves.  The pathing is nice, they are far from any aid, and it is easy to get to, and close to the zone out.<br>
Left Moat or Left CY-<br>
Not as far from the Keep as RCY.  Mobs can path through the wall and die there, the corpses being lost.  I reported this, but knowing Verant, it will be fixed sometime 2003.  Take the RCY over this if you can.<br>
Basement-<br>
If one is just out to get royal frosted velium bps and legs, there is a basement area where one very low level mob spawns, and the watchers are just up the stairs, waiting to be pulled.  Requires a monk puller.  No zone out.  It is the staircase between the two first floor watchers.  Invis to go down and get past them, kill the lower npc, pull the watchers down.<br>
Stairs-<br>
Some prefer this to the CYs.  No mobs path through the stairs, so they are decent camping spots.  The stairs on the 2nd to 3rd floor are good for pulling Royals.  Very unsafe if one moves from the staircase.  Requires an attentive group of raiders that don't goof off (harder to get than you think).  Requires a monk puller.<br>
<br>
Pulling strategies-<br>
The level 60 strategy:<br>
sentries do not aid pulled mobs if the puller is level 60.  This allows pullers to single pull most 1st floor mobs, and 2nd floor mobs.  Once the second floor is clear, it is not hard to pull the third floor royals at night (when the Dain is asleep and moves to a back room.)<br>
The Monk Strategy:<br>
A monk pulls the mobs, and FDs, and the highest level tank pulls off with a range weapon.  Basic strategy.<br>
<br>
Pulling Royals:<br>
Royals can only be pulled at night, as they surround the Dain.  The Dain retires to his chambers when it is night time, and the Royals can then be pulled without aggroing the Dain.<br>
<br>
Multi-pulls:<br>
If pulling two mobs, and they are of higher level, have the highest tank hold one of the mobs while a cleric chain CHs him as the rest of the raid kills the other mob.  This is identical to the PoG strategy.  If one gets three, the best tip is to just zone out unless one has 3 very high level tanks and 3 high level clerics.  More than three means zone out.<br>
<br>
Missing Strategies:<br>
I am not sure on what nukes would be effective (other than lure) and I am not sure on a Dain fighting strategy.  If one is knowledgeable of these, please post.<br>
<br>
Final Tips:<br>
-Don't waste time on the outside walls, the most outer Sentries have a slim drop rate.<br>
-Always be ready to zone.<br>
-NEVER nuke a mob under the Ice of the moat.  They CAN and DO come through the ice, and can VERY quickly wipe out a party.  However, the mobs from below can be mezed for a zone out.<br>
-If one aggroes the Dain, DIE, and get a necro.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps anyone planning to raid Icewell.  If you have any additional comments or suggestions or experiences, PLEASE POST.  Thanks. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

Nice write up.  Personally, I haven't decided if I am going to kill dorfs or giants in Velious. (I am truly Velious challenged.  I went the first day with Kubla, then didn't go back until I fought with Gnomer and Elmira in Crystal Caverns.)  But with write-ups like these, one's gotta be pumped to go over there and start ripping the place up.  Nicely done!<br>

But I really want to hear experiences from nukers that went on the raid.  I heard from other raid leaders I know that casters should not nuke until mobs are all the way to 30% life.<br>
I also know that after CHing, clerics automatically aggro when they sit down.  This makes it very hard for them to med, and is why clerics being there are so important.  The raid I lead was INCREDIBLY difficult due to only one resser.<br>
I just want to hear a healer and a nuker's perspective. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

I know it would be incredibly helpful, and this one only took me 20 minutes tops to write.<br>
I would love to hear one from others for places like Hate and Fear, for some people, including myself, don't know all the information that one should about that zone, like which mobs are unmezzable, have more hp, hit harder, etc.<br>
<br>
I think one for hate is in order considering our plans for next week =D.<br>
<br>
Plus, hate and fear have been revamped, and require new strategies.  I still ponder whether it's more beneficial to IVU or invis on Hate zone in now.<br>
<br>
I am sure certain members *cough* Kikulle *cough* have experience in lots of places =)<br>
<br>
I think the most important ones to make are as follows:<br>
Hate<br>
Fear<br>
Chardok<br>
<br>
When I get 55 I will be leading at least 3 Western Wastes raids for DoK and guests.  After some experience there I will try to make a guide there as well. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

<br>
When we did Icewell, we chose to camp on the stairs. It was a fairly decent place to camp, except for two things: it got pretty tight in there and had to shrink all the tanks; also, since snare didn't stick, sometimes we had to chase the dorfs all the way up on the 1st floor.<br>
<br>
Here's a question: our initial intent was to camp in the basement museum, where the lower level mob is, but someone said that once you attack him, he calls for help and 3-4 guards pop up. Any idea if this is true? That would be a great place to fight at, since it would give the extra room for a large raid.<br>
