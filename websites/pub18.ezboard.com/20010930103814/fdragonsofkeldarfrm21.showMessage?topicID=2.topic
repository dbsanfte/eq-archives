<br>
I can't believe so much happened in the few days I was away. I will address (hopefully) all the issues in this letter. I will also invite the ones who have left to come here as guests, read this letter and reply if they wish to do so, as a courtesy because in my heart they are still my dear brothers and sisters. <br>
<br>
First Issue: Guild growth<br>
-------------------------<br>
I am depply concerned with our fast growth and the loss of the family feeling. There is no easy answer though. A lot of our recruits (present and recent past) have come to us by indication of a guildmember. That means our guildmates thought DoK was a good guild to be in and wished their friends had that chance. What does that tell us? First, that a lot still consider DoK the best guild out there. Second, that these folks waiting for an invite are friends of friends. <br>
Now I don't know about you, but if I had a good friend (and I did, Nerasi, Slyde, Smiley, all friends I wanted to bring to DoK) I would like for my friend to have the best. I would like to spend all of my time with them and share a guild channel. Isn't it the way we ALL feel?<br>
Now the problem is, if each one of us has ONE friend out there we would like to guild, that would mean another 95 members for DoK. Although I agree that we are growing too fast, who can make the judgement that your friend should join the guild but someone else's friend is too many?<br>
I apologize for not being able to draw a line here. I believed everyone who ever sought DoK as an answer deserved the chance to apply and be voted on. I believed every guildmate of mine should be able to bring their friends, and their friends would become my friends. <br>
I don't know each and every one of DoK's 95 members very well. Some I have only spoken to once or twice. That isn't good. But I can't help thinking he is important to someone. If he wasn't there, someone I love and care for wouldn't be as happy. <br>
Just food for thought.<br>
As of today, there will be a recruitment freeze in DoK. The recruits we have currently are the last ones we will vote on for an indetermined period of time. Probably at least a month. The council will decide when to re-open recruitment. Please be patient if you have friends you are in the process of recruiting. <br>
<br>
Issue 2: Old Crew is leaving<br>
----------------------------<br>
I can't BEGIN to tell you how hurt I am that some folks decided to leave while I was out of town, mostly offline, and without a word to me in private. Some of these guys are old timers and I consider them personal friends. The fact that they chose to leave DoK without helping us fix what is wrong is extremely painful. I can only wish they will find happiness wherever they go, and that their friends show more consideration for their feelings than it was shown to me. DoK is a result of mine and other's hard work, time, dedication, tears, LOVE. When they were accepted into DoK, I shared my time and my thoughts with them, my RL events, I helped them as best as I could, and worked beyond whatever free time I had to ensure they had a good and organized guild structure. I do take it personally. They are friends of mine, not just members of my guild, what they do hurts me IRL not just reduces the head count in the guild. I wish they had chosen to talk to me, wait a couple of days and share their feeling with me. Even if they did leave afterwards, I would feel like they had given me a chance to help.<br>
Of the people who left - Shaedon left because he felt like I wasn't handling his issues properly. He had had serious problems with Winamin and later with Razamufin, and the fact Winamin was put on probation and not removed from the guild and Razamufin (and Shae as well, since I believed both were wrong) were issued official warnings didn't seem to be the response he was looking for. <br>
Nirron and Bollen never told me they were leaving, never bothered communicating to me or to the guild their reasons. So I didn't bother asking either. Maybe that wasn't very nice but I felt insulted by the way they just dropped out of a FAMILY. My family no less :)<br>
<br>
Issue 3: Lower Levels<br>
---------------------<br>
You are absolutely right. It seems we only do the high level stuff these days. The guild is big enough now that everyone should be able to find something to do and people to do it with. I think there is a cultural memory from when DoK was small and people are not used to taking charge and saying "ok, whoever is level 30-35 give me a tell NOW" and organizing something right there and then. I will say it again. We only seem to do high level stuff these days. But again, who should be doing the lower level stuff? The high levels? Nope. The lower levels. It's up to each one of us to organize what we want to do if nobody else is organizing. If you need my help, you will have it. No questions asked. But I'd like to see some more effort into taking grouping/raiding into your own hands. If you notice, Col and I haven't been organizing all the high level stuff. Eowen, Darkleaf, Kikulle, Phanser, these guys are taking charge and that is great :) I want to see folks like that below level 50 too!<br>
<br>
Issue 4: Colubridae<br>
--------------------<br>
Forgetting the fact Col is my husband and the most important person in the world to me. Since you don't know him as well as I do, it's easy to see only his bad temper and confrontational side. He has those allright. But he also cares deeply for this guild and does whatever he feels it's right to ensure DoK is a good guild. Sometimes he is right sometimes he is wrong. We all are. He is not an easy person to get along with (except for me :)) but he is the most loyal friend you will ever have and he will not betray you, lie to you or sugar-coat the truth. He is what he is, and that's why I love him so much. He has very strict moral rules and he is a harsh judge, but he does it not out of anger or power trips. He does it because he thinks it's right and he wants the guild to be good. I will finish here because I feel like this is something people should talk to him about individually if they have problems, but I wanted to finish by saying he was the best voted councilor for the third time in a row. (or since we started voting for council). That means (to me) that people think he is harsh, people think he has a bad temper, people think he is a hypocrat and impossible to be guilded with, but also think he is the best person to lead DoK in my absence? Weird combination.<br>
<br>
Issue 5: SOLUTIONS! (I love those)<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Thank you so very much those who took their time to come to the board and make constructive suggestions on how to improve what we think is not good enough. Lyvja and Zavion come to mind, but I know there are others (I haven't had time to read everything yet and am already late for a meeting in Baltimore). THat's the way to go guys! Don't like it? It's fine, come and say you don't like it and we will try to fix it. But coming and saying Don't Like it, here's how it should be... THAT makes my heart sing. Because you obviously care so much about this guild that you actually think about ways to improve it and want it to be a better family. My deepest gratitude and love to you. <br>
I would like to invite all of you for a Guild Party this Sunday, at 2 pm EST (11 am Pacific) at the Lake Rathe Arena. I apologize in advance if this conflicts with something I havent looked at the calendar. But I think its important for us to bond again. A short meeting will be held as well before the tournaments and party (and salying of the beast :))<br>
I will make my own suggestions (a "zone of the week" for each level range comes to mind) when I have some more time. For now, I have to run to my meeting.<br>
<br>
Again, be assured I will do my best, give this guild all of me so we can all be happy in DoK. <br>
/guild hug<br>
<br>
I love you all <br>

<br>
My only problem with this whole thing is that I personally don't feel that there's anything wrong with the guild.  If a "family feeling" is lacking, then I believe it's more of a personal issue.  If we are going to grow as a guild, then that "family feeling" is going to be difficult to maintain, it's just the nature of the beast.<br>
<br>
I'm a little disappointed in the recruitment freeze.  Other then the "guild merger" event having some bumpy points, I don't think we've recently recruited anyone that's turned out toe be a "bad apple."  Quit the contrary.  I think some of the people that we've guilded are awesome.  However, if people that think there IS a problem believe that freezing recruitment for a period of time will fix the problem, then so be it.  I happen to believe as you do Temp, in that there are people that I meet, people that I've known for a LONG time, that I want in this guild and now, I cannot ask them to join us.  That, IMHO, is as bad to existing members as our rapid expansion.  Then again, you can't please all of the people all of the time.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm just too easy going, but I enjoy grouping with everyone no matter the level.  Take last night for instance in Freeport with Tanph and Hworang (and the others too, hehe).  That was a blast taking down Lucan, and though I rarely ever group with those two; but they are guildmates and it was like we were instant family once again.  It's like extended family to me.  Like the aunts, uncles, that you only see once a year.  While you miss them, and somehow wish you could spend more time together, it's inevitably those rare get togethers that makes the relationship special.  The guild parties are those types of events.  The times when we come together as a guild to just hang out.<br>

Recruitment has slowed down, to what I belive is a reasonable pace (one or two ppl a week getting the votes required).<br>
However, I DO think, that at least untill the party/guild meeting (and planned council meeting) we need to take a collective deep breath, and sort some of these issues (the real, and the imagined) out. <p><html>

<br>
Tempestade - as always you show strong leadership - and your note here really takes the issue by the horns.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty new here; but I think one thing we all have to consider, given the way this game is designed "Size Matters".  Verant lacks the imagination to make the game more challenging to 55+ level players beyond giving mobs 35K HitPoints and Offsensive capabilities beyond what they gave "Gods" in the initial release.<br>
<br>
It's also clear that they LIKE the "Power" Guilds (I like this term better than uber) who have their ear when it comes to design etc.<br>
<br>
With Kunark - there was only one zone that was inaccessible my a mid-sized guild (Veeshan's Peak); but a good third of Velious is.  The XA is nice - but has it's limitations.  In a sense it's TOO successful - (too large) and there's the "No Clerics sign up for Fear" syndrome.<br>
<br>
IMHO there are in essence two types of guilds; "Power" Guilds and "Social" Guilds.  Clearly DOK is a Social Guild.  But these aren't either/or setups.  True Power guilds have social aspects to them.   When conflicts arise - if they aren't defused by good SOCIAL leadership they fall apart.  The people have to (to some degree) like each other.  Look at the number of guilds that rise and fall in a three week period.  Sovriegn Maxime, for example - was created and disbanded in the four weeks I've been a DoK.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the coin - unless you want to limit your capabilities; Social guilds need to have some aspects of Power Guilds.  Also - the more successful you are socially - the more popular you are.  Like Tempestade pointed out, if you have 95 people in the guild - and they all have a friend that wants to join - you soon are a 200 member guild.<br>
<br>
Inclusiveness is a GOOD thing.  I went to a VERY large University (U of Illinois) which had a large Greek System.  (My apologies to any DoK's who were in fraternaties and sororities) I dispised the attitudes of many of the people in them - and their "We're better than everyone else" and their systems that seemed to relish being able to reject people.<br>
<br>
I hate Country Clubs (apologies to any DoKs who may belong to one) that exclude on race, religion, and social class.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that certain Power Guilds on Xegony really have an arrogant attitude that I saw in some of the fraternaties and sororties, and Country Clubs, etc.  That we are a private club<br>
<br>
Now I'm rambling on here (so what else is new) but the point I'm making; If DoK is the type of organization I believe it is; it will accept anyone with open arms who simply wants to be here, shares the VALUES to be here, and demonstrates that they are willing and able to behave according to the accepted rules, and mores. It's NOT an exclusive club only open to people who heppened to sign up before 1947.<br>
<br>
I understand the need to control growth; and if a recruitment freeze needs to be done for a while - then putting people's admission on hold is a good idea.<br>
<br>
The recuritment system is a good one.  You have to wait a week and get 10 members to approve.  Perhaps it should be tweaked?  I don't think so but it could be considered...<br>
<br>
Okay bottom line time.  There's no doubt in my mind DoK is the best server on the guild.  That's why I wanted to join.  I know that bringing 11 people with me could cause strain; and I hope that the OoN "Adoption" didn't contribute to this problem.  But I know that adding quality people to a quality guild could ONLY result in making the best guild even better.  <br>
<br>
If DoK is as good as I (and I think most people here) believe it is, and it has a policy of inclusiveness - it's INEVITABLE that it will grow to a very large size.<br>
<br>
The key is communication.  There are no problems that can't be solved if people try hard and apply themselves. <p><html>

<br>
It's pretty obvious that the guild is going through some rough times; some saw it coming, some didn't. I bow before those in the guild that chose to stay and work to fix the problems, rather than leave.<br>
<br>
I suggested as one of the first steps that the officers get in touch with those of us who left the guild (recently or a while ago, it doesn't matter) and get their input. Some left without a word, some said a nice goodbye, very few gave us a thing or two to think about.<br>
<br>
Temp listed the main issues that surfaced lately.<br>
<br>
Guild growth: I'm one who believes in letting the guild grow naturally, but, if the decision is made to halt recruiting for a while, I will respect that decision. I want however to point out that I only know of ONE person who left because of this: Hworang; there could be more, but I don't know that. I am not trying to dismiss the issue, I'm only saying let's not make it into more than it is.  I suggested an open poll, where the whole guild can speak up on this. Afterall, it's everyone's guild...<br>
<br>
Personal issues: I think that's the #1 reason people leave DoK, or any guild for that matter. It's human nature to disagree and we can't prevent that. What we can do is be more careful in how we communicate with each other, so that disagreements don't turn into arguments and hurt feelings.<br>
It doesn't matter that I think Col was right in most of his assessments; it doesn't matter that I'd take guys who speak their minds (like Shaedon or Kikulle) over someone hidding around the bushes. Some people don't respond well to being pushed and we should understand that, if we want to stay a group and not a military faction.  I'm sure those involved got a message and they'll think about it.  Good things will come out of this mess in the end.<br>
<br>
Low levels: I think this is an issue where those directly impacted should speak up. Let's not confuse the family feeling with cozy raids, run exclusively by Temp and Col. It wasn't going to work like that forever.  I know for a fact that raids for low levels never lacked support from the high level players; my offer for help was turned down several times, which means they didn't need it. Now, if there are not enough raids being organized for low levels, look no further than among your ranks.<br>
<br>
Epics: it takes determination to complete an epic quest. I have a great deal of respect for those involved in their quests and will lend a hand anytime.  If they come out as pushy, it's because they have a goal and they'll go for it. Don't read too much into it and don't feel like you *have to* help. The epic team was made of people who volunteered and so far, I personally haven't noticed anyone pushing his/her quest exclusively.<br>

<br>
One of the main reason that I &quot;left&quot; the guild (I still haven't had the time to unguild =P) was I sorta need a temporary time out with the guild, I just feel that with such a large guild that this is turning out to be, that I feel more helpless to the guild.<br>
<br>
And with many of the old guild members leaving, when they left, it took that little piece of me with them. All the people who left were the people I looked up to while I leveled up. Now that I basically halted leveling Hworang and god knows what the heck I am now doing on EQ I feel that maybe just a little time out is good. And sorry Temp that I was not able to make this discussion with you before I came to conclusion of leaving the guild but I will miss you all and OF COURSE I will keep in touch with many of you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><html>

<br>
First off I just wanted to say that Tempestade your letter was very well<br>
written and I admire your dedication to helping out the guild.<br>
<br>
Second off I do believe that people who are midlevels like me shpuld take in to<br>
their own hands of organizing groups for ourselves. I know lately that I have<br>
grouped with some of our midlevels. I plan on doing this in the future as well.<br>
One other thing is that people who tend to group often can accomplish things ordinary groups would not be able to do. <br>
<br>
In regards to the lack of the family relationship I feel that we should group with guildmates when you can <br>
or have social gatherings when we can. The only way to fix a problem is to address the problem and find a way to overcome it. Social gatherings and talking are one way to fix it. <br>
<br>
Lastly I just wanted to say that I am sorry that I will not be able to come to the arena on SUnday<br>
I have to work. <br>
<br>
Well I justed wanted to say hello to everyone<br>
If anyone wishes to speak with me I am normally on my ranger Dalbrathe, or my druid Tanpheiro<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Tanpheiro (aka Dakbrathe) <br>
