Persons that you cant help but thing wow this guy is just so nice or way cool, and once in a while you come across someone whose attitude or actions leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and thinking WOW !! what a jerk !<br>
<br>
I am not a vendictive sort of person and in general i consider myself fairly open minded and I tend to go out of my way to help most people if they as politely. But screw me or anyone i know over and I have a memory like an elephant. One day I will get a chance to return the favor.... <br>
<br>
Couple of examples:<br>
Prekunark I started my cleric which is now my main, adventuring in CT which was always packed back in the day, I was with a group camping the bottom of the &quot;zig&quot; pyramid. Fighting a couple of lizards i suddenly see scalymob00 is very afraid. Lo and behold one of the lizards runs in terror into the maze bringing back a MASSIVE train that kills all of us. Behind us on the pyramid a higher lvl sk had cast fear on one of our mobs. Couple of days later i hear in ooc someone shouting not very nice words at the same SK for doing the same trick.<br>
<br>
Fast forward about a year and a half<br>
The same SK sends me a tell asking to buy some sk spells from my guilds vault which i administer.....<br>
I promtly told him where he could stick his request and gave away the spells he wanted to a random sk in N Fp<br>
<br>
ahhhh feel it warms my heart just thinking about it.<br>
<br>
Another time a couple of months into Kunark, my group completely whiped out in Disco in Sebilis. We quickly came to the conclusion that it would be much faster to get our corpses summoned than. As I zone back in I ask a necro who is in the zone in group if She can summon my group if we bring coffins to her. <br>
&quot;Sure she replies 500 pp per summon&quot; %&amp;¤lkjsdfljk% you gotta be kidding me. Eventually found another necro in N Fp and got him to Seb to do summons.<br>
<br>
Just a few days later i got a res request from a person I didnt know, but since I wasnt doing anything I ran to LOIO to do res. As I zone in I figure might as well do some more resses and I announce in ooc that I am doing resses at zone. As is common in lower lvl zones I had quite a few ppl bring their corpses. Including a couple from the same guild as the necro I met in Sebilis. I informed them that i would not res them for free as I was doing to the rest of the people. But would require 500 pp for the service. <br>
The guildleader of the said guild contacted me and we talked ending up with me ressing his guildmembers and he apparently guildremoved the necro for actions inappropriate behavior.<br>
<br>
ahhhh once again I felt very good<br>
<br>
Now to my last story, just two weeks ago I was entering Sebilis with my lvl 59 shaman and a SK friend, we were going to spend a few hours getting a bit of xp while we chatted in real life. As we were moving in through a full pop I single pulled the frogs one at a time and we dispatched them in short order. As we are fighting a group comes up behind us they pull the closest frog but being lower lvl they pull quite a few frogs and pulling from behind us they aggro only the target frog while his buddies assist the frog I am fighting beating the snot out of me.<br>
<br>
My sk friend survives and asks the cleric in the other group to res my shaman, but the cleric didnt think the Sk asked nicely enough (my friend dosent speak english very well ). At which point i got kinda testy as in my openion a request to res should have not been nessesary.<br>
<br>
If I, my group, or my guild had killed anyone by accident I would have ressed buffed that person right off the bat no questions asked and appoligized. The cleric felt that since he didnt pull it wasnt any of his concern i was killed.<br>
Finally ended up running my own cleric from Temple of Veeshean in Velious to Sebilis to res myself.<br>
<br>
I havent had another run in with this Doof but I am sure of one thing. <br>
Eventually what goes around comes around....<br>

I have never turned down a request for a rez unless its someone I never even met and they want me to travel across the whole world to get to there corpse to rez, which has happened to me. Anyway, the point being is that if never helped anyone out I know there would be a time that I would need help and I woulnd't get any.<br>

In EQ and in RL. <br>
<br>
RL: I was cheated on majorly by this girl.  She was a total hooker about it.  To the point where we would spend a ton of time together, and she would flip personalities and say the exact opposite to another guy she was seeing.  For example, we were going to her cousins wedding.  She told me she couldn't wait for me to meet her friends and family, while she told the other guy we were just friends :P<br>
<br>
Anyway one night she said she was going shopping.  So I stayed home that night played a little EQ, and did a little work on my home theater.  I call around 9:30 wondering where she was at, actually I paged her.  She called back about 9:45 and said that she was buying presents. This was sunday night, and she also said she was at the mall of america.  Well, MOA closes at 7pm on Sundays.  It used to anyway when this occured.  So... I inform her - wow been shopping all this time while the malls been closed eh?  &quot;Oh well... I went to get something to eat&quot; ...  Thats kinda funny because the ENTIRE MALL except the movie theater closes at 7.  Than she says this...  &quot;I lied...  I didn't want to tell you, but I went to my best friends Candle Light Vidual... It was one year since she died and I was embarrassed to tell you.&quot; Now, at this point, it was either suck it up and deal, or find out more...  I found out more. &quot;So where was this at?&quot; and wham. Instantly gave me the number and name of this hotel.  I call it...  Nothing. <br>
<br>
So...  She lied about going to her best friends memorial anniversary while she was humping another guy. To me, that is the lowest of low.  <br>
<br>
I cal her and say get a life... You are phychotic, than being the guy I am, made it so she was denied out of 10 bars in the downtown area and ruined her name.  That was the fun part for me, but I knew what goes around comes around too... And one year later... I get this call from a crying girl... Had no clue who it was. <br>
<br>
&quot;Miiikee....  &lt;Sniff sniff..&gt; (Notice the lack of Sympathy) I do not know if you knew this, but I was engaged, and I came into the house just now and saw him having sex with 2 girls at once! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ((  &lt;Cry cry cry wah wah wah&gt;.

<br>
Best feeling ever. <br>
<br>
EQ: Was actually a good one of what goes around comes around.  I went to a zone and summoned some corpses of a group late late at night.  Turned out to be that his main was a very high level cleric.  The next day he saw me on and PL'd me from 44 to 46 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And said thanks for helping with that last night, its the least I could do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

LONG POST</span><hr size=1> Being the kind of guy I am.  Yes.  If anyone hurts me or my friends, I am someone that believes in an Eye for an Eye.  Always will.  Of course just once.  After I did this, I never did anything in &quot;Revenge&quot; again.  But it did feel good in my eyes and I made sure she never did this to anyone I knew.  Thats for sure, which just happens to be a lot of people.  <br>
<br>
Wasn't an exagerration.  Some of the bars I did not know the owners well enough.  But I was very pissed after spending 6 months with this girl, spending time with her Son all the time while she would run errands (Seeing someone else which I found out about later) who happened to have a mental illness and I took care of him while she cheated on me.  Than Lied about her best friend who was dead.  What I did in return wasn't anything close.  She could still go out in the suburbs. <br>
<br>
Maybe 7 bars not 10.  I can still name them if you are from Minneapolis you will know which ones I am talking about. <br>
<br>
Champps, Loon, Lounge, Club Ashe, South Beach, District/Rosens, and brothers.  <br>
<br>
Sorry...  Yes I abolsutely ruined her reputation.  She now goes out and everyone sees her and knows she is trash.  A good thing because maybe she will learn she cannot treat people like she did.  And the big thing is, I am sure I am not the only one.  There were countless others before me that just sucked it up.  <br>
<br>
Also a condition of this: She tried to spread lies about me and opened the door in the first place, so I guess I should state that as well. <br>
<br>
But either way, I guess you are right, what goes around comes around wasn't me getting her booted from clubs in Minneapolis, but rather having her walk in on her Fiance having sex with 2 girls at the same time.  <br>
<br>
Funny thing is, guys put up with this crap all the time.  Now I am not trying to stereotype when I say this or come off as sexist, but from the people I have talked to, this happens more to guys than it does to girls.  And it seems like the girl is always complaining.  <br>
<br>
Case in point: If a girl usually has a phychotic boyfriend, 80% of the time there is a reason why. Most likely a guy that she screwed over in some way and cannot come to grips that it is over.  For me, I just offer up a nice dish of &quot;in your face&quot; and move along. <br>

LONG POST</span><hr size=1> My personal belief is 99% of all men are just scum. There, of course are a few exceptions. I know of three of them on EQ, Dogs, Traigos, Baram. Yes, I have few other friends on EQ that I think highly of and I talk to often and when things work out we get to group and enjoy company and the game. I do not need to say any names, they read on here, they know who they are, and hugs to them. <br>
<br>
I am sorry that girl was like that Ut, but the revenge you received from what you did, really made me laugh..It is kinda ironic that things worked out that way. What I dont understand is, if she thought of calling you then, she must have really thought about you often. I don't have numbers to past boyfriends/ex's, dont keep, usually dont want to talk to. We always agree we will remain as friends, but, shrug never seems to work out that way. <br>
<br>
I am going through a divorce right now, I wish him true an evil things in his future. Why ? Because now I can look back and wonder how I was so dumb to put up with it for so many years. I was working many hours, stupid Corp buy outs, extremely decent money, family time was important when able. Children were being attended by a RL friend of mine, he didnt even half to take care of them, I cleaned the house, I cooked dinner, I  took care of the kids, I paid the bills. He chose to play EQ, had girls that just needed computer help calling the house ( lied to me<br>
about it ) would pay for their EQ on his credit card ( that I paid for ), would go out late with friends just for BBQ wings ( in MY car), would spend all the time that I was at home, away from home with his &quot;friends&quot;.... he swore he had changed, we got back together almost a year ago, that lasted very short time, he didnt want to watch his daughter, had to go to bar with friends to have wings, etc..I laugh at the whole deal, I know he will get what is coming to him, aside for the fact that he made suggestions we could/should work it out and I laughed in his face as I hang up on him or slam door in his face.. I know one day I will get more revenge for the a$$ that couldnt even leave his so called &quot; friends&quot; when his 16 month daughter spent a week in the hospital and he couldnt make much of an attempt to be with her, while I never let her side.<br>
<br>
most men suck, and the theory don't do anything you will feel guilty for later on, is very true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E6E1DF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/ulillaane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lillaane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>MithMarr Defender<br><img src=http://www.winterblood.com/mmdn/star2.gif><img src=http://www.winterblood.com/mmdn/star2.gif></span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#E09C5F>(7/27/01 2:51:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What goes around comes around....

Maybe God wanted us to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. <br>
<br>
Maybe when the door of happiness closes, another <br>
opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. <br>
<br>
Maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. <br>
<br>
Maybe it is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, but it is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives. <br>
<br>
Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they <br>
will love you back. Don't expect love in return; just wait for <br>
it to grow in their heart; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours. <br>
<br>
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. <br>
<br>
Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. <br>
<br>
There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have <br>
only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. <br>
<br>
May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. <br>
<br>
Always put yourself in others' shoes. <br>
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. <br>
<br>
The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. <br>
<br>
Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. <br>
<br>
Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. <br>
<br>
The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past <br>
failures and heartaches. <br>
<br>
When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. <br>

  I can probably count on my fingers, the number of times I've ran across Zaz. <br>
And to each time, Zaz was always helpful, and I think if my memory serves I was able to return the same extra mile at one time. =)<br>
<br>
 Lil, I like those quotes, funny how most of those stir emotions in me, thoughts and feelings I either choose not to express, or have not experienced in some time, but the person I think of is still the same. heh. =)<br>

Im not trying to start a gender flame war here, im just saying that if you have views like that, keep em to yourself or people will think you are shallow. <br>
<br>
By the way, what would happen if a man said 99% of all women are scum? 'Hes an evil sexist pig' they would say.
