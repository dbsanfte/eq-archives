<br>
The GM of the guild was embroiled in a &quot;ninja&quot; incident, and in fact named the guild after the item in question, an Insidious Halo.<br>
<br>
Personally, im a big beliver in guilt by association.  If you spend time with someone, are friends with them (or join thier guild) then you are in FACT condoning thier actions.  I have had multiple negative encounters with the GM of Halo, I fail to see how anything good can come from a guild led by such a greedy, malicious, egotisical person.  I also fail to see how any self respecting player would associate themselves with a guild so blatantly named after an incident which would shame most of us.<br>
<br>
So, you see (perhaps), that this is nothing like raceism, where you dislike someone for something they have no controll over.  I do in fact dislike people for the CHIOCES they make.  I wouldent go as far as to say, that no one in Halo is a good person, I WOULD say, and safely I think, that anyone in Halo has SERIOUSLY diffrent priorities than anyone in DOK.  As Slyde said best, its NICE to know that the GM of your guild (in my case my wife as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) is considered one of the nicest (most helpfull, most caring, fairest, dare I say best looking too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )people on the server.  Instead of the reverse. <p><html>

<br>
(sorry I couldn't resist!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Anywho - I also have two really good friends in Halo.  Del and Kendric.  They chose that guild for reasons of their own agenda - and I respect that.  I'm still friends with Del and Kendric (and lesser so with some others).  The vast majority of the guild I have no opinion of - and a number of people that I have little respect for; and at least one I hold in contempt - both for actions I've heard second or third hand - but more importantly an incident I was able to witness first hand.<br>
<br>
Personally, I pride myself in being a member of a guild whose leader is among the most respected people on the server.   My friends either have chosen not to believe the evidence to the contrary - or perhaps feel that the benefits of HALO outweigh the bad rep of their leader.<br>
<br>
Regardless - if you read the Halo's charter - they state right out that their mission statement is to get good gear for their members.  If you look at DoK's charter - you'll see a different kind of guild.<br>
<br>
I'm GLAD there are guild for people who's primary motiviation is getting and sharing the best items for their membership - and other guilds that are about making friends and helping people serverwide.  While Kendric is one of my best friends - I know that he wouldn't be happy in DoK (similar to my friend Kikulle/Binek/Falcar - I have no hard feelings whatsoever about his leaving DoK). <p><html>

And if you hate Helenae and her policies/behaviors, then why do you, yourself, follow her words?<br>
<br>
Does one instance turn the all your friends to enemies?  Does you getting one speeding ticket, mean that all of your friends are wreckless drivers?  Does you going out to drink once and a while mean all your friends are alcoholics?  Or does your one friend that stole that candy bar from the store...mean that you and all your friends are thieves?  I think not. <br>
<br>
I really don't want to defend Helenae, and frankly, i don't see why i need to.  I don't see eye to eye with her on everything, nor should I.  You are not little puppy dogs following your "leader" and doing whatever, whenever, and however they say to do something.  Or at least, i hope you, yourself, has a personality and your own life.  <br>
I joined HALO months after this "supposed"/"rumored"/"fact" was an issue.  And i have heard 10 defferent stories surrounding it.   That's the past, this is the present. Period.   Yes, she "recieved" the Halo, "how" she got it....is debatable.  Why bother anymore?   I wasn't there...i don't know directly.<br>
All i know is while being in Halo i have never seen anything of the sort.  We look out after each other, and take care of each other.  I hear of more loot fights, and issues within DoK within the past month, than i ever have since being in Halo for nearly 3.  This is all irrelevant. <br>
<br>
My point is this Rjak.  You knew me before Halo.  We always got along, and hunted ogether alot.  A bunch of stuff happened, then now, you hate me.  That's fine. That's your choice.  I can't explain, or care to waste the breath to explain everything to you.  Yes, you can be judged by those you keep per say. That's fine.  That works great on those first impressions.  However, you knew ME way before HALO was in the picture.  Simply a guildtag changes someone's impression?...that's petty imo and pretty ignorant.    <br>
<br>
There are great people, bad people, and those that just hang out thruout EVERY guild in this GAME.  I  have friends in nearly every guild on this server, and those can see thru a guildtag and they know the real me.  Nuff Said<br>
<br>
This was NOT supposed to be a flame thread, and i hate that it turned out this way.  It's sorta funny, i get yelled at by 2-3 ppl on this site, and i log into the game, and 15 dok's send me a tell apologizing for way ppl handle these posts.  That's fine, they wish to stay in tha background, and not cause a scene. That's what they want, and i respect that.  It's also very evident to me that i still have ALOT of friends in DOK that i would do anything for, and that would help me as well, if i truely needed it.  <br>
<br>
I apologize for this thread going outta control.  I was simply answering a plea for help from some friends.  Be well Dragons. I'll see you all later<br>

<br>
&quot;You knew me before Halo. We always got along, and hunted ogether alot. A bunch of stuff happened, then now, you hate me.&quot;<br>
Talk about oversimplification.  I wont rehash the old facts, but rest assured Dels, that the choices YOU made, are what cause the rifts, nothing as simple as a guild tag.<br>
<br>
As for...<br>
&quot;I hear of more loot fights, and issues within DoK within the past month, than i ever have since being in Halo for nearly 3. This is all irrelevant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Exagerations (or outright disinformation) won't help your arguments here.<br>
I can't recall one argument over loot in the last month, and aside from last night, very few arguments about anything (and I do seem to recall an issue in Halo where someone accused the GM of logging them on and stripping thier items (true or not), of course maybe, in Halo, that isnt an issue).  Please don't pretend to know whats going on in DOK, just because you have a few friends inside who still talk to you.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.s. Im locking this thread, its petty, and Ive managed to drag myself down into the pettyness.  We are above this kind of trash talk.  And none of us want to see it on our boards. <p><html>

But again I'm just the GM, what do I know :P<br>
Dels, what we DON'T have is a reputation problem. I am not going to throw insults at Halo but you know my feelings and I agree with some of what has been said here about the company you keep, etc etc.<br>
I've always tried to be the voice of reason and the peacemaker when it comes to you and some Dokers. But please, do not come to our boards to compare your guild with ours, loot wise or otherwise. Do not come to our home to imply we bitch about loot, because it isn't true and you'd hardly know all the facts if it were true. I appreciate all your offers to help and the valuable information you sometimes bring to our family. But I ask you to not comment on DoK's internal issues, because they are OUR issues and if you have any information about them... well you shouldn't have :) Unlike other guilds, our name rarely shows up on Xeg.net and similars and our reputation is our most valuable treasure. <br>
Every guild has its problems, and DoK isn't perfect. But it's hardly your place or anyone's outside the guild, to make reference to our problems unless they you are affected by them.<br>
<br>
That said... I don't want to feed the flames, so can we please let this die? dels is a good person, and there are other good people in Halo, in Havenlight, in IS, VS, everywhere. I agree that they can be judged by the company they keep, but let's never forget there is a real person behind the screen and some words can hurt.<br>
