We have lost other good people recently.<br>
There have been a few cries for DoK to stop recruiting and it is time for me to add my voice to that list.<br>
<br>
I am posting this in a PUBLIC area and it is my deepest desire for this posting to stay here because:<br>
1) There may be some recent ex-members who wish to make constructive comments.<br>
2) Anyone who wants to join DoK has the right to know why some people are leaving, asking for a recruitment hiatus, or just what is going on so they don't join and then discover some internal strife.<br>
<br>
We recently had two guilds that married into DoK - this was the right thing to do, but it had unexpected consequenses.  One is that some of us are still trying to meet our new family members.  For those of us who do not have a character above level 45, we have not fought with these people against Vox or Inny.  We don't go to Karnor's or City of Mist for experience.  We aren't working (much) on our epic quest.  We just haven't met very often.  Blame?  Absolutely not!  But I suggest that DoK has been a family to me in EQ and I need more time to meet my new family and am getting overwelmed trying to meet more of them.<br>
<br>
One way I can get to meet more of you is by leveling to 46 as soon as I can.  Well, you may have noticed I am not playing my main (level 37 currently) very much lately.  Why?  I don't care for the zones people go to so they can get &quot;1 level a night/week&quot; often and when I do go there, despirate to get a couple of blue bubbles of experience, I can't seem to find groups.  It is difficult at best to get an escourt and enchanters only solo well under a few circumstances and learning your way around a new zone ain't one of them!  I also tend to log on around 10-11EST when much of the guild is going to bed.  And try to get a rez after 1am EST?  I think not - not worth the hassle.<br>
<br>
Slyde and Larsal have been invaluable to me as information sources in playing my new bard.  Liliel represents the best I could hope for in a new guildmate (someone who is actually willing to step foot into West Karana and even solo her way out of Hell 30 there!! /salute Lilel - You go Girl!!).<br>
<br>
My interactions with my new family members has been overwelmingly positive -- I am just begging for more chances to meet others.  For those of you who have requested membership, I would willingly &quot;grandfather&quot; your applications through. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/uslydekatzenjammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlydeKatzenjammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Musician of DoK</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(5/10/01 11:22:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A public request</span><hr size=1> There are a handful of DoK people I've known for a long time - but as I've discovered being a member for all of one month - there a LOT I don't know as well as I'd like to.<br>
<br>
Most of the people who've left - I didn't know very well (or at all) I have to admit - except for Birr and Shaedon (who left before I joined).  To be honest - I really am completely ignorant as to what those issues were - and perhaps it's not my business.<br>
<br>
I have to say - if I've contributed in any way - directly or indirectly; for example fast growth by having a dozen new members join at once with the OoN marriage (I like that better than merger hehe) I apologize.<br>
<br>
But as far as making things better - I'd say we should try to have more events - perhaps dueling at Arena - that include all levels so we can get together and get to know eachother better.<br>
<br>
Planar and Epic Raids are good - but if the intensity of combat is such - you may be spending more times concentrating on fighting than socializing and getting to know people.<br>
<br>
Also - if (heaven forbid) things go bad - negative stress can be generated that is counter-productive to what we are trying to accomplish.<br>
<br>
I'd like to request we have another guild party of some sort. <p><html>

I haven't known you long, but I am developing a deep respect for you.  You know your branch of the family better than I do - perhaps you could steer me towards a suitable hunting partner that I may not be aware of from OoN.  There's nothing like glorius combat against a common enemy (as oppesed to within the family) to bring people together.<br>
<br>
I am going to be hosting a tour of Qeynos soon and possibly some other non-experience events.  I hope you will join me at these events.  I am not overly fond of duels, but our recent drunken-run around the Arena was (I'm told) a sight to behold (My vision was slightly impaired at the time) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/uslydekatzenjammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlydeKatzenjammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Musician of DoK</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(5/10/01 12:32:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A public request</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the kind word - assuming that the roster is up-to-date and you chars are upper 30's - I'd recommend hooking up with Lahn-Druid Dalbraith-Ranger/Tanphiero-Druid, Rukog-Shadowknight/Gaiwen (Class?).<br>
<br>
Jadan/Shinjimmer/Tanag (his 50+ chars) has more characters than I can keep track of - propbably has four or five in your char's level range!<br>

PLEASE remeber that text doesnt always translate feeling well. Give people the benefit of the doubt when there may be more than one translation. in 5 secs of anger it would be a shame to waste one year of friendship. Take the time to give people you dont know a tell just saying Hi. They may not be able to chat with you at the moment but at least it opens the door. Its easier to talk about things with friends than strangers so do your best to at least have your name familiar in tells. <br>
<br>
As far as high 30's low 40's groups. I've been matchmaking- for lack of a better word- a few of that level that I know who are in different guilds. Most of the ones I know are on about 430cst earlier and later. Their names are Arianna, Albion, Martie, Anguss, Quanchie, Wolfdin, Lall, Windwick, Nalyen and all friendly and good people near lvl 40.<br>
<br>
I'm also doing alot of tells lately looking for people interesting in regular exp groups in Chardok, Hole and HS. Seb is too crowded to do much usually. <br>

<br>
Just because a few of you have outcasted me doesn't mean that i don't miss you all.  Yes, i was hurt, and may of said some things i shouldn't have, but i think we all have.  I am still saddened by these other ppl leaving. DoK is a Great Guild, and Jade, i luv you like my real sister, and you do lead this crazy bunch very well.  Although i don't think i'll ever be allowed back into DoK, my choice or not, doesn't matter any more.  <br>
<br>
All i wish to say is this:  My friends will be my friends no matter what guild tag is over my name.  I think only associating with ppl inside your guild is...ignorant.  There are tons of great ppl out there that i know in Many guilds and would welcome them by my side anytime.  yes, it's fun to hunt "with" your guild, but everyone needs some time away and to meet new friends, try new things, go new places, etc.<br>
<br>
I have tried to stay non confrontational with a few inside DoK and i think this is for the best.  But don't take this as me shutting ALL of DoK out.  I miss and talk to a few of you alot still, and would hate to see that change because i don't have "DoK" over my name.  However, be upfront and honest with me if/when you talk/group with me.  If you need help, gimme a tell, i'll do my best to help as i always have done.  <br>

<br>
I would like to mention that you were not outcast from DoK, but, simply the rules were enforced.  We have a strict policy about Dual Guilding (that is, it must be pre-approved by the council/GM).  And in your case it meant making a choice.  I hope you dont feel that we drove you out, because in fact many of us were working to keep you in DoK.  You chose to explore other options.  I for one have no hard feelings, except certainly with your new GM. <p><html>

I was in Juris Gladius with Dels for a long time before we disbanded, and 80% of us went to HALO.  You had no problem with my decision to be in JG.  But when the same guild, has a new tag, you have a temper tantrum.  <br>
I don't think it's a matter of enforcing the GUILD's rules, as a matter of enforcing your beliefs.  YOU didn't like Halo, so therefore you gave me the ultimatum at that time, but when i was in JG, you had no problem.  I don't deal well with ultimatums, and those giving me them, have always lost.  As far as the GUILD rules, what was the difference with Dels being in JG or Halo.  Either way she was in another guild, and dellys was in here.  <br>

Yes, we did mind you taking Dels to JG and I personally told you so. You told me it was temporary, which was basically the ONLY reason we agreed to the dual guilding. Then of course, when JG disbanded and Gold asked me to take them in, I was happy because you were coming home. And I feel that is very unfair, very low and one-sided to come to our boards as a victim that was driven away when you chose to leave DoK TWICE. I am sorry if I don't feel right about having my guild always as your second option. We are not a public park, you don't come and go as you please trusting we will always be here when things don't work out somewhere else. I like you, but I think you have some serious issues with guild loyalty and as much as I would love to continue being your friend, DoK requires the loyalty you can't give.<br>
I sincerely wish you the best of luck and if you ever need my personal help I am at your service. But please, don't come to our boards to stir up trouble, or if you do, at least let's discuss the whole issue and not just what you want people to believe. I had no problems telling you this on tells so I didn't know I had to bring it up again. And honestly I had no wish to do so in a public place. I have more respect for you than this, but I think that has to go both ways.<br>

Is when you went to JG, you checked ahead of time, as you knew that you should.  And got approval, even with some reservations.<br>
<br>
During the time you were duel guilded, we had multiple issues, and complaints.  I was liking the idea less and less, and I honestly think you took best advantage of the oppertunities presented by the guilds, when JG was doing something fun, you went with them with either Dels, or Dellys.  When DoK went to hate, you singed up right away with Dellys.  I looked at this and wondered if we were allowing a bad example to be set.  When we tried to talk to you about it, you either couldent, or wouldent understand our point.<br>
<br>
So when JG disbanded, and you rejoined DoK, I figured those problems were behind us.  Only to hear 2 days later that you had left DoK with Dels again, and joined Halo.  This time with out even checking first.<br>
<br>
Its no secret that I have serious issues with Halo, in particular its GM.  Never assume however that I let my personal feelings get in the way of what I feel is right.  Certainly dont make assumptions about why I make the calls I do.  Had you come to us in the first place, a vote would have probbaly taken place, and the answer would have been no.  We did not offer you an ultimatum, we asked you to make a choice (at the time I assumed I knew how you would choose), and you did.  Obvoiously you were tired of &quot;babysitting&quot; in DoK as you termed it. <p><html>
