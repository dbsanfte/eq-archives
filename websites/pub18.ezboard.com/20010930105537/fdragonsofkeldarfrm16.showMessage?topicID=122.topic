All in all I thought it went very well. <br>
<br>
However, i think the wipeouts could have easily been avoided by having a monk split the rooms instead of us charging in. Col, not taking anything away from your pulling skills, but SK FD just does not compare to monk FD, and a monk could have split them much easier. <br>
<br>
We have plenty of monks in the guild now. There is really no reason for not utilizing their skills. I would like to se the monks take a more active role in the pulling of raids. It is what we monks do!  =)<br>

Charging the king room is documented as the way to do it, the reason we got so many adds the first time, was because someone opened the door and pulled some of the queen guards.<br>
<br>
I wont get into a class discussion issue here, because I dont think its the point.  We did what we came for, we learned some things, and we had a sucessfull night.  One of the main reasons I was pulling is because I know the exact route to get to the royals, I know the timing and I know the pathing.  Honestly I only tried to FD pull one room (king the second time we went in, before he spawned), and a Warrior or Pally could have done as well, or better than I did pulling. <p><html>

I also felt that a powerful resource was going to waste: multiple monks.  I've seen monks work wonders in the planes with chain pulling.  A monk doesnt have the 1.5 second cast time to Feign Death so he would die much less often.  I agree that col's knowledge of Chardok and the pathing is of great benefit, however this knowledge would be best used by going along with the pullers and advising; not only would there be less chance of a train, but our pullers would be learning too, thus making future raids more successful.  I also felt bad that Colubridae had to die so many times, not only was it burning his xp, the extra res'ing caused slight delays.  If we had been using monks I feel that some of the massive trains could have been avoided, but I also noticed some people running up and/or attacking before the lead assist had indicated it was ok to do so, this behaviour of course devaluates the monk's abilities.  Sollron is one of the most skillful monks I've had the pleasure of grouping with.  Btw, off topic, Sol we need to go get a Tranix Crown for you sometime, you need that Magic Resist/ac/perma-infravision bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I in no way meant to belittle your job pulling last night. You did a great job! I do disagree  with the charge-in method though. I know and have talked to monks that have separated the king room into pulls of 3 mobs at a time. It can be done, but not with the cast time of SK FD. I really hated seeing you eat so many deaths last night! Totally not necessary!  =)<br>

Had me worried when I made first rush into get the note and I looted a spell instead hehe. I died there.

My hat off to Col for pulling and to the Enchanters that were AE mezzing.  Overall I think the assisting was done well, although I do agree we were a bit too quick to attack mobs before the MA had shouted the target.

<br>
Glad you finally got that punk :)  My congrats..and condolences :P  I just got done camping Ragefire. ARGH.<br>
I spent the last 18hours of Scatters camp, camping it with her to ensure that i would take it over next.  Her's ran 61hours.  I got my rage to spawn at 8:20yesterday.  Took me 41hours, 12mins.  Got 2 groups mobilized in about 10mins. 72 seconds later, From the time i handed him the pearl, Ragefire...was dead!  rawr! Completedy her epic, then slept from 9:30-6 last night hehe.  <br>
<br>
I turned the camp over to Grah.  He's been waiting since and sadly, will be interrupted by Nagafen sometime today. :(  So once we twinkie kill Naggy(or another group mobilizies to kill him) , he'll continue camp. My advice, if you're up to it Huffty, get in touch with him and possibly get yourself next in line for that camp?  Typically, the first cleric on the scene after rage dies, takes the next camp.  That's why i waited with Scatter for so long hehe.<br>
<br>
As far as pulling King? We don't. hehe.  We agro pull "most" of his guards up to the Herbalist?(necro epic dude). Gives us like 3 waves of 2-3 mobs. Leaving like King, and 1-2 adds in room.  Then we rebuff, and "drop down" thru the trap, onto the kings head, and kick his butt :)  We use the drop down, cause we've agro'd the Queens mobs a few times somehow hehe.  <br>
<br>
Good work all :)  When you going back? If ya want me to help sometime, send me a tell :)<br>

We got a Red Scale, CoF, and the Mystical Bag(100% 10 slot, 0 weight) and a blue diamond along with his heart of course :).<br>
I wanted some Blazing Armor personally, but i think this was the best drops i've seen from Rage in a long time.<br>
<br>
Halo kept the Red Scale, but we lotto'd the other 3 items. <br>
CoF was given to Tvar of TMC, who passed down his CotM to Poppn. <br>
Bag was given to Grimlem of Halo<br>
BD was given to um...i forget =P<br>
<br>
Anyone know if the nerfed Naggy's Respawn btw?  HE was due at 5ish yesterday, but never popped.  This is good news tho, since we hav a cleric waiting on Rage currently :)  We figured that Naggy would interupt his camp.   <p><html>

FatalFury (TMC) took the ragefire camp on Tues July 24, at 5:25pm when Naggy Died(on server up). She had the camp until wednesday evening.  Rage pop'd about 9pm wed night. (28hour rage camp). Scatter (TMC) took over camp and held it till sat afternoon at 1pm. (64hour camp). I was there with her for her last 18hours of that.  I took over camp and held it till 9am mon.(44hours)until my rage pop'd.  Grah(halo) took over camp, and is still holding it (wednesday 3pm...54hours and counting)<br>
So far it's been almost 8 days exactly since Naggy was defeated. I know for sure, that the zone wasn't repop'd, or a second naggy was dead.  Cause i kept a close eye on the camp, knowing i was getting myself into that rotation.  Maybe they moved him to 7days...+/- a few days?  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, i was just wondering if anyone heard that they modified his spawn time :) <p><html>

Maybe they did extend his spawn cycle by a bit, to be nice to the clerics?  Nah, that couldn't be it... <p><html>

Well, Naggy did it, ruined it all...<br>
<br>
He finally spawned, last night about 9pm...(8 days 5hours since his last death)  The worst part of all....It interupted our Ragefire camp.  We were entering hour 61of the Rage camp..when he spawned.  Making our cleric, completely start over with the camp.  <br>
We organized a twinkie raid, and dropped rage fast for his rude interuption.  Drops were 2x GPK's, CoF, and Bag.  <br>
I don't know how Grah has the strength to start this camp over...it really sucks :(<br>

<br>
While it does - I do think that a certain amount of randomness makes the game better.  The idea that a mob like Nag will "spawn" at the click fo a clock 7 days to the minute of the last time it was killed - with a group of players with exactly the numbers and classes and buffs - and then proceed to kill it the exact same way every time and get the exact same loot is kind of ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I am sorry for Grah to have organized a 61 hour camp like that for naught... <p><html>

Randomness in Mobs i think they should make even more random imo.  <br>
<br>
Ragefire is simply a pain in the arse tho.  It should be a triggered mob imo =P or at least, not in a place where another mob can spawn and totally screw you up after 2-3days.  Ragefire's Randomness is 18-72hours....how is that for random? argh hehe.  <br>
<br>
Trak is pretty much down to the hour.  Which is why you see one guild farming it over and over =P  cause those that killed last...know exactly when it will spawn again. <p><html>
