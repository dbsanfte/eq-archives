<br>
My intentions here were simple...To try to rebuild and/or keep the many friends i still have/had n DoK.  I personally still love you all, and wish you the best.  What i thought i was doing....was giving you all some strategies and/or tactics that we use.  I have now gotten yelled by Halo...and now by you all for sharing these ideas/tactics.   <br>
I want to see you all succeed, not spend hours and hours learning and many more hours CR.  We have already done that and i thought i could save you all the trouble.  I thought that If i could give you these ideas, then it would save you tons of time learning them on your own...or so i thought. <br>
<br>
I never tried to come off as bragging...or halo play by play.  Yes, if you wanna know everything we do...visit www.eq-halo.com or IC's forum.   I really haven't told/posted alot that we have done.  All i did was post: <br>
1: Some tactics we use, <br>
2: Talking with you all about some tactics, <br>
3: Saying hi and remaining friends with a few of ya<br>
4: Offering my help if/when you needed<br>
or 5: Telling you a funny story/raid i was part off.<br>
<br>
Although those things i guess appeared as " Hey look, Dels the bragging, loot-monger, halo bitch is back"  That truely upsets me.  I was alerted to Col's post by a couple of you(DoK) and sent Col a tell.  He was actaully polite and i believe honest to me.  Not as cold hearted as his post seem to indicate to me today by reading them.   So, please, if you want me to just stay off of these boards, Tell me below.  <br>
<br>
I have tried to go outta my way helping when any of you needed it.  Heck, even last night, i held up my raid 30mins just so i could give Liliel 2 rez's that she really needed.  I didn't mind, i'm glad i could help.  All that was needed from her was a simple thank you :) She tried to pay me, and apologize cause she held me up. I told her it wasn't needed, your welcome, and ran along my way to the raid i was going too.     <br>
I am NOT too good for you, i'm not that way.  I try to help everyone.....<br>
<br>
I really don't need to defend myself i don't thnk, i have helped alot of you all, and will continue untill i'm told to go away....<br>
<br>
In Conclusion,<br>
Again, i'm sorry if i sounded like "bragging" to you all, that was never my intentions.   I was simply trying to stay friends with you all, give and discuss tactics, and to help you all whenever needed....<br>
<br>
Safe Journeys....friends..<br>

I'll try to put this bluntly without seeming rude, and anyone here can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong:<br>
<br>
1) When I joined DoK, I joined because the people in it were people that I would do just about ANYTHING for.<br>
2) These are people I'm proud to be seen with as I feel that we should be judged by not only our own actions, but by the actions of those with whom we associate ourselves.  One example:  When one of our members in RL was in a bad situation, Tempestade BOUGHT her, with her own money, a new computer, drove to her house, and set it up for her.<br>
3) When someone whom fits #1 and #2 above, then turns around and associates with a person (or people) that many have alienated because of past or present actions, it's natural to feel a bit betrayed; hmmm, i'm not sure if betrayed is a strong enough word here.  I think it doesn't come down to the fact that you were in DoK and moved to another guild necessarily, I think it's your choice that made some people in the guild a bit bitter.  It's that whole #2 thing above that I think bummed most people out.  It's like Havenlight in a way.  Most of my old friends from Excalibur joined Havenlight while I stayed away from any guild for a while, and though I rarely spent much time with them after that, there weren't really any hard feelings between us.  We still had mutual respect for each other because Havenlight was a guild that most people respected, even if they envied them.  I don't think the same can be said for Halo.  I guess it would equate to a member of a family in the south going to fight for the north in the Civil War; maybe not quite that strong, but it was the only analogy I could come up with.<br>
<br>
Am I wrong?  Maybe it's just me?  /shrug.<br>
<br>
As for posting on this board, it's a public forum.  So long as you, as well as any other poster, wishes to post on this board and remains civil, I don't think anyone should be discouraged.  However, your tone is a bit condescending if I must say so.  Perhaps that was not your intention, but it sure comes off that way.  I once heard someone say this in response to a quote from Goldenrod, and for the life of me, I can't remember who it was.  It went something like this:<br>
<br>
'Goldenrod, if you are what I will be like when I reach the "high level game," then i'll be happy to never reach that level.'<br>
<br>
Something along those lines.  Take it for what it's worth.<br>

<br>
First off, yes I was irritated by some of the posts Dels made, Its no secret that I have little respect for a lot of what Halo is about (primariliy the GM, but also the type of people who would follow such a person).  Ewoen also got some of the feelings right about leaving one guild for another.  Its been discussed before, and I will make it clear again.  Temp and I did everything we thought was proper to keep Dels in DoK, she chose instead to join another guild.  So certainly, im sure I was predisposed to be irritated by posts (bragging or not) relating to Halo.<br>
<br>
With that said, and I cant stress this enough, I appreciate the fact that Dels was willing to share information with us, to help us out, and save us some trouble.  Even more so to the extent that she upset some folks in Halo (which kinda tickles me to hear).<br>
<br>
I spoke with Dels at length during the Jug's raid on Saturday, and I hope, made my point clear.  I (personnaly) have no problem with her posting here (not that it matters, this IS an open forum).  And I do in fact appreciate the effort she is making.  On the other hand I think she could pay a bit more attention to how she &quot;sounds&quot; when she posts (like I am here, trying to not come off as harsh, while still remaining honest).<br>
<br>
We have sevral people who view/post on our boards here, from outside the guild, and regardless of my personal feelings for them, as long as they refrain from using profanity, and remain civil, they should feel welcome in our house.  Just remember it IS OUR house. <p><html>

<br>
Some of your postings were definitely VERY appropriate - and MUCH appreciated - particularly when we ask about strategy - or perhaps mention failing on something.  When you tell us the successful way you did a mob - criticizing would be sort of like biting the hand that feeds you.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of the ill-will toward your guild's leader at times is like a pebble in the shoe for some of us - especially when someone mentions, for example, a zone, and you talk about some tough mob you took down (ie no one brought up that mob in particular).  To me - that's when it somewhat sounds like bragging.<br>
<br>
Anyway - I do think you should continue to post here; and I do hope you'll continue to offer us advice - and even help us on raids when appropriate (in fact personally my number one criticism of friends and former guild mates who join "Uber" Guilds - is most of them seem to never ever do anything except with members of their new guild and their allies).<br>
<br>
I do consider you a friend - and another of my very good friends (Kendric) is now in Halo; but I personally have great pride in bein a member of a guild who's leader is one of the most respected people on the server. <p><html>

Just want to say say it's good to hear some of your different perspectives, strategies, and places you've gone with Halo from time to time, so please do continue to post.  Also, one thing that I feel which is very noteworthy of you is your willingness to check out what's going down here and on XA and trying to minimize conflicts regarding camps/ raids.  Since Xegony doesn't have an offical calendar, it's nice to see you're willing to take a look around every now and again and try to head off contention for raid points.  Thanks for doing this.  I look forward to other posts on your strategies, and I hope to actually meet you sometime in game.  (I don't think I have yet to meet you - I joined DoK after you left.) <p><html>

It sure seems that you haven't.  I think that Eowen's, Wendaars, my own, and heck even Colu's response (never known for softening his position for diplomatic niceties) made it very clear what our opinions are and what it was the Colu objected to in the first place.<br>
<br>
I think Del's post was written sincerely and right to the point - but your comment sure seems to border on a "Troll"... <p><html>

I did read the post(s) before I posted but  may not have explained it as well as I should have.  I was fustrated that after all the help Dels has posted she gets flammed for adding a few posts about the adventures/accomplishments she has been on.  I did not see her posts as bragging.  I did see it as sharing her adventures/accomplishments with friends.  That is what I was upset.<br>
