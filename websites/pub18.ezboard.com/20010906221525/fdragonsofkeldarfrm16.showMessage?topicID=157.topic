3) Bunch of people wondering what Teserras are for, hehe<br>
4) Grats to Haatr on the necro bracer, I don't really know if it's any good, but it had 65 mana (/shrug).<br>

Hopefully we'll get a good turnout tonight to clear island 4 and, just perhaps, take a few from Island 5 for the RANGERS =D.  Plan on starting around 9PM or 9:30PM tonight.  There are a few people that messaged me to let me know that they would not be able to start till around 9:30 because of RL commitments.  If I get on earlier, I may play Inari for a while until people show up.<br>
<br>
Btw, this has been a VERY costly trip for me and some others.  Some people have donated to the cause.  If you have not, please make the appropriate donation to me and I will distribute the funds as fairly as possible.  To give you an idea of how much I've spent, after donations so far it's cost me around 1800 plat (in stones and coffins).<br>

<br>
Seriously, though.  I'm really excited to be getting involved in these Raids.  I'm not sure what Island 4 holds for us, or Hate if that happens, but I'm having fun with everybody there, and I'm loving it.<br>
<br>
As for those quest items, does anyone have a better site than Allakhazam's for listing who each item is for?  I'm thinking a chart like Alla's has of the Velious quest gems...very nice.  I was trying to keep Slyde informed last night, but all I could do was look for each item in the LONG list of ALL quest items, and see which quest each one corresponded to.<br>
<br>
Nice job, everyone, in the AirPlane.  Congratulations on the other drops, everyone.  Great zone, and we should kick butt here again sometime soon. <p>Rukog DethBryngr<BR>

Forgot to apologize again, too.  I'm sorry about last night everyone...<br>
<br>
Due to my Siphon Strength spell, we faced a near-wipeout from aggro'ing the quest mobs again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I wasn't clear what had been the trigger to the 2 wipes the night before, and I heard it was Lifetaps, so I hadn't even mem'ed that series.<br>
<br>
Apparently, though, it's any spell that makes you &quot;Smile at soandso and Say 'Ahh...I feel much better now!'&quot; or whatever the message is.  <br>
<br>
That takes out Siphon, Shroud, Vortex, Lifetaps, and Vampiric Embrace, plus any related weapon procs...not certain on any others, but basically, I've got my spellbook full of spells I haven't used in many months!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's a learning experience, and I'm glad I figured out for sure what the trigger was on Island 1, rather than facing another crappy CR on Azarack isle.<br>

I know this because I use them when we fight on the first isle as well.<br>
<br>
What DOES cause the mobs to aggro is anything that they percieve as PvP (dueling) on the 1st Isle.  If you were for instance to have the wrong target, that is a player instead of a mob targetd, and cast ANY offensive spell, you will aggro the quest mobs.  This includes color flux type AE spells, and probbaly any AE attack spell.  The coding was put in to keep ppl from dueling on the first isle to be summoned to further isles.<br>
<br>
Its possible that some bard songs as well might cause the aggo?  Have to ask Slyde what he has safely played up there. <p><html>

I don't know.<br>
<br>
I was wondering about the &quot;Smiles, Says 'Ahh'..&quot; spells doing it, since I'd been using them (except lifetaps) on the spirits we'd faced, all the way up until the princess.  That's why I was so confused.<br>
<br>
Monday night, Volker (SK) seemed to trigger 2 wipes, and then me last night.  It seemed too much of an SK pattern to be coincidence.<br>
<br>
Maybe it was our proximity to the quest mobs in the case of the princess?  Being further away before that fight might not have triggered them?<br>
<br>
Also, it was established that Ghrif was the first to get attacked.  We just wrote it off as him being the closest person agro'ed on the path of the mobs to me...<br>
<br>
Either way, I'm holding off on any of those spells on the 1st and 3rd Islands...I'll stick to Flutter and Grim Aura, and I'll test my 49 spells when I get them for &quot;Emote&quot; messages that may be similar triggers.<br>
<br>
Not sure how to do a &quot;scientific test&quot; of this matter, though, since Dueling itself will trigger them, and I'd hate to wipe a raid just to determine what spells FOR SURE are safe.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Col's right, though, with the targeting thing...someone could have accidentally targeted someone and cast a spell...Assist Keys are crucial.  *shrug*  Just wanna be safe, is all. <p>Rukog DethBryngr<BR>

<br>
It's possible it's coincidence; but we had a total of 3 aggroes of the quest mobs.  each time - IMMEDIATLY before the mobs attacked - someone had cast a spell with an a "say" (manatap, lifetap, strenghtap).<br>
<br>
Again, it's possibly coincidence - but this was verified in everyone's logs.  <br>
<br>
No one dueled, no one cast an AOE, no weapon procs, the only consistent thread between the three occurances, and verified in every instance was a say generated from a spell.<br>
<br>
AOE's are the easiest to verify in a multiple group setting - because someone would have gotten a "... tries to cast a spell on you but you were protected" message.  Those never happened.<br>
<br>
The weird thing - is that a different individual was attacked than the person who did the spell with the "say".<br>
<br>
So I do believe it's possible that we haven't really determined what causes it; but after three aggroes (two with wipeouts) we weren't willing to risk it... <p><html>
