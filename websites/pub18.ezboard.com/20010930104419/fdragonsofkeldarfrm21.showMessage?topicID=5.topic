<br>
The Council and Guild Leader met last night on a chat room to make a few decisions. Please bear with me, this is a long post. I am sorry Councilor Tikkeni couldn't be there, but the majority of the council was and here's what was decided:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Recruitment Freeze</b></font>: No new recruits will be voted on until the council and guild leader, by unanimity, decide to remove the freeze. Recruits whose names have already been listed on the board (even if they are not up for vote but pending officer evaluation) will continue their application process normally. If council and guild leade (again by unanimity) decide to open exceptions, the recruit will still follow the regular process of application and voting.<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Guild Grouping</b></font>: We will institute "Zone of the Week" for each level range. We ASK that you hunt in that zone during the week, so you have a better chance of grouping with your guildmates. This is not mandatory but I expect cooperation until you feel like you know reasonably well all members on your level range.<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Guild Events</b></font>: At least once every 2 weeks, DoK will host a non-exp event somewhere. It will not always be the Arena. Again your participation is not mandatory but strongly recommended. Those who don't show up for events repeatedly will be noted and whenever they complain about not knowing anyone in the guild... hmmm... we will ask why :)<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Class Officers</b></font>: Given that recruitment is frozen and there's been a lot of difficulty getting class officers to evaluate recruits, this function will be dissolved. <br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Mentors</b></font>: We will no longer appoint mentors for each class, but will request volunteers to mentor new members, regardless of their classes. To volunteer, please see the new thread on the Family Inn. Your responsibility will be to ensure the new members in DoK receive the attention and respect they deserve, and also be tutored in our charter, rules and structure.<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Officers</b></font>: Officers will meet with council and guild leader once a month on a chat room. Before we start this, they will be offered the chance to step down from their duties if they feel like they can no longer perform. Officership is not just an honor, it's a responsibility, a life of service to the guild, and those who don't meet this profile will be asked to step down. They may also lose officership if they don't show up for 3 consecutive meetings. The role of the remaining officers will be discussed during those meetings.<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Epic Quests</b></font>: We feel that it's necessary to remind all members that they are not obligated in any way to help guildmates with their epic quests. There's a "fever" in the guild as people get close to completing their quests, but that's the reason why we have Wednesday Quest Nights. I will not allow people to "push" or pressure guildmates in order to get help for their quests. There is an epic team being formed and again, this is NOT MANDATORY. If you are not in the epic team and feel like you're being pressured to help beyond your desire to help, we urge you to contact councilors or the guild leader in-game or via e-mail. <br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Respect for new members</b></font>: I am ashamed that we lost a new member and I received a complain from another one because they were mistreated or discriminated against by the older members. Let me remind you that you were all new members once and had you been treated unfairly, you would not have liked it. This is totally unacceptable. A new member is JUST AS IMPORTANT in the guild as any other member. They were voted in because we feel like they have what it takes to be a Dragon of Kel'Dar. Therefore they are just as good as any of us. Please take a few minutes to read a new thread in the Dungeon about this. I will have no problems putting people on probation or removing them from the guild no matter how long they've been around if this is how they treat a brother or sister.<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
<b>Calendar</b></font>: We are disappointed with the little use people are making of this great tool. In order to enforce what we feel is necessary to guarantee the success of raids, from now on <u>people who don't sign up will not be allowed to participate</u>. If you are not sure you can be there, sign up ANYWAY, and make a note to the raid leader that there is a chance you may not be there. I don't get it. People complain about not doing enough things with the guild and then we have to cancel raids for lack of attendees. <br>
<br>
Well, these are council/leader decisions. I hope you will understand they are being made in order to better the guild and improve the closeness some felt they were losing. I also hope you will help us through this moment by participating in raids and events, by hunting in the zone of the week and by doing your part in getting to know your family.<br>

<br>
I see Barbathol is listed in the recruits section?  Is the freeze lifted or was he "in the queue" before the freeze was enacted?  Not that I don't think we should invite him, mind you, I'm not for the freeze, but if a freeze was voted on then doesn't this go against that?<br>

I belive there are a few others who fall into this category as well (one reason we are dismissing class officers, only a few of them did thier jobs in a timely fashon). <p><html>

I found myself becoming the warrior class officer after Birr left the guild, but I was never informed or truly knew of all my responsibilities with the job.  I have checked the charter and I have tried to find information on the boards, but I still was unable to find information on being a class officer.<br>
Did I miss something?<br>
I tried to speak to Barbathol last night when I met him, and the night prior his sponsor in the guild spoke to me about him, and asked me about the class officer thing, yet I had no idea what he was speaking about.<br>
Where is (was) the description of being a class officer?  I really was never quite sure what my task was in that field, or I believe I would have gotten around to this "class evaluation" much sooner.<br>
Can you tell I feel a tad bit guilty about this? <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

<br>
I chatted with Barbathol today on the phone, and he appreciated your suggestions and inputs.  He actually called me to ask what my jewelry skill was and what I could make him in the way of some items.  <br>
<br>
By the way, he was really impressed with what you were equipped with.  And you complain about losing rolls!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
