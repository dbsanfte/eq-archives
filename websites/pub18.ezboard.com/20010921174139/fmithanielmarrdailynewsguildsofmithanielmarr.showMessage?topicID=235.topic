This cannot be streesed enough, and it is also the place where the vast majority of people stumble. A guild is a gathering of people who have come togther for a PURPOSE. You need to ask yourself what this purpose will be, it could be roleplaying, it could be powergaming, it could be to play Sand Giant Football, but above all, make very sure that your guild has a purpose that goes above and beyond the normal camp-kill-loot routine in EQ. <br>
If your guild doesn't have a fixed purpose, then it is little more than an extra chat channel to communicate with people. And lets face it, if that is the kind of guild you make, then its succes is purely dependent on the people you get in the guild, and if there are no enough people who are of the sort that you want, then your guild will fall apart in less than 3 months, give or take a month.<br>
A Friends Guild as we shall call them, has no purpose other than to bring people into contact with others. And remember this: 90% of all guild are of the Friends sort, what makes you think that YOUR guild will be so special that people would want to join it ? Always look around your server and see if there is a niche that your guild can fill, and if there isn't, then surply and demand will ensure that your guild won't last long.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2. Get the right sort of people to be founding members</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I have seen far to many potential guildmasters go around hunting for temporary founding members in the faith that once the guild is created then the new members will come like rain during a storm.<br>
Wrong.<br>
A lot depends on your founding members, a lot more than you might think at first. Your founding members are what will attract other people, especially if your guild is a Friends Guild. Firstly, you should ensure that your founding members are of the player type that you want to have in the guild. If you are making a roleplaying guild, then you should of course have roleplayers and so forth. <br>
And most importantly: Make very sure that a number of your founding members are ACTIVE players and guildmembers. This is another major issue. If you have finally created a guild for a very specific purpose above that of the normal boredom of EQ, then your greates assest is active members who share in your vision and likes to participate in what the guild has to offer.<br>
Take a roleplaying guild for instance, if I create a roleplaying guild then the people in it should be someone who likes to drop what they are doing at a moments notice and come join me in an roleplaying event. There is nothing worse than members who are 'busy' elsewhere camping or holding a spawn when you have finally managed to create a special event just for them, be it a special raid, a roleplaying event or a game of Sand Giant Football.<br>
Also, your founding members will be the ones who will do the majority of recruiting, and if they are enshusiastic about their guild then they will find ways to transmit that enthusiasm to potential recruits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3.Do something!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Having said that, try seeing it from a regular guildmembers perspective, they have joined a guild, possibly rejecting other guildoffers in order to be in your guild, they will expect to be entertained.<br>
One of the worst crimes that you can commit to a newly founded guild is not to do anything. Your members will expect something fun to be in the pipeline, don't dissapoint them.<br>
If you don't have something for your members to do, then they will quickly get bored and go off on their regular camp-kill-loot routine, from where there is not far to leaving your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4.Prepare for the casualties</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
No matter how good a leader you are or how special your guild is, people will drop out for one reason or another. This is something that you must prepare for. Be certain that you can survive the resulting drop in members. I estimate that unless you are very lucky indeed. After a month then you will have lost 1/3 to 1/2 of your original members, depending on how well you have entertained them. <br>
So make sure that you recruit enough people before you found your guild that you are certain that you can carry out your purpose. A guild created for the sole purpose of raiding Hate every week or holding a Sand Giant Football match every weekend has a certain minimum on its memberbase in order to succes in its purpose, and if nothing else then there is that dreaded 10-accounts minimum before your guild will face the possibility of being forcefully disbanded.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5.Be there for them</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Being guildmaster is a lot of work, don't take the job unless you are certain you can handle it. A guild cannot run itself, there will always be issues where your presence will be required or your judgement will be wanted. <br>
Don't ever leave your members alone for too long, if you do, you will create a leadership crisis in the guild. I have been in a guild where we practically never saw our guildmaster or any of our officers. The guild was not succesfull and quickly fell apart due to a lack of leadership. If you create it, then you must guide it too.<br>
And unless you have been seriously luckly in finding officers, then don't rely on your officers to be able to steer the guild on their own. Always assume the worst, then you can breathe a sigh of relief later. Which leads me nicely to:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6. Communication</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Make sure that before you create the guild you have a means of getting the members togther offline. A website and message board is essensial, especially the message board. Find a place where you can host your website, its not difficult, free homepages can be held in many places. I use geocities ( www.geocities.com )<br>
And for message boards, the most common one in use seems to be Ezboard ( www.ezboard.com )<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 7. Advertise your presence</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you have read through all this and despite my warnings have decided to create your guild or perhaps even done so already, then make sure you make others aware of your presence. Advertise, post messages on practically every single message board you can get your grubby little hands on. You will take a lot of insults in the process and a lot of &quot;Hahaha, look at the newbies&quot;. Live with it, because there will also be people who will read your message and think to themselves &quot;Hmm, that's nice maybe I should join this guild.&quot; <br>
This is another reason for having a message board and website, so that potential recruits have an easier time getting in touch with you.<br>
<br>
Well, being guildmaster isn't easy, but there is nothing quite like that feeling you get where you have held a succesful raid/RP-event/Football match for your guild, and all your members can back later and told you &quot;Thanks, we had a great time, when do we do it again ?&quot;<br>
That, my friend, is the feeling of succes. Value it when you get it, for it doesn't come easy.<br>

<br>
I was playing a untwinked newbie alt in EC the other day and had 3 different guild startups /tell me to ask if I wanted to join.  My question was always &quot;What are your plans&quot;, only one guild had a reasonable answer, &quot;to help newbies&quot;.  The rest were either &quot;to be an uber guild&quot; or &quot;planes guild&quot;.  The error in that logic is that they are asking a lvl 9 human monk to join a &quot;planar power&quot;.  I think MM has a guild for just about everyone.  If you can't find a guild that will take you, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU, buy a copy of &quot;How to win friends and influence enemies&quot;, read it live it.  <br>
<br>
One thing to add to Elhimac's list (add to #5):<br>
As a guildleader, if you are going to be gone for more than a few weeks, transfer leadership, not just in title, but the Leader tag.  I was &quot;leader&quot; of a guild, but not the leader according to the server, so the guild died when the officers quit playing/moved on to other guilds.  The leader comes back 3 months later to find his guild gone.<br>

Definetly Upier as Center- If any Gnomes come on a blitz he will just eat them<br>
Left Guard as Imadi - Big ass, nuff said<br>

Left Tackle Defenitly would be Bakk - He also has a big ass, and puts fear into the hearts of Elves everywhere.<br>
Right Tackle hmm would be Scrunch - Good driver<br>
My Tight End would have to be Skinnart for sure- He can slow his enemys while still being quick enough to be good.<br>
My Full Back would be Utnayan's alt Utntout - D0rfs would make good ones wouldnt you think?<br>
My Tailback position would have to go to Shakld - He does have a tail ya know.<br>
My Y reciver would be Monalot - Short and quick, can take some punishment<br>

"Friends guilds" <i>can</i> be successful.  I was co-leader of one that remained active for about a year, and is now hibernating.  The tag still shows up every now and then, though only 1 or 2 of the players are founding members.<br>
<br>
We were small, and friendly, and we had so much fun.  The reason behind forming the guild was just what you advised against.  A more convenient chat channel for friends.  We accomplished what we wanted.  That accomplishment was creating a group of real friends...and though I hate to use the now-so-cliche-term...a family.  Many people feel there needs to be more to a guild.  Loot, roleplay, exp-hunting, sand giant football...they're all great reasons to join a guild.  But why join a guild if you can't call each and every person in it your friend?  I know there are very few people out there who can honestly say they like all of their guildmates.<br>
<br>
We <i>were</i> special.  People <i>did</i> want to join our guild over others.  Friendship was the bond we had, our reason for being a guild, and it worked.  At least in our eyes it did.<br>
<br>
/cheers to all the past members of CoAI<br>
<br>
And I guess this is a good time to say to those who feel they left on bad terms (you know who you are), "I ain't mad at ya, ain't got nothin but love for ya."<br>
<br>
And to any aspiring guildleaders out there:  If you are truly dedicated to your guild, your guildmembers will know this, and will pay you back for your commitment.  Even if only one person tells you that they enjoy being in your guild, you are doing something right.  Lead and learn. <p><font size="+1"><Font Face="curlz mt, lucida handwriting, comic sans ms, times new roman"><Font color="004000">Astara De'Crescendo<BR> Minstrel of Mischief</Font></Font></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D7CFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/uelhimac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elhimac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Roleplay my precioussss</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#E09C5F>(6/13/01 5:31:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to make a succesful guild</span><hr size=1> Astara, I'm not saying that a Friends Guild can't be a succesful one, I'm only saying that the vast majority of the guilds on the server are Friends guilds and that any guild that you would create would have a hard time being unique. <br>
I'm not saying that such a guild won't be a good one, but I am saying that such a guild would be relying on its members and their reputation for all the interest in the guild. Take my Phantom Guard for instance, unlike most other guilds PG does not rely solely on friendship for its recruiting, but instead uses its reputation for roleplaying as an additional attraction to potential recruits. And I'm not implying that the members in PG aren't good friends, far from it.<br>
Certaintly, there are a good deal of Friends guilds who have been very succesfull have have been around for a long time, but for each and every one that has been around longer than 4 or 5 months, I'm willing to bet I can give you 3 examples of guilds that were disbanded before they had been in existence for 3 months. <br>
So I am suggesting to all the hopefull guildleaders that they should think twice before they found their guild, and that if they can make a purpose for their guild other than being an average friends guild, then they should do so because it will be an extra insurance for their guild.<br>

Very good thoughts Elhimac.<br>
<br>
I would add a little bit to your comments on leadership...<br>
<br>
Once you have established the guild, someone needs to be the final arbiter.  Typically that's the guild leader.  If someone isn't firmly and continuously monitoring membership and activity to make sure the purpose is achieved, then the guild can lose direction and falter.  One direction, one purpose, tough decisions, but better in the long run.<br>
<br>
Something that I find myself saying often is that no guild is 'right' vs. another one and no player's style is 'wrong', it just doesn't fit in every guild or group or raid or RP event.  The trick is to find the place that's comfortable, and be respectful of others' styles.<br>
<br>
Tough to be tolerant; tough to find the place that's right for you; painful to discover you thought you had the right place but didn't...  But oh so heavenly when you do find the right one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>

<br>
First off, El is very correct on choosing the right founding members.  In a prior leadership role, I made some VERY bad decisions regarding my right and left hand members which to this day are still having an adverse effect on the inner workings of that organization, even though both me and they are long gone from it.  The people that you pick to work with you in leading the group speak with your voice and your authority when you are gone.  If what they are saying is not what you would say, then the wrong message is getting out and the direction of the guild will skew.<br>
<br>
That said, let me add another point that is very evident in a couple of the threads on the rant board...if your guild tag is over your head, you speak for your guild, and this is TRIPLY true if you announce yourself as the leader.  All it takes is 1 cop to beat you up to make you afraid of all cops, maybe everyone in uniform.  If one person in Guild X gives you a bad experience, then the chances are you'll associate that experience with that guild tag the next time you encounter someone from that guild.<br>
<br>
If you are the leader of a Guild, either shut up, or make DAMN sure what you are saying is what you want said on behalf of the guild.  Stepping out onto a board and making a complete ass of yourself makes a complete ass of your guild.  Guild leaders are not &quot;human&quot; when they post and they don't get to lose their temper or make mistakes publicly.  When they write up a post, they type it out, then walk away from it for a bit to get a drink or take a walk, then come back and re-read it to make absolute sure it is as clear and concise as possible.  I know that, for every post that makes it to the board, there are 3 that die in rewrites because I rethought the message.  <br>
<br>
Nothing says &quot;My guild is a group of pathetic losers&quot; better than making an ass of yourself, then coming right behind your own post and either apologizing and defending your right to make mistakes, or ranting and raving about how everyone misinterpreted you and making yourself (and your guild) a victim.<br>
<br>
Not all leaders are great public speakers.  If you are a great leader but not comfortable speaking for your guild...DON'T.  Find someone in your guild that is eloquent, clear, and understands the message of your guild and have THEM do the posting/speaking.  Every guild/group has a poet in there somewhere that loves to read their own typing (*cough*MacGregor*cough*) and has oodles of spare time during the day or night to make sure the guild's message is posted.  Make sure they do understand your message and work closely with you or they might send out the wrong message.<br>

We are a guild of Friends. Small and close knit and thankfully its been an easy guild to be in. I know a few of our people said they had searched a year or more to find the right guild. I'm happy to see them say "Hey Tallia" when I log on I can tell you that.<br>
<br>
When we founded TMR we had one thought in mind and it was to have a group of people we could trust and get along well with. So far those visions have come to pass. <br>
<br>
I did make one mistake the same as  Mac did by not being careful who I put out there to represent us. It did come back and haunt me.  Thankfully I was able to nip it in the bud and set things straight. <br>
<br>
Being a small quiet guild has its down falls though. No one knows you! But hey its okay. The longer you play the more friends you make. Not all of them need to be in your guild its nice to know they are out there.  :)<br>

Thank you for the words of wisdom put down here and the honesty in your responses. <br>

IMHO, the biggest stumbling block of guilds handling growth.  I don't have any keen insights about this, but I've seen growing pains tear apart so many friends guilds.<br>
<br>
People change.  People level at different rates.  People enjoy doing different things in game.  This is why friends guilds often disband after a while.<br>

I agree with Mara and Memak. Most guilds falter because they either try to do too much, or not enough, and their recruiting zigzags to fit the goal of the week, which results in a core of members with no over-arching purpose, no unifying goal. I've always made it my single most important duty as a guildleader to put the -- here it comes -- VisionTM -- of the guild at the forefront at all times. Cheesy as it sounds, without someone vigorously steering the guild along the original course plotted, it's easy to get sidetracked and lose direction -- and lose members. As Mara hinted at, most guildleaders are too nice, and don't have the guts to stick by the VisionTM at all costs so as not to lose members in the short run. But in the long run, they'll be lost anyway, because their VisionTMs didn't line up anyway. :/<br>
<br>
EverQuest is a miserable game for keeping a casual-friendship-oriented guild together, that's undeniable -- but it can be done. Hopefully the next generation of MMORPGs won't have the same destructive levelling systems. Game designers sometimes forget the game is supposed to be *gasp* fun.<br>
<br>
Most people in this thread I notice speak with the wisdom acquired from having made these same mistakes in the past -- I sure have. Adaptation to what works and what doesn't, really is everything. <p><p><font size="1" face="Verdana">Cimmarose's player<br>

<br>
One fo the problems that Loremaster had (at one time) was that there was almost no requirements: anyone and everyone could get it.<br>
<br>
Problem was, it lead to a lot of arguing, fussing, fighting, and eventually a guild split.<br>
<br>
One of the first things I did was add a ruleset when I took over leadership.  Candidates are interviewed carefully to make sure we all share common ideals/goals. It makes dealing with guild issues much, much easier if we all have the same final goals in mind.<br>
<br>
That being said, another important thing is to know when your members play: being spread across Euro/Asian/America timezones can be possibly destructive as well, as people who play in &quot;off&quot; times can feel left out.<br>
<br>
The one thing I don't worry about is what classes we have.  I do care what level, and what type of player they are.  Normally, I want new guidlies to be 30 or higher. Why?  Because it saves me time trying to plan fun events for people from 1-60.  Much, much easier to do it from say, 30-50 or so.  As to what type player you are: we find that out (hopefully) in the first two weeks or so of membership.  If you're a constant whiner, you probably won't be invited to stay.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents. <p><center>

To be ALL Erudite with Good/Neutral Classes only.  A Roleplay guild.   As we Erudites wished to remove ourselves from associating with ye of lesser intelligence. =P<br>
<br>
Of course many told me it wouldnt work. We could never become Uber and Never raid successfully.<br>
<br>
But we never defined a successful guild as an uber-raiding machine.  People joined us to be different. Many alts joined us to take a break from uber raiding infact =)<br>
<br>
We did however experience the same problems as other guilds.  When members reached epic levels they craved high level adventures, and the DB couldn't offer that.<br>
<br>
So the DB evolved into a mid level RP guild that serves as an Elite Fraternity for Erudites who desire RP and eventually will move on in the elder years.<br>
<br>
Some showed their loyalty by using &quot;Darkender&quot; as their sur name, so when you see Erudites in other guilds with the sur name &quot;Darkender&quot; you know their heritage.<br>
<br>
***Of course when we did raid we had to improvise in ways that all/class guilds would never have to:  our tanks were the few Eru pals on the server, plus our mage pets.  Our nuke power was incredible of course, and mob control along with heals was not a problem. ***<br>
<br>
After two years with membership exceeding the 100 mark, I'd say the Darkender Bloodline was a success.  But in no way was it an easy task. Many Same Race guilds give up..we never did. =)  Good luck to those who attempt it.<br>

Thanks for starting this one Elhimac.<br>
<br>
Relaxed guild or raid guild?<br>
<br>
Been struggling with this one forever.  Always, it seems, after watching many a guild come and go, it's one or the other.  History, as I've seen it, says you cannot be both.<br>
<br>
You either lose your high levels that are raid-capable because you're &quot;too relaxed&quot; or you lose the lower levels because they feel left out.<br>
<br>
Phantom Guard is a unique case, in that they are niether &quot;raid&quot; nor &quot;relaxed&quot;.  They're an RP guild, and my hat's off to them.<br>
<br>
Allexus can relate to the rest of this post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
RoV began about the second week (maybe the 4th week) of MM going live.  Shortly before I joined, its membership was cut in half.  No, I don't know why.  I joined a guild of about 15 people.<br>
<br>
The guild's original leader and its other founding member, found out that RL came first and both pretty much disappeared from Norrath.  We had no guild direction, no charter, tons of problems, and no clear leadership.  Our members were levelling themselves up and out, effectively &quot;outgrowing&quot; RoV.<br>
<br>
Allexus and I, at that time, did the best we could.  We developed our tenets, and I think both of us would agree that they were more written out of frustration and anger than anything else.  They are being redeveloped as we speak <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
We floundered, and floundered badly.  Things would improve for 2 or 3 weeks, then go to hell again.<br>
<br>
5 months ago (seems like 10 years) the original leader stepped down giving me the reins and the guild now had an active leader with a clear direction.<br>
<br>
Active leadership is the key.  If the guildleader isn't playing, then he needs to step down and turn it over.<br>
<br>
Since I took over RoV, we're about 60 members now.  Lots of the members are RL friends of other members, etc.  Some are in-game friends.<br>
<br>
We've recently promoted 2 members to officer status (Grygus and Jandak).  Both of these new officers will argue every damn thing I say, point-counter point, etc.  It's taken us two weeks to hash out the new tenets (and we'll probably spend 2 more weeks arguing about 1 final point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).<br>
<br>
I love them both for it.  Their heart is in the right place.  The other officers are becoming more involved now, and it looks like RoV is finally on it's way.<br>
<br>
Because its leaders are active, and its leaders communicate.<br>
<br>
All posts above made some very good points.  In picking your founding members or new officers, I found the above posts lacked the most important point of this:<br>
<br>
The rest of the guild has to be willing to follow them.<br>
<br>
As for the biggest problem we have (and most any other guild I know has)... managing growth (thank you Memak).  Raid or relaxed guild?  How do you keep the most guildmembers happy?  How do you keep enough members at enough levels so that few, if any, feel like their guild isn't their home?<br>
<br>
I don't know, and I imagine there is no right or wrong answer, though managing the growth is a key factor.  As I said before, most every guild I see is either &quot;raid&quot; or &quot;relaxed&quot;.  Not both.  RoV is going to try for both though and see how it goes.<br>
<br>
Elhimac's original post in this thread pretty much touched on everything.. hit the nail on the head, so-to-speak.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the points made above<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  That said, let me add another point that is very evident in a couple of the threads on the rant board...if your guild tag is over your head, you speak for your guild, and this is TRIPLY true if you announce yourself as the leader.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Amen brother.  It seems I can never stress this enough.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Stepping out onto a board and making a complete ass of yourself makes a complete ass of your guild. Guild leaders are not &quot;human&quot; when they post and they don't get to lose their temper or make mistakes publicly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This also applies to dealing not only on boards like these, but in interacting with other players IN GAME as well.  I got into a discussion with Benevelont Order's leader one night and because of his attitude I felt like I was talking to a 13-year old.  Since then, I don't associate with that guild, period.  When you're the Guildleader, your actions, attitude and speech will stand out, and be remembered.<br>
<br>
As the Guildleader, for those that aspire to try it, be prepared.  You'll get more complaints/gripes/bitches than you ever will pats on the back.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    My personal guidelines, some from experience...<br>
<br>
1)  Never overestimate your value to your Guild.  Become complacent, or think that your guild cannot do without you, and you'll be proven wrong.<br>
2)  Ensure that your guildmembers are having FUN at the game.  While I can't make anyone enjoy anything, if I'm not provided the opportunity for them to do so, I'm not doing my job.  Once the opportunity is there, it's up to them.<br>
3)  Understand that you are limited, and you will make mistakes, and even a few enemies.<br>
4)  Officers:  yes you can have too many, and yes, you can have the wrong ones.  Find those that the guild is willing to follow, ensure they are able and willing to lead, and put them in the positions to do so.<br>
5)  Do not make the mistake of thinking you have to do it all.  You can't, I can't, no one can.  That's what you have Officers for.  Empower them, empower even non-officers (you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results).<br>
6)  Have fun yourself.  If you're not, your guild will know, and will be affected by it (RoV is never in doubt when I'm in a bad mood or just simply bored <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) <p><img src=http://baaklar.homestead.com/files/Signatures/BaaklarSig.jpg><BR><BR>
