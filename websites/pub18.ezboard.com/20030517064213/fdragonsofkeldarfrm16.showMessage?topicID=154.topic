We'll do better tonight.  If you can, and you intend on coming tonight (i.e. you are parked up there or will get a ride), please post here.<br>
<br>
Some notes about Isle 3, Azarack Isle.<br>
<br>
1) Tonight we will fight exactly where we zoned in.<br>
2) We will all still zone in invis, only Linila and I will break our invis and wait for a wanderer to attack.<br>
3) When you zone in, please, do NOT move unless it's toward the outside rim of the island but be careful not to fall off.  Get your bearings before you move.<br>
4) Assist.  This wasn't really a problem last night, I just want to reiterate how important it is.<br>
5) When a mob is killed, loot the broken mirror from the Azrack's corpse immediately.<br>
6) Reinforcements will be coming.<br>
7) If you are a large race, try to get a shrink from Wiggle.<br>
8) Remember, Azracks are DAMN hard to mez, so if you break a mez, you've probably just killed a chanter.  Dead chanters = wipeout.<br>
<br>
That's about it =).  See you all tonight, 9PM EST.  Something IRL has come up that requires my attendance, but I should still be there at 9PM.  If enough people show up before I get there, and reinforcements come up (Linila knows some of these people), please, feel free to wipe out a few fairies.  Just make sure there are enough key pieces for those people who do not yet have them.<br>

You will get more adds, faster, and have a much higher chance of wiping out.<br>
<br>
The spot we picked last time was nearly optimal, out on the edge of the pathing, and way down below the &quot;flight altitude&quot; reducing aggro range. <p><html>

<br>
You stated that you are starting about 9pm est right?  Just making sure.  We need to go up and kill that Monk thingie real fast, but we're going up at 5:30est and be done with isle 1-2 by like 6:30 so it shouldn't be a problem.  <br>
<br>
I was curious tho, since we'll need to kill isle 1...and you say reinforcements are coming...wer eyou planning on summon/rez method to join the rest of raid? or did you have planned to kill isle 1 to rejoin?  Let me know, i believe isle 1 is on a 12hour(?) timer?  <br>
<br>
If you need isle one mobs, let me know.  We are only bringing up 6ppl tonight, so if you need the keys, you can have or we'll let those mobs alive so you can kill them when your raid starts.  We'll prolly just clear isle one for fun, unless you need those keys as well. ok?<br>
<br>
Not sure if i'm going as one of our 6, however, Scalemane is leading this raid for us.  Contact him, or I, if you need to get ahold of us if you don't reply back here today.<br>
<br>
I knew you had this raid planned, but i don't think this will interfer as you are past isle one and we will prolly be gone by the time you all log in.  Thanks in advance.<br>

Then Aydra (I believe) had her invis drop, but we were all at the camp - she didn't train anything and did a great job of letting us know it was dropping in advance.  I'm not sure, but I think we may have engaged them too far from the edge (so, too far into the center of the island) and as such we kept getting adds.  I think it is an absolute must that every single person except for Linila, Eowen, Riffs and I get a shrink, for every single inch we move closer to the center of the island has the possibility to create an add.  I understand some may not like to be small, but it'll help to minimize the space we take up and lower the chances of an add.  Also, it'll help us chanters to be able to click on the adds more easily.<br>
<br>
Yes, they are highly reistent to mez, but I was able to do my normal mez (Dazzle) at about a 35% success rate (4 mezzed, ~7 resists).  I really think we could do this island more easily, but we just need to have everyone on the correct strategy - assisting Linila, Clerics healing the chanters first, and we shouldn't have any problems.<br>
<br>
My recommendation would be to have a secondary healer (dr00d/ shammy) in the chanter groups just to be on the safe side, and even have the pally's grouped there too for a LoH last-resort.  My cleric dropped pretty early in the fight, and quite honestly I was surprised how long I actually stayed alive after this - considering I didn't have my AE stun available.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to making it happen tonight - This is the second time I've been wacked on that island which, by the way, occured when we got adds like crazy at the zone-in point (somone's invis popped immediately that time.)  Now, it was a while ago and I wansn't a chanter then, but it seemed like we got more adds in that case.  And it was my very first plane raid and had been a while since I saw yellow and red mobs on my character.  /shrug.  My vote would be to go to the far edge again and try it there and see what happens with the shrinks and all. <p><html>

if you kill all the mobs on island 1, then we're pretty much SOL since we can't get anymore keys for our reinforcements.  The duel/summon/rez thing ain't a good idea on island 1 due to aggroing the efreetis, so basically we're screwed if Halo does this.  Only other option (if we both plan on cooperating) is waiting until all of us our logged in and ready to fight.  We're only bringing up about 10 to 12 reinforcements so there would be enough keys for everyone.  However, unless you BUY the keys from the keymaster, you have to clear all of the fairies to get Sirran to spawn which, again, leaves us with no way to get keys.<br>

Del - we had wipeout and CR at isle one - so everone is camped at isle one - so getting people to join up with the raid is a simple TP from a wizard :) <p><html>

Didn't know you were still on One. My Bad.  <br>
<br>
Hrm, yeah, i never thought about needing to kill all of them to spawn Sirran.  Thought we looted, ported over heh.  It's been a while there for me.  <br>
<br>
Any chance your reinforcments could get online earlier?  I would like to try to work it out, but not much i can do here :)  Not 100% i'll even be going.  <br>
<br>
They had planned to go up last night at 6pm...but i told them you all had planned to go thru the isles.  So HALO decided to let you all move ahead.  I didn't think you'd still be here :(   <br>
<br>
We have a big ol thing happening about 7pm, and would like to finish this beforehand obviously.  gah.  This sucks.<br>
<br>
Well, even if i can't convince HALO to wait another day. (our monk has been waiting for weeks) and keeps this little raid bumped every time he's had it scheduled. =/  You all can still summon to isle two? Yes, it's a pain in the butt, but it's still doable.  Or maybe, you could help purchase keys for our 6 ppl? then we could just ignore isle one?<br>
<br>
The keys are like 300-400p each or something right?  Not sure each of them want to spend the cash for them.  I don't know, i'll chat with them.  Let me know if your other ppl can get up there around 6pm...if worse come to worse, and we decide to kill to get this over with, you all can loot the remaining keys.  <br>
<br>
Then again, i suppose we should just jump up there, kill the island, and loot what we need and destroy the rest of the keys huh Col?  However, that isn't HALO, and that's why i came here to attempt to work out a solution.  If halo was as vindicative as Col thinks, i wouldn't have bothered, and you all would just log into an empty island...hrm....<br>
<br>
Diplomacy does work....if both sides have an open mind...<br>

We need to reinforcements because some people coudn't be up there the second night, so we need to bring up more.  So the summon/ rez would be tough, for we'd be doing this with only about 12-16 people fighting the full spawn of the nasties.  Let's see what we can work out - I don't think many people will be logged on by six, so this is tough.<br>
<br>
I appreciate you trying to work this out, Dels, and thanks for speaking up yesterday for us.  We should be much farther along in the island hopping now, but another guild out there wasn't as considerate as you and decided to pop up to Air on Sunday (our first day) and throwing off our plans/ momentum.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can help to split the cost of they keys you need - the costs if I remember right are like 280pp or 420pp, depending on what key you need.  And of course it'll be the 420pp one (it can never be the 1cp one! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  I know I wouldn't mind contributing like 100pp or so to help keep the sprites up for our reinforcements.<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for coming and trying to work this out! <p><html>

<br>
Nevermind, dont answer that, I already know your point, and its about appearing to be a victim.<br>
<br>
Get it through that thick skull of yours that what your guild did in Hate was DISPICABLE.  There is no justification for it, and no amount of dis-information will cloud the facts.<br>
<br>
No one, however said that Delsenora was vindictive did they?  No, just the folks you have chosen to guild with.  You werent even in hate, so I dont see how what I say about the rest of Halo applies to you anyway, unless of course you agree with the way they handled themselves. <p><html>

Well Col, this is a HALO raid, not a Delsenora Raid.  I came to attempt to work this out, however it doesn't seem feasible.  I quit trying...<br>
<br>
If we must live up to our reputation, we will go ahead with our plans.  Sorry we couldn't work this out all.  If someone more diplomatic would like to send me tell between 5-6pm today to try again, do so.  I'd hate to see 2 raids trashed due to this childishness. <p><html>

If you wish to stoop to the level of your guild, im sure you will.  If you honestly wish to try to resolve the issue, then your opinion of me wont interfere with your efforts.
