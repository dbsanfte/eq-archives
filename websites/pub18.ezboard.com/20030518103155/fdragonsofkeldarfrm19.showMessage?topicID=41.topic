BACKGROUND:  Hehe, OKies, before ya read, there is some language involved here,  but all in all, it's                            not "THAT" bad :)<br>
<br>
                          This happened about 2 weeks ago to a friend of mine, in Inner Circle.  He "snipped" the                            log times, etc out to make it easier to read, along with adding a little commentary :P.  We                             all DIED laughing when we heard of this.  See...some times Ebay'rs can be alot of fun to                             play with :)<br>
<br>
THE STORY:                      <br>
                          So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see <br>
                          the message: "d00d sow plz".<br>
<br>
                          Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb                           (hereafter referred to politely as "the petitioner")<br>
                          must have been poorly informed at best.<br>
<br>
                          Boy was I ever wrong.<br>
<br>
                          I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes                           behold? Only myself and the petitioner.<br>
<br>
                          So I says to myself...."Self? You need to edumacate this fella!"<br>
<br>
                          (Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton<br>
                          form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a                           LARGE dark-brown skeleton named "Gibober"<br>
                          standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.)<br>
<br>
                          I say "Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer."<br>
<br>
                          The Petitioner says, "$#*&@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr"<br>
<br>
                          Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a "/who all dumbass" (um..pardon..I                           meant "/who all petitioner")<br>
<br>
                          This is where I discovered the "/who all" bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right?                                                     There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31                           Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl.<br>
<br>
                          Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began                                                     dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while                           deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Necromancer's can't cast SoW".<br>
<br>
                          Petitioner says, "Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i                           couldn't catch you until you sat down! if<br>
                          you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a dick about it a$$hole"<br>
<br>
                          Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "I have JBoots."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "what are they"<br>
<br>
                          Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor....<br>
<br>
                          Petitioner asks, "can you buff my hps my hp sux"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "I can't buff you, dude. I'm a Necromancer. I only have one buff that<br>
                          you would probably want."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "yeah the one you won't give me dick"<br>
<br>
                          Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Why do you need a sow?"<br>
<br>
                          He says, "i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level"<br>
<br>
                          Yep. That's what he said......"burned woods".<br>
<br>
                          I say, "man are you ever in the wrong place."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "?"<br>
<br>
                          Apparently he found the "question mark" key conveniently located nearby other various                           and sundry communication facilitators.<br>
<br>
                          I didn't answer him.<br>
<br>
                          He repeats, "??"<br>
<br>
                          Found it twice...good for him.<br>
<br>
                          He repeats, "???"<br>
<br>
                          Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "my friend told me it was in kunark"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of                                                     months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "?"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "!"<br>
<br>
                          He says, "?"<br>
<br>
                          I say, ","<br>
<br>
                          He says, "wtf"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "no, already have some."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "????"<br>
<br>
                          I don't respond.<br>
<br>
                          He says, "so where the @#$% is burned woods"<br>
<br>
                          He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his                           feet.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch,<br>
                          since they began randomizing zone locations."<br>
<br>
                          My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet.                           Just snippets.<br>
<br>
                          He says, "@#$% i just got off the boat"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "You don't need the boat."<br>
<br>
                          He says "why"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "You're a wizard!"<br>
<br>
                          He says, "how you know that"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "oh yeah the green ones"<br>
<br>
                          I nod.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "thx"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "How'd you think about doing it that way?"<br>
<br>
                          He says, "they were all @#$%## up when i got this char"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "why"<br>
<br>
                          Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with<br>
                          your collection of boogers.<br>
<br>
                          I say, "It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "how do you know"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "All patch messages come with a zone connection map."<br>
<br>
                          He says, "oh"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Ok. You have it memmed now?"<br>
<br>
                          He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book.<br>
<br>
                          He says, "yeah"<br>
<br>
                          I say, "Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there."<br>
<br>
                          Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell.<br>
<br>
                          A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes<br>
                          I still haven't heard from him.<br>
<br>
                          Getting curious:<br>
<br>
                          I tell petitioner, "Are you there yet?"<br>
<br>
                          No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ]<br>
<br>
                          Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through.<br>
<br>
                          I tell petitioner, "Hit the 'r' key to reply to me."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "i'm here now where do i go."<br>
<br>
                          Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. "C" for effort.<br>
<br>
                          I tell petitioner, "Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "no"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one."<br>
<br>
                          It was a guess, but an educated one.<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "found it"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Click on it."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "north"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north.                           When it forks to the right, take the right<br>
                          fork."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "ok"<br>
<br>
                          Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction                           up.<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "They were roleplaying."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P"<br>
<br>
                          Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you.<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Where are you?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "i see something now. looks like a castle"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble,                           just keep running."<br>
<br>
                          Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in.<br>
<br>
                          A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was<br>
                          expecting.<br>
<br>
                          I tell petitioner, "What happened?"<br>
<br>
                          As if I didn't know....<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "my spells are gone!"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "What happened?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "i died why"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "east wtf???"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Yikes. My bad. You should have run west."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "?"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "So where are you now?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "how can i tell"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you<br>
                          'You have entered [zone]'."<br>
<br>
                          He replies "it doesnt say [zone] there."<br>
<br>
                          After smacking my head against my monitor....<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "What does it say in place of [zone]?".<br>
<br>
                          Get this....<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "Burning Woods"<br>
<br>
                          I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way!<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "is that the same as burned woods"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "i have to get my corpse back?????"<br>
<br>
                          /ignore petitioner<br>
<br>
<br>
                          Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No!<br>
<br>
                          Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened.<br>
<br>
                          I tell petitioner, "How's it going?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "wtf? where you been"<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "been afk, sorry."<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me."<br>
<br>
                          My conscience somewhat eased...<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Really? Cool! Where are you now?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "iceclad ocean"<br>
<br>
                          I scratch my head a few times.<br>
<br>
                          I reply, "Why Velious?"<br>
<br>
                          He replies, "the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this                           week"<br>
<br>
                          I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly                           before my dog dialed 911.<br>
<br>
                          He replied, "@#$%&* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?"<br>
<br>
                          That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife. <p><html>
