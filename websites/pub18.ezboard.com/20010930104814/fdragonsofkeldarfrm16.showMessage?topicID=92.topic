We scouted fear and formed up to break, there was some conflict with the guild Val'Kori, who seemed to feel that even showing up second to the jump off spot they had some claim to the zone.  Thankfully Temp handled the diplomacy, as I was ready to throttle a couple of them (even after they yielded the zone, they left a couple of monks in there FD to watch us break, claiming that if we failed they would form up and break).<br>
<br>
Luckily we had a pretty smooth break, 1 enchanter who was dead more than alive, and we did it in one shot.  Pulls started, and we cleared up to the Tentacle Tormentors before folks had to start leaving.  Id like to hear how the follow up raid went after we left. <p><html>

I didnt have anything going on, so wandered over to PoG, figured I could run around the zone and spot or harmony for your raid.<br>
<br>
Of course, that didnt happen, and I was requested to get some of the scout party and other raiders out of PoG/WL and over to Feerott, only too happy to oblige.<br>
<br>
While doin that, I received a /tell asking if I was going to go up to Fear with you guys, hadnt planned on it, but said  that I'd love to go if no one minded me not being able to stay past midnight.  Got the &quot;ok&quot; from Haatr, and went on in to Fear with group 4.  <br>
<br>
Great break, Finasteride once again did an amazing job as the solo Enchanter, and hats off to everyone else on a job well done.<br>
<br>
I ended up staying until 2am (and man, am I paying for THAT today) and had a great time.   I dont recall any uber drops, but it was great to see everyone working as a team.<br>
<br>
I'm always up for a raid, even if ya just need a scout for a Tunare bashin party.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href =mailto:sulvento@hotmail.com>Notus SulVento</a><br><b>57 Preserver of Clan Phoenix<br>Ally to Dragons of Kel'Dar <br>Member of Xegony Alliance</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/utempestade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tempestade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 1170<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/3/01 9:51:31 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.keldar.com/bearwalk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Plane of Fear Recap</span><hr size=1> Until I left, at about 11:30 Eastern, we had only a couple drops - monk bracer (congrats Geutto), cryo belt (haatr), fluxblade axe (Solak) and carmine sleeves (Uldor).

<br>
Yeah.  That's why.<br>
<br>
I want to thank Mel for letting me run Melchiah for the night.  I hope everything works out and we'll see you back here with us again.  I didn't get any drops for you...sorry.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (BTW...you're parked in SRo at the wizzy pyramid.)<br>
<br>
I also want to say thanks for everyone being open to having me participate in my first Planar raid, even though it was in an &quot;out of body experience&quot;.<br>
<br>
I was pretty impressed with how smoothly everything went, especially after hearing such horror stories about wipe outs and failed breaks...I barely even noticed a hiccup.  The &quot;mass of melee flesh&quot; did get a little annoying at times...trying to reach over the crowd to get a whack in was difficult.  <br>
<br>
I also realized as I logged Mel in that all the hotkeys reset because it was a different client.  I also had to fight the urge to cast spells...kind of a lazy life for you Warriors!  I never did get the effects figured out for all Mel's armor, but I can worry about some of that if/when I get some special armors of my own.<br>
<br>
Rukog's got another half level to get through 45, and it's killing  me how slowly the bar is moving.  I DID pull about 1/3rd of a blue fear kiting one Rager in DL last night before the raid, but it took all my mana and he was beating on me pretty bad...maybe I'd better try grouping again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm just giddy about getting Ruk up in the Planes, though, and I'll be joining you all before you know it.<br>
<br>
Very nicely run raid.  <br>

Overall, I think it went well.  I was designated the puller, a job I've never done in Fear before.  In fact, I've never been anywhere else but the tree.<br>
<br>
I pulled a bit slow, but we did very well, and other then me getting blinded and lost, and Rujii dieing getting my corpse, I think it went very well.  Binek helped me out a lot in learning the zone, and pulled quite a bit as well.  We ended up clearing the zone, other then Cazic of course.<br>
<br>
Quadrin ended up getting Verm boots and arms, Shaedon got some wizard arms, Nyte got a blue diamond, a pair of verm arms rotted, at least one rogue weapon rotted, a pair of monk gloves dropped that I don't know who won.  (was dead at the time and not in zone)<br>
<br>
Overall, I'd say it was pretty sucessful. <p><html>

 I must say, it was a great raid, and even when half the raid departed, we still rocked fear's world with 20 people. I feel I was especially lucky, having verm boots drop and noone but me wanted, then noone wanted verm arms (except me), so I was told to loot em, and not let em rot, another pair of verm arms dropped too after that.<br>
<br>
  We kicked butt, and I would be happy to raid with all y'all any time. Falcar did a good job leading after most left, and Jiet did a great job pulling.<br>
<br>
  Thanks again for allowing me to go, I shall be on most raids with you guys in the future.<br>
