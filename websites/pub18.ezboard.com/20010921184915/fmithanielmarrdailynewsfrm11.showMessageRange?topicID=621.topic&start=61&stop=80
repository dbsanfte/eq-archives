<br>
We all know that everyone at some point in thier EQ life pisses/trains/etc someone in this game. Being human, we all tend to focus on the negative rather than the positive. They dont call this the  &quot;Days of Mithaniel Marr&quot; for nothing.  I notice that in this forum is are maybe 3 threads dealing with someones act of kindness rather than a flame about soandso did this. <br>
<br>
Everyone needs to lay off the testosterone suppliments and realize that this is a game. I think one of the major reasons people leave this game is not because they are bored, but because there are more politics and blacklisting in the game than in RL. <br>
<br>
Selwen is an EXTREMELY good raid leader. He and the rest of CS have gotten some major kudos for doing things that were thought could not be done by us. The only thing that Selwen has some issues with is a)letting go of things and b) his approach to people. Everyone rubs people the wrong way at times. Some one thinks they are being funny, I think they are being immature. I think I am being whitty, someone thinks I am insensitive. Tis human nature to be so. I don't get along with Selwen( as he well knows) and I was one of those that did not want him in my guild anymore. But that does not mean that if given the opportunity to raid with him I would say no. <br>
<br>
Ut, Selwen has done ALOT more things to me than I would believe he has done to you. If I can /ignore or not even bother with him or his alts, why can't anyone else? Selwen and I have had huge arguements before. Pick up and drive on. If you keep letting all the little things get to you, one is not long for this world.<br>
<br>
If someone annoys you, /ignore and drive on and enjoy the game. If they send someone else to you, do the same till it becomes harrassment and deal with it accordingly. <br>
<br>
Ut, I dont personally know you at all. Never grouped with you or your alts. But I think that you are being slightly unfair in this post. All posts are 2 way. All posts have different sides of the story. Unless you can bring some evidence into the post, dont go quoting stuff that you cannot back up. <br>
<br>
I am not defending nor attacking anyone. I think that somewhat of neutral party needs to intervene to tell both of you to grow up and go on with life. And yes, I dont personally like Selwen at all, but that does not mean that I enjoy seeing anyone get rake over the coals for a pretty petty reason.<br>

<br>
First I want to say how sad it is to see such childish posts and how out of hand this thread has gotten.  <br>
<br>
I have been friends with Selwen for over 2 years on EQ and I have seen it all.  Great guilds that get created, break up and reformed into other great guilds, conflict that occurs but works its way out through the process of forgiveness and understanding.  I have learned several lessons myself about commenting on boards about  judging peoples purely on my emotions at the time and not on common sense.  Selwen has consistently shown his ability to be a true leader in all areas of leadership.  I have seen him get upset and yes it is not pretty but I would ask any of you to take a look at how you and any of your friends react when they are upset, is it something you are proud to be part of?  <br>
<br>
In respect to Ut, I don't know you at all and I will not claim to understand your thought process, because I am not interested in analyzing you.  However, I would offer that if you have such a problem with Selwen, in the game of course, that you make some attempt to work it out.  In all of your postings I saw nothing but attacks with no offer of resolution.  I believe that you may have been hurt by his actions but take a second and put yourself in his shoes, infact, read your threads and pretend you were him, can you see why you offer no resolution in your threads?  If you cannot begin to bring yourself to forgive and forget then you have 2 options<br>
<br>
1.  Place him on ignore and move on<br>
2.  Go the arena and work out your frustrations, whoever wins declares this to be over.  <br>
<br>
I personally don't think going to the arena will solve anything and I almost bet that Selwen would rather work it out and become your friend than fight it out, because that is how my friend Selwen works.  However be assured that one way or the other it will get WORKED out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I agree with Dev's last post concerning resolution, I know Dev from a previous char and he speaks of true experience, this type a emotional posting offers nothing other than something to read when people get bored.<br>
<br>
I challenge all of you that have posted from both sides of this conflict, make a change in yourself and try, honestly try, to work it out.  The feeling of accomplishment you get (maybe even new friendships) that will last forever would surely outweigh any feeling of accomplishments attained from the name calling and trashing that this thread has shown.  <br>
<br>
I am not trying to say I am perfect myself, I am only reflecting on my xper with such issues.  Selwen is a great guy as well as all of you who have posted here on this thread, lets remove the emotion, work it out and move on because MM has umber lewts and mobs that need some great leaders to conquer.<br>

(for historical purposes:  I was in a guild with Storms and Selwen way back when.  At the time I played Miraquai as my main.  The guild broke up, and ended with a lot of this flaming bullshit and didn't get ANY of us anywhere.  It served no purpose then, and in hindsight was a total waste of time.  That bitterness that was harbored was resolved a while ago, as it should have been from the start.)<br>

<br>
Remember one thing here.  I did not go onto another character and start rehashing everything after I put him on ignore.  You fail to realize this.  <br>
<br>
My job here is to point out the crap players.  I have gotten more than enough tells and emails onthe subject but... As with screenshots and logs, those are just not viable proof.  That email was written to me by a member of CS and I left the name out.  As usual I do not let others get involved if they do not want to. <br>
<br>
I try and wake people up.  People that fall for the fake crap that this guy is spouting off. Like I said, one of my downfalls are fake people.  Cannot stand them and never will be able to stand them.  As far as proof anything here can be edited.  Anyone who deals with Athreule knows that they are a widely respected guild on the server by many.  Know that the members are very honest and true, and do not make things up about stories.  Such as Selwen's concocted tells I gave him when I so called threatened his rep. <br>
<br>
When I read garbage and fake junk like this I almost just want to quit the game and be done with it entirely.  I will always point out this type of thing. Whether you agree with it or not is up to you.  I see things first hand, and I will write about it and point it out.  And if I save one person from grief of having to deal with this guy, than I have done what I think is a favor to the game and the server. <br>
<br>
Just because there are a couple people that have their eyes closed, doesn't mean you cannot open them. <br>
<br>
The last two posts seemed very intelligent.  However, and the only way you will ever know this is if someone comes to my house here in Minnesota and looks at the tells I get on Utntout or Utnayan, the replies I get about this person is astounding. I love the game, I love playing it, and I like to pretect the integrity of the game.  Until I actually do quit one of these days, I will still try and protect the &quot;real&quot; players out there that love the game, and help people, and strive to make it better.  Not end up being a trainer of mobs to multiple Kael raids, one of Athreule's included.  <br>
<br>
Its one thing to come here and make a speech.  Its another to follow through with it. I'd like to see Selwen actually follow through on his words.  <br>
<br>
As far as being a saint?  I probably have the loudest mouth at times when I really get into a topic or into a good group and get riled up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But never... Have I ever trained anyone on purpose since I started playing.  Nor will I ever.  I would always go through the proper channels of authority. <br>
<br>
Its funny though how the evidence I did give was just ignored.  What about me getting tells from his other characters as well as other players in a hole when I already Ignored the guy?  Yet still questions on that do you people read?  Also what about the Guide summoning him out of the area?  You all think they do that for kicks?  Do you know how much someone has to screw up before they summon someone? <br>

First of all, really dont know how Vortix's name got into the issue, should've been Clubber, because he was the real ass. Vortix decided to become an ass towards the end of his career because he lost his joy in the game.<br>
<br>
Secondly, kick ass post Alaryas. Even though im not in guild, give me a shout out =)<br>

Thirdly, whenever you post something about someones spelling and grammatical errors.....You need a life. If you have nothing to write about but someones spelling crap, you need to.....<br>

1.) Become a English teacher,<br>
2.) Like i said before...get a life, or<br>
3.) Dont quit your day job in the bathroom with your one-eyed friend.<br>

<br>
I respect your champion attitude to seek out and expose the fake people in the world, we all have this in us.  I only caution that sometimes if you are so bent on finding the fake in people you end up never seeing the truth in them due to the fact that you focus on the negative.  I have not read all posts on this board but I have seen some people actually try to post postive comments, good che (sp)  like the chinese would say. Have you ever posted a good comment on this board?  If so can you take that approach and seek out the good here if there is any and use it for resolution.  I dunno but you seem very very upset and frankly it looks as though you will have to find a resolution yourself.  I am only giving you some advice from my point of view of what I try to do when I am overly frustrated with issues and cannot figure out how to resolved them.  The negative will consume and destory anyone that gets caught in it, I know this from xper <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Good luck to you my friend and I hope it does come to a peaceful resolution for all.  Thanks for the spelling correction on the name, I have been up from FEAR and RageFire all night so my apologies for raping your name hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can assure you people that know me will know if it sounds like me or not. I remember the conversation vividly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also Selwen, you were not online.  I looked for you. <br>
<br>
But like I said, if this thread gets you to shape up, and you really are sorry and those actions come through, I am more than willing to set aside differences.  I always am.  What would be the point of bringing this up if I didn't want the previously bad apples to change their colors? <br>
<br>
In fact, I would even go to the extreme of coming here, posting about someone, witnessing that, and than... Having them try and go out of their way to make me look like a schmuck for ever accusing them of anything by being nice to every player they encounter to prove me wrong. <br>
<br>
A little reverse phychology I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Utnayan you seem to do this to a shitload of ppl, wtf is that bout anyway  are you that freaking miserable with the game that you have to make these posting at the LEAST a weekly basis; or are you just trying to do your duties or do da.<br>
<br>
This is a fucking game and im so tired of ppl taking it so seriously. People let anything get to them so bad, how many times have you posted a topic about so and so being a horrible person and making you sick utnayan and making you feel like you wanted to quit the game. If the game makes you so mad where you want to quit so much or you have to bash the hell outa ppl on a message board then you are way past the time of when you should of quit.<br>

why in gods name are people telling YOU about their problem there having with someone else, i really dont even see where you come into the picture. and if they really are ( which i dont see happening) tell them they can deal with it themselves and it has nothing to do with you , instead of comming here attempting to destroy this guys rep.

Who the hell are you to tell this person to get a life, he points out a spelling error and you go apeshit on his ass. I really dont see how reading and ranting on msg boards about a computer game and then playing the game also gives anyone the room to talk about a life. Nm wait, i read what your write, in your spare time you like to visit poor kids, play football with them, work out, hang out with your girlfriend, ALL STUFF that is that would be stereotypical for having a &quot;life&quot;. I really dont see you fit in the time of day to be superman of RL and the MMDN at the same time,/cheer<br>
<br>
As long as im ranting and more then likely gonna get banned or whatever i  was wondering why in the hell are there no edit buttons for us. I remember your long ass post about tallas and how you wanted to beat him up and he's a shit head and your the man and stuff, i come back the next day and you edited it out. Not to mention ive seen you do that with a couple other of your post. <br>

<br>
  Edit buttons are not in because people were editing their posts. <br>
<br>
The only thing I edited out of the last post was what I did for a living and I didn't want anyone else to know.  <br>
<br>
Reason for posting?  Because people ruin the game for others and I look out for them.  Simple as that.  <br>

Alah: Whoever the hell you are... Do you even play the game?  How about a sig or something so I know who to stay away from since you have no clue.  Only two people I have mentioned here are Tallas and Selwen. I am about to mention one more though, and I don't know if you are this guy or not.  But you sure sound like it.  See a thread titled &quot;Who the hell is Kamus?&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh wait...  You are Rashaz.  RL friend of Bringit.  Not going to knock that guy because I know first hand now he is trying to clean up his rep.  But I see you are still a tard. <br>

It seems obvious by the posts of your friends that you have a severe Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Personality problem going.  How else do you expect some people to act towards you if they only get the extreme anger you seem to posses.  Work on controlling you anger towards others (and not going over the top with it) and you wouldn't have the rep problems you seems to be getting from it.  You could be the nicest guy in the world, but it only takes one action to forever brand you as a jerk in EQ <p><b><i><font face="Copperplate, Bookman Old Style, Arial" size="4">Lyet Stormpaw</font></i></b></font><font face="Tahoma, Bookman Old Style, Arial" size="4"><br>
