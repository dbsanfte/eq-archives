Interesting read if you want to know more about the history.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;At the beginning of time, Veeshan created the lands of Norath and placed her First Brood on the world. This brood consisted of Lord Yelinak, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Illiandar, and Sontalak. Over time, more dragons are born, such as Jaled'Dar, Trakanon, etc. There was only one faction for the dragons at this time. There was not such thing as the Ring of Scale or Claws of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Somewhere during this time, two dragons of different colors decided to mate. The resulting child dragon was Kerafyrm. Some believe that this dragon may have been more powerful then all of the First Brood and may have been almost equal to Veeshan, herself. It is also believed that Kerafyrm may have been insane and wanted to destroy world of Norath and all life on it. <br>
<br>
What ever the results of the mating was, a war broke out amoung the dragons which became known as the War of the Scale. This war was devistating to the dragons. It horrorified them. To end the war, the First Brood and all of dragonkind was forced to imprison Kerafyrm in a deep sleep and place him in a tomb. Kerafyrm's sleep has to be maintained and gaurded by four warders inorder for him to stay asleep. It is unsure if these 4 warders are also a member of the First Brood, along with Lord Yelinak and the others, or a member of the Second or Third Broods as is Kerafyrm, himself.<br>
<br>
After the war, many new laws were formed to prevent this thing from every happening again. The two most notable laws the dragonkind made were: 1. Dragons of different colors are forbidden to ever mate. 2. Dragons are forbidden from killing each other.<br>
<br>
Sometime after the War of Scale, Jaled'Dar did not like the way that Lord Yelinak was running things for the dragonkind. Jaled'dar formed a splinter faction of dragons and lead them from their homelands in Velious to the lands of Kunark. The splinter faction become known as the Ring of Scale while the original faction become known as the Claws of Veeshan. Amoung these Ring of Scale faction dragons were Trakanon, Phara'Dar, Lord Nagafen, Lady Vox, and others. <br>
<br>
Now, on the continent of Kunark there rose a race of lizardmen named Shissar. The Shissar exanded their empire far and wide throughout the land. They experimented with many dark magical arts and discovered many powerful and secret magics. The Shissar had gained so much power that they even angered their own gods. Their gods brought down a plague upon the Shissar that completely whiped them from the face of Norath.<br>
<br>
At the end of the Shissar empire, there were five tribes of the Iksar. The Iksar were the slaves of Shissar, and now that their masters were all gone they had free reign to grow. Each of the tribes grew to power on their own. The five tribes were the Kunzar, Kylong, Nasthar, Obulous and Jasarth. They named their leaders Sathir which is Iksar for &quot;King&quot;. Eventially, one Sathir gained enough power to combine the five tribes under one rule and created the Iksar empire. This Sathir was Venril of the Kunzar tribe. He made Sebilis his captial and started a period of expansion and consolidation.<br>
<br>
Over time, Venril explore the dark arts that the Shissar left behind. As he grew old, he began to fear death and wanted to become immortal. He finally made a pack with Innoruuk for the knowledge and power to make himself immortal. An amulet was created that with the correct rites would allow him to achieve his goal. But inorder to become immortal, he first had to commit suicide. Then his initiates were supposed to place the amulet, that had captured his sole at this death, back on his corpse. This ritual was interupted by his Venril's son Rile. Rile wanted to be king and knew that he would never be king if Venril become immortal. Rile had Venril's corpse destroyed and the amulet containing the sole of the old king hidden.<br>
<br>
While this all was taking place, the Ring of the Scale faction of dragons who now resided on Kunark, held a secret meeting to discuss the iksar expansion and its threat to the dragonkind. Trakanon, who may have been considered the wisest being on Norath, advocated a powerful direct and immediate intervention on behalf of all the races against the Iksar. It is rumored that Trakanon may have had the power of foresight and knew that the Iksar would eventually challenge the power of the dragons. The other lords of the Ring of Scale disagreed with him and it was decided that the dragons would only take an indirect hand in with the Iksar expansion.<br>
<br>
Trakanon decided to take matters into his own hands. While Rile, the new king of the Iksar, was saling with his fleet in the Timorous Deep, a sqaul arose and sinks the Sebilisian fleet including the flag ship Fetid Plank which Rile was aboard. All hands were lost including Rile. The lords of the Ring of Scale were furious and Jaded'Dar, leader of the Ring of Scale dragons, imprisoned Trakanon for 600 years.<br>
<br>
Rile was succeeded by his son Atrebe. Atrebe was more like his grandfather Venril then he was like his father Rile. While Rile was a warrior king, Atrebe aspired to learn the dark arts that his grandfather knew. He experimented with combining dragons and iksar to create the Sarnak which he had trained to be his slave army. He also experimented with combining dragons with Frogluk to create the Sokokar which would be the flying mounts for his Sarnak army. Atrebe perished in one of his own foul rituals gone bad.<br>
<br>
Atrebe was succeed by his third son and general, Ganak, who acted quickly and assassinates his brothers become the king of the Sebilisian Empire. In retaliation against an acts that Atrebe did against the dragons, the dragons go to war against the Iksars. This war last about forty-four years. Towards the end of the war, a mighty battle was fought in the skys of what is now know as the Field of Bones. In this battle, Ganak on the back of a Sokokar meets Jadel'Dar. The magic that they used to fight each other kills both of them. <br>
<br>
Ganak was succeeded by his only son Chottal. In a final blaze of revenge and desperation, a group of dragons attack the royal palace and kill Chottal Sathir. This ends the war between Iksar and the dragons. The dragons of the Ring of Scale are devisated by their loses and return to their Peaks.<br>
<br>
This also ends the reign of kings with the Iksar empire and a new council is formed. This council is called the Emerald Circle. The Emerald Circle attempts to rebuild the Iksar empire but runs into some difficulty. There are earthquakes that drop ancient Viesar into the Lake of the Moon. Danak is split and half of it falls into the sea. Starvation spreads across the empire. The frogluk and giants that the iksar have conquered and enslaved rise up in revolt. Even their own creation, the Sarnak, turn against their masters. The Goblin lords of Faydwer send raiding parties to Kunark. Kurn's Tower is smashed and broken by an army of giants lead by a mountain giant named Warslik.<br>
<br>
Trakanon and his allies burst free from their 600 year imprisonment and descend upon the cities of the Iksar and reduce them to ruins. They take the bones of slain Iksar and other creatures to the sight of the death of Jadel'Dar as an example for others who may think to fill the shoes of the Iksar.<br>
<br>
Finally, the Ring of Scale reforms around Jaled'Dar's daughter, Phara-dar. They demand that the destruction be ended before the continent is ripped apart. Trakanon refuses to rest until death and vows to watch to insure that the Iksar never rises again. Phara-dar blames Trakanon for the death of her father since it was he that started may have started the war with the Iksar when he had Rile killed. Trakanon is banished to the council chambers of Sebilis to live days forfilling his vow to watch for the return of the Iksar empire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Added into this series of events are some of side stories that include Lady Vox, Lord Nagafer, Jaled'Dar, Venril Sathir, and Zlandicar.<br>
<br>
Some time during the reign of the Iksar, it seems that Lady Vox and Lord Nagafer wanted to mate. This was against one of the laws that was created after the War of the Scale. It is believed that Veeshan may have had to take a hand in the event to stop Lady Vox and Lord Nagafer from creating a second Kerafym. Lady Vox was imprisoned in Permaforst and Lord Nagafer was imprisoned in Lavastorm to keep them from completing what they desired.<br>
<br>
Sometime after the fight that killed Ganak and Jaled'Dar, part of Jaled'Dar's remains was taken to the dragon graveyard Dragon Necropilous. While it was there, Zlandicar decided to taste it. This caused Zlandicar to desire only to eat the flesh of fellow dragons.<br>
<br>
Sometime after the fall of the Iksar empire, the Sarnaks rose to a short time in power. During this time, they explored the dark arts that the Iksar, and before them, the Shissar used. They found the remains of Rile, son of Venril. They also found the amulet containing Venril's sole. They completed the ritual causing Venril to be reborn in the body of his son. Venril rose up to conquer the land again and using his dark arts he created an army of undead. The gaints who would not be slaves again, fought back and forced Venril to hold only Karnor Castle in the middle of the desert of the Dreadlands.<br>
<br>
It also seems that Jaled'Dar's spirit did not go to the afterlife but was stuck in the dragon's graveyard. This may have been the result of his flesh being consumed by Zlandicar. How ever it happens, it seems that the spirit may have gone insane or atleast desire to be released from the world of Norath. Jaled'Dar see that the only way that he can accomplish this goal is to have the Sleeper released. If Kerafym is released from his prison, the destruction of all the dragons and the world of Norath would give Jaled'Dar his final release. But he is still bound, even in death, but the laws of the dragons and not being able to directly kill another dragon. So he is unable to removed the warders that protect the prison of the Sleeper. To achieve his goal, he tricks mortal advantures into doing it for him by giving them the key necessary to gain access to Kerafym's tomb. To prevent the First Brood from stopping Kerafym again, should he be freed, Jaled'Dar desires proof that all First Brood have been defeated prior to giving the key to some unluck adventurer.<br>
<br>
As I said, this is what I can determine from the storyline and post that I have seen. Some of this may be in error, but it can give a general picture behind the events that lead up to the Sleeper's Tomb. Enjoy. <br>
