I spoke to a few people there, and they said it would be no problem if we hit the second floor.  So we went up, formed up and uh-oh both groups in Hate were preparing to hit the second floor.  Luckily Yarrash was leading the other crew, and was completly nice about sharing.  Both groups wound up splitting the second level, and evntually merging when some of the BT folks took off for the night.  Drops are pretty scarce compared to the lower level, but WOW when they do drop they are incredible.<br>
<br>
Rjak and Simplie won Cullers, 2HS 31/37 and look Great<br>
Tashia won an earring +5 to all saves.<br>
A druid from the other group won an Uber Druid belt.<br>
Readd got some great Ranger (POG quailty) Legs.<br>
Lillypaws got to loot an Insidious Halo<br>
I won Umbral Bracers, but they rotted before I could make my way to the other group to loot them.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will be going back again tonight, and starting as early as 7 or 8 EST.  Hopefully we can clear the lower level ourselves, but if not, we will go back to the second floor, its pretty huge and can support multiple raids.<br>
Innoruuk was UP last night, but we didnt have the right mix or experiance to try him. <p><html>

Will you have enough there tonight?  <br>
I wouldn't mind coming to help IF you needed me or wanted me there.  I wouldn't mind fighting with some of my old friends....<br>
<br>
Personally, i'd still REALLY like to see temp get those dang pants.  If ppl are worried about me looting? forget it.  I won't loot unless it'll rot, and i doubt that would happen.  Besides, only EM i think i need still is helm, or maybe a bracer, but i could care less if i get those. <br>
<br>
Just a thought, and wanted to offer my help,  if wanted great, if not, s'ok as well.  <br>
<br>
i only brought this up cause of your other post about only having 3 clerics or whatnot signing up for Hate, if you can find others that want to go or soething, that's cool.  Just would hate to see a raid canceled cause no clerics =/<br>
<br>
BTW, Do you know WHO cleared it yesterday at Server Up?  We had those darn demi's timed, but not that screwed us all up =/<br>

They started at about 11 AM but I hear they moved pretty slow all day.  So the demis are probbaly spread out some.  I know they took Meastro around 4 or 5 EST.  Whats his spawn time now anyway? Maybe get a shot at him or his hand tonight.<br>
I also think there was a patch yesterday.  Which is why ppl went up so early.<br>
<br>
As far as clerics, we had 4 or so last night, give us a tell around 7 EST or so, and we will have a better idea, I dont think anyone would have a problem with you joining (as long as you dont need pants, Temp really wants em bad, I saw her trying to Train other clerics last night and loot the bodies).<br>
<br>
We should start pulling between 7 and 8 and I think sevral people will be getting rides up from S ro around then. <p><html>

Well, I do want those pants but that didn't stop me from inviting and welcoming a total of 7 clerics last night, most of which did not have pants :) (no wonder everyone stared at them!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't really know how the groups will look like tonight, we have a fair number of people who weren't with us last night and intend to join tonight, so I think it will be a matter of getting stones, wizards and counting the people for groups. Dels, feel free to give me a tell.<br>

<br>
Druid Belt was Ultra-Uber!  The stats were:<br>
<br>
10 Wis, 60 Mana, 60 HPs, +20 sv Magic, and I think 7 AC<br>
(I never seem to look at AC, so it could be different.)<br>
<br>
As this was the first time I was up in Hate, how do the spawns work?  I was expecting to see some Forsaken Revenants (need that essence of vampire!) and I don't think I saw one.  Do they spawn on the 1st floor?  Also, we do need to get Temp her legs.  What mobs do they drop off, and where do they spawn?  Also, what is the average spawn time on common mobs?<br>
<br>
See you all tonight.  I am camped at the entrance to Hate (note, not a good idea to have pulls being fought around the TP symbol when it is click and you are TPed), so I will be on an alt until we decide to go up.<br>

It was a blast, though only being 52 kinda trivializes my role as an Enchanter.  (Can't mez, mob is tashed by the time I will cast it, people want C2, etc.)  But it was still fun and a learning experience.  I tell ya, porting up and running on the wall, only to have to camp while Eese soloed the mob (thanks again bro! /salute!) got the blood pumping.  Add to that the other raid /ooc'ing &quot;Halo on corpse going to rot&quot; really made me jump up and down in my seat.  It's great to see Lilly was able to win the random and get to it.

Tashia has an excelent drop list posted on the XA website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://xegonyalliance.com">xegonyalliance.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The second floor mobs pretty much drop POG quality armor for Tunare worshipers.  And some Class and race only items, and weapons.  Second floor loot is MUCH more rare, and superior in general.<br>
<br>
And at 52 you can mez pretty much anything on the first floor, except Spite Golems, which pretty much nothing sticks on. <p><html>

I know we have done Hate with only 49 and 50 chanters before, and it all works out.  Some mobs are more resistant than others for sure, Clerics and Revs come to mind.  But they all CAN be mezed (except spites). <p><html>

<br>
And agreed.  I guess that is more where I was coming from...  I was told by a chanter last night not to even try mezzing anything on the 2nd floor, due to the 49 Ench spell not working on them.  I had heard the first floor was more mezzable (I got a rat mezzed but died due to someone breaking mez early on.)<br>
<br>
So I guess that my excitement on the 1st floor is two fold.  One is the class-specific armour (and more drops, so more people will get items) and that I can actually contribute.<br>

I will be looking for people in Hate as I log and will be on Wendaar at the first opportunity to do so.  Getting pumped already.  Damn clock, tick!  Only 2:20PM.

Thanks all for helping me get the halo!  I love my cha now.  The second floor mobs some ARE mezable, using glamor of k, but highly resistant and hard to keep mezzed when no one is listening to /ooc for %t is mez'ed.  I mezed a few when we first went up there, only to die by agro after someone would tank it to keep us all alive.  So I gave up on mezzing after the first few fights.  But just for future reference, some can be mez'd with GoK.<br>
<br>
1st floor mezzing, no matter what level, is still highly resisted.  I did one hate raid with me as the only enchanter on the first floor.  If I wasn't resisted then someone inevitably broke the mez and caused agro on me before I could mem blur.  I finally talked the raid leader that time to give me a personal healer and NOT to freak and put a tank on it if I started getting hit on.  It went fine from there but you can almost guarentee to get resisted the first time you try to mez a target.  GoK will work with less resists but the mob will only stay mezed for like 30 seconds.  I would much rather keep trying with Dazzle until it sticks.  If we're to be mezzing mobs tonight /assist is going to be a big deal.  Do not panic if the enchanter starts getting hit on, have someone stun the target, someone heal the chanter and let the chanter keep trying till it sticks.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Tashia will be there again with us, she's a good enchanter and I would much rather rely on her skills at mezzing at 57 than mine at 55 or Wend's at 52.  But even if all 3 of us are there Wen come along because it's a great learning experience.  If Tashia is there all and she's doing the majority of the mezzing please bug me and not her for c2.  She'll be busy mezzing and snaking the tanks.<br>

But, personally I only learn so much sitting in the background...  I'm a hands-on guy, and like to get the experience first hand.  I learn much faster this way...  I also get reminded faster- i.e. When I agreed to tash the mobs and you slow, what did I do on the next mob?  The classic Tash right off the bat, aggro the heck out of the mob, and I died.  This was good, as it reminded me to not be a dumb-ass, and I tried to get the cleric to resuscitate me so I would take the hit in the exp bar as a reminder of being so stupid, but I deferred to the 49 rez instead.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also would much rather rely on Tashia at 57 mezzing than me any day.  I looked at her equipment, and all I had to say is WOW.<br>
<br>
And I would be more than happy to take over the snaking of the tanks from her...  Just a few more components... Getting sooo close  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.showMessage?topicID=54.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.showMessage?topicID=44.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.emailToFriend?topicID=60.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.threadControl?topicID=60.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub18.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm13">The Guest House<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm8">Recruits<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm14">The Roster<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm16">War Room<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm17">The Foyer<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm19">The Theater<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm23">Clan Phoenix<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm21">The Courier<option value="dragonsofkeldargeneraldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm12">The Assembly<option value="dragonsofkeldarraidsandevents">Raids <option value="dragonsofkeldarequipment">Equipment<option value="dragonsofkeldarwordsrunesetc">Words, Runes, etc<option value="dragonsofkeldarcouncilarea">Council <option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm6">Officers<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm7">Events<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm9">Flea Market<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm10">The Dungeon<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm11">The Hiring Hall<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm18">The Library<option value="dragonsofkeldarfrm20">The Epic Headquarters</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/bdragonsofkeldar>Dragons of Kel'Dar</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fdragonsofkeldarfrm16>War Room</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="www.keldar.com">Dragons of Kel'Dar </a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
