<br>
Here are some things I get asked frequently about being a cleric:<br>
<br>
1) Heals<br>
I have 4 heals memorized - Celestial Healing, Divine Light, Remedy and Complete Heal. I use Celestial Healing when the mob is off the target. It will slowly heal the target up to their full hps, but if the mob is still on them, it wont be fast enough. Divine Light heals a bunch of hps, but has a rather bad casting time, so keep that in mind. For emergencies, go with Remedy, it doesn't heal as much but casting time is lightening fast so it keeps the chanter alive longer ;) CH is something you wanna use during down time or when the battle is controlled so you can afford to wait for your tank to be low enough to make casting time and mana cost worth while. I often wait until Col is down to 1.5 bubs of life before casting CH if he is fighting a single blue mob. Of course, before doing this, you need to watch the target closely and balance AC, hps and how much the mob hits for so you don't CH a corpse :)<br>
<br>
2) Other spells ALWAYS memorized<br>
- Divine Aura: this gives you invulnerability for 30 seconds. Saved my life more times than I can count, it gives you enough time for the tanks to taunt the mob off you. But remember you can't cast while invulnerable, and using this to camp during a train more often than not won't work. As soon as you sit down, invulnerable or not, at least one mob will stay around you, and as soon as tha aura pops, you get hit and there goes the camp.<br>
- DD: I have reckoning now, awesome spell hits for 630. Considering I haven't held a weapon since my mid 20's, this may be the only chance I have to kill a mob that is down to a sliver after killing all my tanks.<br>
- Root: Depending on the zone you might wanna keep this friend around. It buys you some precious healing or running time.<br>
- Stun: help your friendly chanter to avoid gateing mobs or even give them enough time to mez. <br>
- Group heal: useful for raids and AE mobs. Casting time and mana cost are brutal so its usually my last resource<br>
<br>
3) Buffing<br>
I always give everyone Hero, which is a AC/hp buff combo. If I remembered to bring jasper, I will give myself Symbol of Pinzarn and then give Marzin to chanter, puller and main assist. If the other group members brought peridots, they get symbol too, but in raid situation it's rarely needed. If the wizards get chewed on (for example), it's a train, a bad aggro management or a general screw up, and symbol won't save them.<br>
A lot of people ask for extra AC buff, but the mana cost on those is NASTY. I reserve it for chanters and pullers only.<br>
<br>
4) Healing the Pull Group<br>
Ah the biggest challenge of all. Make sure you establish right away some kind of signal (hotkey preferred) with your puller so he can tell you when to heal and when NOT to heal. Sometimes they have to make the quick decision of dieing rather than training the group and you don't wanna mess that up. Keep the puller memorized until the mob is in the camp, then switch to the enchanter. That's the guy who will go down faster and the one you need to save at all costs. If a mob gets on you, dont walk away, dont cast invulnerable (unless you're REALLY dieing) and for God's sake, don't try to heal yourself. Keep healing the chanter, go down healing the chanter if it comes to that. Glue your finger to the remedy hotkey. AFTER the chanter is safe, if you're still alive, heal yourself. Cleric is a support class, keep that in mind. <br>
<br>
Those were my tips. I may think of something else later in the day :) I will write a separate thread on my other especialties: lottoes and forming groups.<br>

<br>
On a CR in a large raid when you start rezzing.  All clerics should leave their regular groups and group with Bard(s) for manasong.  If the sum of bards and clerics is 6 or less - this will be a single group - otherwise split up into two groups.<br>
<br>
This can make a BIG difference in the amount of time it takes to rez.  Excepting smallish raids (and other special circumstances) - I never quite understood the "It's Okay - I have Clarity 2" response to an invite from the bard group.  Bard Manasongs stack with everything - the 32 song even stacks with other bards. <br>
<br>
In a place like PoG for example; a quick CR means the difference between getting back in action or another wipe due to respawns...<br>
<br>
Obviously when you have clerics with "Clickers" this becomes a moot point (Heheh I hope I still get invites on raids) <p><html>

<br>
Just a few things to add....<br>
<br>
<br>
Celestial Healing.  <br>
If the fight is about to start I will usually toss this on the main tank just before he runs in.  It is enough healing to keep him near full health.  And if he does have some bad luck and get hurt bad then I will toss another heal his way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stuns<br>
Use em, Like em Love em.<br>
Depening on the raid.  If the mob is capable of gating and my mana is good then I will start tossing out some of my stuns.  This will do two things,  1) Stop the tanks from getting ablused  2) Hopefullly intterupt the casting if he is attempting to gate<br>
<br>
Atone<br>
I do not use this as much anymore, but I used to atone a mob if I over healed and the tanks could not taunt it off me.  Works great if it is on the chanter as well.  At lower levels this is a great way to kill a pet after the owner had died.<br>
<br>
Assist<br>
If the raid is low on clerics, Assist the mob.  You will then target whoever is getting thrashed on.  If Thier health is ok assist again to target the mob.  Keep repeating this and healing as needed.<br>
<br>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Invulnerability is an 18 second duration.<br>
<br>
I wonder if this wouldn't work:<br>
<br>
1) Someone /shouts "Clerics Camp"<br>
2) Divine Barrier up (or Divine Aura)<br>
3) /q<br>
<br>
Remember, if you try <i>/camp</i>, and something whacks you, you stop camping.  Bummer, I know, but that's the breaks.  I believe that <i>/quit</i> is like a "forced" camp.  After you /q, you WILL be camped after 30 seconds.  There's a couple advantages here.  <br>
<br>
1) You don't have to sit and we all know that sitting is a BAD thing.  <br>
<br>
2) If you're back a bit from the fighting before the battle starts (and if you're a cleric, being "on the wall" might not be such a bad idea), and you haven't really aggroed anything yet, then you'll be the LAST person to get aggro.<br>
<br>
3) Once you DA up, and /q, there's only a 12 second window where if you get attacked, you'll take damage.  If you're going to die anyway (by sitting and trying /camp), then /q IMHO offers you a better chance of survival.  If they ever remove /q, just turn off the PC.<br>
<br>
4) I've noticed on several occasions that people who are LD do not seem to get aggroed as much.  Maybe it's just me, and i'm wrong, but it's just an observation.<br>
<br>
I really think this would work well.  Hopefully we won't need it on the next Hate raid, but If so, I think at least one cleric should try it.<br>

I know that Monks/ SKs do this when they FD and want to clear aggro.  From my experience, I haven't seen the LD people being aggro less...  I think it is just that the other chars are drawing the aggro to them, and since the LD guy can't do anything, he's not adding any aggro.  /shrug, good to try it out.<br>
<br>
Temp and cleric company, very nice posts on how clerics heal/ responsibilities.  It is very comforting to know that you place such a high priority on healing the Enchanters.  And the buffs too.  I was wondering what &quot;Remmy Wendaar&quot; actually was, and now I know it's that quick cast heal spell.  We do go down quick, and it sounds like the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
As a side of humor to this, I had an interesting (Level 60) cleric last week in Seb.  His strategy was to hit me with a Cel heal when I had multiple (sometimes 3 Krups) beating on me.  I am sure he was hitting me with some other heal along the way (too busy mezzing and stunning the mobs to notice each movement of my hp bar), but it seemed to do a nice job.  Each time I nearly died and I wansn't too comfortable with him hitting me with Cel Heal, but ended up living every time.  (He was level 60, so I wasn't too concerned with the rez.)  I don't know if this was some new strategy he was trying out on me, but it did seem to work well.  Maybe he was Cel Heal   Remmy, and figuring that if I got the mobs mezzed quickly I had Cel heal to top my life off and I was getting pounded he had the Remmy to bump me up.  I don't know if this is something more standard to do on chars with low hps (ie Chanters) or if this is done on tanks, but I thought I would mention it.  At least you can mess with your Enchanter some, just be sure to not let 'em die.  They do that enough already.<br>

I don't know yet, as I'll get DA at 55, but my understanding is that DA has a massive anti-taunt factor.<br>
Therefore, DA followed by /q has a pretty good chance of saving the cleric/paladin's life.<br>

There are lots of other tricks for using it for pulling and tanking, but that's outside the cleric's responsibilities :) <p><center><img src="http://home.us.net/~silviu/gifs/Sig54.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/unuclus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuclus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/5/01 12:19:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cleric Responsibilities</span><hr size=1> I do basically the same as Temp except I put the same priority on bards as I do chanters. If there is one of each in the group then chanter first and then bard. When the chanter goes down then I switch to the bard. Which ever one is in the group that is the one I make a hot target key for, if both are in group then a hot key for each. If either one goes down then so will the group. I will die first if at all possible before I will let either one of them.<br>
<br>
I use heroic bond which is a group ac/hp buff not only as a buff but also as group heal. Faster and less mana then a group heal spell. Oh, I use Celestial Elixir instead of Celestial Healing. It seems to be faster and can heal up to 1500 hps. It also has cure disease with it.<br>

* browsing the old web pages while bored at work*<br>
<br>
We experimented with the DB/DA  + /q  thingie a tew times.<br>
here's what we learned:<br>
<br>
You DB....seems to drop agro....<br>
you /q<br>
DB is a "flashing spell" for 18secs.  but when you /q  it "seemed" to become more like a bard song and faded after 3 secs of becoming LD.<br>
<br>
We tried this several ways hehe.  First, i just ran into a KOS area where i was KOS and my "watchers" weren't   =P<br>
<br>
Since i was the only one agro, this worked well to see the length of safety.   As soon as i db'd, i waited 3 secs, then /q'd.<br>
my watchers /logged the event =P<br>
After 3 secs from seeing "LD" on my head, they were smacking me down for the next 12 or so seconds before i was squished. =(<br>
<br>
This "might" save you in a group circumstance, where as when you DB-lose agro- then /q  become vulnerable again, BUT there are still a few remainding tanks left to taunt/die for you then i suppose you MIGHT have a chance of getting out alive.  but i don't count on it, we threw this out as a possible tactic.  <br>
<br>
Try it yourselves, this is just what i noticed =P  Then again, i'm only 53, so agro is a bit higher to start with on these mobs then if you are higher level 55+ maybe?<br>
