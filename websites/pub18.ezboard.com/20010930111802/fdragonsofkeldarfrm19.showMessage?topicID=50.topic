Me and the wife did it rodeo style last night,&quot; one friend confided to another. <br>
&quot;Rodeo style? How do you do it rodeo style?&quot; he asked. <br>
&quot;You start out doing it doggy style, then you slap her ass and tell her that she doesn't @#%$ nearly as good as her sister. Then you<br>
try to stay on for as long as you can.&quot; <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
A father and son went hunting together for the first time. The father said, &quot;Stay here and be very QUIET. I’ll be across the<br>
field.&quot; A few minutes later, the father heard a blood curdling scream and ran back to his son. <br>
&quot;What’s wrong?&quot; the father asked. &quot;I told you to be quiet.&quot; <br>
The son answered, &quot;Look, I was quiet when the snake slithered across my feet. I was quiet when the bear breathed down my<br>
neck. But when the two chipmunks crawled up my pant legs and said, ‘Should we eat them here or take them with us?’ I guess<br>
I just panicked....&quot;<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
On the farm lived a chicken and a horse, both of whom loved to play together. One day, the two were playing when the horse<br>
fell into a bog and began to sink. Scared for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help! <br>
Off the chicken ran, back to the farm. Arriving at the farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no avail, for he had<br>
gone to town with the only tractor. Running around, the chicken spied the farmer’s new Z-3 series BMW. Finding the keys<br>
inside, the chicken sped off with a length of rope, hoping he still had time to save his friend’s life. <br>
Back at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to see the chicken arrive in the shiny BMW, and he managed to get a hold<br>
of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him. After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer’s car, the chicken then<br>
drove slowly forward and, with the aid of the powerful car, rescued the horse! <br>
Happy and proud, the chicken drove the BMW back to the farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned.<br>
The friendship between the two animals was cemented: best buddies, best pals. <br>
A few weeks later, the chicken fell into a mud pit, and soon, he too, began to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life!<br>
The horse thought a moment, walked over, and straddled the large puddle. <br>
Looking underneath, he told the chicken to grab his “thing” and he would then lift him out of the pit. The chicken got a good<br>
grip, and the horse pulled him up and out, saving his life. <br>
The moral of the story? <br>
When you’re hung like a horse, you don’t need a BMW to pick up chicks. <br>

10 Reasons why Starwars is better than StarTrek.<br>
<br>
1. In the Star Wars Universe weapons are rarely, if ever, set on &quot;stun&quot;.<br>
2. The Enterprise needs a huge engine room with an anti-matter unit and a crew of 20 just to go into warp ---the Millennium Falcon does the same thing with R2-D2 and a Wookie.<br>
3. After resisting the Imperial torture droid and Darth Vader, Princess Leia still looked fresh and desirable --- after pithy Cardassian starvation torture, Picard looked like hell.<br>
4. One word: Lightsabers.<br>
5. Darth Vader could choke the entire Borg empire with one glance.<br>
6. The Death Star doesn't care if a world is class &quot;M&quot; or not.<br>
7. Luke Skywalker is not obsessed with sleeping with every alien he encounters.<br>
8. Jabba the Hutt would eat Harry Mudd for trying to cut in on his action.<br>
9. The Federation would have to attempt to liberate any ship named &quot;Slave I&quot;.<br>
10. Picard pilots the Enterprise through asteroid belts at one-quarter impulse power --- Han Solo floors it.<br>

==============================================Things Movies Teach Us<br>
1. At least one of a pair of identical twins is born evil.<br>
2. Should you decide to defuse a bomb, don't worry which wire to cut. You will always choose the right 1.<br>
3. Most laptop computers are powerful enough to override the communications system of any invading<br>
alien society, and run an applications system that everyone is very familiar with.<br>
4. It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involving martial arts - your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one, by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessors.<br>
5. When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in your bedroom will still be clearly visible, just<br>
lightly bluish.<br>
6. Radiation causes interesting mutations--not to your future children, but to you - right then and there - or, over a period of time until you finally go crazy and kill people.<br>
7. Honest and hard-working policemen are traditionally gunned down three days before their retirement.<br>
8. Rather than wasting bullets, megalomaniacs prefer to kill their arch-enemies using complicated machinery involving fuses, pulley systems, deadly gasses, lasers, and man-eating sharks, all of which will allow their captives at least 20 minutes to escape.<br>
9. It's easy to land a plane providing there is someone in the control tower to talk you down.<br>
10. Once applied, makeup never rubs off - even while scuba diving or after fighting alien monsters. But only<br>
if you are beautiful. If you are overweight, your mascara will run and your lipstick will smear.<br>

Things NOT to say to police.<br>
1. I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer. (OK in Texas)<br>
2. Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.<br>
3. Aren't you the guy from the Village People?<br>
4. Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me. Good job!<br>
5. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a police officer.<br>
6. You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?<br>
7. I pay your salary!<br>
8. Gee, Officer! That's terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning, too!<br>
9. Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.<br>
10. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other cars around. That's how far ahead of me they are.<br>

The Woman Assassin<br>
The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks,<br>
interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists; two men and a<br>
woman.<br>
For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door<br>
and handed him a gun.<br>
&quot;We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the<br>
circumstances. Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair.<br>
Kill her!&quot;<br>
The man said, &quot;You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.&quot;<br>
The agent said, &quot;Then you're not the right man for this job.&quot;<br>
The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went<br>
into the room. All was quiet for about five minutes. Then the man came out<br>
with tears in his eyes.&quot;I tried, but I can't kill my wife.&quot;<br>
The agent said, &quot;You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.&quot;<br>
Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions to<br>
kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room.<br>
Shots were heard, one shot after another. The the agents heard screaming,<br>
crashing, and banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The<br>
door opened slowly and there stood the woman.<br>
She wiped the sweat from her brow, and said, &quot;This gun is loaded with<br>
blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.&quot;<br>
<br>
thats what I got, some more if anyone wants to hear em shrug..not everyone will find them funny, but what ever.<br>

DEAD FROG TEST: (A true Story)<br>
A kindergarten teacher had a pupil tell her he had found a frog on the way to school. She inquired as to whether it was alive or dead. &quot;Dead,&quot; she was informed.&quot;How do you know?&quot; she asked. &quot;Because I pissed in his ear,&quot; said the child innocently. &quot;You did WHAT?&quot; squealed the teacher in surprise. &quot;You know,&quot; explained the boy, &quot;I leaned over and went 'Pssst' and he didn't move.&quot;<br>

HIGH TECH MILKING MACHINE<br>
<br>
Lewis's cousin, the farmer, ordered a high-tech<br>
milking machine. Since the equipment arrived when his wife was out of town, he decided to test it on himself first. So, he inserted his penis into the equipment, turned the switch on and everything else was automatic. Soon, he realized that the equipment provided him with as much pleasure as his wife did. When the fun was over, though, he quickly realized that he couldn't remove the instrument from his penis. He read the manual but didn't find any useful information. He tried every button on the instrument, but still without success. Finally, the farmer decided to call the supplier's Customer Service Hot Line. &quot;Hello, I just bought a milking machine from your company. It works fantastic, but how do I remove it from the cow's udder?&quot; &quot;Don't worry,&quot; replied the customer service rep, &quot;The machine will release automatically once it's collected two gallons.&quot; <br>
==================================================<br>
The boss of a big company needed to call one of<br>
his employees about an urgent problem with one<br>
of the main computers. He dialed the employees<br>
home phone number and was greeted with a child's<br>
whispered on the first ring, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
<br>
Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having<br>
to talk to a youngster the boss asked, &quot;Is your<br>
Daddy home?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;, whispered the small voice.<br>
May I talk with him?&quot; the man asked. To the<br>
surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered,<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked,<br>
&quot;Is your Mommy there?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; came the answer.<br>
&quot;May I talk with her?&quot; Again the small voice<br>
whispered &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
Knowing that it was not likely that a young<br>
child would be left home alone, the boss decided<br>
he would just leave a message with the person<br>
who should be there watching over the child.<br>
&quot;Is there any one there besides you?&quot; the boss<br>
asked the child. &quot;Yes&quot;, whispered the child,<br>
&quot;A policeman.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wondering what a cop would be doing at his<br>
employee's home, the boss asked, &quot;May I speak<br>
with the policeman?&quot;. &quot;No, he's busy.&quot;,<br>
whispered the child. &quot;Busy doing what?&quot;, asked<br>
the boss. &quot;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the<br>
Fireman.&quot;, came the whispered answer.<br>
<br>
Growing concerned and even worried as he heard<br>
what sounded like a helicopter through the ear<br>
piece on the phone the boss asked, &quot;What is<br>
that noise?&quot;. &quot;A hello-copper.&quot;, answered the<br>
whispering voice. &quot;What is going on there?&quot;,<br>
asked the boss, now alarmed. In an awed<br>
whispering voice the child answered, &quot;The<br>
search team just landed the hello-copper!&quot;<br>
<br>
Alarmed, concerned and more than just a little<br>
frustrated the boss asked, &quot;Why are they there?&quot;<br>
<br>
Still whispering, the young voice replied along<br>
with a muffled giggle, &quot;They're looking for me!&quot; <br>
