<br>
OK, here's the skinny on the &quot;New&quot; hate. There are roamers that path up the wall between zone in and SWC. Hate breaks need to be treated almost like fear breaks now. You need to get a cleric and a body puller to SWC at all costs and they need to camp out until they get the ok from the spotter. The creatures that roam the wall are Lichs, Rats and Ghasts, with the occassional Cleric wandering up there. Rats and Ghasts see regular invis but not IVU. Liches, I'm not too sure about, but they do see regular invis. Clerics do not see invis, but IVU will not work. Also, now that you can only go halfway up the wall, you come dangerously close to the walls of 2 houses on the way to SWC, which can and will aggro the stuff inside. The SWC clerc spawn has been replaced by a trap that spawns 3 &quot;Very tiny Imp's&quot;. They have next to no HP, but will break your invis and aggro the house right there.<br>
here is my suggested method of breaking into Hate:<br>
<br>
Have as many groups zone up at once as possible and once they are zoned in, start towards SWC. All should be regular invis'd, SOW'd and buffed. Clerics should be Runed as well and have both Divine Aura and Divine Barrier up and ready to use. The goal here is to get as many clerics to SWC as possible. If you get aggro'd, your job is to stand and tank as long as humanly possible to give the clerics time to get to SWC and camp. Clerics, do not stop running unless you get aggro'd and then call out that you are aggro'd. Once the mob is taunted off you, get moving. If you see someone engaging a mob and you can either help tank it or stun/mez it, do so. You will probably die, but we will res you back in. If you successfully make it to SWC, CAMP!! Log on an alt and wait. Whatever you do, do not go above halfway on the wall, as you will be multiply HT'd and will aggro the second floor and possibly kill the whole raid. Once the SWC is clear, one cleric will log in and res one cleric and one chanter/Bard in. Then the first cleric should camp and log back onto his alt until he gets the all clear. The ressed cleric will now be in charge of ressing folks and getting prepared for the raid. In case of an aggro after he begins ressing, the cleric will attempt to camp. Everyone should do thier damndest to buy the cleric time. If the cleric makes it out, then he will log back in when safe and start over. If the cleric does not make it out, then the first cleric will log on and we begin again. lather, rinse, repeat until the whole raid is in and we are ready to rock.<br>
<br>
POST BREAK:<br>
<br>
Once we are all ressed in and ready to go, EVERYONE, should be sitting on the lower half of the wall. And I do mean SITTING, not bouncing around, etc... We all move to the floor after buffing and begin the pulls. If at any time you get Grav Fluxxed by a lich, you WILL camp. You hit the 2nd floor and are now aggro to them and will kill us all if you do not camp. If you have a bard in your group, then the whole group will camp, as the bard will pass aggro along. In the event of a train/overpull, you stand and fight to the death to buy the clerics time to get out. Once the clerics are out, you can attempt to camp. If this happens, we are back to step one of the break in, one cleric comes in and resses a cleric and a mana vault and we start again.<br>
<br>
These are just my opinions and suggestions on how to break the new hate and should not be taken as law, but they have worked well for me so far. please comment/suggest as you see fit.<br>

The problem we had was lack of wizards to port multiple groups at the same time. I will also add that any raid leaders doing Hate from now on should collect the twink names of the participants to make communication easy when the mains are logged off. <br>
Also, SWC is bugged to hell. A few times I (or my group) had to log because of aggro from above even without a grav flux. In one occasion I was on the ground, away from the house, checking a mob's corpse and got smashed by one of Innoruuk's spammers. I backed off, the mob was no where to be seen, so I camped. <br>
Some other issues we had - people still don't get the concept of fighting OFF the wall. Amazing because a lot of those people are not new to Hate and the wall has always been a problem. *shrug*<br>
Also people who enjoy red letters (shout) should either lead a raid or pull <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
And last of my whinings... I was group leader, main healer of the pull group AND lotto officer. It is absolutely impossible for me to keep up with drops unless people /tell me what is in the corpses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lesson for the future - please help the lotto officer by telling him what is in the corpse, stats (if applicable) and what classes/races can use it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My request last night for people to leave the shout channel clear for the raid leaders and the pullers was met with some sarcasm which I don't consider appropriate.<br>
<br>
I monitor the shout channel constantly and carefully; that allows me to know what the raid leaders are asking for, what the target is and if there is a target switch. If anyone feels like announcing their assists (of questionable value to the raid, IMO), please use /say or /gsay, but not /shout.  I don't think it's too much to ask and there is no reason for anyone to take the request personally.<br>
