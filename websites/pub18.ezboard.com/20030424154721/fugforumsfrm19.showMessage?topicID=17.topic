<br>
Hello all. I've written this guide to explain how a Naggy raid is done. This is my observations on both good &amp; bad raids. <br>
For many players, dragon hunts are their first foray into large scale raids and if you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot of what is going on, and what you need to do. Most of all, be patient. Pulling off a large raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short of certain classes. An average raid usually takes around 3-4 hours, I have seen them take only 2½ hours but also I have seen them take 6 hours. Once again I will iterate on certain classes being short.<br>
<br>
Requirements<br>
You need to be between levels 44 and 52, clerics can go as low as 39 but I would strongly suggest against it seeing that all dragons have the ability to imbue dragon fear and most likely your level 39 cleric would be running away from the beginning and that group would be wiped.<br>
<br>
You should try to get a good fire resistance and magic resistance. The fire resistance for Nagafen’s AOE breath weapon and the magic resistance for the fear.<br>
<br>
Be ready to pay every once in a while. In open raids it can cost the raid leader up to 400pp to get everyone buffed up and good to go. So please be prepared that sometimes there is a raid fee with any open raid of up to 2 peridots or 20pp.<br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
Nagafen resides in Nagafen's Lair (aka Sol B) in Lavastorm you can find the entrance at 1000 by 500. <br>
1. Closest Druid portal: Lavastorm Mountains<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: Nektulos Forest<br>
3. POK bookstand: Nektulos Forest<br>
Please meet at the Lavastorm druid rings to assemble the groups, then fight your way to the king room and there you will do a buff circle or buff phase.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
1. Nagafen is a level 55 Dragon Warrior.<br>
2. Naggy's most deadly weapon is his AE fire breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; Be willing to sacrifice your ac if you must.<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, go to the bazaar and buy some.<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Solusek have high fire resist - including Nag, use cold based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on a dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HIS MELEE RANGE. (This is vital I have watched raids get wiped because casters did not know this and could not get there spells to stick)<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Lavastorm or Solusek, report in to the raid leader or a raid group leader.<br>
2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous and roleplay when you show up and put LFG on<br>
4. There will be a raid channel set up for communication, please check with a raid group leader to get the channel. And if you need help to set it up please don’t feel afraid to ask.<br>
If you are a raid group leader ask the raid leader what the channel is for the group leaders and raid leader.<br>
5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers). This is what takes most of the time. Killing naggy is a 10 min process at that.<br>
<br>
Note: if you don’t want a wipe please be ready to wait for a few hours while groups get set up. If you don’t have a proper amount of certain classes it takes awhile to acquire them, so if the raid is missing classes please help look for them. This is Important.<br>
If you are not a raid Leader or Raid group leader do not issue instructions all you do is screw things up. If you do want to try to take control be ready to be booted from the raid, THIS IS NOT TOLERATED and I have seen raids take an extra hour just because of people thinking they can do better. And even if you can you are still not the raid leader so be quite.<br>
<br>
Class Specific information<br>
This is for every class just to help them get ready for what will be coming.<br>
This is in sequence of the main assist shouting the attack command.<br>
<br>
Warrior, Monk, Ranger, Rouge, Beastlord: Run forward and attack, and nuke if you have the ability. Use disciplines at that time such as fearless or any other of your choice, Do not run back for heals because you can off set the dragon if the agro gets to you. Stand fight and Die if you must. It is ok most likely a 96% res will be there of needed. IF you don’t know your disciplines please use this link.<br>
eq.crgaming.com/disciplin...ss=Warrior<br>
<br>
Paladin: If you have never chain cast you will now as a paladin you are one of the best agro holders this game has to offer. You will load up Cease, desist, and stun prior to the fight and once you get in you will cast these three spells none stop. I mean non stop once again if you die you will be resed most likely for 96%. This will stop the dragon from casting any spells and it will give you all the agro. You will not load up any other stun spells such as force because they are mana heavy and you need your mana for the 50 spells you are going to cast through out the fight. Also if you have your new healing spell Ethereal Cleansing you can cast this on the main tank before he goes into battle. Use your disciplines eq.crgaming.com/disciplin...ss=Paladin <br>
<br>
Shadowknight: Debuff while you are attacking lower its AC and attack and steal its HP.s <br>
Also you have harm touch when you get down to 20% health use it don’t waste it or when Naggy gets down to 20% health that is the time to use it also. Do not feign death at anytime you will still die from his AOE breath weapon, stand strong and fight. Use your Disciplines: eq.crgaming.com/disciplin...adowknight<br>
<br>
Bard: You will be twisting songs and staying back as far as you can from your group, so they are still getting your song benefits. You will be twisting mainly resistant songs for your group. The second twist you should focus on is debuffing the dragon and then after that it is up to you. Again use your disciplines eq.crgaming.com/disciplin...Class=Bard<br>
<br>
NOTE ALL CASTERS: The first spell you should cast is a dispel magic type spell. Run into his melee range and cast, only 6 need to caste dispel to strip all buffs. The Main target is to debuff the mob.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: After the cancel magic the first spell you should cast is Tashania. After this you weaken. When you get weaken off if you have not seen a slow should you can start trying to slow as well. After that you can incapacitate. If these three spells get off the mob will be dead. After that feel free to Dot him to lower his buffs even more. Have a pet out and shrunk.<br>
<br>
Shaman: After the cancel magic the first spell you should cast is Malosi. This is one of the most important spell you can get off. Right after that you can slow, incapacitate then back up and assist naggy and heal the player who is targeted. Have a pet out and shrunk.<br>
<br>
Cleric: Your main job is keeping the party alive. Before the main tank goes in you cast Celestial Healing on him. This stacked with the paladins heal of 400hp in 24 seconds means the main tank will heal 1148hp in 24 seconds which will allow them to get good agro. In this the main tank will have two clerics targeting him and after the first one heals him the second one will heal him and they will trade it off every heal to minimize the agro. All other clerics will have a hot key to target the Main tank and can take a cleric position if one goes down. But will be keeping there group alive throughout battle. You heal any of your players when they get to 50% life naggy will not live long enough for you to run out of mana. Remember you must be close enough to see your members hp going down.<br>
<br>
Druid: You are a healer to help with the groups. But when able you can run in and cast your Dot AC debuff spell and you can also try to do direct damage or dot damage where applicable, remember Naggy is very fire resistant use cold or your ice spell.<br>
<br>
Magician: The First spell you will cast is cancel magic and then Malosi until it is shouted that it has stuck. Have a pet out and shrunk and fully buffed just with your spells. Remember the main goal is to debuff the mob. After that wait till 50% Health and start nuking the hell out of him. Remember you need to be in melee range so if you are getting close to dieing run out and get healed.<br>
<br>
Necromancer: Cancel magic, then debuff the steal hp and mana and get your pet in there and shrunk. <br>
<br>
Wizard: First thing you will do is cancle magic then if you can debuff do so. At 50% health you will chain Ice Comet and Force Strike till the mob or you are dead. Do not stop once. Remember you have to be in melee range for this to take effect.<br>
<br>
Buffing<br>
Once group are made you will work your way to the fire giant king room where buffing will begin. Each raid group leader will stand in a certain place and his party will stay with him. After this the buffing group will goto each group and start buffing. It is much easier for 6 to buff then 35 to come get buffed less confusion. Listen to your group leader and everything will go fine. Depending on the buffing phase you might have to log off and log on another character and join a chat room till all the buffing is done the raid leader will say if it is nessesary. Also with mass group buffing everyone will gather around the person MGB and after buff you will go back to where you group spot is.<br>
<br>
IT BEGINS<br>
<br>
OK buffing and groups are done next is naggy. The MainAssist (MA) will get CH (cleric) and EC (paladin) and charge in and start hacking on the dragon. Everyone counts to 7 then runs in and begins his job. Main assist ahould be a paladin casting cease, desist, stun, cease, desist, stun and not slowing down. I CANNOT STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS.<br>
<br>
Things to remember: In Naggy’s room you must run over a bridge of lava to get to his main chamber, keep naggy in the middle of the chamber. IF he gets close to the walls get on the other side of him and push him the other way. Keep the sucker away from the lave, Naggy heals very fast in the lave and if he gets there he will likely wipe the raid.<br>
<br>
NAGGY’S Down LOOT<br>
LOOT RULES<br>
1. Depending on the raid, loot rules can differ widely. Be sure to check before joining the raid. Some items may be claimed by the raid leader or hosting guild.<br>
2. Typically, each class eligible for an item is assigned a number and a random is performed to award the item. If eligible, raid leaders and group leaders should state which numbers they have prior to the roll. <br>
<br>
When naggy drops everyone back away from the dragon and no one tries to loot. If you loot the dragon you can and will be caught. Please note Sony’s GM admins have the power to log on your character take the stolen goods away and give it back to the raid leader. DON’T NINJA LOOT. Thank fully we have POP which made raiding much safer and now only one person can loot. When the loot is collected the no drops will be rolled for first and then the other loot after. The raid leader will loot all Loot that he can that is tradable and things will be randomed out after that. NOTE: only about 5 out of the 35 or 40 people will be getting loot so be quite we don’t want the loot to take as long as the grouping did. Sit there and read what the raid leader is saying. A lot of loot will be seeded first. <br>
Example of Seeding: BOB sets the seed /random 5000 ….. it comes up as 2342. <br>
So bob gets everyone to roll out of 2342. That is seeding that way no one can hack the rolls. <br>
<br>
Also only roll once, every raid leader has the right of ownership to say who gets to roll and who does not. I have seen raid leader give items to someone else because the person who won on his first roll rolled again because he was trying to cheet. BE honest.<br>
<br>
PS: Please comment on this and add anything i have missed i will add it in. Thanks all<br>

<br>
There are two options for resists with Naggy:<br>
Guardian Rhythms + Elemental Rhythms will give about 110 MR, 55 FR, depending on level and drum used.  You can heal AoE breath damage, but if you're feared, then everyone's songs will drop until you get back in action.  Sometimes resisting fear is most important.<br>
<br>
If everyone already has decent MR, the other option is:<br>
Amplification + Psalm of Cooling + Guardian Rhythms (remember, Guardian Rhythms stacks with pretty much every other resist song we have)<br>
This gives about 100 FR and 55 MR.  Kiss that AoE breath good bye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But remember, this mix is useless if you're constantly running away from Naggie because of fear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=17.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub18.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ugforumsfrm1">General Info<option value="ugforumsfrm29">Guild Applications<option value="ugforumsfrm2">Raids<option value="ugforumsfrm28">Help!<option value="ugforumsfrm19">Public Info<option value="ugforumsfrm25">Members Only<option value="ugforumsfrm22">Guild Bank<option value="ugforumsfrm23">Proposed Rules Changes<option value="ugforumsfrm26">Old Threads<option value="ugforumsfrm32">Vote Here<option value="ugforumsfrm21">Items For Sale<option value="ugforumsfrm18">Officers<option value="ugforumsfrm27">Old Officer Threads<option value="ugforumsfrm33">Officer Voting<option value="ugforumsfrm4">Bard<option value="ugforumsfrm20">Beastlord<option value="ugforumsfrm5">Cleric<option value="ugforumsfrm6">Druid<option value="ugforumsfrm7">Enchanter<option value="ugforumsfrm8">Magician<option value="ugforumsfrm9">Monk<option value="ugforumsfrm10">Necromancer<option value="ugforumsfrm11">Paladin<option value="ugforumsfrm12">Ranger<option value="ugforumsfrm13">Rogue<option value="ugforumsfrm14">Shadow Knight<option value="ugforumsfrm17">Wizard<option value="ugforumsfrm15">Shaman<option value="ugforumsfrm16">Warrior<option value="ugforumsfrm36">Humor?<option value="ugforumsfrm37">Photo Gallery<option value="ugforumsfrm38">Miscellaneous</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/bugforums>ugforums</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/fugforumsfrm19>Public Info</a><font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.238<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
