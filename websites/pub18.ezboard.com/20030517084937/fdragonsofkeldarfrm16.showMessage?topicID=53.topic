This post will get continuously updated as we find more issues.<br>
<br>
1) Assisting, honestly we do a pretty good job at this, which is good, as its the single biggest killer of raids when done improperly.  Make sure you have hotkeys for both main and secondary assists.  Make sure you hit them multiple times as sometimes targets are swiched, and sometimes assist dosnt work properly.<br>
2) Targetting, for the main assist (or secondary) this is a real skill to have, and have perfected.  I honestly only know of 3 or 4 ppl who raid with us regularly who I trust in this role, and often find I need to do it myself.  ALWAYS shout your target, make it part of your hotkey, and always use the hotkey, never use auto attack.  Asses the risks and target the mobs quickly in the proper order, usually each zone, or enchanter will have a particular oder they want things done in.  Communicate, and constantly re-evaluate.  If you have to swich targets, shout the new target multiple times, shout SWITCHING.  Dont go out to meet the puller, unless he has asked you to tag off of him.<br>
3) SURROUND the mob, this is one we seriously fail at consistantly, I see mobs being pushed up the wall in hate, off cliffs in the Hole and Chardok.  Into walls causing gating bugs, SURROUND THE DAMN mob.  Dont push it around, if you see it being pushed in a unfavorable direction, get behind it, and push the other way.  In some (few) cases a mob must be pushed to disrupt casting (unstunnable), only in these cases will tanks all be on the same side of the mob.<br>
SURROUND THE MOB.  DONT PUSH IT AROUND, keep it in one place.  This is the single biggest problem I see on XA and DoK raids.<br>
4) Watch aggro range, on big game mobs (hard hitters like 300-400+) one Warrior will usually hold aggro, allow him a fe moments to solo it.  When he calls charge, everyone rush in, and fight at extreme range, that is as FAR AWAY from the mob as you can, while still able to hit it.  The main Warrior will stay as close as possible, and therby maintain aggro, as the mob usually attacks the CLOSEST tank to it.  This will become more and more important as time passes, and we hit bigger things.<br>
5) Never attack a mezzed mob untill the Main assist has shouted the target.  This gives them plenty of time to taunt it and draw aggro of the poor frail enchanter.  When Im main assist, I usually hit the mob with a debuff or two (Siphon Strength, Shadow Vortex, Shroud of Pain) a couple of Taunts and maybe a DOT (Boil Blood, Heart Flutter) if I know for sure I wont have to swich targets.  This all will develop a healthy aggro, and pretty much guarantee that the mob will only hit me once mez is broken.<br>
<br>
Thats all I can come up with ATM, more will follow, feel free to comment. <p><html>

Verant said they were going to fix that bug where aggro is 5x normal when sitting, but they never did.  So, when casting some high taunt spell on the mob, don't sit down immediately.  Some classes cannot sit down at all during a fight, such as clerics and enchanters and sometimes shamans.<br>
<br>
Also, hybrid classes should wait or completely avoid casting spells while in melee on big mobs.  This may include HT.  From what I have seen the biggest problem on the large mobs is people taking aggro (either from being too close or casting) when they aren't supposed to and dying fast.  We don't have a 60 tank, so don't fight like we do =P.  It's hard enough as it is to have tanks keep aggro, as we have no spells or discs or abilities to do so.<br>
<br>
Casters seem to cast too early in itself, and anyway most big mobs just have too high MR for most things.<br>
<br>
This guild is great with smaller mobs, except for surrounding them and getting on one mob in a crowded area with mezzed mobs and multiple mobs of the same name.  I think the hole may be a good practice raid area for all as it is not quite as hard as some other zones, doesn't require a great deal of people, and the mobs still have the big zone reactions (easy aggro, gate, etc.)<br>
<br>
To be honest, this guild would do great in PoG if we had enough going.  Lots of mobs to be pushed and nice drops etc. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

I can usually manage my aggro effectivly, and the only times I have over aggroed a mob, is when I want to pull it off someone FAST (chanter or cleric).  But even when I do, im nearly as effective a tank as a Warrior (disciplines aside), and wont 'drop like a fly'.  The main thing to be aware of is time between casts, and extreme mele range.  If I keep an eye on these I usually dont have a problem. <p><html>

I have had very little experience in pulling and would really like to learn more and hone my skill at this.  Maybe sometime we can go to a place where I can get some pulling exp, I would greatly appreciate it.<br>
Any Ideas ???<br>
My main concern is which mobs are first on the list, but  from what I know I guess that would be studding the mobs we are going after.<br>

<br>
Most bard songs don't aggro too much initially (although it can add up over a long battle) and buffs aggro mobs as well (hence a mob with a large aggro range and slow pulled usually immediately attack the bard singing mana in a single group pull setting) so I don't worry about when I start my songs - only on rare occaision holding that off.<br>
<br>
The Surround thing is critical.  My gut tells me our failure to do that properly is what caused the failure last Saturday... <p><html>

I know it sounds screwy, but Enchanters can stay FM by draining the mana from the casting mobs and refilling their own mana.<br>
<br>
A lot of this comes with experience too.  Knowing which mobs are very MR (like Spite golems in Hate, or the level 53 Golems in The Hole) and getting them first, knowing that Giants can't be mezed too.  Much of this experience, sadly, comes from dying, hehe.<br>
<br>
Don't underestimate the power of "root parking."  I like to think of Rangers as an extremely versatile and resourcefull class.  We depend highly on the spells that we have and tend to use them very carefully in setting up pulls.  Harmony is one of the most powerful spells in the game for outdoor zones, and for indoor zones, rooting a mob when it's next to another mob brings the other mob leaving the mob you rooted standing there waiting so that your enchanter gets more time to mez them.  Also, snare can accomplish the same thing in a multi-pull allowing you to "stagger" the incoming mobs to make your Enchanter's life easier (and allow you to take less damage).  The other night in Karnor's I had a four mob pull.  I started by snaring a mob, so three other mobs came.  I backed up a bit (it was a long pull) and snared another one of them.  That left two others.  I backed up again, took a few hits and snared the third one.  I proceeded back to my group letting them know that three more mobs were coming after the one we were killing.  Sure enough, slowly but surely, three more mobs came meandering in at staggerred intervals.  By the time the last mob got there, we were pretty much done with the first one and we simply switched to him when he showed up.<br>
<br>
It's tough for Warriors to pull, unless the pulling situation is a mob like a dragon.  They just lack the necessary mob avoidance tactics needed to avoid aggroing other mobs unnecessarily.  There are potions that can fix some of these problems, but in the end, it could be quite costly.  An example of potions is the IVU potion.  Again, using an example from the other night.  There was a named mob I wanted to pull, but there was a skel in the way.  I didn't mind getting the skel as an "add," but if I aggroed him first, i'd never get to the named mob I wanted.  I popped out my 10-shot IVU potion and invised up, ran right past the skeleton, and found the Skeleton Warlord that I was after.  I walked right up to him and whacked him once really good, and ran back to my group.  When I got to the skeleton that I had run past before, I snared him which left him far behind by the time I got back to my group with the Skeleton Warlord that I was really after.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not trying to tout my abilities here, only to offer examples of tricks that Rangers use when setting up pulls.  I always keep IVU potions on me, and always have a Gate potion too for that situation when I'm in a place where no teleport out is available.  It really comes down to <b>RESOURCEFULNESS</b>.  Being able to get yourself into and out of certain situations.  Take Siren's Grotto as an example.  I now know how to run from WW to CS, and from CS to WW (the more dangerous of the two).  Both require Invisibility, and the trip from CS to WW requires SoW.  It took me a long time to get up enough courage to make the run from CS to WW, but finally I did it, and I did it THREE times just to make sure my success was not a fluke.  In fact, I nearly died once, and it helped me discover ways to avoid aggroing some of the see invis mobs near the CS zone (in the water).  Dying stinks, don't get me wrong, but many times, we learn more by failing then succeeding.<br>

<br>
<b>Always Carry Resist Gear</b><br>
<br><br>
I have three full sets of resist gear that I carry with me at ALL times.  Any of these suits can get my MR, CR, or FR above 100 as a base.  It isn't easy, I know, and my inventory is quite often completely full.  Some of the gear is pricey (plat diamond rings for example).  Some is not pricey (Bloodstained Mantle, Dwarven Ringmail Tunic).  Lest you think that AC is most important in huge fights, go ask Nillis how well his nearly 1100AC stacked up against Ixiblat Far.  Even with 2700+ hps and 1100AC, he went down before he could even LoH... TWICE!  Can you say quad attacks of 450 per attack (that's 1800 hps per round)?  I am a "strictly AC" person.  All of my regular gear is for AC.  Self buffed, I'm at around 925 AC.  But, when i'm in "epic" situations against mobs that hit for 300+ per attack, I will equip my resist gear over AC gear (if the mob is a caster).<br>
<br>
Now, if you can boost your resists AND maintain AC, then you're set.  Otherwise, I consider it a tank responsibility to come prepared.  If that means you keep stuff in the bank and get it before a raid, that's your choice.  I just find always carrying it with me is just easier.<br>

And I do notice a problem on raids where I don't know everyone where the hybrids end up aggroing.  It is usually a better idea to have a druid snare as they aren't building aggro by fighting the mob.<br>

<br>
The biggest task for a tank is to have his resists high while keeping his AC high.<br>
At level 53 I have a constant 975 AC, and it only goes down to 963 with Cold resist gear.  When at 975 AC, I remain at 99 MR at all times...but I need some FR gear.<br>
FR is at a constant 55 at the moment. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

I wait til its about 1/4 way dead and snare it this comes from getting pounded intot the floor a million times and also from the old days when Pets would always root and break your snare <p><html>

  Snare + Fixation of Ro + Ro's Fiery Sundering (they stack) + a fire based dot + Magic based dot = nervoud dr00d / dead dr00d.<br>

   Immolate lowers FR too.<br>

<br>
<br>
5) Never attack a mezzed mob untill the Main assist has shouted the target.  This gives them plenty of time to taunt it and draw aggro of the poor frail enchanter.  When Im main assist, I usually hit the mob with a debuff or two (Siphon Strength, Shadow Vortex, Shroud of Pain) a couple of Taunts and maybe a DOT (Boil Blood, Heart Flutter) if I know for sure I wont have to swich targets.  This all will develop a healthy aggro, and pretty much guarantee that the mob will only hit me once mez is broken.<br>

ALWAYS snare a mezed mob.  It way reduces the chance that a mezed mob will attack the enchanter.<br>
<br>
Second, Eese, please, you MUST have resist gear.  I don't care HOW poor you are, there are things that cost next to nothing to attain and I'll even donate some things that can be jeweled with gold.  Gold Cat's eye agates make great MR pieces.<br>
<br>
Mel, I'll try to get you my list of resist gear.  I think the plat diamond rings (or velium if you're really rich) make a GREAT starting point.  Two of these things bumps everything up by 14 across the board.  If we get to WW enough, I don't see any reason why everyone in the guild shouldn't get one of those talismans, and they bump everything up by 4, 5, 6, and 7 (though those dragons are REALLY hard).  Remember though, that I use items that have high resists with no concerns about AC.  Whether or not you believe AC matters in big fights, talk to Nillis.  With close to (or over) 1100 AC, and around 3000 hps, he went down TWICE against Ixiblat before he could even lay hands (twice meaning they fought him twice, and he died both times nearly instantly).  He could probably even post the logs for you if you're interested.<br>
