Basically, a bunch of spells and 3 GOOD drops - cleric legs went to Olmer, Enchanter gloves went to Finasteride and SK legs went to Col :)<br>
<br>
He now looks like he got dressed in the dark hehe<br>
<br>
Anyway, I had some troubles zoning in (suddenly the portal tree disappeared from my screen, no matter WHAT I do, relog, reboot, play with the settings... that tree is gone. I had to log Temp on a different PC to zone in. Weird.)<br>
<br>
Mobs were going down so easily and usually in singles, I thought the place was a walk in the park. Especially considering Col and I had never been there. Many thanks to Volker (and later on Kikulle) for taking care of pulls and strategy. Overall the pulls on the West side of the water were easy, even when we got two PoGs we did very well. When we got to the Lake Camp things got harder but not impossible. I'd love to go back there asap. A spotter is VERY useful (thanks Nillis and Rjak :)) and having more than 2 clerics would definitely help. Poor Shat died countless times :(<br>
<br>
One thing that kinda upset me was the number of no shows. Ouch. Severin and Whos never showed, Jumpkin, Daino, Nataly dropped out at the last minute. In a 4 group raid you can imagine the confusion it caused. Luckly we had some last-minute sign-ups :) Another problem (mostly my fault I guess) was that I counted on some people who didn't go there to fight, just to spot so they wouldn't hurt their Tunare faction. So I suspended sign-ups when we in reality still had open spots.<br>
<br>
Live and learn. Thank you very much everyone who came and made the raid successful. I learned a bit about the zone and look forward to going there again :)  <p><html>

We had a number of spells drop, but drops were thin over all.  Despite that, the raid was incredibly sucessfull, we had ZERO wipe outs, which is key for POG.  CR can take hours from the zone, and in many aspects is worse than Fear for CR.  We handled a big train (for POG) in which we had 4 unmezzable mobs, and 2 others.  We saw from the other raid going on, that if you kill things quickly, the loot rolls in a bit better.  We learned a lot, and I personnaly want to go back asap (even on weeknights). <p><html>

<br>
Again, I look forward to any chance I may have of fighting at your side again.  ESPECIALLY IN PoG!<br>
<br>
This was my 14th trip, I'm very happy for Colubridae on his new leggings, although my heart did sink when they dropped. (that was the first piece of noctivigant I have ever seen drop in my fourteen trips there).   I've lead a few raids there myself and have done a number of CR's in the zone.  I've aided in taking down almost all of the possible nameds in the zone etc.. etc.. etc..  If you ever need an experienced PoGer or just another tank, call on me PLEASE!  I am always willing to drop whatever I'm doing to join the effort!<br>
<br>
Again, I think this raid went VERY well.  Even when times got rough (at the waterfall with the numerous adds, and at the lake with the clerical whipe out) the troupe stuck it out and walked away victorious.<br>
<br>
From my observations of this event, I would like to add a little bit of criticism if I may.  Please this is not a flame or rant, just some helpfull tidbits from someone who's seen what can go wrong or right in this plane.<br>
<br>
1) more wizards, wizards are vital for CR in this zone and wizzies/mages are important in keeping the gaters at bay.  We had a number of tanks to combat gating mobs and some VERY skilled chanters at hand that were able to substitute for the lack of fire power.<br>
<br>
2) Waterfall camp is a tough spot to hold, what makes this spot even worse is the constant roamers that like to stop by.  They never quite cross the river though and this can be taken advantage of.  I feel the camp was a bit too close the the waters edge, had wee moved a few paces further west (just out of sight of the waterfall) we would have had a lot less adds when the PoG's arrived and it shouldn't have compromised pulling.  This is also very helpful if a CR ensues, gating mobs are very heavy in this area and CR's are very common place here.<br>
<br>
3)  60 enchanter is a must in this zone.. as well as a 56+ cleric (clicker preffered).  I understand that this isn't always possible, but it's something to try for. (no need to reply on this one, i know very few enchanters that are 60th and I know just how hard it is to find chanters/clerics for a PoG raid.  I congratulate all the chanters/clerics that did attend.  You all did a wonderful job.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Again this isn't a flame, just some 3rd party ideas.  And again the raid went wonderfully, PLEASE INVITE ME AGAIN!! I have enjoyed all my outings with this guild and it never fails to impress me over and over again.<br>

1. warn the group of incoming roamers (rangers with tracking can do this best)<br>
2. warn the group of PoGs spawn (anyone non-KoS can do this: the PoGs spawn at -200 -1000, they buff and then the zip towards the camp spot)<br>

Was weird being the main healer with my group as a 52 shaman.  Soll, Rapa, Simp and Meean were very patient with my limited healing abilities.  Wiggle has gotten really dusty lately and it was refreshing to play her again.  Thanks for letting her tag along!<br>
<br>
The cleric wipe out was interesting.  We got jumped while they were all dead and I kept canabalizing and remembered Crack telling me about assisting the mob to find who was getting beat on.  I healed Demongirlie just a few seconds to late and her corpse took my mana.  I was suprised at how well superior heal actually worked.<br>
<br>
Ahhh it was fun!  That's one raid that will be added to my memory scrap book.<br>

<br>
And nice pics Nillis.  I like the different angles, and especially the one with you standing next to her.  Also, nice try picking her up.  Isn't that like hitting on your mom, though?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I am a bit disappointed in Verant, though.  Being &quot;the mother of life&quot; I expected her to be, different.  I mean, the sword is only OK at best and her outfit is pretty ratty.  I've seen Firona wielding a better looking sword and looking much better.  And her size, yes she is tall, but I expected her to be much, much larger, proportionally of course.  I just think of pictures/ descriptions of CT and am a bit let down by this design.<br>
<br>
/sigh.  At least it looks like she got stuck with that stupid bear pet.  I would love to take that out many times, just to piss her off.  (Though, that CR would really suck.)  Has anyone killed Tunare yet on any server? <p><html>

I heard that even PoG legs are evading you now temp :P  heh, i was getting the play by play from our raid in there along with your raid.  <br>
<br>
ANyhow, just browsing the boards, bored here at work :P<br>
Oh, one "helpful hint".  Why a monk pulling?  Bards make the BEST PoG pullers, hands down, the BEST.  <br>
Bard/mage combo even better :)<br>
not sure if you didn't have bards, is why you went with a monkey puller or what.  /shrug<br>
<br>
And like um Deminica?(sorry hun, forgot the name) said....stay about 50feet to the left (if facing the wall) of the waterfall,  No Roamers :)<br>

The speed of the mobs seems to all be slower than a good SOW, so unless a lot of stuff dispells (I didnt see anything doing this) I cant guess why you wouldent want to use a FD puller (especially for thos damn Totems, ouch). <p><html>

However, he is not planes level capable, so I have no idea how easily mobs are mezzed and such at these levels. But I could certainly see track and Selos helping out considerably, let alone aoe and resists songs helping with multiple mob pulls. <br>
<br>
(especially casters...all of us FD'ers know how hard it can be to get off a sucessful FD with multiple mobs chaincasting on you!)<br>
<br>
Sounds fun really...may have to level the ol bard up some more!<br>
