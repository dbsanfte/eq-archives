But couldent quite managed Terror, his 500 point AE kept taking our casters down too fast.  We really have to work on Aggro management before we try this guy again.<br>
<br>
We had a lot of really good help from some friends, and some REALLY good drops.<br>
Druid Legs, and Crown..one other Druid drop?<br>
Shadowknight Legs (my second pair, would have rotted) and SK Breastplate to Demincia<br>
Pally Brestplate to Blaane, Bracer to Mantra<br>
Necro robe to Oosz, extremely rare drop.<br>
Monk Legs to Kerekian.  Tunic to Rejaine (sp?)<br>
Seems like there was a Flux Axe in there someplace?<br>
Dragon Spine Claws to Rjak<br>
Necropotence Amulet (who wound up with it?)<br>
Shamman Hammer (Sollron?)<br>
Shatmandu got a Shamman Belt, and his EPIC mob.<br>

Congrats to all that got drops, and to those that didn't, we'll get you some stuff on the next raid!<br>
<br>
We did get Terror down to the &quot;T&quot; in his name (I know, I was the last to die), but remember, this guy prolly had what, 32k hps?  If that is the case, then he still probably had 1000-1500 hps left (at least.)  Not to belittle a hard fought battle and that getting him that low isn't a great job, just that there was still a bit of work left to be done on the dude.<br>
<br>
Also, I want to say it was good to see that we went after the same mob 3 times and tried to beat him, and did progressively better each time.  The respawn should have been considered before the pull, but I know we were all excited to get at him.  So, no major issue with that.<br>
<br>
The issue I had with Terror was our mentality going after him.  We died the first time, and we attributed it to the lack of CR buffs.  So, we CR ourselves, got the casters along the wall, and took him again, and died.  This time, we attributed it to the Clerics going down too quick.  So, we suited up and tried again, and died ever so close to the goal.  Honestly, I felt like a football lineman, brute forcing our way to the goal.  We didn't stop for a minute and evaluate the situation, and what we can do to stack the odds more in our favor.  I suggested Enchanters Chain-Rune V the tanks or clerics (I honestly didn't know which ones would be better suited.  I felt clerics, so they would be kept alive, but wanted suggestions.)  This fell off to the side, deferring to rush to take the mob down.  Had we taken the time to buff the whole party with Rune V, I think we would have had him, as the Rune V provides 620-700 hp buffer, depending on the level of the Enchanter casting it.  That is at least 1 extra AE round, and at full force, we could have probably done the 1000-1500 hps of damage needed to take him down.  To experiment, I chain casted Rune V on myself during battle, and was the last to die.  (Nothing quite like seeing the mob stop hitting someone as they fall to the ground, they turn to look at you, and run at ya.  With less than a bubble of health, you know that's it.  Damn, where is that FD when ya need it!)  I think we could have done it.    But enough with &quot;what-ifs.&quot;  Let's just try to keep in mind that when we fail and decide to attempt the battle again that we look at what happened and evaluate strategies, then go kick the mob's butt!<br>
<br>
The positive is that I know how to do a fear break now, and honestly it was quite fun.  We executed well, and the train was an unfortunate aside.  Great job, and see you all on-line! <p><html>

We had a fun night, and good drop also.  Thanks for the invite.<br>
I had several question about the Terror fight.<br>
<br>
1. Is Terror slowable? and did we attempted to slow him?<br>
2. Is he tashable? and what type of spell he is weak against?<br>
3. His AoE cold doesn't seems like a spell to me, is it a proc?  I seems to see it have a delay and it proc when a certain amount of time pass.  Will stun prevent it? actually, judging by his size, I would think he is immune to stun.<br>
<br>
I agree that aggro management needs to be work on, I see him run around chasing after caster while tanks are on its tail.<br>
<br>
In the first and third fight, I start healing with celestral heal and manage to stay away from aggro. and die when the AoE got me.<br>
For the second fight, I was trying to see if AoE heal will work better and promtly got summon and squash.  Also, I believe in the 2nd fight, Temp was the first to die cause she was sitting when Terror enter camp.  This is something we need to remember, CASTER should stand up when we have incoming.<br>
<br>
I look forward for my revenge on Terror, with a sure win strategy.<br>
<br>

You did a great job all night, and when it comes to battling mobs, we need someone that says &quot;We go for X, NOW!&quot; and everyone listens without question.  Just wanted to remind people to not be shy when in a raid situation and think of new ideas, and what may have not worked out.  The best thing that can probably help is some guideline/ protocol on how to relay the suggestion.  I would recommend for the person to suggest something to the group leader who can properly filter the request.  Either they can (a) relay it to the raid leader should they feel it will really help, (b) give the proper leadership on whether to experiment with the idea (meaning, OK to rune tanks, but not OK to AE the mobs all to hell), or (c) veto and table the discussion for off-line discussion (on boards, etc.)  It was my bad not to ask Readd to do this (he was my group leader), and I prolly should have sent you a tell quick.  The Rune V spell costs a peridot, but I would have gladly absorbed the cost to be able to get to bed earlier than 2 AM, AND take this punk out.<br>
<br>
And honestly, I wanted to take that mother out big time.  <br>
<br>
Role Playing time:  You're a tank, and have probably been hit in the head one too many times.  I am a highly enlightened caster with high intelligence and charisma, able to win over my enemies with my wit and charm.  Of course, I also get to sit on the sideline and coach rather than be in the heat of the battle.  Well, kinda, since chanters get to get messy at times.  Anyhow, now get in there and be my meat shield, NOW! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

AC. ATK).  So Im positive he is highly magic resistant.  He might have a low resistance to disease/cold/fire/poison (although my fire based boil blood didnt stick either).<br>
Im pretty sure then that only the highest level chanters/shamman could slow or Tash him.  Im also pretty sure Wizzy lures were working.<br>
Im also just about postive that the AE was a Proc, and therefore unavoidable, someone said they couldent manadrain him, so Id guess he has no mana.<br>
<br>
I think next time we do this guy we will need some higher level warriors with disciplines.  More/better Resists (bard songs for tank groups, or shamman potions that stack on buffs).  We need to get the Tanks to keep him aggro, and keep the casters back untill he is at 50%, just like Maestro, or a Dragon.  Chain Rune the Warriors, and let them keep aggro.  Keep all other tanks at extreme mele range to help this.  And perhaps have some casters just chain casting pets (water for mages).<br>

I didn't try to cast on him any times, but should have tried to tash him as he ran at me.  bah, hindsight.  First time I died too quickly, second time I was chain casting my pet that generally died before they got to him (one AE to get the mindless ench pet to go in, then 1 more finished him off.  /sigh).<br>
<br>
I think we would have a winning strategy there, Col, with what you say.  Tanks with resist disciplines, bards to sing resist songs, rune everyone before, and chain rune tanks.  Next sign up, bring 5 peridots for your cleric and 3 for your friendly Enchanter.   <p><html>

I have a non-resistable Resist Debuff - I tried it a couple of the times - and gave up the last time to concentrate on making sure buffs stick.  It's like -22 to resist - and I've found - on my offensive songs - on highly resistant mobs - that's probably not a lot to make a difference (it's really nice on marginally resistant mobs).<br>
<br>
As far as the resist - that Cold is really tough.  I had CR of 135 I believe - and only had one complete resist - quite a few where I only took 40-70 HP's and still several at 450.  I rarely (if ever) got the full 500 when I had my resist song going.  I suspect if we can get people to 200 - we could take that sucker down a LOT easier. <p><html>

<br>
One small thing I noticed in the thread about Terror, my Cold Resist was 160 when we fought him with the discipline on.  I still got hit several times in the 130-200 range by the AE spell.  The thing I noticed though was that the Tanks didn't get to build much aggro before he took after one of the casters...I was wondering if it would have been better if the tanks had spent a little more time on him before anyone casted?  Even if it mean a tank or 2 went down before a cleric started healing or the others started nuking.  Just a thought as I never mind dying =)<br>
