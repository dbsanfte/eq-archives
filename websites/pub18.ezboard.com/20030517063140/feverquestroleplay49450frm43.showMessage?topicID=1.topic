<br>
A starry night descends upon the western Commonlands as Eias prepares to camp for the evening. The howling of werewolves had ceased, their invasion thrown back to the desert from which they came. He had slain many, and was weary from the fight, but because of his effort and that of many other courageous souls, the Commonlands once again sleeps in peace.<br>
<br>
Hovering in a countenance of death, he meditates, reflecting on deep truths that few understand and even fewer know. A skeletal companion stands over him, keeping the fire warm and the perimeter safe. Eias is known by many in this part of Norrath as a power not to be trivialized, but there are still a few who would have the courage to attack him in this slightly vulnerable state. His protector's hollow eyes keep watch. A low fog begins to form on the ground as the air begins to cool. It is nothing unusual for this time of year. Eias finds it comforting, something akin to an evening back home. The companion continues its scans, and its eyes lock onto something approaching in the mist.<br>
<br>
A battered and exhausted young Teir'Dal comes stumbling into the camp. Barely lucid, she eyes Eias with distorted vision, only faintly seeing the hovering green-robed gentleman and his skeletal companions as she falls to her knees, unable to continue. Falling unconscious, her last vision is of Eias looking down upon her, the faint violet glow of his eyes adding to her fear. She is alive, but barely. Her shredded clothing barely functions to keep her modesty and they fail utterly to provide any kind of warmth in this cool night air. The young woman's feet are shackled, but the chain that would prevent flight is shattered. Cuts and bruises cover her dark indigo skin and some are bleeding badly. Placing his hand upon her chest, Eias channels a small bit of his life energy into her. Her open wounds stop bleeding and most of her bruises become smaller. He commands his companion to remove the shackles, whereupon it's powerful, bony hands rip them apart as if they were made of paper.<br>
<br>
The companion again locks his gaze in the direction from which the dark elf had come. &quot;She has pursuers, master!&quot; Carefully making their way through the mist and brush, three orcs of the Deathfist clan approach the camp, following the trail of blood left by the woman. The leader, a legionnaire, stops the two centurions with him and points toward the camp; they have noticed Eias and his skeletal sentry.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have no quarrel with you, Necromancer,&quot; shouts the legionnaire, &quot;but the woman comes with us!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I disagree,&quot; he replies with a very dark, threatening tone. He had just saved her life and was not about to let them take it from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mistake. Centurions, attack!&quot;<br>
<br>
The centurions draw their blades and charge. Eias's companion promptly intercepts one, drawing two blades and engaging in a blinding dance of steel with the now outmatched orc. The legionnaire begins to close on the camp cautiously, looking for an opportunity to strike. The one charging Eias promptly finds its mind touched in the darkest reach. Fear begins to overwhelm him and he turns to run. His skin promptly withers as Eias rips the life force from him, adding it to his own and reducing the orc to a hollow husk of a corpse.<br>
<br>
The dance of steel between the Eias's skeletal protector and the other centurion ends abruptly when one of the skeleton's blades finds the orc's neck. The legionnaire suddenly discovers that he is the new dance partner and tries to bow out, backing away and fighting to keep the skeleton's blades away from his own neck. Knowing the attempt to be futile, he turns to run, whereupon two blades make a clean v-notch where his neck once rested.<br>
<br>
The brief battle ended, Eias decides it best to move camp. The trail of blood could bring more trouble and the scent of dead orc will only make it worse; the Commonlands are known for their large cougars and lions, not to mention grizzly bears. The companion could easily deal with such intrusions, but Eias is eager to minimize any danger to the young woman that he now protects. They move camp into a deeper thicket of brush and trees further away from any trails.<br>

<br>
Eias's young ward sleeps through the day. She appears to need much time to heal, only the channeling of life from him had kept her alive. Come the sunset, she stirs a bit and slowly opens her eyes. Her many wounds make moving difficult, but she manages to make note of her situation - safe and warm in a stranger's camp. She accepts a refreshing drink of water from her protector.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you hungry,&quot; he inquires. Small bits of meat are warming over the campfire. Not the usual dried flesh you find sold by supply stores, but fresher kinds, as if he himself had hunted them. The scent of warm spice awakens her appetite. &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; she weakly replies as she takes the small tin plate offered her. He serves up the meat with a bit of sweetened tea.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whom has fear brought to my camp,&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
The tea and fresh meat has already strengthened her. &quot;I am Na`Tiel, of the family Vex.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eias Rham,&quot; he introduces himself. &quot;Was it the orcs who harmed you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she begins, &quot;I was on Kunark. A group of us were exploring a region to the east of my people's outpost there when we were set upon by Iksar. If I may ask, what is the date?&quot; Thinking for a moment, he states the date by the Teir`Dal calendar. &quot;Has it been that long, six months almost? The Iksar put us to work in a mine and kept us half starved so we could not regain our strength and use any magic. My sister was captured with me. She gave me her ration one day, which helped me get my strength up enough to fight off the guard on us and allow me to teleport myself to the spires south of here. I was trying to get to Neriak, but already weakened and wounded, I only got as far as here. I knew the orcs were pursuing me, but they had not yet found me.&quot; He offers her another helping of meat, which she gladly accepts. Even if she had not been half starved for the last six months, she would consider this meal exceptional. It seems that this traveler had decided to live well wherever he was. <br>
<br>
&quot;Neriak is not far from here,&quot; he notes, &quot;and I have a welcome reputation there. I will go with you to make sure you arrive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would appreciate that, but I would ask one other thing,&quot; she was recalling the air of power she felt from him as she collapsed helpless the previous night. &quot;Would you help me rescue my sister?&quot;<br>
<br>
He ponders for a long moment. &quot;Let me get you to Neriak first,&quot; he replies. Many confusing and conflicting thoughts made it difficult for him to commit at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not wish to sound like I am begging, but if it's an issue of reward, I can show you where they keep the gems and mithril ore they were mining.&quot; She was recalling hearing his name spoken in circles of power in Neriak, and was desperately trying to think of ways to get his help, even considering offering herself to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not an issue of reward or anything like that,&quot; he states, smiling slightly. &quot;Do not mistake my living well here as a sign of wealth or a desire for comfort, as this comfort is more to do with frugality than finance. Besides, if I know the Iksar as I do, it will take more than the two of us to accomplish a rescue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually,&quot; she notes, &quot;there weren't many guards at the mine. It was high in the mountains where few people traveled. Most of the guard was committed to escorting the material back to their city. I know the remnant would be no match for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Either way, it is best to get you back to Neriak first. Your people should know what happened, maybe they will be able to help as well.&quot; He is beginning to truly understand how close she and her sister must be if she is so willing to set out now to try to rescue her. Going to Neriak would not add much length to a journey to Kunark either way. Resigning herself to the facts, she agrees, and at sunrise they set off for the Teir`Dal city.<br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/beverquestroleplay49450.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thuud>thuud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Player</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#778899>(11/2/02 8:17:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub18.ezboard.com/feverquestroleplay49450frm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.zoomnet.net/~russcm/everquest/characters/eias/graphics/photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part 3</span><hr size=1> Dark Empathies and Understandings<br>
<br>
They arrive in Neriak a few days after departing their camp in the Commonlands, having traveled slowly, Na`Tiel's wounds still giving her trouble. Eias does his best to minimize her discomfort, but she has been badly abused by the Iksar. Her former captors are known for their cruelty, but Eias had not previously heard of them being bold enough to take Teir`Dal as slaves, frogloks being their preferred choice. He ponders this change and what it may mean.<br>
<br>
Stories had filtered back to him concerning disappearances of former companions he had known when he journeyed to Kunark. Adventuring as he does makes few lasting friendships, as many who follow this lifestyle are in it for the reward of material and power; some for self, some others less selfishly for their societies. Eias journeys seeking both goals, with the ultimate goal of bringing respect to both his home and himself. Such is the dilemma before him now. If the Iksar have captured former companions of his, he could free them and bring respect to himself. However, if he did so, then he may provoke their captors who, as he does, also follow Cazic Thule. The people of Paineel, his home, are by default grouped among the rest as outsiders by the Iksar and as such dealt with as invaders, but still there is hope that someday Calibis and Paineel could be allied. Though friendly toward Paineel, the Teir`Dal have no such problem battling the Iksar, as they follow their creator, Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
&quot;What troubles you,&quot; questions a voice that wakes Eias from his thoughts. Na`Tiel has returned. They had gone to the temple of Innoruuk to see to her injuries where he was waiting outside on a balcony overlooking the caverns. Now healed and clad in a deep black robe with runes denoting her as a wizard, her true beauty is evident, her ebon hair braided in a way that reminds Eias of woven midnight.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are looking well,&quot; he notes, attempting to evade answering her. Even wounded, she had been lovely, but he is still surprised.<br>
<br>
She could tell from his expression that he found her beautiful. Pleasantly flattered that such a one of power would lower his guard enough to show such admiration toward her, she replies, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Not one to let him slip by that easily, she continues, &quot;That does not answer the question, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
Knowing she will not relent, he requests, &quot;ask me again later.&quot;<br>
<br>
She did not like that answer. The thought of not having him along to rescue her sister was devastating. It is well known that one should not force someone of his power to walk where he did not wish to walk, but she was still determined to at least try. &quot;Why later? I know I owe you my life and you owe me nothing, but I have to ask this. Do you intend to leave now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling gently to calm her, he reassures, &quot;No, I simply do not know how to tell you of my concern.&quot; He walks with her back into the temple area, where two members of the wizard's guild meet them. They have come to escort her to the guild leaders.<br>
<br>
He waits for her at an inn in the foreign quarter, still pondering his choices. Going with her at least to the Outpost will do no harm except to make it more difficult if he decided not to proceed to the mine. Although never personally loosing someone such a family member, he could relate how painful it would be to loose one so close. Nothing was forcing him to go, but for some reason he was starting to believe he needed to. Was this part of the dark road required of him?<br>
<br>
&quot;Something heavy weighs on your brow, I see,&quot; notes a voice from behind Eias. A dark robed Teir`Dal gentleman joins him at his table overlooking the town below. The runes upon his robe mark him as a leader of the Neriak wizards. &quot;I may be able to help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Eias replies, &quot;but the decision is mine alone in the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not here to force the decision, but simply to add another side to the debate.&quot; Signaling the waiter for what appears to be his usual, the gentleman continues, &quot;you are respected by our order and the other orders of this great city. I come to request your assistance not only on behalf of Na`Tiel Vex, but on behalf of all the orders. You may not be considered an ally, but you are not an enemy. You are trustworthy and deserving of the respect given you by our leaders.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have been to the area of the Frontier Mountains she has described. It has been decided that action in the full name of the Teir`Dal be taken against these Lizard Men, these Iksar as they call themselves. You could make a valuable guide and with your help it would be almost guaranteed that anyone we send would arrive at the mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
The waiter brings the gentleman's beverage. He takes a sip, then nods to the waiter his acceptance of the drink, as if to judge it's quality before receipt. Continuing, he explains, &quot;We will send a dragoon to escort you to the Outpost. He will bring sealed orders to the Outpost's commander with detailed instructions as to what to do. You know our kind, Eias; we do not take action piecemeal. Once someone inspires our hate, we are focused. We are creatures of hate, and our combined hate makes us strong. All we need from you is an extra hand to make sure we can deliver that hate to the offenders.&quot;<br>
<br>
This seems to be the answer Eias is hoping to receive. He knew that by coming here the leaders of the city would want vengeance. &quot;I will come then. I will add my power to the fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent. Na`Tiel and the dragoon will be here soon.&quot; The gentleman, having finished his drink, rises and offers his hand in traditional Teir`Dal fashion, which Eias takes firmly, as custom. &quot;Someday, when your people need us, you will be able to count on at least some of us, perhaps all. I have other rounds to make. Good journey, friend of Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
About an hour later, Eias notes a large procession of robed figures moving in the street below. Center to the crowd is Na`Tiel, accompanied by an aged woman bearing a crest of high rank and a gentleman in ceremonial warrior garments. The warrior, woman, and Na`Tiel make their way to Eias's table on the overlook, the remnant of the crowd gathering as if to bear witness to what was about to happen. The woman begins to address Eias, &quot;You are the one who has chosen to be guardian to Na`Tiel Vex?&quot;<br>
<br>
Standing, Eias replies, &quot;Yes, I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman continues, &quot;You have saved her life once. That was not required of you then, nor is anything further required of you now. Some cultures profess that once you save a life, that life is yours to care for and protect. Neither the culture of the Erudites nor the culture of the Teir`Dal professes to such tradition. Additionally, only she can decide if she feels obligated to return any debt of gratitude toward you, we will not hold her to any, and neither may you.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have chosen to be guardian on the mission to rescue her younger sister from the bondage of the Iksar. Additionally, you will assist in the upcoming battle where you choose, but you will assist. If you do choose to accept this freely, know that leaving without completion of the mission will most likely invoke our enmity and be disallowed access to our city. Success in the mission, and you will have our gratitude, something that can be of value to you in the future.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have but one chance to reply, do you accept this task given you, Eias Rham of Paineel, freely?&quot;<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, he replies, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
An unmistakable smile appears on Na`Tiel's face. She is placing heavy hopes in Eias, something he is not use to dealing with. He has been a loner most of his life, having responsibility for another is something he has chosen to avoid. It is why he does not frequent Freeport as much as he did in the past, Sariah and Leirna must not feel dependent on him. Now he has Na`Tiel and a promise. He will do his best to honor both, all the while making attempts to bury his uneasiness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Na`Tiel Vex,&quot; the woman continues, turning toward her, &quot;do you accept Eias as your guardian in this endeavor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replies.<br>
<br>
Turning toward the gentleman in the warriors garb, the woman takes an amulet from him and hands it to Na`Tiel. &quot;Signify your acceptance by bestowing upon him the Rune of the Guardian.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking it, Na`Tiel nervously brings it to Eias, her heart racing uncontrollably. Hesitating for a brief but uncomfortable moment, she beacons him to bow slightly, he being a good foot taller than any Teir`Dal. Smiling softly, he leans forward, withdrawing his hood, and she places the amulet around his neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Upon receipt of this rune,&quot; the woman proceeds, &quot;your voice becomes our voice in matters concerning her safety. Where you speak, we speak. Those who hear you, hear us. You are but one of very few outsiders to whom we have given this power and responsibility. Do not think it trivial.&quot;<br>
<br>
Standing tall again and returning his hood to its place, he thanks the woman. Taking Na`Tiel by the hand, he vows, &quot;I shall not fail in this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing, the woman concludes, &quot;may Innoruuk and Cazic Thule bless this endeavor with their power.&quot; She turns to depart, as does the crowd that came with them. The warrior moves forward to join Eias and Na`Tiel.<br>
<br>
Still holding her hand, Eias shows Na`Tiel to a chair at his table. &quot;Sadly, I have to wish the blessing be not quite what she hopes,&quot; he says softly as he sits.<br>
<br>
Puzzled, Na`Tiel inquires, &quot;is that part of what you are going to explain when I ask later, I hope?&quot; Nodding slightly, he looks up to greet the warrior joining them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guardian, I am Dragoon Til`Vahn of the Indigo Brotherhood. I have been assigned to help you.&quot; He holds out his hand in the traditional Teir`Dal manor.<br>
<br>
Eias takes his hand firmly. &quot;Pleased to meet you. Join us if you will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Til`Vahn sits, and they discuss the upcoming journey. &quot;Several others have been dispatched to gather assistance for the battle, &quot;he begins,  &quot;but we are to go directly to the Outpost. I estimate we can be there in eight days if we leave at sunrise and have no delays.&quot; <br>
<br>
They complete the plans for the journey, Til`Vahn departs to make some final arrangements. Looking down from the balcony, Na`Tiel makes note of the pleasant view. &quot;I have always liked it,&quot; Eias states, &quot;its relaxing. However, it is time for me to sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
They rise from the table, Na`Tiel taking one last look of the view. &quot;You're still not ready to tell me, are you,&quot; she asks.<br>
<br>
Pausing uncomfortably, he replies, &quot;no.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thinly disguising her disappointment with humor, she asks, &quot;So, guardian, where shall I stay tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pleasantly amused, he replies, &quot;you should be safe enough at home.&quot; He turns to head to the main desk of the inn.<br>
<br>
She takes him by the arm, stopping him. &quot;Wait,&quot; she asks. After a brief pause, she continues, &quot;stay with me tonight. The house will be empty without Na`Vaar there. Besides, I may need you when I get there, I have not yet been home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing her fear clearly, he agrees.<br>

Til`Vahn had arrived ahead of Na`Tiel and Eias at the gate. The guards there know him well, and are bidding him farewell. Well - wishings are shared all around as they prepare to depart, although Eias can tell some of the guard is uncomfortable with an outsider being guardian to such a one as Na`Tiel. He can do nothing to change that, this path chose him as much as he chose it.<br>
<br>
Departing Neriak, the three proceed south into the Nektulous forest toward the valley that leads to the eastern Commonlands. A river bridge along the path marks the last protection the Indigo Brotherhood's guards would provide until they reached the Outpost. Perpetual undeclared wars between raiders, orcs, and the Teir`Dal rage in the hills and forest south of the river and into the Commonlands, where the Freeport Militia holds power. The band, however, will receive little help this time from the Militia.<br>
<br>
Exiting the valley to the Commonlands, they pause to rest. It is nearing late afternoon. Their plan is to proceed across at sunset, arriving in the guards patrol area after dark. The Militia's reaction to dark elves is mixed; one never knows if they will kill or ignore. Eias is known to the militia; alone he would be ignored. This time, however, as guardian to a Teir`Dal wizard, he does not wish to be seen.<br>
<br>
Eias prepares an evening meal of his usual fine quality. Til`Vahn, not being accustomed to eating so well in the field, is quite pleased; he thanks Innoruuk for his fortune. The scent of spiced meat does attract the occasional large cat, but they are persuaded to leave. The sun begins to set over the mountains in the distance, and they pack to proceed. While admiring one last view, Na`Tiel eyes Eias whispering something to a shadowy shape, which departs quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who was that,&quot; she inquires.<br>
<br>
&quot;A messenger with a message for some friends,&quot; he explains. &quot;If they get the message, you will meet them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Untold centuries ago, when the desert dunes began encroaching on the fertile lands here, a forgotten people built a tunnel through the hills in an attempt to preserve a passage to the Lake of Marr and points south. The tunnel still exists, and the desert came, drying out the southern area of the Commonlands and forming the northern reaches of the desert of Ro, the lake now being referred to as the Oasis of Marr. The three begin to approach the tunnel, travelling unseen and avoiding the militia.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should rest at the tunnel, near the entrance,&quot; Eias notes. &quot;If my friends received the message, they will meet us there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Til`Vahn is uneasy with the idea of meeting up with anyone. &quot;Are these friends of yours tolerant?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They tolerate me after a fashion,&quot; he replies, a bit of dark humor implied.<br>
<br>
&quot;After a fashion, that is still not comforting,&quot; Til`Vahn remarks.<br>
<br>
They make camp a ways into the entrance of the tunnel. They will proceed through at sunrise and then through the desert that lies beyond the next night. The usual evening fog of the Commonlands was forming, the tunnel's already cooler air making the fog deeper where they camp.<br>
<br>
Little is being said between the three, they are all fatigued. Eias begins a meditative exercise to restore his energies in case it is needed there. Moonlight was filling the entrance to the tunnel, and outlined in the fog two cloaked figures began to approach the camp.<br>
<br>
A young woman's voice calls out from the fog, inquiring, &quot;is their room by that fire for friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
Motioning the others to be silent, Eias answers, &quot;of course. I hope my dark messenger found you well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He did,&quot; comes the reply, &quot;but he startled me in the midst of meditation.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed. I shall have to speak with him about his timing then,&quot; he notes, standing to greet his two friends with the warmest of embraces. He introduces the one who spoke as Sariah, a white - cloaked golden haired woman bearing a gold and ivory guilded sword and markings that shows her to be a paladin of Erollisi. The one with her he introduces as her younger sister, Leirna, a well dressed dark haired youth that seems to show the greater affection for Eias.<br>
<br>
Uneasily, Til`Vahn greets the newcomers. Keeping one eye on Sariah, he makes room for the sisters to sit. Na`Tiel seems a bit more at ease, trusting that these friends of Eias are no threat. Leirna produces several bundles of fresh fish and vegetables, making note of how she has missed Eias's cooking. Things begin to relax more as he gives each a task in preparing the meal.<br>
<br>
Sariah begins relating some events that have transpired since Eias's last visit to Freeport. &quot;It is good that you have come now. You know of Braxen Kurn, of course,&quot; she begins, &quot;He has not relented, in fact, he is stepping up his hunt for you. I overheard him speaking to a gentleman, an Erudite, at the temple recently. I believe his name was Palatos or something similar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Palatos Kynarn,&quot; Eias inquires.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I believe so,&quot; she confirms. &quot;Do you know him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am familiar with him,&quot; he notes, &quot;He is one of the Craftkeepers, part of the High Council of Erudin. They have hunted my people for generations simply to silence us. They spread more fear about us than we spread fear in general.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Apparently he is now helping Braxen,&quot; she continues, &quot;and the plan is to ruin your reputation in Freeport. Braxen went on to Velious, apparently on his way to Thurgadin to do the same there. One by one he plans on poisoning people to turn on you and your people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eias seems disturbed by this. &quot;Palatos should know better, he is far away from home and alone in Freeport. He should not be giving me a reason to confront him. Odds are if I do, he will immediately cry for guards and start a fight, forcing me to kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah knows that is likely exactly what will happen, and it's the confrontation Braxen wants as proof of Eias's menace. &quot;Should I speak up for you, confront him instead?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he replies quickly, &quot;that would just make trouble for you, and you have already risked enough for me. I will have to deal with this eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is this Braxen,&quot; interrupts Na`Tiel, &quot;and why is he after you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The fish are cooking and the vegetables stewing. As they cook, Eias relates the story of how he fought a companion of Braxen, a Sir Edwin Motte of the Knights of Truth. Edwin had murdered a fellow's student, and in exchange for some assistance given to Eias, he had vowed to avenge the act. After the fight, Braxen confronted the Knights, and the only reason Eias was not a hunted man in their eyes is the fact that Sariah had spoken on his behalf. She had noted that Eias had done nothing different than what Edwin would have done if the roles were reversed.<br>
<br>
Til`Vahn finds something of irony in the last part of the tale. &quot;Interesting that a paladin of Erollisi would be so bold as to question truths brought before the Knights of Truth, followers of Erollisi's brother Mithaniel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not really,&quot; Sariah notes, &quot;at times my role is simply one who speaks truths from another point of view.&quot;<br>
<br>
The meal is ready. Feigning a bit of a chill, Leirna moves closer to Eias while she eats; the hot tea and fish are quite warming. Na`Tiel inquires as to how Eias had met the sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;That in itself is quite a story as well,&quot; Sariah begins. She tells of how she was guarding a caravan heading from Freeport to a villa in the oasis. They were ambushed by a band of orcs who held a grudge against the caravan leaders. &quot;In the midst of the fight, I became the last one standing in the area where I was. I quickly ended up on the ground, and bleeding, basically finished. An orc was over me with a blade resting on my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's wasn't as bad as you makes it sound,&quot; Eias interjects. &quot;At that point it was at least three to one, and you had already taken out two.&quot; Til`Vahn appears impressed by that fact, while Leirna is uncomfortable listening to it totally.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, true,&quot; she continues, smiling humbly. &quot;As the orc raised its blade to finish me, it suddenly staggers. The life drains out of its eyes and it dries up like a raisin. It slumps to the ground at my feet. I manage to crawl away from it slightly, and see this fellow with a skeleton following him. I had never seen or met a Necromancer until then, so all I knew of them is their reputation for being someone who would kill you rather than look at you. I thought I was about to die by his hands. As I passed out from my wounds, I saw him reach down for me. All I remember after that is a warm sensation coming over me, then waking up in his camp.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can relate to that experience,&quot; Na`Tiel notes. Smiling, she relates her first encounter with Eias. &quot;It seems that mercy sometimes comes when you least expect it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The otherwise quiet Leirna speaks up to that. &quot;Mercy that saves your family.&quot; She has finished eating and was now leaning against Eias, his arm around her.<br>
<br>
Na`Tiel notes an irony, and relates how they are on a mission to rescue her sister. She was beginning to feel a kinship with these humans, something she did not expect. Humans and Teir`Dal are not ones to trust one another unless there are reasons to change the mistrust. She was finding such a reason here. &quot;I wish,&quot; she states, &quot;that their had been such mercy when my parents were lost in the battle at Kithicor.&quot; They have all heard the stories of that bloody day, and all know the horror that place now holds for anyone who passes through.<br>
<br>
Til`Vahn is starting to ease his wariness of Sariah. He is beginning to respect her as a fellow warrior, although he would have no problem slaying her on a field of battle. Until that happened, though, he would not hesitate to fight at her side.<br>
<br>
They continue speaking through the night. The time draws late and the sky outside begins to lighten a bit. The time has come for the three to move on. Sariah and Leirna bid warm farewells to Eias and his companions, Leirna holding her embrace of him a bit long. As they parted company, Na`Tiel makes note of how quiet Leirna seemed to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was little to say,&quot; he notes with a touch of sorrow in his voice. &quot;Most was said long ago, and the rest needs no words.&quot;<br>

<br>
The band's journey through the tunnel and into the desert is uneventful, the combined power of Na`Tiel and Eias makes traveling unseen quite easy. Coming onto a set of dunes just north of the ancient lake known as the Oasis of Marr, they spy a group of anxious men huddled in a make - shift hiding place. Curious as to the reason, Eias has his companions wait for him while he investigates.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has to be an inky invasion,&quot; Eias hears as he approaches, &quot;why else would they be here in such number?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They haven't moved much off the beach,&quot; another notes, &quot;either way you know the darkies are up to no good. That fleet of theirs off the coast may mean to carry them up to Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's only three ships though,&quot; notes one who seems to be calmer than the rest, &quot;that wouldn't be enough to take Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not alone,&quot; replies the second, &quot;but definitely enough to take the harbor! Come on then, we have to warn the militia!&quot;<br>
<br>
Failing miserably to be stealthy, the group of men scampers north heading for the city. Eias returns to his group, relaying what he saw. &quot;Do you recall them mentioning anything about ships,&quot; he inquires of Til`Vahn.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he replies, &quot;but I was not told the entire plan either, and I was under the impression that they were still gathering resources as we left.&quot;<br>
<br>
They move on, over the last few dunes to the Oasis. As they approach the seacoast near the lake, Eias notes a trio of masts prominently set against the sunrise. Reaching the summit of a nearby rocky hill, he looks down upon an armed camp assembled around the small docks used by travelers to the Timorous Deep and beyond. The three masts belong to a large vessel anchored offshore, who herself is flanked by two smaller single - mast ships. All three appear to be ships of war! Eias can make out at least a full platoon of Teir`Dal marines garrisoning the area around the docks.<br>
<br>
This seemed out of place to him. To the Teir`Dal, the art of Wizardry is considered a second class endeavor; even the Wizards guild refers to itself as the Spurned. Why all this effort to simply rescue the sister of an otherwise unimportant wizard and punish her abductors? Was it worth it to risk three precious warships from their small fleet to transport her and whoever else comes? This was clearly not an invasion, the Oasis of Marr is not strategic enough to capture and there was clearly no plan in the works or no indication in Neriak of any attack pending on Freeport.<br>
<br>
Approaching the camp, Eias places the guardian rune in plain site. The three are greeted by a patrol of marines and shown to a tent. &quot;Greetings, Guardian,&quot; shouts a voice from within the crowded tent. Making his way through the assembled, the commander of the marines greets the three warmly. Central to the tent, a gentleman is briefing the crowd on the timetable of the fleet. He makes note of how for reasons of expedience these ships were sent to bring them more quickly to the Outpost; the usual transports run by the Ogres being too slow. Concluding his briefing, the gentleman, whom Eias determines is the second in command of the main vessel, states the fleet will sail with the sunrise, using the offshore morning breeze to speed them into the Deep. The crowd then disperses. The marine commander takes Til`Vahn aside to discuss something, while Eias and Na`Tiel mill about the camp. <br>
<br>
Overwhelmed by the scale of things, Na`Tiel is puzzled. She was told even less about the plans that Til`Vahn. Coming to the dock, they eye a marine lieutenant arguing with an ogre, apparently operator of one of the transport rafts which carry passengers to his island in the Deep. Na`Tiel translates part of the debate to Eias; the ogre is protesting his loss of business, while the lieutenant explains the situation as temporary and vital to the needs of Neriak.<br>
<br>
Til`Vahn returns with several others. &quot;We are to be taken aboard in about a half hour with this group,&quot; he explains, introducing them as a troop of scouts from the Ebon Mask guild. Na`Tiel smiles as the scout's leader introduces himself as Vaxn Texxnev.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good to see you again, cousin,&quot; she says warmly.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you, Na`Tiel,&quot; he replies. &quot;When I heard Na`Vaar was among those taken, I had to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
They gather their gear at the docks and wait for the boats to return to take them to the ships. One of the scouts has a spyglass, and Eias asks if he can borrow it. Scanning the ships, he notes their names. The largest and apparently the flagship bears the proud name 'Innoruuk's Rage', perhaps a name meant to convey her power. She is large, well armed, and looks to be a match for anything the humans or gnomes have put to see. Eias had not before seen any Teir`Dal ships of this size, which may mean she is unique - another sign that there is more afoot than a simple rescue. The other, slightly smaller vessels bear equally grand names, 'Night of Bloody Kithicor' and 'Hate's Flame'.<br>
<br>
While panning between the ships, he spots the outline of another vessel on the horizon. Adjusting the spyglass a bit to improve focus, he looks again. It appears at first to be a two - mast fast merchant, a typical vessel that travels out of Freeport to points all over the Ocean of Tears and Timorous Deep. Looking closer, however, he notes it is flying the flag of Erudin and the command pennant is that of a Knight of Prexus. Rare indeed its it to see an Erudite vessel in these waters. Bearing out coincidence, Eias draws out a conclusion, Braxen Kurn had acquired his own ship, nothing unusual for a follower of the Ocean Lord.<br>
<br>
Noting his focus on something distant, Na`Tiel inquires, &quot;what is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Between the 'Rage' and the 'Kithicor' on the horizon,&quot; he notes as he hands here the glass. Spotting the ship, she draws the same conclusion as he. The 'Rage' had also spotted the merchant, and one of the lookouts was keeping an eye on her from the mainmast.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think we should do something about him now,&quot; she inquires as the longboats arrive to take them to the ships.<br>
<br>
&quot;Likely not,&quot; Eias concludes. &quot;Sariah said he was heading to Velious, probably on his way to Thurgadin. If that is the case, he has two things going against him right away. I have fought the Dain's enemies side by side with his forces, and that ship of his will not last long in the Iceclad Ocean. The Dain may receive him and listen, but will likely do nothing, and the ship will become a burden, probably sinking before he can use it to go elsewhere. No big loss, as he likely will be able to acquire alternate means of leaving Velious.&quot;<br>
<br>
Braxen is reviewing charts in the captain's cabin with his navigator and the gnomish mercenary they have contracted to assist in their transit of the ice around the only open port in Velious. One of the crew enters. &quot;My Lord, your Lieutenant has spotted something you should see.&quot; Knowing Krajn would not summon him unless it was important, he comes up from below. Seeing the Teir`Dal fleet on the horizon, he inquires if they have been hailed.<br>
<br>
Krajn replies, &quot;no, but that's not what I wanted you to see.&quot; Handing him his spyglass, he notes, &quot;on the dock, the green robed Erudite.&quot;<br>
<br>
Peering though the glass, he spots the individual Krajn indicated. &quot;Eias,&quot; he exclaims through clenched teeth, &quot;what is he doing there? Alter course, take us in!&quot;<br>
<br>
The crew begins to comply. &quot;Those are warships, M'Lord,&quot; cautions Krajn, &quot;Teir`Dal warships.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what they are,&quot; Braxen states firmly, trying to hold in the rage he felt toward Eias. Pondering a moment, he commands, &quot;Signalman, send up a hail!&quot;<br>
<br>
Eias and his companions are brought aboard the 'Rage'. She is to act as transport for the journey to the Outpost. As they come aboard, he notices an archer in the bow fire a signal arrow seaward. He sees the ship he spotted on the horizon has turned shoreward, toward the fleet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Red signal arrow, M'Lord,&quot; Krajn notes, &quot;they are warning us away and they have not returned the hail.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Signalman,&quot; Braxen commands, &quot;send that we wish to send a party aboard or ashore, their choice, to confer with their commander! First officer, slow our approach!&quot;<br>
<br>
The 'Rage's' captain is forward with the archer. Seeing the hail and message, he directs his attention shoreward, ordering a signalman to send to someone by the camp. Eias watches the exchange as a crewman takes his belongings below to his cabin. Na`Tiel, curious as to what is transpiring, stays by Eias.<br>
<br>
&quot;The captain is communicating with his admiral ashore,&quot; he explains to her. &quot;He is inquiring as to whether or not he wants to meet with the captain of the merchant per his request. It appears not.&quot; <br>
<br>
The captain orders a flag - hoist, signaling the admiral's command to the other ships, which promptly begin raising anchor and setting sails.<br>
<br>
&quot;They have ordered escorts to intercept and keep us at distance,&quot; Krajn reports to Braxen as another red signal arrow is launched their way.<br>
<br>
Swearing a curse under his breath, Braxen orders the ship turned parallel to shore and headway reduced to minimal. &quot;Signal again,&quot; he shouts, &quot;this is Captain, 'Vengeance of Prexus' requesting face to face with commander of fleet!&quot;<br>
<br>
'Kithicor' and 'Flame' rig for full speed and head strait at the 'Prexus'. Knowing the Teir`Dal will not likely allow him to remain, Braxen relents. &quot;Accursed spawns of Innoruuk! You will perish along with the Heretics you harbor! Full sail, get us out of here and resume course!&quot; 'Flame' takes up a shadowing position on 'Prexus', while 'Kithicor' falls back, guarding against the chance of another intruder.<br>
<br>
Most of the crew and passengers of the 'Rage' are on deck to witness the chase, Eias of course the most curious. Na`Tiel makes note of one particular gentleman on the fantail, pointing him out to Eias. &quot;That is Varum Tolax.&quot; Recognizing the family name, Eias inquires if his relation to Nexxka Tolax, the guild leader of the Dead's shadow knight corps. &quot;His son,&quot; she notes.<br>
<br>
The chase of the 'Prexus' lasts about an hour and the escorts return to their anchorage. Eias and Na`Tiel retire to their cabin, they have been assigned the same one, Til`Vahn being assigned the neighboring cabin. Being close to midday now, a meal has been brought to them, a classic mariner's meal of cod and dried fruit. While not appealing to Na`Tiel, Eias finds it quite nostalgic. <br>
<br>
&quot;Erudites are by nature a people of the sea,&quot; Eias begins. &quot;Even though my people have been driven into the mountains, some of our children's tails are still stories of the sea.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sitting by a view - port facing the sea, she wonders, &quot;do you think Braxen knew you were here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He may have seen me on the dock,&quot; he notes, &quot;odds are he had a bigger spyglass than that one fellows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That would make sense,&quot; she replies as she gets more fruit, &quot;likely one of the few things around here that is making sense to you at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling, Eias remarks, &quot;you've noticed that, I see. I was wondering, who else was captured with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you knew,&quot; she states, &quot;but seeing the look on your face when you saw 'Innoruuk's Rage' anchored here, I began to realize you didn't. We were lead by Kav D`Vinn and Neroxn Quexill&quot;<br>
<br>
Eias finally understood. &quot;Ambassador D'Vinn's nephew and Xon Quexill's niece! It's not a wonder they haven't called down Innoruuk himself on Calibis at this point!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more,&quot; she notes. &quot;Na`Vaar had recently been the subject of not a few romantic approaches by one of Xon's sons. It stands to reason that you are being watched by the Dead to see if you can bring home someone who is potential kin to their guild - master. The only reason I am along is an excuse to get your cooperation. We are likely both pawns.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing unusual in that when the Dead are concerned.&quot; Eias's prior dealings with that guild of Necromancers have shown them to be devious and cunning, but also rather cautious and manipulative.<br>
<br>
After their meal, Eias begins an afternoon meditation, focusing on the upcoming mission. He has been to sea several times, and finds the sound of the ocean quite relaxing and mind - clearing. Na`Tiel, believing the time right, takes this chance to ask Eias a question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back at the temple,&quot; she begins, &quot;I asked what troubled you, and you said to ask later.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are asking again,&quot; he replies.<br>
<br>
Smiling slightly, she states, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You said your sister had given you her ration,&quot; he notes, &quot;What do you think the Iksar do to the ones who help others escape?&quot;<br>
<br>
A heavy feeling suddenly hits Na`Tiel. She had not thought of that. Meekly, she replies, &quot;I don't know. Punish her I would assume.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know what Iksar eat,&quot; he inquires.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard mainly meat.&quot; She does not want to hear what Eias is implying.<br>
<br>
Trying to phrase it as easily as he can yet still add bluntness to the statement, he informs, &quot;to them, everything not Iksar is meat, save that which is plant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking away, out to sea, she covers her eyes to hide the upwelling of tears. &quot;So you think she is dead? Is that why you did not want to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, but it was part of my reasoning,&quot; he continues. He explains how both his people, the Erudite Heretics as he tells her Braxen's people call them, and the Iksar both follow the Lord of Fear, Cazic Thule. &quot;If I were to risk any sort of future between Paineel and Calibis on what may be a futile effort, I had to believe your sister was still alive or find some alternative goal to justify going. The only goal I could find was improving my standing in Neriak. Even if your sister were dead and buried, your priests could do something about that, although likely at a high price for someone. If, however, she were dead but not buried, we have again futility.&quot;<br>
<br>
Na`Tiel is now feeling the full weight of what Eias is saying. Na`Vaar may have paid more of a price than either could have imagined when she gave up her ration. Weeping softly, she feels Eias's hands on her shoulders. He had shown her the fear that she had ignored, as is his way. She now turns that fear into hate, which is her way. &quot;If she is gone,&quot; she says, voice still trembling, &quot;then I vow to Innoruuk I will see them all destroyed!&quot;<br>

<br>
The early evening sky lights occasionally as some distant storm releases its energy into the sea, spawning the wind that carries the fleet to its destination. Come nightfall the next evening, save anything unseen, they should be moored at the Outpost of the Teir`Dal in Kunark. Varum Tolax stands mid ship, watching the distant maelstrom, dismayed.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is no place for a warrior,&quot; he comments as Eias and Na`Tiel stroll by. &quot;The only battles out here are simple sports played between Karana and Prexus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No stomach for the sea, Varum,&quot; inquires Na`Tiel, a bit of jaded humor being implied.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, none at all,&quot; he replies firmly, &quot;give me dry land and an army of my fellow knights. That is a warriors place.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eias and Na`Tiel join Varum in watching the storms. They seem to hint prophecy, for in less than a week they will be engaged in battle, as sky and sea are now. That battle, though, will not be for play, as seems to be happening between the Rainbringer and the Ocean Lord.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speaking of place,&quot; Varum continues after a moments pause, &quot;have you figured out yours yet, Guardian.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have,&quot; Eias replies, &quot;I am sure the Dead had their reasons for not wanting to send a necromancer of their own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Varum states. &quot;The only reason I am here is because of concern for the leader's niece. Any concern for this one's sister is only token.&quot; Turning to go below, he adds, &quot;How does it feel to be sent on a fool's errand, Guardian.&quot;<br>
<br>
Na`Tiel becomes agitated, her hand searches for the knife at her side. &quot;Be silent, Varum,&quot; she commands through tight lips.<br>
<br>
Placing his hand on her shoulder in an attempt to calm her, Eias replies, &quot;a fools errand it is not, there are rewards to be had here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Varum says, stopping. &quot;What sort of reward can come from rescuing someone who has likely already been turned to lizard offal and bone meal? How can you rescue someone of who's sinews are being used to lace trousers made of her own flesh?&quot;<br>
<br>
As he turns to continue his belittlement of Na`Tiel's quest, he his suddenly knocked back by a burst of energy. She would hear no more. Drawing her knife, she begins to walk over to the stunned Varum, intent on opening his throat. The crew begins to close on the fight, some to be witness, some to break it up. Eias grabs her arm to try to restrain her. All pause in wonder as the sound of pleasant laughter rises from the down knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well played, evoker,&quot; he shouts as he rises, still laughing. &quot;There is some fight in you after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Na`Tiel is confused. Although opening his throat still seemed to be a good idea to her, she hesitates, curious as to the intention of her antagonist.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Guardian I know,&quot; he begins, &quot;my knights I know, and the marines I know. You, however, I do not know. I had to find out if you had some fight in you before I would trust going into battle with you. Well played.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lowering her knife, she cannot believe what she is hearing. &quot;Do you think so little of us that you would doubt we would fight for our family. Your little game is insulting!&quot; She goes below, clearly disgusted.<br>
<br>
Joining her below, Eias finds her weeping. &quot;We are kindred spirits, you and I,&quot; she says, sensing him. &quot;Both despised by our societies. The only difference is you are not ridiculed and belittled. Hunted, maybe, but at least respected. I would take your place any day if it meant respect.&quot;<br>
<br>
He joins her at the view - port she has made her favorite. &quot;Respect,&quot; he begins, &quot;is something that can be earned with those who will hear. Granted, Varum went about showing you in the wrong way, but he may be willing to listen and allow you to earn his respect.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One more exchange like that, thought,&quot; she notes, &quot;will ensure he earns an open throat.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wind and sea grow more favorable, and the fleet is helped along. Come the sunrise, one of the lookouts on the 'Flame' signals the siting of land silhouetted against the sunrise. Navigators on the 'Rage' find landmarks, and turn the fleet southward setting final course for the Outpost. They are a half-day ahead of plans. In a few hours the first signs of their destination appear on the horizon.<br>
<br>
Eias had been to the Outpost before, he notes it is little changed. Ruined well before the Teir`Dal occupied it, it is still mostly that, a ruin. Few buildings are intact and those that are do not offer the same comfort as a nice home in Neriak would. The only real difference this time is the number of people he sees moving about.<br>
<br>
A skeletal herald greets the passengers on the docks as they disembark, relaying some of the ground rules for conduct in the Outpost. Til`Vahn hands a sealed scroll to the herald, making note of a glyph on the seal. The herald gives Til`Vahn some instructions as to who needs to see the scroll. Awaiting Vaxn's scouts, he leads them to a large tent. Handing the scroll to one who appears to be a ranking member of the Brotherhood, he salutes and greets the officer.<br>
<br>
The officer thanks him and states the usual compliments for completing a task and following orders, then dismisses him. Moving to depart, Til`Vahn turns to Eias. &quot;I shall see you on the battlefield, Guardian. I must now join the Brothers in their preparations.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Farewell then, and good fortune to you,&quot; Eias replies.<br>
<br>
The officer informs the rest that they should wait here, an afternoon meal will be brought to them.<br>
<br>
Some time later, after the meal is finished and the table cleared, Varum enters the tent with the officer. Assuring the area is clear of all that need not know he places several parchments on the table. Most are maps showing the route to the mine and it's probable location.<br>
<br>
&quot;This group,&quot; Varum begins, referring to those present in the tent, &quot;leaves before dawn tomorrow to take up position overlooking the mine to pinpoint it. Guardian, this is where you must choose. Will you proceed with these, or do you proceed with the main attack?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will go with these,&quot; Eias replies. &quot;It is best for Na`Tiel to guide them and my place is with her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I concur,&quot; Vaxn states, adding his voice of approval.<br>
<br>
&quot;As do I,&quot; Varum notes. Continuing, he explains several points on the map. The mission of the scouts and their guide will be to pinpoint the mine, report its position, and establish numbers of defenders. &quot;Once this is determined, you will dispatch a message to our troops who will be gathering here. Hold position for orders otherwise.&quot; Giving the maps to Vaxn, he dismisses the gathered, &quot;Innoruuk bless our endeavors.&quot; <br>
<br>
Milling about after the meeting, Eias makes note of the shipyard; the 'Rage' had likely been built here. He sees another, similar looking ship almost ready for sea, one named 'Endeavor of the Creator'. The irony of the name and the blessing wished upon them by Varum was not lost.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the beach a bit later, Eias meditates - the sound of the sea clearing his mind. He focuses on the vision of his paths, noting how many converging and diverging paths have fallen away. His choices are becoming more limited, but still the same destination comes closer. Has he chosen wisely, or is he simply being drawn to a false power?<br>
<br>
&quot;I know now why you enjoy the sea,&quot; a small voice comes from beside him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did not hear you sit down,&quot; he notes, finally noticing Na`Tiel.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did not want to disturb you,&quot; she replies.<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't.&quot; He is trying to see if he can make out precisely how she fits into this future path, but all he can see is her road diverging from his soon. Many paths part and re-cross his own, but no hers.<br>
<br>
Na`Tiel takes in the sounds of the water and waves, their rhythms filling her being with gentle harmonies. Her mind drifts back to a time when her uncle would play a flute after dinners gathered around a fire, a time of clarity and simple joy she had not felt since.<br>
<br>
Eias rests this night on the beach. In his dream, he focuses on the path he believes to be Na`Tiel's. On tracing it back, he notes a path diverging from hers that does not stray far before approaching again. Conjuring the image of the one who walks that path, he sees a woman who resembles her in every way, but younger and clad similar to a scout of the Ebon Mask. Assuming it to be Na`Vaar, he follows, only to shortly see her kneeling in sorrow near where two paths should intersect hers, both falling short and dissipating to dust. Upon one path, he sees a black ebony mask marking its end, the other a small flame. Awaking suddenly, he looks to see if Na`Tiel is still beside him; she is not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, you are already awake,&quot; notes a voice from behind; Vaxn had come to wake him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Na`Vaar is alive,&quot; Eias informs as he rises to join him, &quot;I am fairly certain.&quot;<br>
<br>
A sense of joy settles over Vaxn. He had all but lost hope while waiting, content to undertake the mission out of a vow of vengeance. Coming to the tent where they were serving the morning meal, he informs Na`Tiel of Eias's news.<br>
<br>
A joyous Na`Tiel joins Eias at his table. &quot;How do you know she is alive,&quot; she inquires.<br>
<br>
&quot;I followed her path in a dream,&quot; he explains, &quot;when we get there, at least, she will be alive.&quot; Happily to him, she did not ask about other paths.<br>
<br>
It is still quite dark when they finally make ready to depart. In the distance, Eias notes that Varum has assembled his knights, the Brotherhood, and both the 'Rage's' marines and the local Undead marine platoon, made up of powerful, reanimated Iksar skeletal warriors. Captain Rottgrime, the commander of the undead garrison, is making a speech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come midday,&quot; he speaks, his raspy, reptilian voice carrying surprisingly well, &quot;we march to bring glory to Innoruuk. We march to punish the ones who took our master's children. We march to show them the power of the Teir`Dal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Varum takes over from there. &quot;What say you, are we ready to march,&quot; he inquires of his army.<br>
<br>
From Varum's knights come the shout, &quot;We are the Dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
Next, the warriors respond, &quot;We are the Brothers!&quot;<br>
<br>
Lastly comes the mixed voice of the undead and living, shouting out, &quot;We are marines!&quot;<br>

<br>
The blinding snow limited site to only a few feet. Jorn tries to shield his eyes, futilely trying to see his guide. &quot;He has gone to far ahead,&quot; he shouts to the one standing beside him, who still only barely makes out what he says over the howl of the wind.<br>
<br>
&quot;He will come back,&quot; Braxen notes to his companion, more hopeful than certain. Trying to lighten the mood of his Northman friend, he jokes, &quot;This should feel about like home to you, Jorn.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Too cold,&quot; Jorn remarks.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did not think that was possible,&quot; Braxen comments, smiling. Making out a shape coming toward them, he inquires, &quot;Is that Brauen?&quot;<br>
<br>
A lean, light-footed wood elf comes into view from ahead. &quot;I have found us shelter,&quot; Brauen notes, &quot;follow.&quot; Leading on, they come to a cluster of small huts - a remote campsite for Coldain hunters. As they approach, a snow bank near them erupts, hit by a ball of fire.<br>
<br>
Stopping in their tracks, they look around. The storm has lightened a bit, but could intensify again any moment. In the distance, they see flashes of flame silhouetting several large human shapes - too large at that distance to be anything but giants of the Kromrif! Braxen turns to his two companions. No words need to be said; each knows what the other is thinking. They set off in the direction of the battle.<br>
<br>
Coming upon the battle, they note a number of dead Kromrif and an equal number of dead Coldain Dwarves. Still in the fight are three giants, two are beating on an unseen victim and one is battling the elemental fire conjuration of a young Erudite woman; she herself seems to be injured. Several trained wolves seem to be helping the giants.<br>
<br>
Braxen charges the giant engaging the woman's elemental. Two wolves attempt to intercept, one quickly cut down by a swift arrow from Brauen, the other evaded. Jorn gets the attention of one of the giants who is beating on the yet unseen individual by opening the back of its knee with his sword; its cry of pain bringing the third's attention onto Jorn as well, the wolves around them attacking.<br>
<br>
The scouting party has ascended into the mountains near their destination. Na`Tiel begins to recognize landmarks and guides the group to an overlook with a view of the entrance. Making notes on the map, Vaxn directs two of the scouts to close and begin making a count of the guards. The army will not be at it's rendezvous point for another seven hours, so they huddle in and trying to remain unseen using what magic they can.<br>
<br>
The scouts return and give their count. As it stands now, the coming army vastly outnumbers the Iksar at the mine. Na`Tiel seems to recall their being more there when she escaped, a fact that concerns Eias. Looking around, he begins noting the terrain. &quot;They could have dozens more hidden anywhere,&quot; he notes. &quot;We could be walking into an ambush.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vaxn looks around, and concurs. &quot;If that is the case, we must assume we have been spotted, and are vulnerable.&quot; Eias kneels beside him, both checking the map to see where the army would be at that time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Three or four fast runners should try to get a message to the army,&quot; Eias states. &quot;I can enhance their ability to travel over these rocks and canyons. They should run this ridge, then spread out down these paths.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quickly, Vaxn scribes four brief messages in Mask's code. Looking over his scouts, he indexes three. &quot;Svez, you're in charge. You, you, and you with me,&quot; he states, handing each a copy and stowing one in his tunic.<br>
<br>
Eias flashes to his vision of Na`Vaar mourning over an ebony mask. He takes Vaxn by the arm. &quot;Are you sure you should go,&quot; he inquires.<br>
<br>
Confused at first, Vaxn sees the look in Eias's eye. &quot;Yes, I must,&quot; he replies. &quot;My orders are to scout and report, and it is my duty to see it through.&quot; Pausing as if to form a final thought, he gives Eias one last order, &quot;You take care of her.&quot; <br>
<br>
Na`Tiel is keeping her gaze fixed on the mine, a fact of which Eias is thankful, as she did not see his face when Vaxn announced he would bear a message. He calls her over to the four, as she will need to render them unseen once he finishes. Tapping into ancient secrets, he alters their very essence, rendering them ghostlike, pushing them as close to death as he can. They can now drift about like spirits.<br>
<br>
The giant comes to its knees, badly beaten and burned. Its neck is promptly severed by Braxen's heavy blade. Looking about quickly, he notes Jorn and Brauen are both standing, looking around as he is for more foes. Turning to the woman he had moved to protect, he sees she is still breathing, but slowly. Some of the wolves had gotten to her, and a vicious bite near her throat was bleeding badly. Placing his hand on the wound, he calls upon his healing power to seal it and restore some of her strength.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you walk,&quot; he asks of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think so,&quot; she replies.<br>
<br>
Looking about for more survivors, they find none. They discover whom the unseen victim of the two giants was - a human wizard now beaten almost three feet into the snow. A short distance from him lies an ogre with an oddly shaped bruise on it's chest lying next to a giant holding a dead gnome in his hand, the gnome fitting the size of the bruise.<br>
<br>
The snowstorm had let up a little more. Brauen leads them to the huts they had seen earlier. The woman uses some of her magic to quickly light a fire from wood they find stored there, a fortunate thing since the storm again intensifies.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that fight about,&quot; inquires Jorn.<br>
<br>
Looking about at her rescuers, she notes, with the exception of Brauen, they seem new to the frozen continent. &quot;Are you aware of the conflict here in the Eastern Waste?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Vaguely,&quot; notes Braxen. &quot;I know about the Coldain - Kromrif war.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have just walked into the middle of it,&quot; she states. &quot;I was supporting some skirmishers. The Coldain main line is about a mile and a half northwest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They should have heard the fight then,&quot; Braxen notes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if they did,&quot; Brauen interrupts, &quot;a mile and a half out here may as well be forever in these storms.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We should rest here as well as we can,&quot; the woman notes, &quot;these huts are not safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Waiting out the storm, they all take note of the sound of the wind. It has changed to a deeper, almost mournful demeanor with a touch of hate thrown in. As the storm begins to wind down, they note the new tone does not fade, but grows stronger.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Brauen knocks an arrow and fires it out the door. The high pitched yap of a dire wolf confirms the arrow found it's target. Wounded, the wolf tries to flee, but a second arrow finishes it.<br>
<br>
&quot;We must go now,&quot; the woman insists. &quot;The Kromrif are close.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sky is clearing; the only falling snow is light and dry. Coming over a hill near the huts, Braxen can look across a valley to see the site of the recent fight. Standing over the dead, a giant eyes the fallen. It leans back, howling a deep dirge that sounds like a cold, icy wind. From over distant hills, other Kromrif appear, closing on the position of the howling comrade.<br>
<br>
Braxen sees the Coldain's lines to the northwest; several mounds of snow have been erected as a wall around a camp. It seems prudent to him to reach that camp, as the group has now been spotted by a pack of the Kromrif's wolves.<br>
<br>
Vaxn and his scouts glide effortlessly over the rocks and canyons. Their feet rarely come close to the ground. &quot;I could get use to this,&quot; he thinks to himself. The army was at least twenty miles away when they set out, and they had covered most of that distance in a very short time.<br>
<br>
They begin to pass down a canyon that would lead them to the open area where they would fan out and try to locate the army. Midway through, the scout at the end of their line shouts, &quot;Ambush!&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning about, they see the second to last become engulfed by magical energy that forms a bond of force fixing him in place, the same has happened to the last. An Iksar clad in banded scale armor leaps from the rock above and behind them. It begins to cast its rooting magic again, but is interrupted by a barrage of throwing blades. Vaxn and the one still free close with it as it falls back.<br>
<br>
The Iksar has pulled them past their companions. A shout comes from one; two warriors who leaped down from the rocks above have struck him from behind. Struggling against his magical bonds, he manages to get his sword free, but is badly wounded. His bound companion throws a few blades into one, who turns on him.<br>
<br>
Vaxn orders the one with him to help the others. &quot;I'll keep this one busy,&quot; he states. Drawing two fighting knives from his belt, he continues to close. Noting it is no longer two against one, the Iksar begins to stand its ground.<br>
<br>
Content that their first victim is down, the two warriors engage the two scouts. The bound one manages to hold his own while still fighting the magic. The one still free manages to get inside the reach of his foe, opening up some sizeable wounds with his knives.<br>
<br>
The two warriors have underestimated the resilience of a Teir`Dal. Freeing himself from the magical bonds, the wounded scout recovers his dropped sword. He manages to find a suitable place to put his blade along the back of the Iksar on his still bound comrade. Shrieking in pain, the warrior brings its own sword down upon the head of the impetuous rogue who has just impaled him, only to expose his back to the rogue's comrade, who does the same. The warrior falls to its knees, where one last blow to the head sends it slumping lifelessly to the ground beside the now lifeless scout.<br>
<br>
Vaxn charges his foe. The Iksar evades with magical nimbleness. Neither has been able to harm the other yet, but the Iksar commands still more powers. Allowing Vaxn to charge and miss again, he evokes spirit energies that slam into his foe, sending him reeling in pain. Recovering, Vaxn charges again, more carefully this time, feigning one direction and coming back on the Iksar when he dodges, one knife finding its mark, creating a serious wound.<br>
<br>
Growing tired of this dance; the Iksar becomes more aggressive. After hitting his foe with another spirit strike, it lunges with its spear as Vaxn turns. The spear catches him in the chest, penetrating deep. Pinning its foe to the ground, it twists the spear, the sound of metal grinding on stone apparent from beneath Vaxn.<br>
<br>
Although writhing in agony, Vaxn remained lucid. Slamming his foot into the knee of his attacker, he knocks a leg from under it. Now with it in arm's reach, he slashes at the Iksar's throat, catching a piece of its neck. Renewing its grip on the spear and its footing, it grinds a bit more, blinding Vaxn in pain. Through the agony, he hears a soft impact on the ground next to him. Opening his eyes, he sees the two surviving members of his team standing over him, the Iksar lying at his side with two swords in its back.<br>
<br>
Attempting to evade the pack of dire wolves pursuing them, Braxen and his group make for what appears to be the dwarven camp. Brauen does his best to slow the pack, using his speed and skill as a ranger to confuse and slow the animals. The Kromrif are closing, however.<br>
<br>
Brauen catches up to Braxen; Jorn and the woman are ahead of them. He sends an arrow into a wolf pursuing him, but the animal does not slow. Before he can notch another, several more arrows strike it, stopping it dead. The Coldain have spread out, and Braxen and Brauen are passing through a line of hidden crossbow - armed dwarves. They all reach the dwarf camp safely. Looking back, they see Kromrif coming over a ridge behind them cut down one by one as the concealed dwarves take their shots.<br>
<br>
Braxen is introduced to the dwarven commander. &quot;We thank you Outlander,&quot; he says in greeting, &quot;and ask if you will stand with us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will,&quot; he replies. Looking around, he sees around three dozen warriors. Knowing there are more, he asks how many warriors there are.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough,&quot; the commander states confidently. Braxen does note a hint of uneasiness in the commander's voice.<br>
<br>
The Kromrif end their rush and fall back behind the ridge. Quiet settles over the area, but the occasional heavy footfalls of the giants can be heard. Climbing to a high spot, the commander sees what the giants are waiting for; another bad storm is heading their way, and night is about to fall. On more distant hills, the occasional band of giants is seen coming toward the ridge where the others wait. When they come, they will come in force.<br>
<br>
Vaxn is quivering from the pain. Knowing withdrawing the spear fully would likely kill him, they have managed to break off the shaft - the shock causing him to drop his blades. The two discuss how they should proceed, but Vaxn had already made up his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two get the message to the army,&quot; he orders, fighting the pain to remain focused, &quot;If there is time, come back for me, but do not make special effort.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saying a quick parting word, they depart with haste. They get some distance away when he hears the Iksar beside him begin to stir. Standing, it sees him, a bloody mess with a spear in his chest, then sees the two departing. Removing the swords from its back and grabbing its shield, it seems to be preparing to give chase. Vaxn looks around for a weapon, but there is only one handy.<br>
<br>
Speaking a quiet prayer to Innoruuk, he closes his eyes to brace for a shock of pain. Placing his hands firmly on the remaining shaft of the spear, he pulls it from his chest, successfully resisting the urge to cry out. Standing slowly, he sees the Iksar begin to cast some sort of magic. With his last bit of strength, he hurls the spear point, implanting it into the back of the Iksar's head, the crunching of bone confirming a firm hit, followed by the cold thump of dead flesh.<br>
<br>
Each of his heartbeats now inched him closer to the end, his heart now fully open. He thanks Innoruuk for his last bit of strength, but his final thought is of Na`Vaar. He slumps to his knees, the strength leaving him. &quot;I love you, cousin,&quot; is the last phrase to leave his lips as his final bit of life departs.<br>
<br>
An icy chill comes over Eias. It had happened! The vision of the ebony mask, now bloodstained, returns and disturbs his meditation. Na`Tiel and the scouts are startled by his sudden reaction to something unseen. Focusing, he notes, &quot;be ready, we may have to make a stand here.&quot; Turning inward as they make preparations, he focuses on the image of the bloody mask, probing it for any hidden meaning.<br>
<br>
Reaching the army, the two scouts find Varum. He reads the message, &quot;Ambush likely. Position possibly compromised. Plan likely anticipated.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain,&quot; he calls out to Rottgrime, &quot;take your marines and reinforce the scouts. Hurry!&quot;<br>
<br>
The storm hits. The swirling snow blinds almost everyone and nightfall makes it worse. Noise from the wind makes verbal communications almost impossible. If the Kromrif are coming, it will be soon. Braxen finds Jorn and Brauen; he will stand by them as they fight.<br>
<br>
The giants have let their dogs loose upon the dwarves. The sounds of injured canines can faintly be heard on the wind. Another sound begins to rise, the howl of the giants. It is clearly audible over the wind. Braxen estimates many dozens, perhaps hundreds of giants howling at once from over the ridge. It suddenly stops, and everyone within site of Braxen suddenly becomes very alert.<br>
<br>
The sound of battle rises from ahead of the lines; the Kromrif have come over the ledge. Hidden warriors rise up out of the snow and engage the giants as they come near. The sound of bowstrings soon begins as the crossbowmen add their weight to the fight.<br>
<br>
Any moment now, Braxen expects giants to come into view ahead of him. His eyes strain to see through the blowing snow. The sound of battle, however, grows fainter. A runner comes up to the commander and shouts something in his ear; the giants are falling back.<br>
<br>
Had the lines held? From the sounds of the howling, they had all expected to see hundreds of giants. Had Brell brought them such good fortune? The answer was coming up from behind!<br>
<br>
The giants had used the sound of the storm and the distraction of the battle to move the bulk of their force behind the dwarves and now that force was charging into the camp with little hindrance! The small force of dwarves that had stayed to cover the camp was now being overrun with ease. Dwarves began to leave their hiding places and fall back into the camp. In the confusion, Braxen becomes separated from his companions, fighting for his life in the midst of this blinding snowstorm.<br>
<br>
The scouts have returned to the site of the ambush. They see the spearpoint in the head of the Iksar. He had given his life for them. Removing his bloodstained ebon mask, they take it with them.<br>
<br>
Starting from the vision of the mask, Eias focuses. Remembering the ancient secrets he had studied, he began reciting the rhymes of the prophets. One gives him the key, &quot;The dead in their slumber are ungiving. To answer your vision, look to the living.&quot; He begins tracing back the path of the mask and sees the Iksar whom he battled. This added to the dread, he knows now they are facing forces lead by the Scaled Mystics, the shaman of Calibis. This battle will be bloody. Noting the path of that Iksar ending, he traced it back. It intersected many other paths, mainly the ones the Mystics have enslaved to work this mine; the climate was too cold and dry for their usual froglok slaves, so alternatives had to be explored. From these intersections, he focuses on the paths of other shaman who seemed involved in the mine. Most begin to lead quite close, but one begins to approach quickly, heading right for the path that ends in the small flame.<br>
<br>
Coming to his feet immediately, he grabs small chips of bone from a small pouch on his belt. Holding them tightly, he begins to focus energy into them. Startled by this, the scouts become nervous. The snap of a bowstring gets their attention; an Iksar warrior stands upon a rock above them. Its arrow glances harmlessly off an energy field surrounding Eias.<br>
<br>
The channeling of energy complete, Eias tosses the bones into the air, which form a skeletal protector. The warrior on the rock ducks back down upon seeing that. &quot;They are here,&quot; Eias notes, &quot;and they are coming now!&quot; Focusing inward, his flesh peals away from his bone, retreating inward to be channeled into power, a howl rising from his soul that is heard for miles around, echoing off the rocks. &quot;Stay with me,&quot; he tells Na`Tiel, his voice now hollow and fearsome.<br>
<br>
Moonlight finally breaks through the clouds as the storm dissipates. The snow is bright red, saturated with the blood of over one hundred dwarves and giants. The battle still rages, the Kromrif appear to be winning. This day does not go well for the Coldain.<br>
<br>
The commander finds Braxen somehow. Handing him a sealed letter, he requests that he take it to the Dian immediately. Looking about to find Jorn, he sees him. Lying amongst a pile of dwarves, the lifeless eyes of Jorn and Brauen stare into the sky. Muttering a prayer requesting forgiveness from his fallen friends, he sets out westward toward the pass to the valley of the Great Divide, it lay within view ahead of him. One of the Kromrif spots Braxen as he leaves the fight. Reaching down, it grabs the closest dwarf and hurls it at him.<br>
<br>
He has just made it over the last barrier mound the dwarves erected. Focusing on the valley ahead, he is suddenly struck from behind with incredible force, driving him forward into a snowdrift. Slowly he rises to his feet, back bruised severely. Turning to see what struck him, he spots a dwarven woman lying in the snow. Her small size suddenly reminds Braxen of a small child and he immediately comes to her side. Her neck is slightly skewed; likely indicating it is broken.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you ok,&quot; he asks, as if to a little girl.<br>
<br>
Her eyes open slightly. &quot;Run, you fool,&quot; she says weakly, noting the letter in his cloak pocket. &quot;There's nothing you can do for me. Run!&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking up, he quickly comes to his senses. The Kromrif who hurled the little one has grabbed a pair of its comrades, all three setting out in pursuit of Braxen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Run, now,&quot; she says, trying to shout.<br>
<br>
He finally does just that. He heads into the valley with three Kromrif soldiers in hot pursuit. The young dwarf is later found inside one of the giant's footprints. A hail of arrows from behind cuts down two, but one still remains. Braxen manages to use his powers to stun it, but only briefly enough to make it through the valley.<br>
<br>
The scouts have managed to maneuver the battle into a small box canyon, narrowing their front to a manageable size. Eias is keeping the number of Iksar's on the line low by using his power of fear to make them flee. A shaman stands back from its warriors, enhancing them and healing them as needed. Eias has been siphoning away the life force of the Iksar warriors and using it as vital healing energy, keeping alive the scouts that are holding the line.<br>
<br>
A dilemma confronts Eias. The shaman leading the warriors will eventually wear down, but how long will that take? As long as it keeps healing the warriors, this fight will go on for a while. Sending his skeletal companion after the shaman will leave Eias and Na'Tiel vulnerable, as the skeleton is picking off Iksar that break through the lines. If he focuses his magic on the Iksar, the scouts will be cut down quickly. The dilemma is made more pressing by the appearance of another column of Iksar warriors and their shaman captain.<br>
<br>
The second shaman decides to up the price, it attacks Eias directly, letting the first shaman continue as healer. Focusing, it lets loose a spirit strike, impacting hard on Eias still skeletal frame. The companion charges, and is intercepted by a force of warriors.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is bad,&quot; Eias thinks to himself. Turning to Na`Tiel, he tells her, &quot;if that line falls, I want you to port out of here like you did before. I will hold them as long as I can.&quot; She agrees.<br>
<br>
The shaman again focuses for a spirit strike. A swift blow to the back of the head interrupts its casting. The marines have arrived! Captain Rottgrime engages the shaman, quickly cutting it down. Spreading out, the marines quickly disperse the Iksar.<br>
<br>
Eias relaxes, allowing his flesh to return. Severely weakened, his skin is pale. Most of the scouts have small bits of his life force in them; his ability to heal exacts a severe price from him, made even more severe by his channeling of his own life force to reinforce his magic. He will recover though.<br>
<br>
Braxen stumbles toward a small tower by a stream. He is exhausted and beaten and there are still Kromrif pursuing him. He only knew the general path to Thurgadin, but his guide is now dead. As he comes to the tower, two dwarves approach. Here he hoped was help.<br>
<br>
He stumbles and lands on his knees. The sound of heavy footsteps can be heard coming from behind him. One of the dwarves signals some others upstream a ways, and a band of nearly a dozen warriors and crossbowman rush over, taking up a line. Braxen stumbles through, handing the note to the guard. &quot;I must get this to the Dain,&quot; he states.<br>
<br>
Examining the letter, the guard confirms its legitimacy. &quot;As you shall,&quot; he replies.<br>
<br>
Eias returns to the overlook where they kept watch on the mine. Teir`Dal marines have surrounded the entrance and knights from the Dead have entered. One by one freed slaves emerge, some seeing the sun for the first time in a near eternity. A few spot Eias on the ledge and wave with recognition, his former companions in battle were freed.<br>
<br>
Stepping away from the ledge, he sees Na`Tiel warmly embracing someone. The vision had been correct, Na`Vaar is alive. The scouts bring Vaxn's mask to the sisters, who recognize it. Eias comes over to them as they explain how he died, the sisters weeping softly at the news.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guardian,&quot; shouts a familiar voice from the distance. Til`Vahn has joined them on the ledge followed closely by Varum. Eias greets the dragoon warmly. &quot;We have avenged them,&quot; he notes, happily thanking Eias for the help.<br>
<br>
&quot;My task here is complete then,&quot; Eias states. &quot;There is one last thing, though.&quot; Removing the Rune of the Guardian, he asks Na`Tiel who should take it now.<br>
<br>
Varum speaks up on that note. &quot;You do not have to return it,&quot; he states. &quot;Once given, it can be permanent. There are privileges given to Guardians. For that matter, she was practically yours in ways you were probably not told about. Given away, even after the task is done, transfers no privileges.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It would have not mattered,&quot; Eias replies. &quot;I have other issues that would complicate this if I kept it. Where I go next I cannot take her.&quot; Again, he asks Na`Tiel who to give the rune to.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot talk you into keeping it,&quot; she asks. Upon him saying no, she requests it be given to Til`Vahn.<br>
<br>
Handing it to her, he tells her to place it on his neck. Ranting through an abbreviated and humorous version of the speech he was given when he received it, he tells him to return it to it's keeper in Neriak.<br>
<br>
As he prepares to leave, Na`Tiel takes him in a farewell embrace. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she whispers so only he can hear, &quot;when you come back to Neriak, I can tell you about the privileges you still have.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling softly as she releases the embrace, he steps away. With a gentle wave to all, he fades from their sight.<br>
<br>
Healers attend to Braxen as he is prepared to be taken to the Dain. One of the healers questions him about the massive bruise on his back. &quot;What hit you,&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apologies,&quot; he replies, dark saddened undertones to his voice, &quot;I did not ask her name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slightly confused, the healer can see Braxen wishes not to discuss it, and resumes his work. Cleaned up to Coldain standards, he is briefed on the proper way to address the Dain. He is then escorted to the Dain's castle, the mighty Icewell Keep. A great crowd has gathered in the main hall for the daily audience of the beloved ruler of the Coldain.<br>
<br>
In the great hall, much pomp and ceremony conclude with the announcement of the arrival of Dain Frostreaver IV. After some usual addresses by the Chancellor and other advisors, Braxen is presented, and the letter given. The Dain's spirits sink slightly as he reads it. &quot;It is a dark day all,&quot; laments the Dain, &quot;our forces in the Eastern Waste have been overrun.&quot; The mood of the assembly darkens.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Braxen states, &quot;I can humbly offer some insights as to why.&quot;<br>
<br>
Curious, the Dane asks Braxen to continue.<br>
<br>
Drawing himself to his full height, he begins by explaining that his trip to Velious was done with the purpose of seeing the Dain, and how fortune had smiled upon him, circumstances bringing him right where he intended to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come to warn you about a culture of liars and evil - doers,&quot; he continues. &quot;Recently, a friend of mine was murdered by one of them. My people refer to them as the Heretics. They spread fear wherever they go. They conjure up the undead and drain the life out of all they touch.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How is it that this could have caused our defeat today,&quot; interrupts the Dain, not wanting a long speech by Braxen to upstage him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because you people have allied yourself with one of them, the murder of my friend,&quot; he replies. &quot;Eias Rham is an evil murderer, yet I hear that some of your people consider him a close ally.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We seek the aid of many people,&quot; notes the Dain. &quot;Brell gives us no restrictions on who to trust and who to not trust. They are all given fair chance to prove themselves. Eias did just that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Allying yourselves with this Heretic,&quot; he warns, &quot;may in the long run turn the other gods against Brell. Maybe this is the first sign of such a thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pondering a moment, the Dain responds, &quot;your heart may be in the right place on this one, Outlander. We will take this under advisement.&quot; Dismissing Braxen, the Dain departs to his chambers.<br>
<br>
Turning to the Dain's Chancellor, Braxen inquires, &quot;I have comrades lying in the Waste. Would it be possible for me to have a guide show me to where they fell.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Chancellor ponders a moment. &quot;Likely,&quot; he notes, &quot;the bodies are buried in deep snow by now or carried off by wolves. We have no soldiers to spare for such a task, nor would it be likely possible to find them easily anyway.&quot; He begins to walk away, then stops, as if a point of irony suddenly occurs to him. &quot;It sounds,&quot; he continues, &quot;like you need the services of a Necromancer.&quot; Laughing lightly to himself, he retires to his chambers.<br>
<br>
Strolling out of Icewell back into the city, he passes through the connecting tunnel. A voice from nowhere asks, &quot;Do you have any message I should relay to Palatos, Braxen?&quot; Stopping cold, he looks around slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he replies, &quot;but I wish to see the face of the messenger first.&quot;<br>
<br>
A black cloaked Erudite steps out from a shadow. Throwing back the cloak, he reveals the crystalline green robe beneath. Braxen could hardly believe his eyes. The object of his long chase was now standing before him! &quot;Eias,&quot; he shouts from between clenched teeth, &quot;you have a lot of nerve pulling this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to end this,&quot; Eias announces, &quot;I do not want to have to kill you to do it though. Give me a message to give to Palatos that will tell him to stand down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What makes you think Palatos is involved,&quot; Braxen inquires, probing more than anything.<br>
<br>
Noting the question as leading, he evades. &quot;It matters not how I know,&quot; rebuffs Eias, &quot;only that without a word from you now, he may not get a chance to carry out your orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
Circling each other like two boxers ready to pounce, they size each other up. Neither had actually met the other before, so they were both curious as to what made the other what they are.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me the word, Braxen,&quot; Eias continued, &quot;we end this now and no one has to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wrong,&quot; shouted Braxen, &quot;you killed my friend. You murdered an agent of the Law. You murdered a Knight of Truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He took the law into his own hands,&quot; Eias replies, &quot;and in his own fine method I avenged the one he killed. I did nothing different than he.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You had no right,&quot; Braxen screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You who brand us outlaw upon birth speak of rights,&quot; Eias inquires. &quot;Do not speak of rights when the only rights you yourself respect are those taken by force.&quot;<br>
<br>
Braxen has had enough. &quot;Eias Rham, I condemn you to death! You who spread lies and cause fear. You preach heresy, you live heresy, and you murder those that bring justice!&quot; He draws his sword and charges Eias, who fades away as the blade passes through where he stood.<br>
<br>
Looking about, he realizes Eias is gone. Screaming out of frustration, he shouts, &quot;I shall hunt you down, Heretic! I promise this! Edwin shall be avenged!&quot; The weight of recent events suddenly hits him. Edwin, Jorn, Brauen, the woman in the waste and the young dwarf, neither of whom he has a name for; they are all dead. He should have been able to save them all, but they now sit on his soul like black failures. &quot;I shall avenge them all,&quot; he vows.<br>
<br>
Stacks of wood line the seashore, each holding the body of a fallen Teir`Dal. One by one a torch is passed down the line, and each fire is lit. Na`Tiel and Na`Vaar, wearing her own ebon mask in tribute, stand over the body of their fallen cousin. The torch reaches their pile and is handed to Na`Vaar.<br>
<br>
Turning to her sister, she holds the torch out to her. Na`Tiel reaches into the flame, taking some of it and allowing it to envelope her hand. Some at first think she is on fire, but quickly realize she is controlling the flame. Stretching forth her hand, the fire leaps onto the wood, quickly spreading through the pyre.<br>
<br>
The speed of the conflagration gets the attention of everyone on the beach. Astonished that she would change the tradition of the burning so flagrantly, they quickly accept it, knowing she did it to honor her fallen cousin. Na`Vaar passes the torch down the line.<br>
<br>
All the fires are lit. Each at the procession now holds a chalice of sacred wine. In unison, they drink a toast to vengeance.<br>
<br>
Sariah stands on a balcony overlooking the fountain walkway leading to the Temple of Marr. News that Palatos Kynarn's body had been found outside the walls disturbed her. She knew questions would now be raised that she did not wish answered. Braxen still had friends among the knights, and she now feared for her life and the life of her sister. Would they find out she passed information to Eias about Braxen's plan and Palatos's orders?<br>
<br>
&quot;Trouble,&quot; inquires a voice from behind. One of Sariah's old teachers, Malien, joins her. &quot;You look as if the weight of all of Norrath bears down upon you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You heard of the murder,&quot; she asks of Malien.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which one,&quot; Malien replies, blunt humor clearly in the response. &quot;This is Freeport, and in Lucan's zone murder is commonplace. I know which one you mean, though, Palatos Kynarn. He was trouble, and associating himself with Braxen only signed his death warrant. He should have known Eias, or for that matter the Plaguebringers, would come after him eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You knew of his plot with Braxen,&quot; Sariah inquires, clearly shocked.<br>
<br>
&quot;We all knew,&quot; Malien notes, &quot;there was only one of us, though, who could do anything about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Relieved, Sariah finally allows herself to smile. Turning to move back into the temple, they note a man standing in the doorway who was not there a moment earlier. Recognizing him, Sariah takes Eias in an embrace.<br>
<br>
&quot;Showing yourself here takes courage,&quot; Malien notes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had to come,&quot; he replies, &quot;I had to make sure she knew. I already saw Leirna and told her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She has nothing to fear here, Eias,&quot; the old teacher states. &quot;Although she may not be popular with the Knights of Truth at the moment, she has not dishonored herself, quite the contrary. A few of us in the order of Erollisi enjoy reminding our brother order that truth is subjective, and that simply because they do not like a particular version does not make it any less true. She, and her sister, will be safe, you have my word on that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Back on the hill in the western Commonlands where this adventure began, Eias sits and ponders how such a chance encounter changed so much, though the path ahead was just as hazardous as before and just as long. While the energy of the moment still allowed, he had viewed the paths of many close friends, noting with interest how Leirna's was cut short by Palatos's path, a situation he had corrected. Na`Tiel and Na`Vaar now enjoyed a long life ahead of them, their paths never straying far from one another. The calmness of the moments now relegating his vision of the paths to a fleeting dream, he focuses again on choices ahead.<br>
