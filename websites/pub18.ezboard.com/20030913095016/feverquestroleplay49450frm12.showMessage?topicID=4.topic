My father was a fletcher, he wasn’t the greatest on Faydwer…or even in the Faydarks, but he was better than most. I would watch him work diligently and methodically over his arrows long into the night after I had come home from my day of play. My mother was a very beautiful woman, and from what I know now was a woman of no small influence. She had long flowing auburn hair that she braided down her back, and piercing emerald green eyes that divulged her soul as she spoke. Though you wouldn’t have known it to look at our house…you could tell she was someone special by the movement of her body, by the way she held your gaze as she spoke. I think she was used to people doing what she told them…probably why she married my father…he never did what she told him, but he always did as she asked. How they met I know not, except my father was once a soldier and my mother was not originally from Faydwer. He met her abroad and brought her back with him to the Lesser Faydark. Now understand these were different times and the Lesser Faydark then was more beautiful and serene than anywhere else on Norrath. <br>
<br>
<br>
My childhood was happy, I remember playing war games with the other boys, building small fortifications in the trees and pelting each other with whatever we could find. I remember tormenting the majestic unicorns to no end, trying to catch them and ride them bareback. I remember my first love; we would lie together in the middle of the druid ring, while the faydrakes played around us. I will never forget her, my darling Yeasora. She was exactly like my mother in her temperament, and my mother adored her for that I think. She had onyx black hair and cobalt blue eyes that drew in everything in their innocence. She let her hair flow freely about her and I loved to let her hair pool over our bodies when we lie together. I had every intention of asking her to be my life mate. In fact I did ask her but I get a little ahead of myself. Like all things, these happy days came to an end. I wish I could say this part of the story was easy to tell…or maybe even listen to, but it’s not. Tears still well in my eyes to think of it, and the agony of loss still tear at my heart, even after all these years. <br>
<br>
<br>
Twilight had descended and Yeasora and I lay in our druid ring (as it was then…so it is today, that ring of stones belongs to Yeasora, myself, and the silent faydrakes who bore witness to our love), when the call had sounded from the village. Yeasora and I quickly made our way back to the village (only about an hours jog from the rings), we came running into the village proper to see a badly wounded dwarf paladin of Brell lying on the wooden platform. His blood stained everything…the wood, the hands of the druidess who tended him, his clothing. I had seen people bleed before…but not so much, I had never seen a persons insides spilling out before. I felt sick to stomach, and I am not ashamed, I had to turn away and vomit into the grass nearby. His wounds were many and thin…and with the exception of the garish slice in his belly most seemed only scratches. After I had retched and looked a little closer I saw black spots forming at his small wounds and realized he was also poisoned. I have no idea what had done this to him or how he even still drew breath. It turns out the stories about a dwarfs hardiness were not exaggerated. I hate to say it but I cannot remember his name, though as far as I know he lives to this day. As soon as he was able he began to tell of us of a tide of darkness that will sweep through the Faydark, he told us to be alert and to prepare. Needless to say this shocked the elves in the Lesser Faydark but I don’t think any took him seriously… except my father and mother. Perhaps it was some type of intuition. Perhaps it was because they were the only elves there who had been off of Faydwer…perhaps it’s because they wanted to defend their homes, and protect their son. To this day I can’t tell you why in the days to come my father did his best to prepare for this “tide of darkness” he passed as much knowledge as he could when I was around. I admit I didn’t take the dwarf seriously; I too was like the rest of my people and silently ridiculed my father and mother for their haste to take up arms against an unnamed foe. I regret no decisions in my life, but if I was made to change any one event in my history, that would be it. I don’t remember a lot of what my father tried to instill in me as far as battle and swordplay and things of that nature. But his code of honor that he passed to me was burned into my heart, mind, and soul. He followed no one set of rules but rather a fluid set of guidelines. He didn’t care what others thought of his actions so long as they fit into his set of morals. The right thing to him was as often wrong to general populace as it was right to them. He would tell me he cared not of what people thought what mattered is that he could he meet his own gaze in a reflection and that my mother would look him in the eye, Innorouk take everyone else who felt the need to enforce their sense of laws on him. <br>
<br>
<br>
About a week had passed since the dwarf had arrived bringing us news of ill tiding. I managed to escape my father’s clutches early to spend some time with Yeasora. On my way out of the village I heard the dwarf would be leaving the next day…after having taken only a week to recover from his mortal wounds. I found my love waiting for me at our ring…she was speaking with a young unicorn when I arrived. This was nothing new she often spoke with the different animals that dwelled in the area, what was surprising is that the unicorn didn’t run off after I approached (this was one of the many I had playfully tormented). The unicorn looked at me with sad violet eyes and introduced herself to me, and this I’ll never forget. She said, “Greetings young Tananthalas, he who will let the blood of evil, my name is Equestrielle and it is my pleasure that Tunare created this opportunity for us to talk”. I was stunned, I didn’t understand this reference to “let the blood of evil” and this was first unicorn that had ever done more than run away from me. Yeasora said something in a language I didn’t understand and Equestrielle bowed her head, looked me in the eyes once again and bolted away. After my initial shock I looked upon my beautiful Yeasora and saw her love for me in her eyes. We embraced with the intensity that youthful love brings and lay later with her hair pooling over my body, her lips still trailing her kisses over my hardened frame. The faydrakes still fluttered ever silent above and around us with one or two resting upon us for a minute before fluttering off again. It was in that moment that I asked Yeasora to be my companion for life. We were young I admit but I believed then as I believe now that she would enrich my life as long as I knew her, that we would constantly learn from and challenge each other. That we would love and be in love for all our days to come. I was surprised when she began to sob uncontrollably, even more so when she said yes in between racking sobs. My heart grew until it knew the bounds of eternity and we kissed tenderly for a long time. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quite a bit of time had passed when I realized twilight had come and gone and the clouds obscured every star in the sky, it was pitch black. We both became agitated that it was very late and our families were probably worried…I couldn’t wait to tell my father and mother the happy news. I hoped they would approve. I stood up and reached my hand down to my love and future wife, she held my eyes with her own and calmly placed her hand in mine. I pulled her up to next to me and kissed her again. Our faces separated and she leaned into me and told me “I love you Tananthalas”. When she finished saying that to me she leaned her head back a bit looked me again in the eyes, and twitched suddenly, her thick blood spilled out of her mouth and I watched in rapt horror as the light in her eyes faded and died. That moment then and now in remembrance lasted an eternity. She fell from my grasp and her now lifeless body slumped to the still warm earth where we had lain only moments before. With tears streaming down my face I noticed the dagger in her back, I looked up from my love’s body and saw a dark elf, his eyes met my own and I knew hate for the first time in my life. This was the first time I saw my one of my dark cousins, but I knew him for what he was form the stories I heard. He looked down at my beloved Yeasora’s body and spat on it, flashing me a smile when he met me gaze again. He showed no remorse at having shattered my life, and with a strength and speed I’d not know I possessed I pulled the dagger from my love’s back and etched a permanate smile on him, it went from ear to ear. His warm blood spilled over my hands and he fell away from me opposite where my love had fallen. I felt sick again…and lost I stared at Aesora’s body a long time, and I stared at her murderer’s corpse not far from it. It was then that I smelled fire…and quickly looked to the sky and despite the clouds and darkness I managed to make out that smoke rose from the same direction as my village. I feared in my heart for what I was to find. I quickly gathered up Yeasora’s body in my arms and started off in the direction of the village. As I walked off I heard a muffled sound behind me. I quickly spun around to see Equestrielle, standing in the ring of stones. Silver tears ran down her face and told me she was sorry. I didn’t say anything I merely motioned in the direction of the village and Equestrielle lowered herself and with Yeasora’s cold body still in my arms I mounted Equestrielle. I had ridden horses before and this wasn’t any different, I simply hung onto her with my legs and clutched my love’s body to my own. I bent my face down to smell the black hair I so loved and began crying into her hair as Equestrielle took off towards the village. <br>
