Anyway, add that mistake to the fact that at that exact moment, or soon after, Fear began respawning making CR darn hard.<br>
<br>
We regrouped, brought in some twinks, and began the VERY successful task of fighting our way to the corpses (mostly nekkid people).  We did very will until one mistake was made and a small train ensued (only about 6 mobs, but some hard casters, and a lot of people were nekkid).  Anyway, just as people were gating, running, FDing, and dying, the connection to Xegony was LOST.  That doesn't mean Xegony went down, it may have, I don't know.  After waiting for about 30 minutes, many of us called it a night.<br>
<br>
We need your help tonight.  Many of us have two or more corpses in there.  All of the corpses are between the "tree camp," and just south of the Fright tower (to the east of Scareling tower).  We could get a necro to summon the corpses, and that might be the best choice as many of the corpses are probably reaching the point where they will be unrezable and we'll end up losing a lot of experience.  I think we should:<br>
<br>
1) Petition for assistance since (at least) part of the reason we failed was connectivity issues<br>
2) Set up break groups<br>
3) Break fear and begin summoning corpses while we do<br>
<br>
This really needs to be done as quickly as possible as the timer to get a rez is expiring (if it already hasn't).<br>

We think the server totally crashed.  We were in the middle of a big fight as well.  Tons of corpses that we'll deal with today i suppose.   <br>
There was talk on our boards tho, if it did crash, we might break fear and clear demi's really fast.  Just talk atm.  If you all are already there, then i'll hold us off from thinking about it.   <br>
<br>
/bonk Readd.  Who decided to call me at 1:30am =P   Yeah Yeah, so i was still awake, but that's not the point =P<br>
<br>
If you'd want help from HALO, i might be able to talk a few into coming.  But then again, that's if you want help from us....<br>

Thanks for the offer of help Dels, we never have any problems breaking Fear though.  The rest of us should be prepared for the fact that either kids off for the summer, or GMT/Asian guilds may have already cleared though. (that is, if people were planning on staying, and if you do, you SHOULD take the Demi's out). <p><html>

<br>
I have already put the same call out to the Seekers of Lore and hope that we can mustard the force's need to brake back into fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
Last night I was told that the zone would be clear and would not spawn up till after a GM pop's it, by the time I was on( and talking with Dogg) a guide had told the both of us that the zone was already been poped.<br>
<br>
I will be on at around 7 pm EST to help get the people we need and to brake fear. <p>Hirosan<br>The last pissed off warrior in the world</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub18.ezboard.com/uolmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Olmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/8/01 8:39:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Call for Help from DoK and Friends</span><hr size=1> I think i managed to camp at the tree spot, in fear so i should be ready to help out with CR, but i really dont want to log in before raid start, so i will be on with a twink rdy to log on Olmer, as soon as break starts.

We should have enough East coasters to be able to break in and get the wanderers cleared.  Then, as people log in we can rez them in.  <br>
<br>
Note, the timer is short on some people, so it is recommended if you are in this boat to log onto the DoK chatroom though the link above and Temp will be giving the play by play.  This way you are not sitting naked in Ferrott and having the exp expire while we break. <p><html>

Sorry to hear the way it went down.  It most cases, yeah, it's repop'd, but the GM's are typically nice enough to drag all corpses to the safe tree.  <br>
Seems tho, HALO, is already up to something else, so Fear is out anyhow.  I also told them that you all are gonna rebreak/clear it.  You just need to watch from the asian guilds during the day.  HALO is very unactive during the day, as most of us are older and work.<br>
<br>
I know Readd was concerned about really really close to the 3 hour mark on corpses...do you have a clicker for the CR?  I'm not gonna beg to help, but i'm offering to help with Break/Rez's.  If you are starting this at 7:30 i would have about an hour that i "could" help before i'm needed elsewhere.  Let me know if you could use my help.<br>
<br>
BTW, Slyde, i replied to your post on our site.  I'll give it again here tho :)  Delsenora99@aol.com or PM(personal message) on the site.  <= Took 15 deaths, one unrez'd atm last night heh.<br>
<br>
PS: Col, i never said anywhere that you were unable to break it. Please don't put words in my mouth.  I was on several Fear Breaks back in the day with you all, i've seen the easiest and the roughest breaks, it's not a matter if you can or can't break.  I was concerned you didn't have enough "clothed" ppl to rebreak.  I simply stated, that if you didn't have the force, or if you needed CR..that HALO could break for you to make it easier. <p><html>

A. Colu didnt put any words in your mouth its just that you 2 have such hard feelings toward 1 another that whatever 1 of you say's sets off the other<br>
B. The call was for DoK and FRIEND's HALO or anyone in HALO is not my friend and I will never ask nor want any help for the likes of that guild. once agin thankyou for the Off and others feel free if you want and feel the need or lack confindence in your own people that you have to ask for help from this guild I for 1 will eat the death and let my corpses rot there before I ask for any help from HALO or any of its members .. this isnt our guild policy BTW just my own feelings on the matter <p><html>

If we REALLY needed help, Im sure we could muster up some guilds we get along with, such as BT, Havenlight, SOA, or Jade Dragon.<br>
<br>
Now, on the other hand.<br>
I WOULD take help from Dels, at any time, because I know she is a good person, and does go out of her way to try to help us out, but as far as Im concerned, Dels is the exception. <p><html>

This is an open forum, for all to read, remember.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I re-read the posts, and honestly can't read anything implying DoK couldn't break Fear (Del's) or that there were words being put in other people's mouths (Col).  I do think Rjak has it right in his first point - (A) that the relationship is a bit touchy, setting each other off, etc.<br>
<br>
But, on Rjak's note, I don't want to start a flame war here, and I apologize in advance for hurt feelings, but Rjak, your comment in point (B) is out of line and really isn't appropriate for this thread.  I know we were all up late last night, so it's probably just that we're all a bit edgy.  Also, I know that there is bad blood between some members of DoK &amp; Halo.  But the spitting venom like that at someone that was simply offering to help out isn't right, no matter what guild they are in.  A civil, polite &quot;No thank you, we can handle this within the guild&quot; is more than enough.  Dels offered to help with some reinforcements (based on the possibility we didn't have enough clothed members) and a clicker (really reduce CR time).  That is a very nice offer, but from this offer Dels (and Halo) gets bashed.<br>
<br>
With that said, I feel we should have more than enough people to break. (I am clothed, 56 Ench ready to go) and we have a clicker to help (Olmer).  So, thank you for the offer Dels, I think we've got this one covered.  I appreciate your offer to help us out.  And, as I said in the other thread, I hope you will continue to post in our open forum.<br>
<br>
EDIT: You guys are fast, or maybe I am slow.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyhoo, Eowen did post this in the open forum, not the allies portion of our board, so we need to keep that in mind.  It was done since we had non-allied people on our raid, I know, but remember where it was posted, and Dels is friends to some of us, and the post is entitled &quot;Call for help from DoK &amp; Friends&quot;  Yet another example of where we should make the call internally first then post on the open forum &lt;cough&gt; PoA and Wendaar not being able to go up on Day 2 &lt;cough&gt;<br>

Wendaar is right, some comments were out of line. For that I apologize. Dels, thank you very much for your offer, it was kind of you. I don't think Col was putting words in your mouth or that you meant to imply we can't break Fear. Let's all calm down and get out feet out of Xeg.net :)<br>

<br>
RJ:  You called for help, several DOK members called me personally on the phone and/or in tells.   I DO still have ALOT of friends in DOK, and would do anything possible to help them.  Some of ya, yea, i'd rather ya rot...but i am not that petty.  Also, why does me offering my help....or accepting my help...demonstrate a lack of condfidence in DoK? That i truely don't understand.  <br>
I think it's sad that you are so bitter, but i guess you are set in your ways, and i have given up on you.  We were once friends.  That is no more.  Sad that we grew up thru the 40-50 range and taught and learned from each other, and now misunderstandings and hot headed tempers now flare.<br>
<br>
Col: Thanks for the Kind...and Harsh words.  Why would you want help from anyone? Because you were in need.  I care alot about alot of you and would hate to see those ppl lose xp/game time/corpses/items.    You might hate the GUILD, but that truely doesn't mean all within in it are bad people.  Some ppl have a problem with you Col...but that doesn't mean they don't love the majority of DoK does it?  It's all relative.<br>
<br>
The reason i offered my help, is because several of DoK asked if i could.  I won't name names, but even tho a few of those can't stand HALO, they at least recognize me as their friend. <p><html>

<br>
My 2 best friends in the whole world are in that guild and they are WONDERFUL!  Like Temp did with Lil, when I needed a monitor, they BOUGHT ME ONE!  Not many friends do those things.  They have always come to my side.<br>
<br>
And, nothing I will say will make anyone like Halo, but dear lord, you sound like racists!  Don't judge someone because they have a tag on their head.  Not all DoK's are super nice and not all Halo's are super mean. <br>
