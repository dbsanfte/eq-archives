<br>
Last Wednesday I got a phone call from AT&T that they want to replace my cable modem.  My area was originally Mediaone - and AT&T took it over - but had to use their infrastructure which was different from their own - so I had an older model modem (the original tech who installed this explained this to me in May - so even though they didn't tell me this this time around I knew why).  So I schedule an appointment for last Friday morning for a tech to come and replace my modem.<br>
<br>
So last Friday a gentleman comes, removes my old modem - hooks up a new one; updates some software from a CD, changes some windows networking settings; makes a phone call to someone at ATT@Home.  He then tells me that it will take 15-30 minutes to configure itself and leaves.<br>
<br>
I decide that now owuld be a good time to go run some errands and get lunch and come home between 3-4 hours later.<br>
<br>
I get home to discover that my previously perfectly functioning setup (the prior modem worked fine 0 it wasn't be replaced due to malfunctioning of any type) is now completely non-functionable.<br>
<br>
So of course I call tech support and explain that I need another visit from a tech.  I ask what time today the guy can come back and I'm told that it's IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to come back today.  Arguing with a supervisor only gets me more and more angry (some one should teach these people that the two words "I'm Sorry" can go a long way to reducing people's anger - but apparantly "It's Impossible" are the only two words in their vocabulary).<br>
<br>
They tell me they can get me the earliest appointment slot next available on Tuesday between 8:00 and 11:00 AM (Monday being a holiday).<br>
<br>
So I go to bed early on Monday night to be able to get up at 8:00 AM (that's VERY early for those of us on musician's schedule).  At 11:45 AM the doorbell rings and I buzz the guy up.<br>
<br>
He arrives asking what he should do (I'm surprised expecting that they should know this before hand) - so I explain to this guy who has a VERY blank look on his face.<br>
<br>
As I finish - he explains he's a video tech; that they have a seperate department for the Internet - and he has no knowledge or equipment to replace my modem etc.<br>
<br>
So he calls in - and I explain the problem to his dispatcher and that I want someone to come that day.  His dispatcher tells me that there's a completely seperate dispatcher for the Internet - and she called the other dispatcher and they'll TRY to get someone over - but there's no other information available.<br>
<br>
So at 4:00 PM - surprise surprise - I hear nothing from them so I call my tech support line.  Of course - the tech has no log or any other sort of listing past problems (nice system these people have) - so I have to explain everything from the beginning.<br>
<br>
For the first time (including a talk with the supervisor the previous Friday) I feel I get someone who really cares and is making an effort to do anything other than trying to get me off the phone as quickly as poosible.  He spends a lot of time tweaking settings and all - but still can't get my connection to work (I still am under the theory that the new modem is bad).  And explains that I want someone first thing tomorrow.<br>
<br>
He starts to say - it's looking good - then there's a long pause - and he says he has to put me on hold.  After a while he comes back (AND SAY'S HE'S SORRRY!) but the earliest he can get a tech to me is Friday between 11:00am-2:00PM<br>
<br>
I ask him if he's made SURE that it's not another video tech - and he confesses that was the problem initially (when he thought he was getting me someone the next day)  that it popped in a video tech and he verified it was an Internet guy and why it was taking so long...<br>
<br>
So anyway - you won't see me until Friday afternoon at the earliest.  And since I have gigs Friday night - and two on Saturday - you probably won't see me until Sunday.<br>
<br>
I'm now paying $8/hour at a local Internet Cafe to even get to the boards - I'll try to keep up here if possible...<br>
<br>
Take care all! <p><html>

<br>
Also, glad to see you finally got ahold of someone that took the effort to help you out.  It always sucks when things don't work, and dealing with people that just want to finish the call is no fun.  Hopefully you're at least able to use your computer for other games - let me know if you come across any off-line games that are good - and practice that trombone! <p><html>

I am an engineer for a reseller of IBM, Compaq, Hp, Cisco and 3Com equipment. I am the main router person at the shop, and spend alot of my time dealing with phone companies, and ISP's trying to get them to get there s**t together. Of course, the problem is NEVER on either of thier ends. That is until I spend hours, days, or even weeks of going back and forth between the two before I finally get someone who eventually gets it escalated to someone who finally admits that the problem exists on thier equipment. <br>
<br>
Or, sometimes, you get the &quot;everything is fine here&quot;, then, after doing absolutley nothing, everything mysteriously starts working 10 mins later!  <br>
<br>
I just think they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for workers these days, and just can't get enough qualified individuals to fill the spots.  Hope you get it taken care of quickly, and we see you back on soon!<br>

<br>
I work for a large national CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) and the best way to get things escalted is to ask to speak with their Executive Escalations or Executive Relations group (Office of the COE) and file a complaint with your state's PUC (public utilities commission). <br>
<br>
ISP and Phone companies have to respond very quickly to PUC complaints as the telecommunications industry is very regulated.<br>
<br>
Might help in escalating issues...<br>

(Sorry again).  But it is an issue close to home, as my dad's TV cable and Cable modem were both AT&T.  They caused many disconnects on his cable (which he needs since he works at home) and his cable TV went out ALL THE TIME.  They give minimal tech support, and care little for customers..just their money.<br>
My dad is now in support of boycotting AT&T, and mailed the BBB as well.  He now runs a DSL line that NEVER GOES OUT and a satalite dish that NEVER GOES OUT.  And the tech service has been great as well.<br>
I myself run with different companies (sprint mostly) and have no cable.  Earthlink may not be a wonderful ISP, but the tech service people are kind and admit when they screwed up.<br>
I am also going to suggest a boycott of AT&T to everyone who can.<br>
BTW, I am sorry for those who work for AT&T or know someone who does that is kind, for I nor my father had the luck to deal with you during the tech crisis that occurred.<br>
Slyde- if you change companies I bet you will have a good chance that you will have better experiences. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER><TR ALIGN=CENTER><TD ALIGN=CENTER>_________________________________________________________________<BR><BR></TD></TR>

The problem is that the ILEC's fashioned a so-called "Telecommunications Act" that bsically gave them the power to screw anyone over (I'm sure Exec can tell you more).<br>
<br>
So the company that provided the network for my DSL was on the verge of bankrupcy (which recently did fold) so I jumped ship in May.  I was getting day-long to week-long otuages at least once a month - and constant packet-loss that made EQ unplayable.<br>
<br>
ATT Cable was working flawlessly for me until a guy came to replace a modem and didn't stay until he was sure it was working (it wasn't); and then a tech support system didn't properly differentiate the type of technician they sent.<br>
<br>
It seems for me here - is that the problem is the people not the technology.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll get someone who can fix it properly... <p><html>
