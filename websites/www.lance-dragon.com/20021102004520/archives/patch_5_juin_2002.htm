        ** Pet Changes ** <br>
        <br>
        With this patch we've made some rather sweeping changes to the way pets 
        work.<br>
        - Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures. Pets basically treat mesmerized 
        NPCs as if they were dead <br>
        - Pets are neutral to NPCs. Monsters will not attack pets first unless 
        the pet is being aggressive to something<br>
        - Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage 
        to that creature<br>
        - Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage 
        to that creature<br>
        - The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take 
        a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do. In most 
        situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will 
        not take experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience 
        if no PC does damage to the target. As long as a player does damage to 
        a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more experience than it 
        used to.<br>
        - Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command<br>
        - /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs<br>
        - Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician 
        Epic pets.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ** Miscellaneous **<br>
        <br>
        - Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with "damage shields: 
        OFF" to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back 
        on<br>
        - Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on 
        a horse if they went out of range<br>
        - Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, 
        even with See Invisible </font></font></font></td>
