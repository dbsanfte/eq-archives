        Update Coming Soon</b></font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Over the next couple of 
        weeks, we will be adding some new features to the Guild Website. The Guild 
        Bank and Library will be coming online as integrated parts of the site 
        rather than postings on the members section of the boards. We'll also 
        be adding sections to the roster for members to post trade skills info, 
        character biographies, and also screenshots they may wish to have associated 
        with their character(s) or in the screenshot archives. Finally, there 
        will be a number of small changes in terms of site navigation that should 
        make it easier for people to get around and find things. Special thanks 
        go out to Danadarr, our Guild Webmaster, who, in consultation with the 
        Guild Officers, is leading the charge on much of this initiative. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">At last night's officer 
        meeting we discussed and concluded that recruiting was an important priority 
        for the guild over the next month or so. While we are off to a tremendous 
        start, there are still level pockets within the guild that sometimes prevent 
        members from being able to </font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">find 
        a guild group. We find this unacceptable and intend to recruit across 
        all levels so that IO members can always find other guildmates for groups.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC"><b>While the officers are 
        leading the charge on this effort, members can help us by keeping their 
        eyes open for good candidates. </b>First and foremost, we want mature 
        individuals that are interested in actively participating in a guild family. 
        Direct potential recruits to the <a href="philosophy1.htm">Guild Philosophy</a> 
        page - if they don't like and agree with what is written there then we 
        aren't the right guild for them. Also have them look at the site generally 
        to get a feel for how we operate and what we are like. Finally, make sure 
        they are people that you feel would fit into our family and people that 
        you like to play with. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The best way to recruit 
        new members is to group with them. If you think you've found someone good 
        - send a tell to one of the officers and we'll be happy to help them take 
        the next steps towards joining our guild.</font></p>

        Banker, Librarian, and Event Coordinator Announced</b></font></b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">We also filled some guild 
        positions at last night's meeting. Dartan will be in charge of the Guild 
        Bank, Arkalen/Shadra will be responsible for the Guild Library, and Fryne 
        is our new Event Coordinator.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">If you have items or plat 
        you wish to donate to the bank, talk to Dartan. He will also be posting 
        a list of bank items on the boards in the near future. As guild banker, 
        Dart will also be spending time in EC checking out the auctions for good 
        deals or possible trades that will benefit the guild.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">If you have runes, words, 
        or pages, give them to Arkalen/Shadra. Arkalen/Shadra is maintaining the 
        library in Rivervale, but if you can't get there an officer can help get 
        your stuff over to the mules Shad created for the library. A catalog of 
        library items will be posted in the near future as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Finally, if you have suggestions 
        for special events or want to get more involved on that front, get in 
        touch with Fryne. Vertix will still be leading raids, but Fryne will be 
        coordinating all other non-raid events such as parties, recruiting events, 
        fairs, contests, quests, etc. There was also some discussion of adding 
        another event coordinator since this is a fairly large task so you may 
        see someone sharing these responsibilities with Fryne at some point. At 
        any rate, look for new threads in the Events Forum soon.</font></p>

        of interest to the Guild. This should give us a quick and easy way to 
        see what is happening on a given day and what things are upcoming for 
        the near future. We especially intend for the calendar to be used for 
        pick-up group scheduling which has been something of a problem in the 
        past. If you're planning on doing something specific on a given night 
        that you'd like other Inspired Order folk to join you doing, this is the 
        place to schedule it. Hopefully, if we use this feature correctly, we 
        can eliminate anyone ever looking for a group and feeling frustrated.</font></p>
