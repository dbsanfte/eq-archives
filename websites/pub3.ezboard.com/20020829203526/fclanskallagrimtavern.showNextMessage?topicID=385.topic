Saved<br><br>Before I share with you how to come to have a relationship with God, I want to let you know that you must REPENT.<br><br>What do you repent of?<br><br>Your sins. A sin is something that you have done bad or wrong, and everyone has done something bad or wrong. But it goes further than that, everyone is born into sin, so you must be re-born as a new person in Jesus.<br><br>Let's look what the dictionary has to say about &quot;sin&quot;: (1) : an offense against God, an action that is or is felt to be highly reprehensible, an often serious shortcoming : FAULT (2) : transgression of the law of God, vitiated state of human nature in which the self is estranged from God.<br><br>Let me give you the some Commandments that are from God.<br><br>Exd 20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. <br><br>Exd 20:13 Thou shalt not kill. <br><br>Exd 20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. <br><br>Exd 20:15 Thou shalt not steal. <br><br>Exd 20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. <br><br>Exd 20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.<br><br>If you do not know who Jesus is I'd like you to go to this site: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.why-jesus.com">Learn Who Jesus Is</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and if you know what a Christian Bible is then please read what is called the &quot;New Testament&quot; slowly and carefuly a few times or even more before you repent for your sins. The reason I say this is because you got to know why it is that you are accepting into your life and why you want Him in your life. If you do not have a Bible then go to this site: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/">The Bible Study</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and read starting from MATTHEW to REVELATION.<br><br>While learning who Jesus is, you must know why Jesus died on the cross for. He died on the cross for your sins, and he was raised on the third day from his death and then a couple of days later went to Heaven. If you read the Bible you will get a better explaintion on what Jesus did for you.<br><br>Now let's talk about what repent means. Repent is not a simple prayer like many unlearned and untrained Christians may tell you. Let's look at what the dictionary has to say about &quot;repent&quot;: (1) : to turn from sin and dedicate oneself to the amendment of one's life (2) : to feel regret or contrition b : to change one's mind transitive senses (3) : to cause to feel regret or contrition (4) : to feel sorrow, regret, or contrition for.<br><br>You must regret with all your heart the life style you have right now, you must regret with all your heart and mind that you have sinned against GOD ALMIGHTY which created everything.<br><br>Let's read some scripture from the Bible.<br><br>Jhn 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br><br>We can see from the scripture above that Jesus has come that whosoever will believe the Testimony of Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br>Jhn 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.<br><br>Right now you are a servant of sin, you must become a servant of righteouness.<br><br>Jhn 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br><br>In the scripture above we see Jesus said that he came to save you from your sins.<br><br>Rom 3:23-26 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that everyone has sinned.<br><br>Rom 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br><br>Jesus is Christ, and Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day that we may have eternal life through his dead and burial and resurrection.<br><br>Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><br>Right now you are a sinner, and all sins accuse death, but throught Jesus Christ we get the gift of eternal life with God.<br><br>2Cr 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br><br>The him in the scripture above is Jesus.<br><br>Eph 2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins.<br><br>The he in the scripture above is Jesus.<br><br>Hbr 4:13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br><br>From the scripture above we see that God sees everything, you cannot lie to ALMIGHTY GOD who made everything in the Universe.<br><br>2Pe 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br><br>The Lord in the verse above is Jesus, and Jesus' promise is eternal life to those who repent and receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>1Jo 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that Jesus is our light and through his blood we have redemption.<br><br>1Jo 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that everyone has sinned and if we say we have no sin we are now liars.<br><br>1Jo 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br><br>When you repent you must confess all the sins you remember and ask in the name of Jesus that God may forgive you for all the sins you do not remember.<br><br>1Jo 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<br><br>In the scripture above we read that if we say we have no sin then we make Jesus a liar and his word is not in us.<br><br>Question: Whom should I acknowledge?<br>Answer: Jesus the Only Begotten Son of the Father, Jesus the Holy One, Jesus the Lamb of God, Jesus the Perfect One, Jesus the sacrifice for our sins: = JESUS.<br><br>Mat 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<br><br>In the scripture aboce the me and my is Jesus talking.<br><br>Question: Who's name should I confess?<br>Answer: Jesus the Only Begotten Son of the Father, Jesus the Holy One, Jesus the Lamb of God, Jesus the Perfect One, Jesus the sacrifice for our sins: = JESUS.<br><br>Hbr 13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.<br><br>In the scripture above the him is Jesus.<br><br>Question: What should I acknowledge?<br>Answer: Your Sins.<br><br>Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.<br><br>Question: What should I believe?<br>Answer: The Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus.<br><br>Rom 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that it is important to believe that God raised Jesus from the dead that you may be saved by confessing Jesus Christ as your Saviour.<br><br>Question: What must I do that Jesus said?<br>Answer: You must be born again.<br><br>Jhn 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be BORN (Baptized) of WATER and of THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <br><br>In the scripture below I will show you why Born means Baptized.<br><br>He that BELIEVETH and is BAPTIZED shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE; In my name Shall they cast out devils; They shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that Jesus says you shall speak with new tongues which is evidence that you have been baptized with the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Question: Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit so I can be saved (born again)?<br>Answer: Lord Jesus Christ does.<br><br>Jhn 20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.<br><br>In the scripture above we see that Jesus baptizes those who repent and really mean it with the Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost is just another name for the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Question: Can I ask to receive the Holy Spirit and is praying really asking?<br>Answer: Yes you can ask for the Holy Spirit, and yes praying is asking.<br><br>Luk 11:13 ..how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<br><br>In the scripture above, your heavenly Father is God, and you must ask in the Name of Jesus which is the name above all names.<br><br>Question: What must I do now that I visit the links you gave me and read from MATTHEW to REVELATION and everything on this page?<br>Answer: You must regret the life you are living right now, you must want a relationship with God, you must repent as really mean it from your heart, you must be willing to stop being around bad people and doing bad thing, you must ask the Father in Jesus' Name to forgive you for all your sins and the sins you have done you do not remember doing, you must then ask your Heavenly Father (God) in then Name of Jesus that you may receive the Holy Spirit that you may be comforted and guided by the Holy Spirit into all righteousness.<br><br>THE CONFESSION OF FAITH:<br>I CONFESS that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.<br>I ACCEPT His testimony and BELIEVE that Jesus died for the sins of the world and rose again from the dead.<br>I REPENT. I have walked contrary to God, and ask for forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ.<br>I AGREE to receive His Seal and embrace His commandments.<br>I DESIRE to know the living and true God.<br>Give me your life, O God, bless me with the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Question: I just repented and received the Holy Spirit with evidence of praying in new tongues, what else must I do and know?<br>Answer: You will receive the 'WITNESS' of the Holy Spirit which is &quot;Tongues of the Holy Spirit&quot;, I will give you a few things you must do below.<br><br>Mat 6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br><br>Jhn 14:13-15 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br><br>In the scripture above we see Jesus say that if you ask anything in His Name then Jesus will do it unless it is something that you are NOT suppose to have, and we see that Jesus says to keep His Commandments. I will give you some of His Commandments and the others you can find in the Bible. I would like you to get a King James Version Bible and if you cannot understand old English then get the New King James Version.<br><br>Here are listed just a few of the commandments: <br>II Cor.13:11, &quot;Be perfect, be of one mind, live in peace.&quot; <br>Heb.3:12, &quot;Exhort one another daily.&quot; <br>I Cor.14:39, &quot;Forbid not to speak in tongues.&quot; <br>II Tim.2:15, &quot;Study to show yourself approved unto God.&quot; <br>Jude 17 &quot;Remember the words which were spoken before of the apostles.&quot; <br>I Tim.1:4, &quot;Neither give heed to fables.&quot; <br>II Cor.6:1, &quot;Receive not the grace of God in vain.&quot;<br>II Pet.3:18, &quot;But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord.&quot; <br>I Thes.5:14-22, &quot;Quench not the Spirit, despise not prophesyings.&quot;<br><br>2Ti 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br><br>In the scripture above it states that you need to study the Bible.<br><br>Question: What if I get tempted to do something wrong?<br>Answer: Pray in your mind to the Father in the name of Jesus and ask for help.<br><br>Jam 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br><br>In the scripture above we see it states to resist the devil which is the tempter that will say all kinds of thoughs into your mind. <p><center> Jhn 8:32 And Ye Shall Know The Truth, And The Truth Shall Make You Free. </center> <center> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bthewatchmanarea888>Click To Visit Salvation Is Preached</a> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/usilvius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/8/02 5:27:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub3.ezboard.com/fclanskallagrimtavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: » SAVED? «</span><hr size=1> go...@#%$...yourself... keke thx la~ ^_^ <p>Silvius Wayfarer<br>60th Sorcerer of Drinal<br>< Cats in Hats ><br><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=249725">My Stuff </A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ucuthulas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cuthulas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/8/02 7:11:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub3.ezboard.com/fclanskallagrimtavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: » SAVED? «</span><hr size=1> Ya think anyone actually read that?
