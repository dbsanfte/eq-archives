It can only be reached through a wizard gate spell (using a very expensive component).  You then need to purchase keys to travel from island to island.  Thus, gettin around here is not cheap.   It is basically a combination of the Temple of Solusek Ro and the Planes of Hate and Fear in conception.  One part of the zone is devoted to quests.  The quests are all class specific and result in some very nice items.  The rest of the zone contains various high level monsters.  It seems that most if not all of the items you need to complete that quests are found in the plane.  Follow the quest link above for the quest descriptions. <br>
Faerie Island - Starting island. Kill Faeries - Drop a Tessera, 3 swords, 3 Rabbits Feet each. Kill all the Faeries to get the swords and feet and then kill the princess to spawn Sirran the Lunatic. Hand swords and feet to Sirran the Lunatic for Key of Swords and Key of  the Misplaced. Talking to Sirran other than hailing is a bad idea. Nothing on this island is aggro., everything but the key masters assists. No AE on this island the quest hall is below you, the efreeti will come to beat you down.  From here you can use the Key of Swords to go to Noble Dojorn (Island 2) or Azaracks (Island 3) <br>
<br>
Noble Dojorn Island - On this island are Noble Dojorn and 2 Bladestorms. The bladestorms will assist dojorn, none are aggro. The bladestorms if pulled off <br>
the island will move to isle 4 and stay there (via someone aggroing them then jumping off the island). Dojorn will always return home. Kill Dojorn and loot. You must have the key of the misplaced from isle one to leave this island. Behind Dojorn's windmill is a port to Azarack island, use Key of the misplaced to activate. Note: Killing Dojorn spawns the Overseer of Air on island 5. <br>
<br>
Azarack Island - 9 Azaracks, all aggro, 1 is the PH for the Protector of Sky. Azaracks drop multiple key pieces and quest items. The doesn't mes easily are <br>
tough to kill. One the protector spawns he will despawn in 80 minutes. You must dispatch the protector to spawn Sirran. Hand him the key pieces grants <br>
you keys to Gorgalosk isle. <br>
<br>
Gorgalosk Isle - Ton of mobs, non-aggro, all except shimmering meteors assist. Most of them drop key pieces and quest pieces. Killing Gorgalosk spawns Sirran, hand key pieces to receive keys for Pegasus isle. <br>
<br>
Pegasus Isle - 3 Pegasii, 3 Griffons, non aggro, assist. Also the Overseer of Air if you killed Dojorn (not sure how long overseer stays up). Killing the <br>
Overseer spawns the Hand of Veeshan. Each Peg/Grif will split into 2 when killed, each split will respawn once (so each is 5 mobs total). The original <br>
pre-split mobs drop key pieces. 1 Griff and 1 Peg are placeholders for the Collector of Souls. All splits and collectors despawn in 80 minutes, all splits, the collector and the overseer are aggro. To spawn Sirran, kill a collector, turn in key pieces for next keys. These CAN be pulled to Gorgalosk island (via monk with safe fall or aggroing one and reviving puller). <br>
<br>
Spiroc Island - 11 Spirocs (small aggro) 3 vanquishers, 6 various, 1 Guardian, 1 Lord. Small aggro, do not see invis, will often walk over you without aggroing. The spirocs are in groups of 3, one vanquisher and 2 other related. Until the appropriate vanquisher is killed, his 2 assigned compatriots will respawn instantly (at home point, not slaying point) when killed. Only vanquishers drop quest pieces. This does however make spiroc quest pieces somewhat more common and farmable. Until the e triads are down the guardian will constantly respawn as well. To defeat this island kill a vanquisher and it's 2 guards. Do this for all 3 sets, then kill the guardian then the Lord. Killing the lord spawns Sirran and allows you to get keys to Bzzazzt island. <br>
<br>
Bzzazzt Island - This place is a nightmare. Before leaving Spiroc island INVIS. These creatures have huge aggro, but do not see invis. Invis, use your key to get up then quickly run behind the large gear near the portal off this rock. From behind there are 3 Bzzazzts. The Left Bzzazzt (from behind) splits like a pegasus 1/2/2, these are very rough. We had chanters sleep the other 2 while took this set out. Dictate here is very powerful, only way to charm the splits and a charmed split will make short work of it's friend. All splits despawn in 80 minutes. The Right Bzzazzt splits 1/3, tough fight. Leave the center bzzazzt for last. If your goal is JUST advancement, kill the left and right bzzazzts and loot key pieces. Wait 80 minutes and do CR, leaving the center Bzzazzt alone for you to kill. The Center Bzzazzt when kills spawns another bzzazzt, then a bixie , then a bixie boss. Each of these is on an 80 minute timer from when it spawns. the final Bzzazzt spawns Sirran. Sirran on this island slightly different. you need to give him a phrase (I don't know it yet) to spawn the Sister of the Spire on Drake isle. You can proceed to drake isle without spawning the Sister but you will not proceed to butterdly/Veeshan's Isle without spawning her. Hand in keys as normally (and hopefully) you have spawned the Sister. Bzzazzts CAN be pulled to spiroc isle, we managed to pull one of 3 and then the other 2 got bugged (ha ha) and split in a locationg we couldn't pull from) <br>
<br>
Drake Isle: No aggro mobs here, all assist but sphinxes. Kill everything for key pieces. Kill the Sister to spawn Sirran and get keys for the last isle. <br>
<br>
Butterfly Isle: Eye of Veeshan always up. Hand of Veeshan if you killed the overseer. <br>

That's really what it's like.  The only real differences are that the quests are all (we believe) to be completed in-zone and of course they are much, much, much harder than anything one sees in Norrath proper. Also, it's possible to see very nice item drops on the mobs without doing the quests at all, so if one likes he/she can treat the zone like Fear/Hate and simply kill stuff hoping for loot.  The items we've seen drop on Mith Marr so far are insanely nice.  Think of Runed Bolster Belts haste-belts off dragons, only with nice stats added like +5 str +5 agil +5 vs magic.  These are from the &quot;lower&quot; level mobs in Air too. When the most mundane mobs in a zone drop stuff that's better than dragon loot, it makes the mouth water as to what is available further up and in.  Only one person on our server has completed a quest so far (he happens to be my guild leader and good friend) but since the warrior quests are bugged he lost his items and the GM isn't going to be on to restore them until Tuesday so we can't tell what the Azure Ruby Ring's stats are yet. <br>
<br>
First things first: <br>
<br>
Air, like Hate, is reachable only via a Wizard group gate spell and it requires a &quot;Cloudy Stone of Veeshan&quot; as a reagent.  The stone is available only in Erudin to my knowledge and it costs around 250 plat. Unlike Fear or Hate, which are basically one contiguous area like other zones in Norrath, Air is a series of &quot;islands&quot;, most of modest size, floating in the sky.  Each island can sort of be thought of as its own &quot;mini zone&quot; in a way.  Most islands are either higher or lower than those around them.  You can (with levitate on) always get to lower islands by running over the edge and sinking down to them, but to get to higher islands you need keys and you need to use them on the right teleporters. <br>
<br>
The first island you reach upon gating in is filled with eight fairies called Thunder Spirits, and these are ringed around the edges spaced equally apart.  They are exactly level 50 and will con indifferent to all players.   In the center of the island is a named PC called the Thunder Spirit Princess, and she will con red to a 50 (meaning 53 minimum) but also indifferent.  The only other NPC in the island is a dwarf named The Keymaster.   On opposite ends of the island are two pads set into the ground.  Clicking on the reveals the message &quot;It's locked and you're not holding the key&quot;.   If you click on the Keymaster you will see he sells three items:  a Key of Swords for about 450 plat, another key (forget the name but it looks like a Minotaur Horn) for 200ish, and a coffin (for Necro summon corpse spell) for 140 or so. The Sword Key will take you to island 2 higher up.  The other key (Key of Winds maybe?) will take you to Azarack Island even further in.  There is another way to get keys, however.  Each Thunder Spirit drops three rabbits' feet and three tiny swords upon being killed.  To use them, you have to first kill the Princess to get another NPC to spawn in her spot.  (This theme of killing one NPC to force the spawn of another is common in Air it seems).  It's a good idea to start with the princess anyway because she will assist the Thunder Spirits when they are attacked.  Once the princess is dead, a little halfling will spawn and he will respond to /hails.  Keep /hailing him or he will disappear.  If you give him the rabbits feet and tiny swords (one at a time), he will return one of each key the dwarf sells.  Since each Spirit drops parts for three of each key, and since there are eight Spirits in all, a group of 24 can all gain 2 keys from this island.  There are NO faction hits at all for killing Thunder Spirits or the Princess, so you will not be KOS if you do this.   In fact, this process seems to be intended by Verant in order to advance in the zone, because items for the quests drop on the Thunder Spirits as well - usually &quot;tesseras&quot;, various types of which are required by almost every class.  Another  bit worth knowing about this first island is that it contains the hidden cave with the efreetis who dole out the quests.  To see it, use 3rd person view while on the island and look around.  You will find it.  Once inside, you can talk to the NPCs until you find the one who gives your quests.  One caveat, though.  Once in the cave, you cannot get back to the first island. You must zone out and re-gate. <br>
<br>
Speaking of zoning out.  Air can be safely exited simply by running off the edge of any of the islands and falling back to earth.  You will zone, then reappear in the OOT just outside the East Freeport docks no worse for wear.  You do not die from falling.   However, any keys in your possession WILL disappear when you zone/log/go LD.   The Thunder Spirits seem to respawn every eight hours or so.  If you lose your keys and they are not spawned, you have to bite the bullet and buy new ones from the dwarf (ouch).   To use the keys, hold them in your hand (on the cursor) and left click on the teleporter.  You will instantly appear on the  destination island.  Before going onto them, though, some other things about island one.   First, you cannot bind there, though you may camp anywhere in the zone.  Second, when fighting the mobs there, do NOT use any AE spells, or you will aggro the efreetis in the cave and they will kill you before you can blink.  This includes any AEs that will aggro mobs in normal zones, including AE stuns.   Third, and this goes for the zone in general, summoning spells for casters are tricky in Air.  The only pets mages can summon are Air pets (makes sense), and these appear not as white elementals, but as little female Efreetis with annoying laughs (think of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark in genie gear). Necro pets seem to be heavily nerfed in this zone.  Some say their level 49 pet spell summons a level 1 pet (unconfirmed though they are weak). Enchanter and Shaman pets conjure as normal. Using the Key of Swords on the correct teleporter will take you to Island 2, also called Noble Island or Windmill Island.  This is a tiny one that contains simply a large, vaguely sinister-looking windmill, and three NPCs.   The main mob is a large Efreeti called Noble Djorn who cons red and indifferent.  He will respond to /hails with greetings and an invitation to remain on his island to keep him company now that his &quot;relatives&quot; are gone.  The other two NPCs are called &quot;Bladestorms&quot; and resemble the rare Blade Dervish from unrest.  They are basically a whirling circle of swords and they also con red indifferent (to a level 50).  These circle the windmill in a repeatable pattern.   If the Noble is attacked, both bladestorms will aggro and vice versa.  All three mobs are linked.  Djorn carries a mace in his left hand and an intriguing bag in his right.   He is usually pulled to the next island over where there is room to fight, but let me mention now that he is tougher than any mob outside of the Gods in Fear and Hate, and maybe tougher than them (though he has been brought down already).  He hits for over 300 and will triple attack for 1000+ in one round.  He is impervious to player spells.  The nastiest thing about him, though, is a wickedly deadly AE spell that will take 1000+ HP off in one shot.   The bladestorms are easier kills if they can be pulled solo and are doable by a group of 24.   The other interesting thing about island 2 is that the windmill can be stopped and started by clicking on the shaft inside.  Whether this is for &quot;show&quot; or part of a puzzle is unknown. <br>
<br>
There are no teleports on Noble Island.  Directly across from it, though, is a larger island with a temple on it and multiple mobs.  This island is slightly lower and can be reached with levitate and SOW (or jboots) by running and floating down to it (though it's a close thing -make sure you keep looking up and running the whole way).  This is the next island most groups clear.   It has four main types of mobs.  The first look like harpies.  The second look like air elementals.  The third look like evil eyes.   The fourth look like giant red willowisps. All are 53+ and indifferent, so this island can be explored in safetylike the first two.  Inside the temple are three &quot;named&quot; mobs and these are much tougher than the roamers.  In the left front corner is an &quot;avenging gazer&quot; (evil eye type), a &quot;heart harpie&quot; in the middle and &quot;Gorgalask&quot; in the right front corner.  Gorgalask will respond to /hails, but don't carry the conversation all the way or she will aggro on you.    The other feature of this island (called &quot;Gorg Island&quot; by most, or Island 3) is the teleporter near the edge in front of the temple.   Most groups camp near the teleport and pull and kill single roamers.  Of the &quot;harpy&quot; type roamers, there are two flavors.   First are &quot;spirited harpies&quot;, which are casters with pets.  Second are &quot;a gorgalask&quot; which seem to be melee only mobs.  These mobs are handled fairly easily by groups of 24, as are all roamers on this island.  They hit in the 200's but they are vulnerable to player DD spells and debuffs.   There are two types of air elementals - crystalline clouds and &quot;a gust of wind&quot;.  These are melee mobs as well (I believe - meaning I don't recall seeing them cast - but I could be wrong).   They are annoying in that like good air elementals they can invis themselves, making them impossible to target unless you have see invis up or use /assist on someone with it up.   Other than that they are no harder than the harpy-types.  The evil-eye types, called Watchful Guards, are enchanters and have pets and damage shields.  These cast a lot as well as hit for high damage.  Their magic resist seems a bit higher than the others, though they are vulnerable as well to PC spells.   Pulling singles is straightforward if you wait until they are somewhat isolated.  The aggro ranges in Air so far seem normal-sized, not ultra-huge like in the other two planes.  The only caveat to this is with the three mobs on the back ledge of the temple (North side). Pulling these can aggro the heart harpy through the back wall, which in turn aggros the other two temple mobs.  One very nice thing about the zone being non-KOS, however, is if a pull goes bad, you can let the puller die and rez him without the rest of the party being attacked.  In fact, your puller can aggro any mob and haul it back to the group and the mob will ignore the other players even if the puller dies.  This makes pulling in Air heaven compared to Fear or Hate.   The roamers drop quest items, rarely drop very nice class-specific loot, and always drop &quot;an animal figurine&quot;.  Have everyone loot one figurine if you plan to go higher up. <br>
<br>
In any event, once these mobs are cleared, you have the meteors (the wisps) hovering above the temple, and the temple mobs.   The wisps are special cases and so far we mainly leave them alone.  They are very magic resistant and therefore hard for caster-heavy groups to handle. They can be meleed to death with 10 tanks or so, but we have yet to see any loot of note on them other than research pages and minor quest items.   That leaves the temple mobs.  The Gorgalask queen can be pulled by aggroing the temple, pulling it to the group, and having the puller die or Feign.  Keep /hailing the Gorg and the other two will return to the temple.  Rez the puller if he/she died, and hack away.  Take note that the Gorg queen is a very tough fight.  She will resist practically all PC spells so it's melee-only for the most part.  She is doable with a very tank-heavy group of 24, but 30+ is safer.   It's necessary to take her down, though, if you want to get higher up, because she is analogous to the Princess on Island 1.  Killing her forces a second NPC to spawn in her spot, and this one will hand out keys when given the animal figurines.   These keys work on the teleporter in front of the temple.  As mentioned before, the Noble, if attempted, is usually fought on Gorg island since it has a big &quot;backyard&quot;.  He can be pulled analogously to the Gorg queen, by aggroing the whole island and /hailing him until the bladestorms go back (they most likely move into the temple, amusingly, rather than go back to Island 2).   When Djorn is killed, a nasty uber-mob called the Overseer of Air (or something like that) spawns in his place and he is aggro and reputed to have a DT like Cazic. <br>
<br>
The next island up from Gorg island is (I've heard) full of Pegasi that are tough fights.  The theme seems to be clear the boss of each teleport island to get the keys to the next, with the mobs getting tougher on each one.  I believe only a few servers at this point have even begun to fight on Island 4 so I know little of its secrets or loot. <br>
<br>
This leaves only the second door on Island 1.   When the mino-horn key is used on this teleport, the player is transported to an island full of very red, very aggro little fire imps called &quot;Azaracks&quot; who hit for 200.   This island is viewable (and I'm betting reachable via levitate) from Gorg Island.  It contains one door and presumably there is some way to get keys on that one as well, but to my knowledge no one has cleared it yet.  It is the only easily-reachable island in Air with aggro mobs on it. <br>
<br>
It should be noted that this zone has only been up for four days and that it likely has innumerable secrets to it that haven't even been hinted at yet.  As stated, POA is a giant puzzle in a sense, and my opinion is that we've barely begun to sort the pieces out, let alone put them together.   It's generally felt that the majority of the zone is geared toward higher-level players (level 55+ if not much higher) once the expansion comes out.   No one has even seen Veeshan yet let alone conned her, but it's been rumored by those who claim to know GMs that Veeshan is 75+  (whereas Nag/Vox/Cazic etc are 53-55 mobs).   Also, Verant has stated bluntly there is loot in this plane that makes gear from Fear/Hate look &quot;like rusty broadswords&quot;. <br>
<br>
The general reaction I've observed from most players in Air has been very favorable.  Most of us (including myself) will likely be camping there (literally) every night as we figure out more and more stuff. Since the early stages of the zone are not KOS, it's perfectly safe to log out on Gorg island and come back the next day ready to go again. Verant is to be applauded for making what looks to be a very very fun zone available to tide us over until Kunark in April <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

It can be raided, and there are drops, but there are also bunches of quest items that you can hand in on the quest island to get cool rewards. Which brings up an interesting point - Plane of Sky is divided into a series of 10 different islands floating in the air. You start out on the lowest island and progress from island to island until you eventually reach the top. The general pattern for each island is this: kill normal mundane mobs, collecting quest items until you spawn the island's Boss mob. Kill the boss mob to spawn a halfling named Sirran the Lunatic. Sirran will ask for a different item on each island (from that island) and in return will give you a key to proceed to the next island. Basically, if there is an item that every mob killed drops like 3 of, it's a key item, otherwise it is probably a class quest item. Most of the class quest items are no drop and should therefore be looted by the appropriate class, although some are not.<br>
<br>
Entry and exit - Entry to the plane occurs in 1 of 2 ways. Either you port up with a wizard using the Alter Plane: Sky spell, or you died and are rezzed. Alter Plane: Sky requires some sort of reagent that can only be purchased in Erudin Library and costs about 250pp each. It's not cheap, and if the raid group isnt on the first or second island it isn't really possible to pick people up midway through a raid, so a raider pretty much has to commit to coming for the entire time. Gate spells don't work is PoS so there is only one way out - down. Jumping off of any edge (provided that you dont hit another island and die) will cause you to fall out of the zone, whereupon you will find yourself swimming in the Freeport Harbor just in sight of the docks. Note that exiting the zone in any way - linkdeath, jumping, camping, whatever will cause you to lose all of your keys (though you can't go back to an island you have already passed anyway)<br>
<br>
Level - Like any Plane, PoS can only be entered by players who are above level 46. However, unlike PoF and PoH where most things are levels 48-51 with bosses being 53 or 55, PoS has mobs that are levels 50-57 or so, with bosses ranging all the way up to 63. Deaths will occur, and probably quite frequently. Due to the relative difficulty, it would be my reccomendation that only people 50+ attend raids here, with possibly an exception for clerics, since extra CH's never hurt anyone. Necromancers would probably be fine also, since fights will last a very long time and clerics and enchanters may be short on mana. For other classes though, the simple fact is that below 50 you will be doing very little damage, and due to the amount of lag caused by lots of people, raids will probably be limited to 30-36, none of whom can therefore be bumps on a log so to speak. To put it in perspective, island 1 contains faeries who are all level 50 with their princess being 53. Island 3 is Azaracks, all 53 including the boss. Island 4 has various mobs that are 53-56, with the boss being 61-62. Most things hit for low-mid 300's. Oh yeah and all bosses but the first 3 Deathtouch.<br>
<br>
The rest of this guide will detail each individual island in order, as they are numbered on the map provided with this guide. Note that all islands except #0 and #2 are in ascening order, both of linear progression and elevation. (in elevation, #2 and #0 are just barely above #4)<br>
<br>
Island 0 - Island 0 contains nothing. It cannot be reached via a teleporter from any other island, nor is there anything on it. It is simply the island which the point 0,0,0 resides upon, and is only used by Verant CS Representatives when they port into the zone (much like the &quot;cat rooms&quot; of many dungeons)<br>
<br>
Island 1 - This island is where you show up when you port into PoS. Note: DO NOT USE AE SPELLS OF ANY TYPE ON THIS ISLAND!! Doing so will hit the quest givers in the bottom section, and that is a very bad thing. Mezzes should be single target only, and charm works well too. This island contains a number of Thunder Spirits [faeries] that are not aggressive, though they will all help if you attack any of them. This island also contains the Keymaster, an NPC that sells this island's keys (as an alternatve to killing the Thunder Spirits for them) as well as Coffins for Summon Corpse. Eventually, after some killing the boss of this island will spawn, a princess. Killing the princess will spawn Sirran who you can then hand in key quest items to. (DO NOT SAY ANYTHING TO SIRRAN OTHER THAN HAILING! Sirran has been reported as hitting for up to 2050) After handing in key items (there are 2 keys for this island) you will end up with 2 keys that work in the 3 various teleporters on this island. One telepoter will bring you to a cave in the bottom of this island, which is where the npcs that give the class quests reside. Another teleporter goes to island 2, with the final teleporter going to island 3. Key quest items: Miniature Sword (or something like that) and Rabbit's Feet<br>
<br>
Island 2 - This is a rather small island containing a single windmill-like structure. If he is up, Noble Dojorn will be on this island, along with 2 guardian Blade Spirits. None are agro. Killing Noble Dojorn (no small task!) will spawn the Overseer of Air on island 5. The only way off of this island is by using the key from island 1 that you used to get here. Key quest item: None<br>
<br>
Island 3 - This island is inhabited by 9 Azaracks [imps] which ARE aggro. Mezz does not work very well here, though it is still possible to use it. The boss of this island is the Protector of Sky. Killing him will spawn Sirran, allowing you to hand in the key quest items from this island and proceed to island 4. Key quest item: Broken Mirror<br>
<br>
Island 4 - This island is inhabited by a slew of different stuff, most notably the gorgalasks [gorgons]. A large temple dominates the greater part of the island. There are also Gusts of Wind and Crystalline Clouds which are air elementals that will invis themselves. Nothing here is aggro, but everything will assist each other except shimmering meteors [red wisps]. This island's boss is Gorgalosk, who will spawn Sirran and allow you to turn in the items for the isle 5 keys. There are also 2 sub-bosses, a Heart Harpie and an Avenging Gazer. To avoid fighting all three at once, all 3 should be pulled out of the temple and run off far from the actual point of engagement. The puller then feigns or dies or whatever. Another person will hail Gorgalosk in place (she responds to hails and will stop moving) at which point the other two can be split and pulled. One last notable feature of this island (and the ones above) is that a haste belt for every melee/hybrid drops here. All have ac/stats, warrior, rogue, and monk belts are level 21 haste (same as FBSS), bard, paladin, shadowknight, and ranger belts are level 16 haste (1 less than Hangman's Noose, same as Swirlspine Belt). Key quest item: Animal Figurine<br>
<br>
Island 5 - This island contains another small windmill and is inhabited by 3 Pegasii (yes that is the plural of Pegasus, because I said so) and 3 Griffons. Whenever a Pegasus or Griffon is killed, it will split into 2 more, and when each of these splits is killed it will respawn once more. So for each 1 mob you see, there are really 5 (1/2/2). The boss of this island is the Collector of Souls, a named Pegasus who will spawn Sirran when killed. Also, if Noble Dojorn was killed, the Overseer of Air will be up on this island, near the windmill. If the Overseer is killed (good luck!) the Hand of Veeshan will spawn on island 9. Pegasii and Griffons are not aggro, however the Collector of Souls, Overseer of Air, and all splits ARE aggro. Note that it is also possible to pull things from this island down to island 4 by either: having a monk with good safe fall hop the gap between 4 and 5, or by having a person aggro a single spawn and then reviving their corpse back on 4. Handing items to Sirran here gains you keys to island 6. Key quest item: Bird Whistle<br>
<br>
Island 6 - This island is inhabited by spirocs, all of which are aggro but have low aggro radii. There are 10 total, 1 Lord, 1 Guardian, 3 Vanquishers, 6 various flavored. Each of the 3 roosts (noted on the map) is guarded by a single spiroc vanquisher, with 2 various-flavored guards. The vanquisher MUST be killed before his guards because if a guard dies and the vanquisher is still alive, the guard will respawn at its spawn point (not its death point though). After all 3 vanquishers and 6 guards are killed, the spiroc Guardian may be killed. Note that killing the Guardian before all of the vanquishers is dead will cause it to respawn, which can in some cases be an effective way to farm quest items. After the Guardian has been killed, the Spiroc Lord may be killed. Killing the Lord will spawn Sirran and allow you to turn in key items to get to island 7. Key quest item: Noisemaker<br>
<br>
Island 7 - Before porting up to this island, invis. After you get up here, immediately move behind the large rusted gear. On this island there are 3 Bzzazzts [wasps]. They are aggro, have a large aggro range, but do not see invis. The left Bzzazzt will need to be taken out first, so when it is pulled the other 2 will need to be mezzed. The Left Bzzazzt splits 1/2/2 like the Pegasii/Griffons on 5. Bzzazzts hit very hard, the best way to fight them being to have an enchanter cast Dictate (level 60 charm) on the second one, as it will make short work of its comrade. After the Left Bzzazzts are dead, the next target will be Right Bzzazzt. This one splits 1/3 and will be a very tough fight indeed. After finishing off Left and Right Bzzazzts, the center Bzzazzt will be fought. The center Bzzazzt spawns another Bzzazzt, which spawns a bixie, which finally spawns the boss of the island, a named bixie. Killing the named bixie spawns Sirran. Hand in the quest crap and get your keys. However, before moving on to island 8, someone should tell Sirran &quot;Am I the wall&quot; or &quot;I am the wall&quot; (can't determine which from people's enigmatic posts) but it needs to be spelled backwards. This will cause the Sister of the Spire to spawn on island 8. Key quest item: Dull Dragon Scale<br>
<br>
Island 8 - This island consists of a bunch of sphinxes and drakes, nothing is aggro on this island except the Sister of the Spire. There is a large temple on this island; the Sister spawns inside. Killing the Sister will either spawn the final Sirran who will provide you with keys for island 9, or you have to pull the Hand/Eye off of 9 from 8. Key quest item: Dunno, possibly none<br>
<br>
Island 9 - This island is another small one containing a single windmill. The Eye of Veeshan spawns here, as well as the Hand of Veeshan if the Overseer of Air was killed. This is the final island.<br>

CHECK HERE</span><hr size=1> <font color=red>List of known spells that behave erratically in PoS READ THIS! </font><br>
<br>
<br>
Levitate - Levitate does not function at all within PoS. <br>
<br>
Gates of All Types - No type of gate spells work in PoS. This includes gate, evacs, succors, etc. Probably Translocate as well. <br>
<br>
Bind - You cannot bind in PoS. <br>
<br>
Call of the Hero - CotH does not work in PoS. <br>
<br>
Eye of Zomm - supposedly works differently, though I don't know how. Possibly allows movement in 3 dimensions. <br>
<br>
Pet Summons - Mages may only summon air pets, which will appear as small Djinnis as opposed to their normal look. Necromancer pets are functional, but severely disempowered. It is rumored that they hit like a level 1, which is unlikely, but needless to say they are much less effective. Shaman and Enchanter pets function normally.<br>
