Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of the temple, third floor, between the two undead knights, one room away from Lord Seafire. The end result of the quest is not known, but it is thought to be a blunt sceptre type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle effects when held. This is the mother of all wizard quests.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Solomen'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study and scribe the history of magic in Norrath.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what history?'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been very generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history there is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. I have seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro become corrupted by their power.<br>
<br>
You say, 'what wizards?'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things right now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an envelope that I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in the wizard tower in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose knowledge rivals my own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I agree.'<br>
<br>
Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.<br>
<br>
==========================================================<br>
EPIC starting<br>
==========================================================<br>
Camin can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow the hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to everyone. Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will receive positive TrueSpirit faction. (Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed)<br>
<br>
Camin will now reply with -<br>
<br>
Camin says, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a wealth of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.<br>
<br>
Now hail Camin and he will respond with this -<br>
<br>
Camin says 'Go away! I have no time for you! <br>
<br>
If this happens, you can continue with the quest. (Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed). <br>
<br>
If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin: <br>
<br>
you say, 'What are you searching for?'<br>
Camin says 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.<br>
<br>
At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue. Some have even reported this as working while being apprehensive to him (confirmed you must do this part of the quest or the next part will result in &quot;I do not do business with your kind.&quot;). Doing this will make Camin reply with:<br>
<br>
Camin says, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. I know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking when they did this part of the quest. There are zero clues as to who or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every other class' quest is straightforward, but still has a very good degree of difficulty. None the less, there is a female NPC vendor in Halas named 'Dargon' that sells a potion called Ro's Breath. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction and charisma. (**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. See this page for Halas Guard and Vendor info**). There is also three other known vendors in the world that sell Ro's Breath -<br>
<br>
Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on the dock shops in Fironia Vie. <br>
Female Iksar shaman vendor, Klok Scaleroot in West Cabilis. <br>
Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the city of Thurgadin. <br>
You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge, and then take it to Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply with the following:<br>
<br>
Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.' <br>
<br>
Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of Lava charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>
Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the following message from Dargon: &quot;I didnt request this item, but thank you very much&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn into blue robe adorned, Arantir Karondor and reply with:<br>
<br>
Dargon says 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have worked very hard to mask my presence here.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Before I tell you anything, I require you to help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then return to me.'<br>
<br>
<br>
The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called Arantir's Ring. Identifying it reveals: &quot;Item Lore: My love has no bounds.&quot; Challice is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. NOTE: Keep in mind that Arantir will despawn in three minutes. So if you want to keep him there while you run to Felwithe, have a friend stay with Arantir and continue to talk to him until you return. It has also been noted that even trying to keep Arantir spawned by talking to him will not work for he will sometimes despawn regardless. If this happens, you must respawn him with another stripped Ro's Breath or wait for another wizard to do so. Hand Challice the ring and she will reply with:<br>
<br>
Challice says 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I was truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. But when he mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved him. Return this ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to see him again.' <br>
<br>
<br>
This new ring, when indentified reads: &quot;Item Lore: I never could love a man like you.&quot; Take this ring back to Arantir and hand it over (WARNING: You cannot hand the ring to Dargon if Arantir has despawned. You must hand it to Arantir. Arantir despawns about 3 minutes after speaking to him the first time so you must either be quick, wait for another wizard to make him spawn, or have a friend stay with Arantir and continue to speak to him - keeping him spawned). Then you must hail him to get his attention and go through the following dialogue:<br>
<br>
you say, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers. When I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my magic failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you wish to hear my story?' <br>
<br>
you say, 'I wish to hear your story.'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'I once was one of four true followers of Solusek Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a special item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a gnome, but I can't think of his name.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard and you could find a trace of Sylen.<br>
<br>
The 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in Kedge Keep - the Blue Crystal Staff. When this item is identified, the power of Solusek Ro radiates from within.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about Demunir Scry?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was more interested in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he immediately traveled to it, believing there to be powerful relics left undiscovered there. While exploring, he came upon a dwelling that housed a powerful warrior. Believing himself to be more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. While in battle with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left him helpless. It is said that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized trophy.<br>
<br>
The Demunir item is the Gnarled Staff found off of Venril Sathir from within Karnor's Castle.<br>
<br>
you say, 'What about the gnome?'<br>
if he doesn't reply, say the following..<br>
you say, 'Who is the gnome?'<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I know he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's craft was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' in jest. I do not know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to locate him. I hear he also stays close to water because of the explosion. You never know when another gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this letter to help motivate him to remember. <br>
<br>
<br>
The gnome is Kandin Firepot. Kandin can be found in the Southwest region of ButcherBlock Mountains (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. Handing Kandin the note from Arantir results in the following:<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but he's dead. His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard. I still have one of his greatest possessions! Hey, I know! You can help me with my greatest firework! I need you to get me a skin to put the powder from my firework in. That's the only thing I can think of to use though I cannot get myself. I need a skin that is dry and brittle, yet can still be shaped. So go fetch me some and I'll scratch your back.<br>
<br>
The 'skin' Kandin speaks of is Cazic's Skin found off of Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear (this item is RARE!). When identified, the skin comes up with 'Item Lore: Brittle yet malleable skin.' It looks like a bear skin.<br>
<br>
Take this skin back to Kandin and hand it to him. He will reply with:<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Great! This is? What is this for again? Oh yeah, the casing for my firework. Here, you can have this then, oh no, wait. You can't yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, and you are exactly the person to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder. Now, go find some for me! Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to my bag for me, please. You can give it back after you've given me what I want.<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point, Kandin Firepot will give you 'Kandin's Bag'. When identified, the bag comes up with: Item Lore: Warning - Explosive!&quot;. Although it is a bag, it cannot be opened. Don't worry about this, continue with the quest.<br>
<br>
The mistletoe powder is found within Old Sebilis upon Tolapmulj. Once you have the powder, return to Kandin and hand only the powder to him. Upon handing Kandin the mistletoe powder, he will return to you the Staff of Gabstik. Once he hands you the staff he asks for his bag back. Hand him 'Kandin's Bag' -<br>
<br>
Kandin Firepot says 'Great! Give this to Arantir so he knows you've helped me! Hey! Have you seen my lantern anywhere? <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
<br>
<br>
You will now have a note from Kandin that you must take to Arantir. This is where things go weird. Occy, the wizard that first completed this quest, took the note to Arantir and handed it to him. Upon handing it to Arantir, nothing happened. No item handed back to Occy, no words spoken by Arantir... nothing. Needless to say, Occy just about cr*pped himself. All Occy heard was the experience 'chime'. Then Occy hailed Arantir after he handed in the note.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor' <br>
<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Ah yes, you again. Do you have the items? Give me the three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.<br>
<br>
At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the Gnarled Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik. <br>
<br>
Arantir Karondor says 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. You will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact, to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you, leave me in peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now you must go back to Solomen and hand him this pack. Upon doing so will result in getting the epic item, Staff of the Four.<br>
<br>

<br>
Solomen says 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your intelligence and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you have made Solusek Ro and all the wizards of the world proud this day. <br>
