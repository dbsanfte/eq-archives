Recently, I made an error and trusted thraxx. I think ou all need to know this because he tried to screw danielsen also. HE will screw any of you if its for something he wants. Here is the post I made on Drinal, CiH and King's Court:<br>
<br>
I don't usually post on flame boards for many reason but today I feel that I have to. today, someone I thought was a friend screwed me over royally. Thraxx, as you all know is a e-bay trade off froma 60 wizzy on another sever. He seemed like a good guy and I have grouped with him on many a times. While I was in a Howling stone group with Vert, trevize, domoguul, seandar and thraxx, I let him borrow my tunic till he got his from seb. I even told him that I was letting him use it because it helped me with damage vs healing. He said thanks. Well, a week later I asked for it back. On 4 separate times, I went to the zone he was in because he was anon, I asked him first where he was and that I was coming. Each time he logged before I got there. I am not stupid but I chose to try to give him a chance. Finally, today I had enough and told him I wanted it and I was coming to get it. He was in perma. True to his false nature, he logged before I got there. Now I am pissed. When he loggs in later, he has me on ignore. My friends in guild start telling him he needs to fix this, that was when he says that he gave me 40K and a sash of the dragonborn for it. Who in the hell would pay that much? I obviously do not have it so then he says he told me he was giving it to my alt. An alt that I do not even have. The point here is that thraxx is a thief. I was a fool for trusting the scum, please do not make the same mistake I did. He also tried to get stealthier (danielson) his tunic by taking the tunic and him logging in another character and giving him a traq staff. Something I discovered after he screwed me over. Thraxx is a damn thief. I am a fool for trusting him. <br>
