<p><font size=+1>Starting a Assassin Character.</font>
<p>One of the most important things of a Assassin is the alocation of his/her
statistics.&nbsp; Chose wrongly on this and your character will find life
on the disc very difficult indeed.&nbsp; Because it was my first time playing
a MUD I didn't pick the right stats for my character and boy have I been
struggling.&nbsp; Statistics give you bonus' to your skills, so if you
have a high stat for the skill in question you will get a huge bonus, if
it is low you will recieve hardly anything.
<p>The most important stat for a Assassin has got to be DEXTERITY as this
affects almost all of the class' major skills.&nbsp; I didn't put enough
DEX on my character and after I had maxed my skills I still only had the
appropriate skill bonus of a newly graduated Assassin, being the type of
person I am I took this as a challenge and gradually over time and a hell
of a lot of effort I increased my skills to a pretty good level, spending
EXP that most characters on the disc can only dream about, then the programmers
decided to overhaul the game system and introduced a skill cut, this effectively
cut all my skills back down to a newly graduated assassin level because
my stats were not good enough to give a decent bonus to up it.&nbsp; This
effectively killed my character off and I am currently looking to start
a new character which im not too happy about after around 50 days of play
struggling to get my character to a alright level.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>The guild structure.</font>
<p>Starting Assassins can use the guild training rooms to advance their
skills cheaply up to a level of 50.&nbsp; Once this is achieved it means
the character will have to pass "the run" to anable the guild to continue
to teach them up to a level of 300.&nbsp; Characters who dont want to do
the run yet can still learn from other players but it is alot more expensive.
<p>The guild is a player run guild, that is the GM (Guild Master) is a
actual player who is usually one of the top assassins on the disc who the
other assassins have voted to have them as their leader.&nbsp; Under the
GM their are 4 HM's (House Masters), one for each house of assassins.&nbsp;
If a assassin has any problems then he should take it to a HM, who in turn
may take it to the GM if he/she feels it needs the GM's attention.
<p>The guild has very important rules which all assassins must follow or
risk being kicked out of the guild, there are no laws which have been confirmed
as standard as each GM will have his/her ideas but a general list was proposed
by the old GuildMaster.

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font size=+1>The commands you will recieve as a Assassin.</font>
<p>As you gain experience points and spend them on your skills you will
be able to learn new commands that will aid your character to acheive certain
tasks.&nbsp; Some skills can be learned at a low level and others take
alot of time and effort to learn how to do them.&nbsp; The skills the guild
teachers can teach are as follows:
<p><b>SNEAK&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
art of moving around without being seen by others.
<br><b>HIDE</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
art of&nbsp; taking cover in a location without being seen by others.
<br><b>SLIP/PALM&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The art of taking and giving a item without being seen.
<br><b>AMBUSH&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A deadly combat command where you hide in waiting for a victim then jump
out catching them
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unawares inflicting massive amounts of damage.
<br><b>CONCEAL</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Concealing items around the assassins body which other characters cant
see.
<br><b>INHUME</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the Assassins most important skill and can only be taught after
a Assassin has completed "The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Run".&nbsp; When a player has a contract on his/her head then all assassins
with the inhume skill can use it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the contracted player.&nbsp; When used the assassin hides out of view
and attempts to throw a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
throwing knife at the victim in a hope of scoring a one hit kill.&nbsp;
If completed succesfully the victim
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
loses a life and the assassin is paid the bounty for killing the character,
minus the guilds cut of the fee.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>The Run</font>
<p>Once you feel that your character is ready to become a fully fledged
Assassin then he can attempt The Run.&nbsp; This is a series of
<br>puzzles and traps which a Assassin must solve to get to the final section
where they must inhume a dummy (altho nobody knows if it is a actual dummy
or not!).&nbsp; If all is successful then the character is awarded his
certificate and immediately becomes a PK.&nbsp; As long as you have the
neccessary skills and a keen eye for detail the run should not cause too
many problems, if you are lacking in either of these then prepare to die
trying.&nbsp; When attempting The Run take nothing with you apart from
a light source and a throwing knife, this leave you unburdened and your
skills will be at max and also, if you do happen to die, then you wont
lose much equipment.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Once The Run is passed</font>
<p>Now you are a Player Killer, other players who are PK can attack and
be attacked by you.&nbsp; You can also be stole from and because your such
a low level you are easy pickings for the thieves on the disc.&nbsp; While
you are such a low level dont carry anything really valuable around that
you dont wish to lose and get a good priest to put wards on your other
equipment, this will mean that any thief trying to steal the warded item
will set off a explosion which will damage the thief depending on how good
the priest was who made the ward.
<p>Now you are eligible to view the red book of contracts, this is a book
where other PK characters on the disc can place contracts on each other
for whatever reason.&nbsp; The book is in two sections, the first is characters
that have had the fee paid and have contracts on them, the other is characters
which have had enquiries on how much their contract would cost.&nbsp; Once
a character has a contract on their head then he/she is open season to
all Assassins.
<p>When selecting a contracted character to try and inhume, take a note
of how much they cost to put the contract on their heads, the lower this
number is, the easier it should be to inhume them.&nbsp; The cost of a
contract is currently $5 for every level of the character, use this as
a general idea of how powerful that character is, should you fail in your
inhume attempt then prepare as the said character has every right to hunt
you down and kill you.&nbsp; Should you succeed then the bounty will be
added to your guild account, minus the guilds cut of course.&nbsp; Beware
this money does not stay forever, take it to your bank when you have the
time, I once lost $5000 by leaving my money in the guild account for too
long (nobody told me about this happening) and the Lords who run the game
won't even entertain you, in some of them can be complete bastards at times.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Hints and Tips</font>
<p>Try to group with other PK's to lower the chance of&nbsp; being harrassed.
<br>Advance your perception to avoid being stolen from.
<br>Advance your hiding and sneaking skills (what they cant see they cant
kill/steal from).
<br>Dont carry valuables about, If you have to then get them warded.
<br>Group with high level characters (if they let you), as you share all
experience points when grouped.
<br>Killing things for exp at low levels is very hard, even a rat is a
hard thing to kill, if you can, group to maximise killing potential.
<br>After inhuming, dont take your cash straight to the bank as thieves
will cotton onto this and lie in wait for you.
<br>Advance weapon skills to start with which will allow you to kill harder
monsters for greater exp points.
<br>Dont go for big contracts unless you feel you have a geniun chance,
even the oldest Assassins have trouble inhuming old PK's.
<br>Most of all - DONT BE A ARSEHOLE!!!
