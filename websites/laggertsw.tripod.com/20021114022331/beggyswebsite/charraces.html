<td><font color="#000000">A hardier variety of the human race, barbarians
inhabit the cold and rugged northlands. Their city of Halas is located
in the mountains of Everfrost. Though referred to as barbarians by the
rest of the world, these proud people refer to themselves as "Northmen."
Because of their harsh environment and warlike culture, they are well suited
to being warriors. They are generally unwashed and rugged, possessing very
few social graces. Barbarians take great pride in clan lineage, and eating,
drinking, and battle are their preferred pastimes.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Although the vast majority of barbarians become
warriors for the great honor this will bring to their clans, some feel
the mystical call to serve as clan shamans, lending their magical abilities
to further their clan's standing. Yet, there is one more class that a barbarian
may become, and that is the class of the rogue. Barbarian rogues are usually
loners who have decided to bring their clan honor through less respectable
methods. Achieving honor is what is important, not how it is achieved.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">No matter their chosen profession, barbarians
are a force to be reckoned with. The very love they have for a fight is
what makes them a true danger. While most barbarians worship the Tribunal,
some may also choose to swear fealty to Bristlebane or Rallos Zek.</font></td>

evil brethren of the woodland and high elves. Their skin is bluish-black,
their hair white, and they share the pointed ears and sharp features of
their elven relatives. Due to their life under the earth and dedication
to evil gods, they have excellent vision in the dark.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Dark elves are a race filled with hate, created
by Innoruuk, the God of Hate himself. They hate all other races, and even
their fellow Teir`Dal. Their sole motivation is to please Innoruuk. They
will lend aid to one another, but only for their own selfish reasons. "I
will help you now to use you later," is a common sentiment.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Being of the elven race, the Teir`Dal have a natural
magical ability. This is evident in the professions of enchanter, magician,
wizard, and necromancer. With their devotion to Innoruuk, they may also
serve him as clerics. For those Teir`Dal who desire to spread hate and
death in other ways, they may choose to become rogues, warriors, or shadowknights.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The dark elves generally follow deities of a dark
nature, such as Innoruuk (their creator) or Solusek Ro. Some warriors are
faithful to Rallos Zek, however, while rogues have a natural affinity for
Bristlebane.</font></td>

<td><font color="#000000">Dwarves are short but extremely strong (much
more so than humans) and dexterous. They appear to be small, burly humans,
and males are never seen without beards and mustaches. Of course, dwarves
do not see their lack of physical height as a disadvantage. To them, it
is simply the way of things. Besides, it is just as satisfying to break
kneecaps as it is to break noses.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Dwarves believe in many different things, and
each is willing to die for their beliefs. One thing all dwarves share is
a common belief in good, strong ale. It would not be strange to witness
a dwarf in battle, a weapon in one hand and a frothing mug in the other.
To better serve their dwarven patrons, taverns across the lands have specially
constructed stools that can take a beating. The innate infravision of the
dwarves allows them to see if a mug is half-empty or half-full in even
the darkest of rooms. For the safety of those around, the mug better be
half nothing and always full!</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Dwarves have such a neutral character that even
the Teir`Dal will allow them into Neriak, to a point. Of their professions,
dwarves may choose to serve their god as clerics, take on the mantles of
paladins, harry the enemy as warriors, or pursue the refined arts of the
rogue.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The faith of dwarves lies mainly in Brell Serilis,
the Duke of Underfoot, but some also serve Bristlebane.</font></td>

<td><font color="#000000">Being the exact opposite of the barbarian Northmen,
the high man prides himself on his intellectual abilities and social graces,
to the almost total exclusion of the physical disciplines. They take satisfaction
in their superiority over all other races. Any obstacle can be overcome
with intelligence and wisdom. Pick up a sword? Bah, leave that to the lesser,
unsophisticated beasts of the land. The only exception is for Erudite paladins
and shadowknights.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Erudites have very few friends outside their own
race. Others find them difficult to associate with. Their snooty attitudes
and overblown egos can be said to be the main factors in this. But only
a party of ignorant adventurers would turn an Erudite away from joining
them, for their high intelligence and facile use of magic comes in handy,
especially when facing a powerful enemy. As clerics, mages, enchanters,
necromancers, and wizards, Erudites excel when magic is needed.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Erudites--other than wizards--tend to ally themselves
with either Prexus the Oceanlord, or Quellious the Tranquil. Wizards utilize
the firepower of Solusek Ro in their magic and so gravitate toward him.
There is a sect of Erudites who have turned to the evil Cazic-Thule, and
are branded heretics.</font></td>

burrows and rarely come to the surface. They resemble dwarves to some extent,
but have a ruddy brown skin and are more wiry and gnarled. Their hair is
white, and somewhat sparse. Yet, their appearance is not what gets them
noticed. Gnomes believe that building contraptions ranks right up there
with saving the world. Renowned for their tinkering abilities, gnomes delight
in the fact that they can build the right machine for any occasion. The
many catastrophes, explosions, and traumatic amputations of limbs that
have resulted from this pursuit of mechanics are not seen as tragedies,
but rather as learning experiences.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Gnomes are an easy-going race, and most have a
pleasant, carefree attitude. They do not believe in failures, only temporary
setbacks. Their fascinations with gadgets, sprockets, springs, doodads,
and-frighteningly enough--explosives, provide gnomes with an abundance
of healthy respect (at a safe distance) from others. Not ones to waste
time on such things as revenge, gnomes prefer to experiment. It cannot
be helped if an experiment happens to go bad on someone who just offended
them in some way.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Gnomes follow the standard occupations of cleric,
enchanter, magician, necromancer, rogue, warrior, and wizard, but in their
hearts, they are tinkers.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">These little people have many deities, among them
Brell Serilis and Bristlebane. Some worship the fiery power of Solusek
Ro, and of course warriors tend to draw strength from Rallos Zek. There
are others rarely spoken of who are said to follow Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer.</font></td>

<td><font color="#000000">Half elves, sharing the blood of both humans
and elves, share some of the strengths and weaknesses of both races. They
most closely resemble humans, except for their slightly pointed ears and
sharper facial features. Although scorned by the more closed-minded individuals
of their parent races, half elves receive some of the best attributes of
both parents. From the elves, they gain the much-valued ability to see
clearly in the dark, good agility and good dexterity. From humans they
take better strength and stamina. With these abilities, half elves make
talented bards, druids, paladins, rangers, rogues, and warriors.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Other races are limited in the places they may
begin their lives. Half elves, however, have more options. They can choose
to originate from the cities of Qeynos, Freeport, Kelethin, or Felwithe.
This benefit helps in establishing half elves throughout the world.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Half elves are eclectic in their worship. There

humans, but are much more agile, dexterous, and light of foot than those
clumsy humans. Halflings hail from Rivervale, a quiet little hamlet smack
dab in the center of Antonica. Their mischievous, jovial natures make them
fun people to be around. Male halflings take great pride in their foot
hair and strive to ensure that each hair is properly groomed.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Possessing naturally high dexterity and agility,
halflings are viewed as quick little fellows who smile a lot. They have
a love of travel, and their professions of cleric, druid, rogue, and warrior
lead them on many an adventure. With their innate ability to hide, halflings
make great pranksters, sneaking up on an unsuspecting victim and poking
them, causing a bladder-loosening scream.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">All is not fun and games for halflings, however.
They take the encroaching goblin horde as a serious threat and defend Rivervale
and Misty Thicket with all of their might.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Most halflings worship Bristlebane or Brell Serilis,
unless they have chosen the druidic or warrior life. Halfling druids follow
the call of Karana the Rainkeeper, and warriors swear to Rallos Zek the
Warlord.</font></td>

<td><font color="#000000">Also known as the Koada'Dal, the high elves are
much more intellectual than their woodland kin, and are the "royalty" of
the elven races (with the exception of their dark brethren). They share
the elfin features of their woodland kin, but are taller, and paler in
skin.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">High elves are very much like the Erudites in
their belief that manual labor is beneath them. Sweat and dirt do not combine
well with the finicky high elf personality. They prefer the use of magic
to muscle. They are a highly intelligent race, which is reflected in their
choice of many magic-using professions. For the devout, there is the path
of cleric. For the righteous soldier, the path of the paladin is a logical
choice. Enchanters, wizards, and magicians hold high places within the
ranks of the high elves.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Even though high elves consider themselves the
royalty of the elven races, they will not hesitate to join parties with
other races who lean toward good. They understand that some sacrifices
must be made in order to do what they believe is the right thing. Of course,
they still will not hesitate to remind others of their own supremacy.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Tunare is the most sacred deity for the high elves,

inhabiting various locales on the continent of Kunark. The god Cazic-Thule
created them during the Elder Age, and they began a tribal existence on
Kunark thousands of years in Norrath's past. Eventually, they united to
form a massive empire, which later collapsed, leaving behind an intricate
and proud history as well as a rich setting for adventurers to explore.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The Iksar have a background that most races would
consider evil in nature, in that conquest, enslavement, and general war
and destruction were the norm. With that said, there are those who have
chosen not to blindly follow in the path of their ancestors and are more
or less neutral in their views of the world and its inhabitants.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The Iksar have an interesting variety of classes
available to them due to their unique history and circumstances. Their
current tribal nature limits their general mystic abilities to the shamanic
arts, yet the fallen Iksar Empire's strong involvement in necromancy allows
them to choose the path of the necromancer or shadowknight. They are also
afforded the special opportunity that, until now, was limited only to the
human race: Iksar may become monks. Their unique reptilian body type gives
Iksar monks special magically enhanced attacks. And, of course, what warlike
race would not have an abundance of warriors?</font>

average height of approximately 10' and weight well over four hundred pounds,
they are truly immovable objects. Due to their size, they are the strongest
of all the races and are tied with trolls in pure stamina. Conversely,
they are the least intelligent race, whose lives consist mostly of smashing
things and eating them.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">An ogre's strength is its strength. With the ability
to use heavy weapons, ogres become either warriors or shadowknights. Whether
they truly understand their vocations, the smarter races have not yet decided.
But, thanks to the mystery of evolution, an ogre is sometimes born with
a bit more smarts, and may decide--or fall into by mistake--the profession
of shaman.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Never let the ogre's dull personality and lower
intelligence mislead you into thinking they are harmless. Ogres are ruthless
killers, and like trolls, will eat what they kill. The best way to make
friends with an ogre is to feed him your left hand. He'll stay with you
until he gets the rest.</font>

kills, and killing some more. They do this not out of instinct but out
of purely evil motives. Their dark hearts pump malice and the need to destroy
that which is not troll. They won't mess with ogres, though, as ogre meat
is not good eating. If they could get away with it, they would dine on
dark elves too (dark elves do not let them get away with it).</font>
