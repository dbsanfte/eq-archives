The only fun people would have would be watching ogres trip over their
own feet. Bards do it all. They sing, dance, play musical instruments,
fight and, on occasion, help relieve overburdened purses. Their artistic
talents stir a party into action, or cause enemies to rethink attacking.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">A bard may believe in various causes and they
are the most eclectic lot with regards to deities, but one thing they all
have in common is the love of their art and to forever be guided by their
muse. Bards can be found among the half elf, human and wood elf populations</font></td>

<p><font color="#000000">A cleric is a healer devoting his or her life
in service of a god. Many races (dark elves, dwarves, Erudites, gnomes,
halflings, high elves and humans) have members whose entire lives are devoted
to worship, and although anyone can worship in his or her own way, only
those who have fully committed themselves to the prayerful life of a cleric
are granted a god's great favor of healing power. With daily prayers, service,
and meditation, clerics receive their powers in order to aid and protect
others. Clerics are forbidden to shed the blood of others and so have skills
only in blunt weaponry. While they cannot compete with the sheer force
of a warrior's attack, clerics are certainly able to protect themselves
in many situations.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font color="#000000">Nature is a druid's ally. Druids are in tune with
nature; thus, their magics are nature based, drawing from the spiritual
forces of both plants and animals. Whether calling forth roots to entangle
an enemy, or using nature's life-giving essence to heal themselves or others,
druids are the masters and servants of Nature. The dedication necessary
to become a druid is great; druids can only be found among the half elf,
halfling, human and wood elf races.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Druids have a love for all animals, but that
does not mean all animals love druids. Although a druid will do what he
or she can to avoid harming one of nature's beasts, many animals see a
druid as just another source of food. This is no reflection of the piety
of the druid, mind you, but rather of the simple minds of beasts. Druids,
like shamans, have the ability to aid others in many ways, making both
desirable members in hunting parties.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">The primary focus of the enchanter's art is found
in the name of the arcane order to which they belong. Their spells are
crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to
charm beings and make them fight for their new masters, or to magically
enhance the capabilities of the enchanter's allies. They also have some
skill in offensive spells, but they will never match those of the wizard.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Enchanters, like all the magic users, may follow
any of a fair number of gods, both good and evil, and can be found among
the following races: dark elf, Erudite, gnome, high elf, and human.</font>

with the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread to a huge
fire elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells
as wizards, magicians still wield considerable power in this area. Magicians,

<p><font color="#000000">Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping
their bodies into pure weapons. Because of this, they shun nearly all weapons
and most forms of armor. They can be very religious and the gods are known
to bless them, not with spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks.
Only two races produce monks - humans and the lizardmen known as the Iksar.
Strangely, though Iksar monks invariably worship Cazic-Thule and most human
monks follow Quellious the Tranquil, there are some human monks who are
actually agnostic!&nbsp;</font></td>

spellcasters studied and perfected the ability to raise creatures from
the dead. In time, their undead minions became truly effective pets and
powerful forces with which Norrath has been forced to reckon. Considered
the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, necromancers, as they came to
be known, dabble in death, using life forces in unspeakable ways to protect
and empower themselves. Even some of the good races of Norrath have been
known to spawn such despicable individuals. Necromancers can be found among
the dark elf, Erudite (heretics), gnome, human and Iksar races.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font color="#000000">A paladin is the very embodiment of a holy knight,
fighting for the cause of good in every aspect of his or her life. As the
paladin gains life experience and proves his devotion, he will be granted
the ability to use limited clerical magics. They share some of the powers
of clerics along with a good deal of the fighting ability of warriors,
but have a few virtues all their own. Only those who are pure in heart
can become paladins, and the so-called "evil" races have yet to produce
them. Dwarves, Erudites, half elves, high elves and humans are the only
races that count them among their numbers.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font color="#000000">Rangers are at home in the forests of Norrath,
as knowledgeable about beasts as druids, though less magically inclined.
Their melee prowess makes them competent warriors. They function as a powerful
meld of these two classes. Only half elves, humans and wood elves have
the instinctual nature that will allow them to excel in this class, as
their senses are extremely acute. Rangers can become adept at using distance
weapons such as the bow and arrow and have often been known to study the
skills of the bowyer and fletcher. Members of this class are unsurpassed
in their ability to pursue their quarry, be it friend or foe.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font color="#000000">Rogues are the secretive, mysterious class of
the world who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and
some say that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere
in the middle, and they are capable of both. They are quite skilled with
many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe with a warrior. Rogues prefer
to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear; backstabbing is their
forte, after all. They move like smoke, in the thick of the fray one minute,
causing tears to come to one's eyes, then evaporating as you turn their
way. Among them, the less honorable skills of picking pockets and stealing
are considered to be fine arts.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">Rogues are believed to exist among the barbarian
Northmen, dark elves, dwarves, gnomes, half elves, halflings and humans,

<p><font color="#000000">Shadowknights are exactly what their name implies
- beings with the power of knights who live and work in the shadows. The
antithesis of the paladin, shadowknights derive all of their powers from
the evil gods they serve. Their abilities are a blend of warrior-like skills
and necromantic studies. Generally speaking, good races frown upon this
class, while those whose deities embrace hatred and pain tend to glorify
and support them. They are only found among the dark elf, heretic Erudite,
human, Iksar, Ogre and troll races.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font color="#000000">A shaman is similar to a cleric in some aspects,
but is more attuned to the world of spirits and animals. They are typically
found amongst the less specialized races, like the barbarian Northmen,
Iksar, ogres and trolls. Other than the Northmen, who worship the Tribunal,
most others follow the darker deities. While they have a solid repertoire
of healing and other clerical type spells, the shaman's strengths lie in
offensive and augmenting spells which can benefit others in their everyday
lives. Many of the latter draw from the spiritual power of the animals
with whom a shaman communes.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font color="#000000">Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all
its many forms. They are right at home on the battlefield and are trained
to take as much punishment as they dole out, because of their innately
strong constitutions. "A warrior is not made," they say, "a warrior is
born," and so it is. Those who prove themselves to be hardier than others
are perfectly suited for the rigors of this class. Though slow to regain
their considerable health when injured, warriors are excellent companions
for healer types. Only the Erudite and high elf races do not produce warriors.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font color="#000000">Wizards are second to none when it comes to casting
powerful offensive spells. Certainly, other magic users are proficient
in their own areas, but the wizard is most effective in battle. That is,
as long as they have someone very sturdy to protect them from melee attacks.
What wizards gain in magical attack ability, they lose in defensive capability.
Learning to harness the power of heat and cold and channel them against
an opponent requires that they open themselves to the elements. They cannot
clothe themselves in metal and still have all that magic at their disposal.
The more intelligent races all have the ability to learn this craft: dark
elves, Erudites, gnomes, high elves and humans.&nbsp;</font>
