<td>Everquest is a online computer roleplaying game set in a fantasy world
of Norrath, a world where swords and&nbsp; magic prevail against beasts
that would slit your throat as soon as look at you.&nbsp; The world is
populated by many races of creatures who are all played by actual users
from anywhere in the world who fight against the computer controlled characters
(NPC's) (against each other also in the Player Vs Player Servers) to gain
experience points which allow them to increase their lvl and become more
and more powerful.&nbsp; Verant have made the game so in order to achieve
certain goals you will have to interact with other players, for example
to take down a dragon you would need around 30+ people to even stand a
chance, solo and you would be dead in around 2 seconds.</td>

<td>Once you are set up and ready to play you must first create a character.&nbsp;
Dont just rush into this as you may scar your character in the long run
if your not sure what you are doing.&nbsp;
<p>Everquest currently supports 15 character races which you can choose
from.&nbsp; Click&nbsp; <a href="charraces.html">HERE</a>&nbsp; to go to
my Character Races page.
<p>After selecting a Race its then time to choose a Class for your character.&nbsp;
Certain Races are restricted to which Classes they can choose.&nbsp; Click

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Starting Out</font></B>
<p>Once you have your character set up its time to log into Norrath and
start to earn a living.&nbsp; Your first task will be to find your guild
in your starting city and hand the leader a note in order to join that
said guild, for example if you picked a Ogre Shaman you would start in
Oggok and would have to locate the shaman NPC who is hiding in the cave
complex.&nbsp; Once this is done you will be given a small amount of exp
and usually hailing the Guild Leader will produce small quests he/she may
ask you to do.&nbsp; Once that is done arm yourself with your starting
equipment and head on out into the newbie area, this is a small area usually
around the starting citys with low level monsters that you can practice
on and gain a few starting levels.&nbsp; NOTE: the consider button is your
friend, consider ALL monsters that you are thinking about attacking before
you do so, the colour and message will tell you if you stand a chance against
that said creature.
<p>At this point dont worry if you die, u wont lose any exp (till lvl 5)
and you will start again with your starting equipment.&nbsp; Loot everything
the monsters drop and sell them to the NPC vendors for cash, it wont be
much but at this point you need everything you can get.&nbsp; DONT buy
from vendors (armour, weapons), as if you /auction for stuff there will
no doubt be higher lvl characters about that can make or sell you items
better than what the vendors sell you and for alot cheaper.&nbsp; Dont
play the game single player, its a multiplayer game and thus should be
treated as thus, if you see other people around your level wandering around
then ask if they would like to group up, grouping up allows you to kill
creatures you could not normally kill for better loot and better exp.
<p>Here is a list of the most common zones I hunted in with my shaman,
they got me to lvl 60 in no time for a none twink and are the best exp
zones in the game.
