<p>This page is dedicated to my favourite game....Unreal Tournament.&nbsp;
When I first got a copy of the demo for this game I thought it was going
to be a complete pile of crap as the other Unreal games were turd.&nbsp;
After about 5 seconds of playing the game I realised how wrong I had been,
this was the best piece of software I had played for a very long time........

<td><font size=+1>Why is UT so good?</font>
<p>Unreal Tournament can be played with or without a network by using bots,
this you may think is nothing new, but the programming on these bots is
like nothing i've seen before.&nbsp; Whatever level of play you are used
to, be it novice or god like, you can find bots that will give you a run
for your money.&nbsp; The best thing about them is they act so human like,
if you take a pop at them and they'll hunt you down like the dog you are,
if they need health they will go get some, they dont instantly spot you
wherever you are like some games, etc..etc..&nbsp; Take for example Quake
III (the supposed Unreal Tournament beater), when you shoot a bot it runs
off like a little girl blind to all that is going on around it.&nbsp; Yet
in UT you shoot a bot and it will try its hardest to turn you into a pile
of pulp on the ground, only breaking off if it spots something of use that
could come in handy (like a bit of health a few steps away) but it still
wont ignore you, it will continue to try and kill you.
<p>A editor is also included with the game and designing your own skins
and levels is a piece of cake.&nbsp; Unlike Quake III, where you have to
manually type the name of the map that you want to play on the console,
UT automatically scans the directory for maps and displays them in a neat
box for you to chose from, this also applies to new skins and MOD's.</td>

<p><font size=+1>Wont I get bored eventually like all the other games?</font>
<p>Unreal Tournament is so unlike all the other games, for starters it
has new game modes built in that other games haven't even thought of.&nbsp;
Take for instance the Assault games where one team has to defend a target
and the other team has to take the target.&nbsp; Once the target has been
taken or a specific time limit has been reached then the teams swap over,
the winner is the team that gains the target in the shortest time.
<p>If for some reason you do get bored then you can simply download one
of the many MOD's that are available on the web.&nbsp; These include things
such as being able to carry 2 weapons together, Runes MOD's (specific runes
give you extra powers like regeneration, extra damage etc..etc..), Hunter
MOD (where 1 player is the hunted and the other players are the hunters.&nbsp;
Only the Hunted can score points and when he is killed by a hunter, then
the hunter becomes the hunted), Giants (the more you kill the bigger you
get), TimeBomb (each player has a set amount of time which continually
ticks down before he explodes, the only way to increase the time is to
kill another player), etc....etc.....
<p>MOD's, skins and levels can be found on most UT pages, for links to
the best ones I've found so far see my links page.&nbsp; If you have a
UT which you would like to add to my links page then simply give me a mail.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>What name do I go by on the net?</font>
<p>When I play online I go by the name of FRANKENSTEIN, this name was given
to my computer by a friend of mine the first time he saw it, mainly due
to the fact that its made from many different parts from other computers
and the side of it was continually open as I'd be fiddling around inside
of it with a screwdriver.&nbsp; If you've read this page feel free to hassle
me online if your on the same server as me....But be prepared for a old
fashioned arse kicking!
