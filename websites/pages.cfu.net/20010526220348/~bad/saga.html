    a bloody 4 v 4 match was in the midst of commencing.&nbsp; Att and Smell on the flanks
    Moon and General Airhead (Hangover) on the insides.&nbsp; All was ready weapons sharpened
    rocks stock piled, war bonds sold it was time.<br>
    <br>
    The battle begins Att rushes out quickly with scythes to scout.&nbsp; Smell pumps out HHA
    and towers fearing the 'ele' rush that he so despises.&nbsp; Moon goes to work on siege
    shops.&nbsp; Hangy barks out commands while munching on crumpets and sipping tea.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </font><p><font color="#FFFF00">Att finds the enemy and engages him with his
    scythes as he begins work on his siege.&nbsp; Moon brings up 15 cats to assist Att in his
    attack. Smell gets hit by his worst nightmare 20 armored 'eles'.&nbsp; He stands his
    ground and holds his position. While General (too big for his breeches) Hangover opens a
    bottle of VO to add to his tea.&nbsp; </font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Att has a large army now amassed and is driving forward with Moon
    backing him up one enemy down and the opponent resigns.&nbsp; Meanwhile Smells town is
    under siege this time by 30 'eles' trampling him.&nbsp; Smell sends up a flare. &nbsp;
    General (passed out for his afternoon nap ) Hangy doesn't see it.&nbsp; Smell has to
    retreat.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">The General has a large army just standing around in the center
    on the map, the troops are confused are they at war or is it a party they think to them
    selves.&nbsp; Smell losing all faith in the General retreats past the Generals base and
    rebuilds in Att's town feeling much safer there then by the (cuddling his teddy bear and
    sucking his thumb in lieu of a stiff drink) General.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Att pushes though the second opponent while Moon breaks off and
    hits the third.&nbsp; Smell rushes numerous peons to gather up the enemies resources to
    deprive them of the much needed supplies.&nbsp; The second and third opponents resign from
    battle.&nbsp; The fourth is mounting a heavy defence around his last piece of the world.
    &nbsp; This is for naught though as Smell has regrouped rebuilt and encircled the enemy
    town and calls to Att and Moon to say &quot;this ones mine its payback time.&nbsp; Then
    with the scream &quot;For the queen&quot;&nbsp; he attacks crushing the enemy and taunting
    him for attacking his town.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
    Meanwhile Moon and Att have encircled General (out picking daisies) Hangover. &nbsp;
    Feeling it's time to install a new General, they allow this troops to get some religion
    and they switch sides.&nbsp; They attack and capture the general who promptly try's to
    order scotch for everyone.&nbsp; Moony wants to torture the fallen General. &nbsp; Att
    wants to just kill him but Smelly feels he should be tortured as well for his fallen men's
    sake.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">They agree to chop off his dick ..... but wait they find he's
    dickless.....they break out in laughter as they release him understanding now why he acted

    <td width="600" height="1402" colspan="2"><font color="#FFFF00">When we last left our
    heroes Moon and Att were off to find new conquests and Smell had killed himself due to
    finding out Hangy was the Queen he was trying to protect, while Hangy was off to the docks
    for some action......we pick up the story here........<br>
    <br>
    Att and Moon had set up camp on a new front,&nbsp; readying their troops and preparing the
    weapons. Hangy returned from the docks feeling unfulfilled because not even the salaries
    would have anything to do with her/him.&nbsp; So he went back to the battle field and saw
    Smells body lying there lifeless. </font><p><font color="#FFFF00">Hangy went over and much
    to his surprise,&nbsp; Smell had missed himself with the dagger and passed out when his
    head hit a rock on the ground.&nbsp; The thrusts force driving him backwards causing him
    to trip and fall head first onto a bed of rocks.&nbsp; Hangy helped Smell to his feet
    while Smell started crying and muttering &quot;damn I died and went to Hell&quot;. &nbsp;
    His thinking was that because he was being helped by Puff his worst torment had come true
    and that had to be hell.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Hangy got him back to his camp and had him cleaned up and fed.
    &nbsp; Slowly Smell began to realize he hadn't died and wanted to know were Att and Moon
    went to.&nbsp; Hangy told then they were about 8 'clicks' down the road by the water front
    preparing for battle.&nbsp; Smell insisted they join up with them immediately.&nbsp; Hangy
    agreed and ordered a transport ship to take the leaders to the brewing battle.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Meanwhile Att and Moon had started to group their armies in
    preparation for the attack.&nbsp; Their scouts had reported much larger armies then was
    first thought&nbsp; They were out manned 5 to 1, nevertheless they were still confident
    they would be victorious.&nbsp; The men marched their armies forward using the cover of
    darkness for stealth. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">About this time Smell and Hangy arrived at the camp site to find
    only peasants foraging for food, farming (with out the farm bug that Smell employs) and
    gathering resources.&nbsp; Smell wasted no time he immediately started amassing his army
    as Hangy went to work hitting on the peasants (remember he didn't get any at the docks).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Att and Moon sent in their first waves and to their dismay they
    caused little damage.&nbsp; Seems the enemy was ready for them.&nbsp; They quickly
    regrouped and tried to attack from separate sides.&nbsp; This worked - Att was held but
    Moony slipped in and was causing havoc.&nbsp; Then out of nowhere came reinforcements,
    &nbsp; they were no longer fighting one but 2 enemies.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Things were looking bleak.&nbsp; Just then the battle field got
    desperately quiet,&nbsp; the earth was shaking.&nbsp; All the armies stopped fighting and
    looked around in confusion.&nbsp; Were the Gods destroying the world?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
    through the dust lit by the moonlight,&nbsp; 50 armored 'eles' appeared. Smelly had
    arrived with his Persian 'eles' (who says Persian has no place).&nbsp; The enemy knew they
    could not hold the 'eles' off and they turned and fled the battlefield.&nbsp; </font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Moon and Att couldn't believe it, they thought Smell was dead.
    &nbsp; Smell had scared the enemy away with the very thing that he feared.&nbsp; Att and
    moon rode over and greeted their friend and ally.&nbsp; Moon inquired where the general
    was.&nbsp; Smell told him he left him back at the camp so the men let their armies plunder
    the town and rode back to see Hangy.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Upon arriving back they found Hangy half naked,&nbsp; totally
    drunk (what else is new) and with a big grim on his /her face.&nbsp; Hangy then spoke
    &quot;blimey!&quot;.&nbsp; Look guys I found it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was stuck up my ass.
    &nbsp; &quot;See I have a dick&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangy pushed the table aside and 'lo and
    behold' there was Bad_Vacuum&nbsp; giving Hangy head with a pair of tweezers.&nbsp; It was
    small but it was there.&nbsp; </font></p>

    Yes, who could forget the now legendary Suntzu military build up, or lack thereof, as

    I need helios was the cry from Suntzu, a cry which couldn't be heard over the screams of
    one Bad_Smell<br>
    Our hero Puff, whilst fighting all 3 enemy forces was keeping his usual eye on his lack
    luster partners, so the call from Suntzu didnt need to be placed...for there was Puff,

    <td width="600" height="1334" colspan="2"><font color="#FFFF00">Well with two victories
    under their belts our boys headed for their home front to brush up on their skills. The
    general(still believing hes the best in the clan - hello in there puff - tell us what
    color is the sky in your world?) has talked to the other commanders and they have decided
    to have some war games.<br>
    <br>
    upon reaching the bad lands they divide up into teams. (Of course Moonie trys for the
    'ole' stacking of them).&nbsp; Moony wants himself Att and Demoz vs that would leave Luck,
    Smell and Hangy. Luckie quicky counters that they shouldn't have to take Hangy (would seem
    no one wants him). Smell finally agrees to take the General and reminds Luck this is only
    practice anyway. Hangy says &quot; Come on guys we'll give em a whooping&quot; Smell and
    Luck don't even bother to reply.<br>
    <br>
    The war games commence,&nbsp; Att and Moon race forward towards Luck and Puff while Smell
    charges towards Att.&nbsp; This battle field reporter then saw the likes of nothing he's
    ever seen before - all the armies vanished.... there wasn't a soul on the field... like
    the practice war never took place.</font><p><font color="#FFFF00">I quickly ran to the
    battle com and tuned in there frequency.&nbsp; They seemed as confused as we were. &nbsp;
    Lucky told the guys to regroup and to stash the rubber swords and shields and to prepare
    for real battle. All but Hangover's armies did.&nbsp; Hangy's didn't have too because they
    were gonna use real swords anyway (this is about the only way Hangy could pull off a win
    with his limited military intelligance).</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">The next thing we heard blew us out of the water in the press box
    ... it sounded like the devil himself.&nbsp; We heard the following &quot;Ok bad boys
    youv'e supplied me with much business for that I'm greatful however I've grown bored, so I
    have a little wager for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Smell spoke up &quot;Who are you and whats
    the wager.&nbsp; &quot;The voice then said &quot;Im Lucifer the Prince of Darkness and
    I'll wager control of my kingdom and eternail life if you can beat my army. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    However if you lose you will do my biding for all of eternity&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Right away Hangy (putting out hells fires with all the pissing he
    was doing in his pants ) said &quot;No way no deal&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitude told him to
    put a lid on it and change his drawers.&nbsp; The others discussed the wager.&nbsp; After
    a 10 minute discussion Moony spoke up.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bring it on you over cooked side
    of bacon&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Hangy was now hiding behind Attitudes leg shivering with fear
    while the men planned their attack.&nbsp; It was decided Moon, Demoz and Luck would rush
    head long while Smell and Att would provide back up .&nbsp; I called to the men over the
    radio and asked what Hangies role was to be .&nbsp; Att replied &quot;He doesnt much
    figure into battles anyway so we dont plan on him hes our court jester if you will&quot;.
    &nbsp; With that the radio grew quite.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">The entire press core was on edge this was the biggest battle the
    world had ever witnessed.&nbsp; About two hours went by then we heard marching by
    hundreds.. no thousands of troups.&nbsp; Then we heard the bugle sounding the charge
    order.&nbsp; The next three days were the longest bloodiest battle Bad had ever faced.
    &nbsp; Dragons flew around the skys,&nbsp; the seas were blood, the forests burning.
    &nbsp; Wild animals attacked like they were possesed and the priests instead of converting
    were striking down men and machine with bolts of lighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could hear the
    crackling cries of the dying, the clanking of the swords the rumbling of the cats firing.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Finally on the forth day we heard cheering,&nbsp; seems Bad had
    pulled it off .&nbsp; Is it possible, could it be, The Bad Boys now ruled hell?&nbsp; Just
    then we heard on the radio &quot;You fought well bad however I shall return for another
    round but for now enjoy your rule while you can&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">With those words bad reappeared on the origainal
    battle field. &nbsp; Their armies were half the size they used to be (except hangover he
    was still at full strenght cause he slept through the whole thing).&nbsp; But Bad had met
    another challenge and had come out victorious.&nbsp; A much needed rest was needed so the
    men decided to take the weekend off before marching on.......... <br>
