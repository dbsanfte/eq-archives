        believed to be? It is said that thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was
        &quot;noticed&quot; by Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane of Sky.
        Pleased with the conditions on Norrath , Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen
        continent of Velious. Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several
        great wounds on the surface of Norrath, thus staking her claim to this promising new
        world.</font></td>

        endless tunnels, Brell Serilis quietly created a magical portal to a cavern deep in the
        belly of Norrath. From there the Duke of Underfoot secretly seeded the underworld of
        Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned home, sealing his portal within
        a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living Stone. It is rumored that the Heretics of
        Paineel know the location of Brell&#146;s portal and seek to tap its power, but Heretics
        are tight lipped and rumors are rumors.</font></td>

        <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is said that it was The Duke of Below who
        called the meeting. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord were in attendance.
        Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as to the origins of his information, told of
        Veeshan's discovery of a new and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her
        brood. Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips. He proposed and
        they accepted an alliance of sorts, ignorant of the fact that Brell too had already
        released some of his creations into the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would
        come to be known as Norrath was divvied up between these beings of power for the purpose
        of keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over
        Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of
        the planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of
        Norrath. In the abysmal depths of Norrath's oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge,
        hearty aquatic beings of great mental power. But is was on the surface of Norrath that
        Tunare's creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and beauty was only
        exceeded by their mastery of magic, drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of
        Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he
        rules, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He
        cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret
        this disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, The Prince of Hate
        snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them
        apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then gathered
        the quivering pieces of these beings of light and rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic
        image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing The Teir'Dal, as
        Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of
        Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown. </font></td>
