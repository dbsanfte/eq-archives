        #EverQuest on EFNet has had a hostile takeover by people belonging to a group calling
        themselves RPG Net. The old ops on the channel has taken back control of the channel and
        are discussing issues of tighter security before re-opening the channel to the public. The
        takeover attempt was made possible due to the fact that one of the #EverQuest ops(nick
        withheld) made a silly mistake of giving out his password to another person posing as one
        of the #EverQuest bots, and then using that password to gain access. Please check back
        here and on <a href="http://www.eqvault.net">EQ Vault</a> for the latest news on the
        channel. Both I and WarDragon are the ops on the channel. Rest assured that the monthly

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Just some bit of info about new RPGs in development
        that has come to my notice. <a href="http://www.valkyriestudios.com">Septerra Core</a> by
        Valkyrie Studios is a Final Fantasy type RPG. The artwork for the game looks very nice and
        the premise is set in a cyberpunk type world. If Valkyrie Studios can produce what it
        promises, this RPG should be a good contender against <a href="http://www.interplay.com/fallout/index.html">Fallout</a>.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another RPG is <a href="http://www.lmkworld.com/">LMK</a> by Larian
        Studios, a German development house. LMK stands for The Lady, The Mage and The Knight or
        Legenden Der MagierKriege in German. For those of you who knows German will realize that
        the German name for the game doesn't translate at all into the English name. It means
        Legend of The Mage(something), my German is very rusty so correct me if this translation
        is wrong. The graphics looks like Ultima 7 on steriods. I don't know much about the story
        of <a href="http://www.lmkworld.com/">LMK</a> as the English version of their site hasn't
        gone online yet. Judging from the graphics and what I could make out from the German
        description, this game is high fantasy. It should be an interesting game to watch for.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly <a href="http://www.nwcomputing.com">Might and Magic
        6</a> should be out in stores shortly. I will write up a short blurp on it once I get my
