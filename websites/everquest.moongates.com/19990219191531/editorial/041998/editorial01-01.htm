      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">A couple of weeks back, EverQuest designer
        Brad McQuaid was kind enough to participate in an IRC session and answer some fans&#146;
        questions about the upcoming game. We here at wewp.com thought that the gaming community
        at large might have an interest in seeing exactly what was said. Some of the questions and
        his corresponding answers are reproduced below.&nbsp; Questions are in bold; answers are
        in normal text. My personal commentary follows in italics.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Are the classes of magic in EverQuest individual to each class
        that uses them? For example, can any class learn from 2 different classes of magic?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: As to how long they'll be -- well, until we've
        tested what we've wanted to for that phase. There is really no way to predict this stuff
        accurately ahead of time.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Most of the spells are unique to that class, however
        there is some overlap. For instance, both a cleric and a shaman can cast healing spells.
        The exact nature of these spells and their names might be different though.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment: Realms of spellcasting is a great idea. Having
        every player able to cast every spell quickly cheapens the mystery and excitement of
        magic. I&#146;d also like to see monsters that can cast spells unavailable to players.
        Maybe we&#146;ll even get to see magic that&#146;s only accessible after an arduous
        journey to some hidden temple or library.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Does the new modeling system allow for
        guild skins or are you going to wait till post ship to implement that (if ever)?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: The new modeling system does indeed allow for
        guild skins and it is our intent to support those at ship, not after. How many guilds we
        can support though is still undetermined.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; &quot;Guild skins&quot; sounds like an
        interesting idea, if a bit Quake-ish. At a minimum, it&#146;ll let warring factions easily
        pick each other out in a large battle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Could you tell us more about how
        experience will be used to buy levels, stats, or skills?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: Experience isn't used to buy skills or stats
        per se. Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so much per level, and
        then also at certain levels you are allowed to learn new skills.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; This seems to me like a limited
        implementation of the Ultima Online system. Personally, I&#146;d rather see skills rise by
        a set percentage once a level is gained, or alternately allowing a character a set number
        of skill points to assign as he wants each level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will Monsters gain experience? Will they
        be tougher in their native habitats?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: Monsters don't gain experience, no, but they
        will fight differently depending on the terrain and time of day.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; If the designers can pull it off, this will
        speak volumes for the enjoyment of EverQuest. Smart monsters whose tactics vary according
        to the surroundings would be great opponents. It may even cut down on player killing: many
        of the pkillers I know hunt other gamers because it&#146;s more of a challenge. The
        smarter the monster AI, the less reason there is to hunt players.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Do you intend to allow for volunteer GM's
        who can lead their friends on quests, or will it be your hired ones only?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: At this point the plan is to allow some members
        of the public to be GMs, but I doubt at the same level of access and abilities as those
        who are Sony Employees.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Sony should reconsider this. UO implemented
        a very similar system with Counselors and Seers; all it did was breed resentment and lead
        to widespread abuses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will quests be reserved for larger
        guilds, or will we see NPC dictated adventure for those who opt for a party-based system?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: There will be plenty of quests for all sorts of
        people, whether individual, or in parties, or members of large guilds. As for GM run
        quests, we don't have infinite time and resources, so these will be limited, but not
        necessarily limited only to guilds.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Questing is the meat of a CRPG: the more,
        the better. A common complaint in other online games is that there&#146;s a lack of focus;
        nobody feels like there&#146;s anything to do except kill monsters, gain gold, and
        increase stats. Adding even generic quests can alleviate much of this. Custom quests are
        even better, of course, since they can change and react to player actions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will there be player owned vendors in the
        game, and will they have a weight and item limit?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: We think a significant portion of the economy
        will be people who buy, sell, and trade in towns and elsewhere. We don't feel we need to
        make them merchants 'officially' for them do be able to do this, nor do they require any
        additional abilities. Basically, anyone can be a merchant or a vendor.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; UO had the same system, until Origin
        realized that player owned vendors were much desired. Perhaps we&#146;ll see the same
        evolution as a result of the EverQuest beta test?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: How severe will the NDA be? For example,
        can we maintain journals of our beta adventures if we do not make specific technical
        references or include pictures?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: the NDA for the first few phases will have to
        be very strict, which means no information regarding the game can be published.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; This is unfortunate: it may mean that
        everquest.moongates.com and other gaming sites can&#146;t provide the coverage the gaming
        public desires.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Are you guys gonna try to make sure that
        every class is equal and has the same advantages? In a lot of games magery has been the
        most powerful skill and over shadows others.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: game balance is very important to us, including
        class balancing. We want to make sure all of the classes have compelling reasons behind
        them to play them, and want to make sure they are all useful in the game.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Hopefully this will be the prime focus of
        the beta test. Code stability, minimizing lag, and other technical issues are all
        important, but the main thing that Sony needs to remember is that this is a game.
        &quot;Game&quot; implies &quot;fun.&quot; Other online games have suffered from having one
        or two essential skills, without which the game is minimally enjoyable. Similarly, other
        online games have more useless skills than chickens have feathers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: How is the gameplay going to be through a
        28.8 connection? I have played all the online RPGs and the lag seems to be a big problem.
        Do you think EQ is going to be better in terms of &quot;lag&quot; than, say, Ultima Online
        currently is?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: I don't think most of the lag people are
        experiencing on these games is because they are using a 28.8. It's usually either server
        based lagged or their ISPs, or somewhere in the internet between them and the servers. We
        are designed the game such that we aren't sending out more data than a 28.8 can handle.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>We are doing several things to reduce lag, including
        using very mature network code (descended from our Tanarus game), as well as keeping the
        number of people down per server, to reduce server lag.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; All I can say is this: I hope it&#146;s
        true. I&#146;d be happy to see a game where the maximum number of players in a world is
        limited in order to keep playability high. The problem here is that this essentially sets
        a limit on profitability. Can Sony actually be persuaded to take a potential profit hit in
        exchange for satisfied customers? It&#146;s a rare thing in today&#146;s software world.</font></td>
