        (~aradune@intergate.sonyinteractive.com) has joined #everquest</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; hello all! <br>
        <br>
        &lt;BlkStaff&gt; any anouncements you'd like to make first brad?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; Welcome to the chat, and thank
        you all for coming. We are almost done sorting through the thousands and thousands of apps
        and hopefully will begin the first phase of external closed testing soon.I do appreciate
        everyone's patience, but we want to make sure we're ready. That said, I'd be happy to
        answer some questions.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Are there any limits (other
        than the pvp/nonpvp issue) to what kind of races/classes can be in the same party? Like
        can a dwarf and ogre (or a shadowknight and paladin) be in the same party even though
        their races/classes in general don't get along?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; At this time there are no
        restrictions to grouping in terms of race and class.&nbsp; Unless this becomes a problem
        in testing, it will probably stay that way.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; I'm thinking that it wouldn't
        be all that hard to kill any npvper... The problem is, people can enchant a monster
        someone is fighting (maybe a heal spell, defence spell, strength spell) which would enable
        the monster the npvp-er's fighting to kill him... how will that be handled? Is it gonna be
        prevented?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; We are continally brain
        storming on potential areas of +pvp and -pvp abuse, and are implementing quite a few ways
        to avoid most abuse.&nbsp; However, also keep in mind that a +pvp person figuring out a
        way to harm a -pvp person will be considered illegal and could result in banning of that
        person.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Since bards can sing, do you
        actually hear voices coming out of the computer or is it going to be some stupid skill?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; We're still working out the
        details behind some of the music and sounds, but the current plan is to have short songs
        related to both bard's singing and instrument playing.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; What kind of items can we
        expect to find on slain monsters??? And will being a certain class of Character affect
        you, as say going into different cities??</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; It all depends on the sort of
        monster you end up slaying... low level and common monsters will tend to have lower level
        and more mudane items, and higher level monsters will typically use more exotic items. As
        for classes, some classes are more related to one's alignment than others.&nbsp; And some
        cities are more sensitive toward other alignments than others, so you'd have to be more
        specific. For instance, I wouldn't want to be a necromancer and parade into the paladin's
        guild in Erudin.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Will Necromancers 'create'
        their undeads from thin air or will they need to have a corpse of a dead monster or (n)pc
        to make them? <br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; Animate dead Necromancer
        spells require a corpse as a target.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        &lt;BlkStaff&gt; 1) I was wondering how expierience was going to be awarded? In uo, it's
        who ever inflicted the final blow to kill it. Currently it is awarded with the final blow.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Asheron's call is going to
        have high, medium, and low attacks during combat. Is EQ going to have anything like that
        possibly better? And if you do have that did you ever think about possibly adding the
        ability to use a controler in the game and during combat making it maybe more like a
        fighting game? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; There are several different
        things you can do doing combat, and it typically involves using combat related skills,
        such as kick and bash.&nbsp; Monks, for instance, have many different types of attacks. As
        for using a controller to make it more like a fighting game, we are definitely against
        making it 'more like a fighting game' in that that genre is twitch based, and this is not
        a twitch game. But as for different controllers, we are looking into it.&nbsp; Currently,
        it's mouse and/or keyboard controlled. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Can you tell us if race
        actually makes a huge difference in game play and i dont understand what you guys are
        talking about with language. Do you mean that if im an ogre i can only talk to another
        ogre? or i can only understand an oge npc if you have ogre npcs?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; Race makes a big difference
        both in terms of your stats, innate abilities, and class selection options, as well as in
        how the world and its inhabitants react to you. As for language, the current plan is to
        have a 'common' tongue that would allow just about everyone to converse with anyone else,
        but to also have race specific languages that one could learn and become fluent in. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Will new NPCs, monsters,
        continents, and buildings be added to the game world after the release? Possibly through a
        mandatory patch? If so, how often will they be released?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; Absolutely -- all three.&nbsp;
        The plan is to keep the development team working away, adding on the world.&nbsp; This
        would either be done through periodic patches and/or the purchase of expansion packs at
        your retailer. <br>
        <br>
        &lt;BlkStaff&gt; Can characters be tagged with their guild name or abbreviation by guild
        leaders and untagged as well? If not, how will guilds be identified within the game since
        I know that skins are still up in the air?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; Yes, your official guild
        affiliation will be stored with the rest of your character information on the server, such
        as your name, title, etc.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;BlkStaff&gt; Question in its simplest
        form: Will EQ attempt to prevent the use of &quot;mule&quot; characters?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&lt;Aradune&gt; If they become abusive in our
        unique environment, yes.&nbsp; We'll find out in testing if this will be a problem in EQ. </font></td>
