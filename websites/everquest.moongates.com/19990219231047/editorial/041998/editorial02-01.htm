        <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are lots of possibilities, of course,
        like gameplay, accessibility, lag, etc. But after spending thousands of dollars and
        several years in online role-playing games, I think I can safely say that the most
        important feature of an online game is its communication system. By that I mean the ease
        of use and readibility of the chat text. Amazingly though, it often seems to be tacked on
        as an afterthought, or in the case of Ultima Online, apparently given little thought at
        all. (Or maybe too much thought.)<br>
        <br>
        You'd think it would be a no-brainer. After all, the only real difference between an
        online game and an offline game is the ability to interact with other people. So it just
        makes sense to give extraordinary attention to the means of providing that interaction.
        Think about it. In the end, it doesn't matter how wonderful a game you have. Eventually,
        people are going to have done everything there is to do, conquered everything there is to
        conquer, and seen all there is to see. But what will keep them coming back (and paying) is
        the community that forms within the game. After the initial rush of excitement over seeing
        a new game, the players start to form relationships with their fellow players. They make
        friends, make enemies, form guilds, even fall in love. And that is what will keep them
        coming back, long after the glitz of the game has ceased to impress them.<br>
        <br>
        For example, take the old RPG Neverwinter Nights, which ran on AOL for something like six
        years. Even when it was released back in the early '90s, it was old technology. It was
        buggy, plagued by hackers, was just 16 colors, and for all but the last six months of its
        life, it was $2.95 an hour or more. If you'd been there more than a month or two, there
        was probably very little you hadn't seen and done. Yet it was always full of paying
        customers, right up until the day AOL pulled the plug. Most of them had been around the
        same little game for years.<br>
        <br>
        Why was a horribly outdated game so incredibly popular? It's very simple. The community of
        players there was as close as any real-life community. There was always someone to talk to
        ... always something going on. Many people who met there ended up getting married to each
        other (myself included). Probably more by luck than design, Neverwinter had an awesome
        chat system that I still haven't seen rivaled. It was easy to use and easy to read. Nice
        and simple.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, take a look at UO. Go ahead and take a long look ... you have time with
        all that lag. Now here is a chat system that just begs to be dragged out behind the
        woodshed and killed with an axe. Gawd, what a mess. You couldn't follow a conversation in
        Ultima if you were the only one talking. Don't even think about trying to talk with a
        group of, say ... two or three people. I mean, really ... your text overlaps one guy's,
        then someone else talks, and her text overlaps everyone else's, but you haven't finished
        reading the first guy's text yet so you grab the damn mouse and try to highlight his text,
        only just as you do it disappears from the screen entirely, so you curse and drive the
        mouse back to the second person's text, and now hers disappears, so you click on the
        damned journal, and by the time the lag lets you see what you missed, you've missed more
        comments .... arrrgggghhh!!!! And that's just with two or three people ... try and talk to
        more people than that, and your monitor starts shaking violently. (Well, mine does anyway
        ... or maybe it's just me.) What an incredible waste of bandwidth. I'm sure it looked like
        a great idea in a room somewhere in Texas, but apparently little thought was given to how
        it would go over with people who had to actually use it. Someone should have told these
        guys that you shouldn't have to reach for a mouse just to talk to someone. Think about it.
        Your hands could be busy typing, or something.<br>
        <br>
        So don't even think about having a nice, quiet, intimate conversation with someone in
        Ultima. (Remember, online games ARE about relationships. You may not agree with me now,
        but at some point in the future you will.) I've said for a long time that the success or
        failure of an online game depends upon how well you can have a &quot;quiet&quot;
        conversation with someone. Neverwinter was great in that regard. You could yack all day
        with someone standing next to you, or across the realm. Or several someones for that
        matter. Simplicity at it's best. Ultima, on the other hand, makes it virtually impossible
        to talk with anyone who can't see you, and damn near impossible for anyone who can. And of
        course, nothing you say is private. You have to use a separate chat program like ICQ just
        to find out where your friends are.</font></td>
