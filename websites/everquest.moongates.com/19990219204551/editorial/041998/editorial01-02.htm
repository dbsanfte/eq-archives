        how... what can you tell us?</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: The
        applications will be up within the next couple of weeks, but as to when the actual tests
        will start, all I can say is when we are ready. We're trying not to rush things so we can
        do it right, however we are working long and hard to get the game to a point where it's
        testable by people outside Sony.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; The application is currently up, as most
        people reading this know. One of the closed site apps mentioned that people chosen would
        be contacted in early April.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: will hybrid races be able to cast their
        respective spells with weapons armed? </strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: You don't have to remove your weapons to cast a
        spell, no. *done*</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Good! This removes what I felt was one of
        the greatest irritations in Ultima Online. Allowing spell use while holding weapons
        especially makes sense with the Paladin and Shadow Knight classes. For that matter, why
        should a mage have to put away his staff when casting a spell?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: A lot of debate has been brought up about
        how hard it will be do raise skills etc., how will skills be raised? Will it be on a
        level/distribute points scale or more along the lines of practice a lot while you level?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: Your skills go up as you use them, but they can
        only go up so much per level, and certain skills won't be available to the player until he
        reaches certain levels.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Can you comment on the availability of
        boats and houses? Will they be in the individual ownership or guild only price range?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: I don't want to say 'guild only', but they will
        be very expensive and you won't see many who have them -- boats and houses are exotic
        items in EverQuest, something you'll have to work hard and long for and can be very proud
        of owning.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Hopefully this will prevent the world from
        getting too crowded with player housing. Houses and boats should be special items, not
        something you can buy after a single day&#146;s work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will combat be conducted in a 3d shooter
        style manner or in a UO style where you simply double click to attack and let the AI take
        over?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: Closer to the UO style, because this is not a
        'twitch' game, but not identical to UO either.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; No comment, except to say that I&#146;m glad
        we won&#146;t be playing a &quot;twitch&quot; game. Lag makes that style of game too
        unplayable by some people.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will there be small scattered islands
        surrounding the larger continents, or just 1 or 2 islands?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: I suggest you explore the world and find out --
        I don't want to take away the surprise and fun of exploration.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; I&#146;m hoping that this comment means that
        the world of EverQuest will be huge, taking at least several play weeks to thoroughly
        discover. The bigger, the better.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will the programmers actually play the
        game or will they just take input from their &quot;playing&quot; designers?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: When I assembled the team I made sure many of
        the artists, programmers, and world builders were into this genre. The entire team's input
        counts and they've all contributed to this game quite a bit. Accordingly I wouldn't be a
        bit surprised to see most all of them play the game quite often. This is a game we've all
        wanted to make and PLAY for many years.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; This is important. I&#146;d also suggest
        that the designers play under actual playtesting conditions: namely, using a system with
        minimum requirements, connected to the game through a modem dialing into a local ISP. If
        this is done, then the designers will have a much better idea of what the average player
        faces, and can possibly empathize with lag or networking complaints. It&#146;s also
        important that the designers create a character from scratch and run through all the
        gauntlets a regular player faces. Otherwise it&#146;s too common for employees to think
        that &quot;code is stable&quot; or that &quot;there&#146;s really no problem with
        spawning/skill gain/stat gain/gripe of the day,&quot; because they haven&#146;t really
        tried to examine those issues from a player&#146;s point of view.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: How do you intend to build an online
        cohesive society in EverQuest? What elements do you think will add to this environment?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: I think the focus we have on this not just
        being a player vs. player game but rather also a very cooperative game will help build a
        sense of community. Allowing people to group, to talk to other party members, and to talk
        to people regardless of where they are will help this. And the ability to split experience
        amongst a group will add to this as well. Also, keeping the server population down will
        enable people to recognize names more easily.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Experience splitting is a great idea. The
        Ultima Online pre-alpha had this feature, and it was one of the things I was very sorry to
        see disappear. It&#146;s a good way to promote player interaction on a level other than as
        mutual cannon fodder. &nbsp; It also allows experienced players to bring friends that may
        have just joined the game &quot;up to speed,&quot; so to speak. Allowing chat between
        groups/guilds regardless of world location may be a bit out of character, but it&#146;s
        really just an acknowledgement of reality. I have yet to meet a regular adventuring group
        in UO that doesn&#146;t use ICQ or IRC to stay in contact. These ideas suggest that
        EverQuest is pointed in the right direction: namely, ensuring that players enjoy the game
        environment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will there be unique items, such that
        only one or a few people will have them? And also, are magic items in general in abundance
        or scarce?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: There will be unique items called artifacts and
        I don't expect too many people to be awarded them, but please feel free to prove me wrong
        :). As for magical items, yes, many. A significant part of EQ is the amassing of magical
        items with all sorts of nifty abilities.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; This is something I&#146;ve wanted to see
        for a long time. Some MUDs have implemented this, and it&#146;s always fulfilling when a
        character completes a quest and obtains a legendary item. The flip side is that it will be
        really important to have these beta tested thoroughly: one &quot;superweapon&quot; can
        easily imbalance the entire game. It&#146;s incumbent on the beta testers to watch out for
        this problem and honestly report it if it occurs, even if that particular beta tester has
        the item.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Question: How much will the God you choose to worship
        affect your character? Is spirituality just a role-playing guideline, like alignment, or
        does it have in-game effects (say, different blessings from different gods)?</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Answer: It definitely affects your player in the
        game.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; This is just great. Paladins, clerics, and
        monks should certainly be different from each other based on their deity of choice. It
        would even make sense that other classes would derive some small benefits or restrictions
        from their choice of god. Perhaps a mage&#146;s fire-based spells are more effective if he
        worships the God of Fire, but he takes a hit when casting ice or water spells, for
        example. This single statement presents a way for EverQuest to stand out if the designers
        pursue it.</font></td>
