        There will be an in-depth review of what we actually saw at E3, we took almost 10 pages of
        notes on it. This review will dispell the rumors that a lot of the other sites posted. For
        those of you who can't wait, all I can say is a lot of the stuff that has been posted all
        over the other sites do have some truth to them, there are just some minor stuff that were
        posted as truth but are really either rumors or &quot;work in progress&quot; stuff. <a href="mailto:warren@wewp.com"><sub>SeVeN</sub></a></font></td>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Sorry for the lack of updates here for the past week. I
        have been extremely busy scouring the E3 floor for juicy bits of info on many many new
        games that will be coming out. I have gotten mails and irc threats from people asking me
        to get the E3 interview with Brad McQuaid online. Relax guys, the interview will be posted
        in due time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Why the interview isn't posted yet are due to several
        reasons. I'm extremely exhausted, I had about 12 hours of sleep in total for the entire
        time I was at E3, there were a lot of &quot;off the record&quot; stuff that was discussed
        during the interview and I will have to be editing them out and sending the final draft of
        the interview transcript to Brad for his approval before posting the transcript.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The transcript will be split into 3 parts, each part of the
        transcript will be residing on 3 different sites, namely <a href="http://www.eqvault.net">EQ
        Vault</a>, <a href="http://www.gamewise.com">GameWise</a> and of course right here at <a href="may1998.htm">Moongates Press</a>. There will also be an in-depth review of the stuff
        that Enj (<a href="http://www.gamewise.com">GameWise</a>) and I saw at E3. There will also
        be an article on <a href="http://eqx.simplenet.com">EQX</a> discussing the interview with
        Brad and some comments about what is happening with the development of EQ from all the
        participating sites in that article.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Moongates Press exclusive screenshots will also arrive
        soon after the EQ Public Relations guy, Shon Damron (He's the MAN!), returns from Hawaii.
        We will also have some scans of the photos we took during the interview with Brad post up
        that will include some very interesting scenes that the EQ team members are very excited
        about. These photos will again be posted on the 3 sites I mentioned earlier. So rest
        assured that YOU will be getting real juicy bits of info by the end of the week. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On a final note, EQ is going to rock hardcore, I sh*t you
        not, I haven't seen 1 thing I didn't like about the game after playing it at least an
        hour. The #everquest folks who showed up as well had almost the same thing to say too, EQ
        was so much better than what we had expected.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:warren@wewp.com"><sub>SeVeN</sub></a></font></td>

        I read a letter tonight that hit a tender spot and I'd like to share some thoughts on it.
        I know that a lot of people who are interested in EQ are UO refuges. Being either
        frustrated with the bugs or lag in UO, or with the almost non-existent Role Playing
        element. <a href="mailto:sith@walrus.com">Sith Dragon</a> wrote this letter I'm referring
        to which is mainly a farewell letter to the people who frequent his Ultima 9 site
        informing them as to the reason why he is shutting down the site. Here is an excerpt from
        his letter :</font><blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I've seen it go from simplistic, nearly non-existent
          gameplay to being enthralling epics that kept me glued to my computer for far longer than
          was healthy. I've watched as Ultima went from being a disk in a ziplock bag to being one
          of the cornerstones of the most-developed genre in computer gaming and, unfortunately, I
          watched as it died.&quot;</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ultima is one of the most beloved CRPG series and is my
        personal favorite RPG series for the PC platform. <a href="mailto:sith@walrus.com">Sith
        Dragon</a>'s letter really said it all for me, about what I feel is happening to the
        Ultima series and more or less to many new games coming out nowadays, where economics
        takes precedence over quality of the game.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You might wonder why I'm putting up such a long blurb about
        Ultima on an EverQuest related website. Well, I've been following the development of
        Ultima Online since the pre-alpha test. I have seen the members of the UO team go from
        friendly with everyone to outright refusing to admit anything is wrong with the game. They
        also begin to give those websites who would only say good things about UO more benefits
        than the sites that would be more unbiased in their appraisal of the game. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Honestly, I'm getting a sense of deja vu here with EQ. The
        EQ team is very much like the UO team at this point in their development period. Due to my
        disappointment with UO, I'm dreading that the day might come, if EQ doesn't live up to
        it's promises, that the EQ team would end up like the UO team. Hopefully this will not
        come to pass and that EQ would be the game that UO was suppose to be.&nbsp; Let economics
        not dictate what EQ should be but what you as a lover of the RPG genre want it to be. I
        would like to wish the EQ team Godspeed and Good Luck on their endeavour to bring the game
        out to us.</font></p>
