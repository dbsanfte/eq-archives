        <i><p>Our name, derived from the ancient language of the High Elves, means Fellowship of
        Light in the common tongue, and similarly, our motto translated into common speech would
        be, &quot;Let Honor Not Fail&quot;. </i></p>
        <p>Welcome to the first installment of the Featured Guild section.&nbsp; I would first off
        like to thank Fraterni Lux and Zealot for all there cooperation in getting this first
        review rolling.&nbsp; And now for the very first Moongates Press Guild Feature, I give you
        Fraterni Lux.</p>
        <p>Let me introduce you to Zealot, the player that maintains Fraterni Lux. I met Zealot on
        irc efnet #everquest, and so far I can tell you is that this guild has its stuff together.
        Drop by the page and see just how much he has put into this guild. This is by far the most
        in depth EQ guild page I have seen to date. The general written statements and
        organization he has thought out are impressive, and more importantly promote cooperation
        and harmony amongst the members.&nbsp; The old adage &quot;Too many chiefs and not enough
        indians&quot; always seems to apply to guilds, I mean how can you put a bunch of
        intelligent rpg'ers together and expect them to accept a leader.&nbsp; Well, Zealot may
        well have figured out the proper formula for this equation.</p>
        <i><p>The virtuous life is held in the highest regard, and since we believe honor is the
        highest expression of virtue, it is a value we cherish most. (W)e encourage racial unity,
        and welcome all that wish to pursue the path of goodness. Just as the noble elf is deemed
        good in the eyes of many, so too can a marauding troll or scheming thief be accepted in
        our midst, so long as they heed the calls of honor, recounting their evil ways and strive
        to use their skills for the cause of light.</i></p>
        <p>That is a very simplified view of their philosophies. Add in a good dose of general
        respect and a deep commitment to the forces of Light and you have Fraterni Lux. </p>
        <p>When I asked Zealot what makes this guild any better than the others if I were a newbie
        he put it quite simply, &quot;<i>Our organization, our dedication&#133;our superb
        roleplaying which is seen in our roleplayers channel, our sense of family and democracy,
        and our commitment to Virtue</i>&quot;. That sums it up quite nicely.</p>
        <p>To add another interesting twist into the fabric of roleplaying, Frat Lux in
        conjunction with EQVault run an irc roleplaying game.&nbsp; Much like the paper
        roleplaying games of the past the participants live out complex scenarios and plot lines,
        complete with dicebots.&nbsp; Set in Norrath this irc rpg takes on a depth and complexity
        I have never seen before on anything of the like.&nbsp; IRC and roleplaying just havent
        seemed to work up until this point.&nbsp; The purpose of this game is quite simple. &nbsp;
        To pass time until beta arrives, to introduce guild members and other players to one
        another, and to familiarize these players with each others style.&nbsp; This familiarity
        will go along way to helping Frat Lux become a power in Everquest.&nbsp; The game is run
        on irc efnet once a week on channel #eqrpg.&nbsp; In order to glean more information
        concerning this rpg go <a href="http://www.eqcentral.net/RPGrules.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I did a short interview with a few of the Guild members in their efnet channel #lux.
        What I left their channel with was a feeling of overall cooperation and dedication. To
        give an idea of the depth they are going to in their rpg style, there application requests
        a &quot;background story&quot; for your character, now I call that going to the necessary
        extreme to make the game worthwhile. Unlike some guilds I have checked out, they do not
        discriminate against any races or classes. I find this to be a nice twist other guilds
        should consider. Who said because you were a troll you couldn&#146;t be honor-bound?</p>
        <p>While not getting overly aggressive or anti evil, they did state that if it was deemed
        necessary they would go to war. On their relations page there are no stated enemies. A lot
        of young guilds use a public hatred to help recruit members, Frat Lux does no active
        recruiting or pressuring, it is all about whether you want to be there and if you can fit
        in. As far as their stance on pk/evildoers goes, Zealot had this to say; &quot;<i>We will
        not actively seek fights with others or start guild wars, However, should PK's harrass us
        or a certain guild disrupt order and peace in Norrath, we shall attack in the name of
        Justice and defend our honor</i>.&quot; Nice ways to avoid unnecessary attention and still
        stand up for yourself. Oh too often you find a guild too gung-ho for its own good. </p>
        <p>If Everquest is anything like UO currently is, the bad guys will outnumber the good
        guys. The only chance Good has on this world is through order, structure, and cooperation.
        These gentlemen (and ladies) seem to have all of this going for them currently. It will be
        interesting to follow this guild as it grows to see how well their theories transfer to
        Norrath. Since no one outside of Sony has seen Norrath to date, it will be interesting to
        see which guilds survive and which ones fall to the wayside. I have a suspicion a number
        of those on the wayside will be the ones that got a little overzealous and put there by
        Fraterni Lux.</p>
        <p>I have a strong feeling that Frat Lux is going to be a strong force on Norrath. &nbsp;
        After talking with them and viewing their unique formula and approach at role-playing I
        hope they are.&nbsp; This is one together group of people that is deserving of a shot at
        the title. </p>
        <p>As a final Fraterni Lux thought I leave you with this, &quot;<i>one of the cornerstone
        beliefs of this guild is that we must side with the forces of light.&quot;</i><a href="mailto:cfoley2@mindspring.com"> <sub>Belal</sub></a></font></p>
