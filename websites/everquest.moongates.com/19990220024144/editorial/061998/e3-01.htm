        Let me begin this report by saying sorry that it took so long. I know some of you at
        #everquest were actually looking forward to cast***ing me if I didn't get this report up
        by June 18th (Well too bad, you guys won't get your chance). I would like to give credit
        to the good people who were involved in helping make this report possible.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">In no order of importance, <strong>Brad McQuaid</strong> for giving
        us his precious time to do the interview, <strong>Shon Damron</strong> for showing us
        around the 989 Studios booth, <strong>Nick Pleis (Enj)</strong> (Where is that CD from
        SquareSoft that you promised?) of <a href="http://www.gamewise.com">Gamewise</a> for his
        participation, <strong>Styx </strong>of <a href="http://www.gamewise.com">Gamewise</a> for
        his constant bugging me to finish up this report, <strong>WarDragon</strong> for setting
        up the questions board at <a href="http://www.eqvault.net">EQ Vault</a>, <strong>Ian Ash</strong>
        of <a href="http://eqx.simplenet.com">EQ Express</a> also for his constant nagging,
        Moongates' very own <strong>Chris Foley (Belal)</strong> for his note-taking, <strong>Jason
        Beaumont (Soltan)</strong> of Wewp! Entertainment for helping us field Brad the interview
        questions, and <strong>Marek Gorecki (RaV)</strong> of Wewp! Entertainment for his taking
        of all the photos. <strong>Brian Ramos (Ariakas)</strong> of #everquest for spending most
        of his time playtesting EverQuest for us (next year Brian, we'll let you off the hook so
        you actually get to mingle with the models at E3).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Initial Impressions</strong></font><br>
        The Moongates team arrived at the booth of 989 Studios on May 28th 11:00am to meet with
        Shon Damron. Nick Pleis met us there as well. I personally went in there with very low
        expectations for EverQuest. I didn't think too highly of the screenshots I had seen before
        hand nor was I happy with the non-existent story or the lack thereof. I was there mainly
        for 1 big reason, hoping for an Ultima Online replacement since I was totally disappointed
        with what happened with Ultima Online. It says a lot about a game, when the pre-alpha is
        more fun than the released version. With a mentality like that, I stepped into the 989
        Studios room and began hoping for the best. All I can say is that I came out a very happy
        man.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shon Damron started showing us a little bit of the game
        engine by moving around in the town of Qeynos. A little bit later, Brad came over and
        started giving us a more in-depth look at the game. From the few sentences I exchanged
        with Brad, my conclusion was that this is a man who really cares about the game he is
        trying to make. This is the kind of mentality that I wished more games developers have.
        The thing that struck me the most was when I commented on how similar many of the commands
        in EverQuest was to MUDs, Brad replied, &quot;Why try to change something that works well
        and fix something that's not broken.&quot; I began to understand more of where the design
        of EverQuest is headed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of you are probably wondering what I thought of the
        graphics engine of EverQuest. Five words, &quot;More impressive than I expected&quot;.
        It's one thing to look at screenshots, but seeing the engine in motion really shows how
        good the engine is. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I did not see one thing I didn't like about EverQuest
        (barring the unimplemented stuff and the bugs). This is scary, something's not right. I
        haven't encountered a game in many many years that didn't have something I didn't like. Of
        course I didn't get to see everything that EverQuest was suppose to be but my impression
        of EverQuest as of now is flawless.</font></td>
