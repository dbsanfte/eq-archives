        McQuaid - <em>editorial by <a href="mailto:kildaren@mci2000.com">Kildaren</a><br>

        <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: I'm asking this again in
        case you lost it with all the disconnects... Will there be strength limits on weapons and
        armor? to balance out the game. Having powerful mages with very powerful armor is not
        good, and will your hands have to be empty to cast spells?</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: There will be limits to who can wield and use different
        times, and this is indeed to balance the game. To cast spells you do not have to remove
        the weapons in your hands. *done*</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; It only makes sense in a class-based system.
        In my opinion, this was one of Ultima Online&#146;s greatest failings: there are certainly
        &quot;best weapons&quot; and &quot;best armor&quot; that 75% or more of the players wield.
        Of course, this stems partially from the fact that in UO any character can learn any
        skill, with no restrictions. It will be nice to see weapons equippable only by specific
        classes, or armor restrictions on spellcasters. It should also make balancing out the play
        classes easier.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: When people talk in EverQuest will the
        text go above there heads or on a chat screen? I think it would be good if there was a
        chat screen but have it so that you only hear the closest 12 or so people on the screen. I
        think that would be better than it appearing over there heads as they walk around.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: There is a chat screen under the 3d view --
        messages do not appear above player's heads. One of the reasons for this (but there are
        many) is that you can receive 'tells' from people anywhere in the world, not just people
        in your view.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; I prefer seeing text messages appear above
        the players&#146; heads. It gives a sense of realism, and it means that it&#146;s much
        tougher to talk in front of other players without them overhearing, so to speak.
        Additionally, I find it easier just to look at the main play screen, rather than
        occasionally glancing down to see if somebody is talking to me. (I hated this system on
        Meridian 59, for example.) Maybe EverQuest will surprise me, however.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Will the game have weather effects? if
        so, will the terrain and its surrounding change with the weather?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: There will be weather effects, including rain
        and snow, and they will change the physics model of the area you are in. An example:
        surfaces will become slippery when it snows.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; Weather effects will be nice, visually. I
        wonder if they&#146;ll affect characters? Will players in plate armor suffer from
        heatstroke quicker than those in robes? Personally, I hope that this level of realism
        isn&#146;t introduced. It only serves as an annoyance, since it requires players to change
        clothing and thus battle strategies when traveling. There is a limit to how much realism
        we need in a game.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Can you tell us anything about the
        availability of catapults and siege engines? I seem to recall a screenshot something that
        looked suspiciously like on in the background.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: Can't comment as to siege engines, other than
        to say, yes that's what you saw in that screenshot.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; If siege engines are actually player
        manipulable, it could add a whole new dimension to combat. Imagine breaking up a mob of
        orcs with your trusty ballista!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--------</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Question: Are boats hollow? Will things be able to
        be stowed away below deck, and will you be able to go down into the boat?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Answer: The larger ships are indeed explorable and have
        rooms and such.</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comment:&nbsp; I must admit that this sounds great to me.
        I&#146;ll really enjoy being able to board a ship and roam through it, fighting my way
        into the treasure hold. It doesn&#146;t really add much else, but the fun factor could
        potentially be boosted by this enhancement.</font></td>
