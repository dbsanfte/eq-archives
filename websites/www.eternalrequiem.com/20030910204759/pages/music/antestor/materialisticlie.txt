Materialistic Lie

Satisfaction death reaction
Lifeless being life deceiving

Materialistic lie existing until you die
The world cannot give nor let ou live

Lustful bodies skinned to the core
still crying out for so much more
Needing eyes filled with desire
made to be just another liar

Turn away it's Hell to pay
Not a very nice place to stay

When you die the needing eyes cry
there's nothing left to consume
All that you've worked for falls through the dust
there's only Hell left to pay for your lust

materialistic lie existing 'till you die
The world cannot give nor let you live
