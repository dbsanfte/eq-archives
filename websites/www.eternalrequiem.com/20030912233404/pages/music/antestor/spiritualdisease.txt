Spiritual Disease

Living just playing the game
Lust for power lies within
Killing is no longer a sin
Striving for a mental illness
And slowly leaving reality

Lost without control
Left within your soul

Subconsciousness no turning back
Absorbed by their own needs
They cannot see where it leads
Left in an inner world of fantasy
Ending their lives as a human wreck

Playing just losing the game
Destroyed themselves with hate
Their souls will not be saved
Endless pain tormeted forever
God's rage awaits for them to see

Lost without control
Left within your soul
