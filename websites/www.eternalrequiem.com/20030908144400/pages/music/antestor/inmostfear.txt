Inmost Fear

Never to feel, nothing's too real
The place of doom, this empty room
Look inside the brain
The unconscious chain

All the time awaiting
Cretures my soul are taking
Who can break these chains
Only death remains

The inmost fear, it's all so near
The evil within, stored by sin
The dark side forsaken
Ready to be awakened

In my darkest hour
I can feel the power
Running through my vein
Driving me insane
Where am I to go
Still inside my soul

Reaching out from within
Who can forgive my sin

If I could reach the door
All this pain no more

No more...
