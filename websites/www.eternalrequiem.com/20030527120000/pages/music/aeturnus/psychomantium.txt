Psychomantium

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Lifeless corpse
Bag of blood
Carrion flesh
Nothingness
Powerless
Feeling death

Ashes to ashes 
Dust to dust
in the end
Die I must

All that I am all that I was
All I will see all I will be
All that I am all that I was
All I will be all I will see
All that I'll ever be

Death closes in on me
No future I'm history
All that I was or ever be
Gone for all of eternity

Absent warmth
Missing soul
Lacking breath
Black lonliness
Dark emptiness
So cold is death

No escape from death
No escape from death
No escape from death
No escape from death

Void being
Unseen
Worthless wealth
Life is past
Precious health
Forever is death
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
In the end
Die you must
