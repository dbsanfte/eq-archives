From Blackest Darkness

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Over my eye's the curtain falls
Once a man now not at all
A horde of demons take control
Binding my tormented soul
Angels from the pit of hell
Control weak alcoholic will
Body paralyzed frozen terror
Inside myself I scream in horror

God can't help you
I control you
Now you become a slave to my will
A puppet controlled a life to kill

Death of life my only goal
to take from you your living soul
To drag you down to burn in fire
With me into torment you die forever

From darkness I look upon
Terrible things my body's done
No escape I am told
From satan's demonic hold
They say God is just a memory
He is gone and has forgotten thee
Away from me my will was torn
No choice now I"m going to burn

God can't help you
I controll you
Now you become a slave to my will
A puppet controlled a life to kill

Because I was a fool
I am now satans tool
Killing men raping babies
I will destroy with no pity
For me the end is near
Won't be long 'till he is here
He will come take me away
To the asylum where I'll stay
