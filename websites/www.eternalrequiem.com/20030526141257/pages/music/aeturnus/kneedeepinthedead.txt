Knee Deep In The Dead

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Like everything that has walked or crawled
Death took me by surprise
Smashed my face against the wall
Judgement came down like a hammer on my head
My next stop was the pit to join the eternal dead
I burn in hell

Lies
Death
And satan scorn me
Last
Breath
Won't somone kill me

Somethings wrong in here
My blood is being spilled
The killer has become the killed
Nothing can be done to escape
This terrible darkness
Separation from God
I don't think I like this

Lies
Death
And satan scorn me
Last
Breath
Won't somone kill me

Always yearning
Ever burning
Here in hell
No relief
Unending grief
Rancid sulfer smell
Souls of those I killed return
Sounding death's knell

Demon teeth lash out at me
I scream out in agony
No one hears my soul's blood cry
Over and over again I die

Pain Death
I can't take this horrid torture
I won't wake unending nightmare
