Ugly

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Don't try to look inside of me
There's nothing in there you'll want to see
Hideous things that dwell inside
A dark and broken heart that's died

My mind is just a breeding ground
for evil thoughts that bring me down
Black and worm-infested hole
Rotten decaying morbid soul

I'ts ugly
What's inside of me
It's ugly

You asked to step inside
To view what I try  to hide
A tumor growing in my heart
Tearing all my soul apart

Infested with this horrible disease
With an appitite Impossible to please
Growing full on malignancy
Horrible Faceless Atrocity

It's ugly
what's inside of me
It's ugly

Eat my insides
Killing me my will subsides
Greed, Pride, lust fed
Come soon to make me dead
Dirt now covers me
Result of my stupidity
Six feet down I lie
In the end we all shall die
