Ancient Prophecy

Too Bad You Won't Live
But Then Again Who Does
Christ Was Dead But Now He Lives
And They Who Live They Are Dead

It's Not A Good Thing To Live In Fear
Someone Is In Fear Of Living
No One Lives Without Fear
Wake Up, It's Time To Die

Weak Is The Strong
Strong Are They Who Weep
Sad Is The Truth
And Laughs Are For Few

Not An Easy Thing
To Meet Your Maker
Everyone Will See Him Face To face
No Escape Beyond His Dominion

Plain And Simple
Skinned To The Core
