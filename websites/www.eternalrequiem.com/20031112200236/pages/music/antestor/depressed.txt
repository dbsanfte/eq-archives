Depressed

Fighting seems so in vain
Weakened by my own brain

Mindless torture blackening my thoughts
I'm flying away to my deepest decay
I'm falling through the black hole
I've lost my tears now I'm cold

Deeper, deeper, deeper I'll fall
I have no strength, hear my call
My soul is screaming, let me free
Take away this pain I see

Descending feelings where are you leading me
Desires of death rules in my darkness

In the shadows I'll die all alone
Blinding sorrow there's no tomorrow

There's no place my soul can hide
Slain by the thoughts that lied

Fighting seems so in vain
Weakened by my own brain
