Mercy Lord

Be gracious to me O God
In Thy  true love
In the fullness of Thy mercy
Blot out my misdeeds

Create in me a pure heart O God
Give me a new and steadfast spirit
Do not drive me from Thy presence
Or take Thy Holy Spirit from me

Against Thee I have sinned
And done what displeases Thee
Thou hast hidden the truth in darkness
Through this mystery Thou teach me

Creat in me a pure heart O God
Give me a new and steadfast spirit
Do not drive me from Thy presence
Or take Thy Holy Spirit from me
