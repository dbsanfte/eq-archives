Carnage:

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Animalistic rage inside
By no rules will abide
No fear of God or man I hide
Anger fills the shredding mind
Lucid thought is left behind
Thoughts to kill is all I find
Don't be fooled into thinking
You're exempt from the undertaking

I kill to live
I live to kill

Can't restrain the voices urge
Causing death of human scourge
Gouged and full now time to purge
Innocent blood is spilled
Sickning hunger is fulfilled
lust for human bodies killed

I will sow my blody harvest
I will reap when life is darkest
I will push my twisted will
I will kill and kill and kill

Bestiality abounds
No remorse or guilt is found
I see no judgement coming down
A lamb for the slaughter
A Sacrifice offered
Atonement for nothing?
