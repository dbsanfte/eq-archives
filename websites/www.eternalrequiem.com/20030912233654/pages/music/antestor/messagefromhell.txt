Message From Hell

I Got Through To You
And Destroyed You To
I Made You All Pay
Cause You Did Obey
You Didn't Stop Me
I Got Your Key
You Cannot Turn Back
I Got You On My Track
I Fooled You With A Lie
And You Did Not Deny
I Fooled You With A Lie
An You Did Not Deny
I Was Fooling You
Cause You Never Knew
