Thoughts

Living inside, restless and wild
Using your mind, just like you're blind

Imagination, hallucination
Distortion of the soul
Leaving you out cold

Nowhere to run, there's no more fun
See no solution to your confusion

Don't stay too long
You'll never know what's wrong
Open up wide, let God inside
