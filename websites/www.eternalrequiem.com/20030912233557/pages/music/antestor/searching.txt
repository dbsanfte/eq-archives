Searching

I'm searching for you, I'm searching for me
For some answers to see
For something to come for something to go
That's all I want to know

God creates, God destroys
Jesus dies so you could live
Drink the blood of Christ
The Son of Man was sacrificed

I'm searching for good, I'm searching for bad
Where is the faith I had
For someone to listen, for someone to care
I don't want to be a mayor

I'm searching for love, I'm searching for hate
Can it be too late?
For something true, for something false
There's someone who calls

God creates, God destroys
Jesud dies so you could live
Drink the blood of Christ
The Son of Man was sacrificed
