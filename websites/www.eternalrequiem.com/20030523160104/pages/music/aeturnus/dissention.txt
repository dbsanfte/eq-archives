Dissention

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Deception in the land of the free
Destruction of what is and what shall be
Forgotten principles of long ago
What happened? We do not know
Try to believe words spoken to me
Of freedom and democracy
But eyes of truth can plainly see
Revealed is there hypocrisy

From birth I've been lied to 
Truth is denied you
Hell we are put through
One nation under God
Liberty, justice, what a fraud

From birth I've been lied to
Truth is denied you
Hell we are put through
Truth is lost
Pay the cost

Greed giving birth to sin
A cancer eating them from within
Lives wasted in denial
Of truths they cannot reconcile

Planning their exoneration
Carrying out your exploitation
Total spiritual deportation
Only God can save this nation
Dissention, rebellion, anarchy
The government in ruins and they cannot see
What will become of their precious spoils
No more will they life off the working man's toils
