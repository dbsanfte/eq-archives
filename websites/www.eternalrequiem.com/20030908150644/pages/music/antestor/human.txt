Human

Temptations Fills My Soul
And Pain Rises From Inside
The Devil Works From Within
Our Sinful Passions Aroused By The Law
I Know That Within
What's Good Is Not At Home
I Try With All My Strenght
But Still I'm Condemned To Fall
The Law Took My Life Away
The Sin Put Me To Death
The Fainting Human That I Am
I Can Not Understand
I Do Not Practise What I Will
But I Do What I Hate
Who Will Rescue Me
From This Body Doomed To Death
Thank's Be To God Through Jesus
No Condemnation In The Lord
Thank You Jesus For Saving Me
