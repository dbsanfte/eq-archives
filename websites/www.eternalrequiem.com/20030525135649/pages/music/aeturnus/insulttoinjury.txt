Insult to Injury

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

My head is beat against a rock
My back is broken to break your fall
Decieved by the fallen man
Ensnared in the horrid plan
Bludgeoned with an iron hand
He will kill me if he can
I cannot survive this plan
he will not control this brain

A hostage of sin I cannot let you in
For what's inside of me is too horrid to see
A hostage of sin I cannot let you in
For what's inside of me is too horrid to see
Insult turns to injury 
Beyond words it tortures me
Tearing at my sanity
Destroying all my will to be falling in on top of me

Love is gone I cannot see
N more will I live in fear of you
I cannot I will no let you get control of me
You bite my heel but I"ll crush your head
I cannot I will not let you get control of me
Too long have I lived in terror
I cannot I will not let you get control of me
My broken insides have come out
I cannot I will not let you get control of me
I cannot I will not let you get control of me
I cannot I will not let you get control of me

You can't bring me down
It seems as if I've been cursed
Someday The situations will be reversed
Tied up flogged thrown away
Victory will come another day
Revenge isn't mine to take
I will bend but will not break
