Lost Generation

We Were Born To Get Love From Above
Selfish, Greed And Curiosity
Sin Burned Through Our Hearts
We Lost It All,
Cause It Made Us Fall
Selfish Endavuor Fails In The End
The Safety You Had Is Gone
You Are Left To be Alone
Blinded By Fright,
Your Eyes Have Lost Sight
You Do Not Know What You Are Doing
The Evil That You Have Done
Have Made You All Become Blind
Your Dream Is A Lie,
You Live Just To Die
Trust In The Word Of he Mighty Lord
Real Life Is In Gods Hand
Is It So Hard To Believe
To Him We Must Come,
He'll Give Us Wisdom
