Death From Above

Lyrics ©1995 Aeturnus

Planets Destruction around the bend
Time for the whole world to end
Off to last battle call
Men war in blood that's six feet tall
Armageddon is the site
For God to have his final fight
Nation's armies deal out death
Soldiers take their dying Breth
Drawing up the battle Lines
It's time for the death of all mankind

Death raining from the sky
Cursing God men surely die
Unwilling to repent
Another plague from god is sent

Gnawing tounges in agony
Nighttime falls on humanity
Facing God's fury and wrath
Satan takes a fiery bath
Thrown into the lake of fire
He burns forever the eternal liar
