We Are God’s Servants
Armed For War
Our Lives Are Sacrified
To Die For The Lord

Mountains Are Shaking
We’re Marching Ahead
God Uses His Servants
To Help The Mislead

Rejoice In The Lord
Through Him We’ll Fight
We’ll Get Our Reward
When The Time Is Right

/: The Lord Is Our Master
O Lord Make Us Win
The Lord Is Our Master
our strength is from within :/

God’s Word - Our Sword
The Faith - Our Shield
In God’s People
Truth Is Revealed

Lift Up His Name
The Battle Has Begun
Listen You Mortal
Obey, No Use To Run

The Almighty Is Here
Calling Your Name

We Are God’s Servants
Armed For War
Our Lives Are Sacrified
To Die For The Lord

Mountains Are Shaking
We’re Marching Ahead
God Uses His Servants
To Help The Mislead

Rejoice In The Lord
Through Him We’ll Fight
We’ll Get Our Reward
When The Time Is Right

/: The Lord Is Our Master
O Lord Make Us Win
The Lord Is Our Master
