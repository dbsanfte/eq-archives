<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.6.1: What is the deal with Callandor? Who will use it?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
The "Into the heart" prophecy (<a href="../../4_prophecy/4.05_karaethon.html">see section 4.05</a>), suggested that maybe
somebody besides Rand would remove Callandor from the Stone: "Who draws
it out shall follow after". In TPOD this did happen, although not in a
very dramatic fashion. Narishma went to Tear to retrieve the Sword That
Ain't for Rand. Bo-ring. Fortunately for our active imaginations, we got
lots of new fodder for Callandor theories.
<h2>What's the deal with the "flaw"?</h2>
<P>
In [TPOD: 27, The Bargain, 539-540], Cadsuane tells Rand about a flaw in
Callandor, which she claims to have discovered in some moldy documents in
the Tower Library:
<blockquote>
"It is flawed, lacking the buffer that makes other sa'angreal safe to use.
And it apparently magnifies the taint, inducing wildness of the mind. So
long as a man is using it, anyway. The only safe way for you to use The
Sword That Is Not a Sword, the only way to use it without the risk of
killing yourself, or trying to do the Light alone knows what insanity, is
linked with two women, and one of them guiding the flows."
</blockquote>
This not only explains the mess Rand made of things at the end of the Ebou
Dar campaign (which was compounded by the Ebou Dar Power Anomaly), but also
the megalomania displayed by Rand during and after the attack in the Stone
in [TSR: 10, The Stone Stands 136-138]. What insanity? As John Rowat
points out, "He went a little nutso, thought he could raise the dead, and
it took him an hour or so to realize that he could just fry all the bad
guys at once." Also, it explains a statement by SS in [TDR: 29, A Trap to
Spring, 276] in which she refers to a woman wielding Callandor. In
particular, she's talking to Eg and Ny, and says, "With Callandor in your
hands, child, you could level a city at one blow." Previously, that seemed
really silly, since Callandor was, as far as we knew, a male-only
sa'angreal. However, Cadsuane's statement indicates that Callandor can at
least be used by a circle of two women and one man, with a woman
controlling the flows (and thus, effectively, wielding the Sword That
Ain't). Given that SS has made the Dragon Reborn her life's work, it is
reasonable to suppose that she may have discovered and read the same moldy
documents as Cadsuane.
<P>
Now we must ask, why was the thing flawed in the first place? John Novak
gives us some ideas:
<P>
"Given that it was made in the shape of a sword and seems to have no other
real purpose than as a weapon, I think it is safe to say that it was
created either during or after the War of Power. In either of these
cases, it was probably the result of one serious-assed QRC (Quick Response
Contract). That alone will increase the probability that things aren't
exactly up to specifications. Further, if it was made after the war, then
by definition it was made after the Taint was created by the Dark One. I
would hazard a guess that men are needed to make a male-oriented angreal or
sa'angreal, so there's another potential reason for it to be screwed up.
Hell, for all we know, that was the last attempt ever made at creating a
male (sa')angreal."
<h2>Who will use Callandor?</h2>
When Rand finds out about the flaw in Callandor, he decides not to use
Callandor in the future. This means that we can just change all of our
"Who will retrieve Callandor" theories with "Who will use Callandor"
theories.
<P>
Logain is still the most popular candidate. This could be the "future
glory" envisioned by Min. Even though Verin said that Logain would be
burnt to a crisp trying to control the sa'angreal, we know by now that AS
don't know everything. Furthermore, any man who would use Callandor safely
needs two trusted female channellers with whom to work. (In fact, since a
woman must control the flows, better to say that any woman who would use
Callandor needs another woman and a man to assist her!) Conveniently,
Logain has started his own personal Green Ajah, and has bonded two Aes
Sedai. Perhaps Logain and his two women will use Callandor, before all is
said and done.
<P>
Another candidate for Callandor-using is the same Asha'man who brought it
out of the Stone, Jahar Narishma. He is one of the few Asha'man under
Rand's influence, rather than Taim's, and he demonstrated his loyalty by
bringing the Sword to Rand, rather than taking it for himself, so Rand
might trust him to use Callandor. On the other hand, given Cadsuane's
warning, and Rand's own experiences with the Sword, it is not certain that
he'd be willing to let <em>anybody</em> use it. In any case, the prophecy
does say "who draws it out will follow after." Narishma drew it out, and
perhaps "following after" means that he will use the Sword.
<P>
Eg's dream of a dark young man holding something glowing [ACOS: 10, Unseen
Eyes, 203] <em>could</em> refer to Logain and Callandor or Narishma and
Callandor, although I don't think that Logain exactly qualifies as
young, from Egwene's perspective (26 to her 18).
