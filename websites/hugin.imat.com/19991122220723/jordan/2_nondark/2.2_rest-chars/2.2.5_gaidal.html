<HR>
<P>
In [TFOH: 14, Meetings, 194], Birgitte tells Nynaeve that Gaidal Cain
hadn't been around in TAR for some time, and that she suspects that he's
been "spun out." Since we never see him in TAR after that point, it is
reasonable to suppose that that is the case. So, of course, speculation is
rife as to where and who he is. Some suggestions are (in order of ascending
age):
<UL>
<LI>Aviendha's or Faile's unborn kid (although there is no proof that either
of them is even pregnant)
<LI>a baby
<LI>Mat's lil' buddy Olver
<LI>pulled out of Tel'aran'rhiod bodily and an adult.
<LI>Mat
<LI>Uno
</UL>
<P>
<h2>Is Olver Gaidal reborn?</h2>
One of the most popular ideas is that Olver, the little boy Mat takes under
his wing in LOC, is the reincarnation of Gaidal Cain. Supporting this are
the facts that he didn't like Birgitte when he first met her, but they have
grown very affectionate towards each other. Olver is very ugly. These are
both "trademarks" of the Birgitte-Gaidal relationship, as described in
[TSR: 52, Need, 598]. Furthermore, Olver is very good at horse-riding (he
races and wins regularly in Ebou Dar in ACOS), and Gaidal shows himself to
be a very good rider when he appears at Falme in [TGH: 47, The Grave is No
Bar to My Call, 559]: "Gaidal Cain dropped his reins and, guiding his horse
with his knees, drew a sword in either hand."
<P>
In spite of the similarities, there is a big problem with the idea of Olver
being Gaidal Cain. Olver is nine years old [LOC: 5, A Different Dance,
122]. Gaidal was last seen in TAR at the end of TSR. That was, presumably,
before GC was spun out. Thus, only a year or less had passed between GC's
"spinning out" and Olver's appearance as a grown boy. That appearance by
Gaidal is not the only one he makes during Olver's lifetime. He appears
numerous times in TAR, as well as appearing with the other Heroes at Falme.
This is a big discrepancy, and requires some explaining, if the
Olver-Gaidal theory is to hold. Many explanations have been proposed, but
none of them are really consistent with the other information we have about
the Heroes of the Horn and TAR. Here they are:
<P>
<h3>The "Time Runs Differently" Theory</h3>
In [TFOH: 14, Meetings, 194], Birgitte tells Nynaeve that time runs
differently for the Heroes in TAR than it does for living people in the
real world: "Time [in TAR] is not like time in the waking world. I met you
here last ten days gone, as it seems to me, and Elayne only a day before.
What was it for you?" Ny: "Four days and three..." Birgitte: "The flow of
time here can shift in larger ways, too. It might be months before I am
born again, or days. Here, for me. In the waking world it could be years
yet before my birth."
<P>
People have used this idea that "time runs differently" to sweep the timing
problem under the rug. However, it is not explained away so easily. Sure,
time runs differently, but there is no indication that it ever runs
<em>backwards</em>, and it would have to do so in order for Gaidal to have
been reborn as Olver. When Birgitte discusses the varying pace of time in
TAR with Nynaeve, all of her examples involve time running faster or slower
for the Heroes, but always running forwards. El and Ny's meetings with
Birgitte occur in the same order for them as for Birgitte, even if the
amount of subjective time which passes between the meetings is different.
<P>
In support of the idea, people bring up the quote by Birgitte in [TFOH: 36,
A New Name, 407]: "Gaidal is out there, somewhere, an infant, or even a
young boy." The "young boy" bit is taken to mean that Birgitte thinks that
time CAN run backwards, and that a nine-year-old could be GC. In addition,
in [TPOD: 1, To Keep the Bargain, 47] Aviendha comments that "Birgitte
worried about [Olver] even more than [Aviendha], but Birgitte's breast held
a strangely soft heart for small boys, especially ugly ones." This has
been taken to imply that Birgitte is looking for GC, and continues to
believe that GC could be a small boy.
<P>
However, this is still inconsistent with the fact that, in every other
instance, time increases monotonically for Birgitte (and presumably for the
other Heroes) in TAR. The first "small boy" comment can be explained by the
fact that the pace of time does vary in TAR, and thus, that Birgitte, upon
awaking in the real world, had no idea how long has passed (in the waking
world) since Gaidal was spun out. For all she knew, it could have been
several years. However, by the beginning of TPOD, she must have learned
how much time had passed in the real world. So, why is she looking at ugly
children? She mourns her loss of Gaidal. It's not very incredible to
think that she has a soft heart for that which reminds her of him.
Furthermore, she may be deluding herself out of hope that Gaidal isn't
quite so young as logic says he must be.
<h3>The "GC Wasn't Born" Theory</h3>
Another proposal is that Gaidal was not born, but was somehow bodily spun
out in the form of a nine-year-old boy, was adopted by his "parents,"
and lied/misled Mat when he told him about his past. This theory does at
least attempt to get around the timing problem without resorting to time
running backwards for the Heroes in TAR. The "small boy" comments brought
up above are taken to indicate that Birgitte believes that this is a
possibility.
<P>
However, this idea has its own problems. Firstly, while in TAR, Birgitte
talks about being <em>born</em> (e.g. [TSR: 52, Need, 598]). Secondly,
when they're incarnated, heroes are supposedly unaware of what they really
are. Never being born is a pretty big hint. Thirdly, if people can
normally be spun out without being born, why would GC have been spun out as
a little kid? Why not make him an adult? It doesn't make much sense.
<h3>The Moggy-did-it Theory</h3>
<P>
In TSR, Birgitte told Nynaeve that, because she and Gaidal Cain fought
alongside LTT, Moghedien promised to make her "weep alone for as long as
the Wheel turns." So, Moggy's wanted to hurt Birgitte for a long time.
Her ejection of Birgitte from T'A'R in [TFOH: 34, A Silver Arrow, 393] was
probably not it -- that was a panicked, angry reaction to being shot,
striking back at Birgitte and getting away as fast as she could.
<P>
Later, in [TFOH: 54, To Caemlyn, 655], she has Nynaeve and Birgitte at her
mercy in T'A'R again, able to take the time to punish Birgitte properly --
and what does she do? "Birgitte was gone. A child of perhaps three or
four ... stood there playing with a toy-sized silver bow." Nynaeve later
forces Moggy to reverse the change, but it shows what Moggy likes in the
way of punishments.
<P>
Perhaps Gaidal suffered the same fate in T'A'R as Birgitte -- he was
transformed into a small child by Moghedien (she claimed to be able to make
such changes permanent). He was then pushed out of T'A'R into the real
world. She might have left Birgitte in the same condition if not for
Nynaeve -- or maybe, if Moggy belived that the Wheel would not spin Birgitte
out again unless GC was "properly" reborn first, and turning him into Olver
and ejecting him from T'A'R broke his ties to the Wheel, then she might
have just left Birgitte wandering T'A'R, waiting to rejoin Gaidal Cain
forever.
<P>
This idea is similar to the "GC Wasn't Born" theory, but by making
Olver/Gaidal a special case, it avoids the problems which would arise if
this was the normal method for Heroes to be spun out. We still have the
problem of Olver having parents. Perhaps they were part of the horde of
refugees in that area who found him and adopted him. (The time span
between Gaidal Cain vanishing from T'A'R and Mat meeting Olver is about
three months.) Another problem is that when Birgitte was ripped out of
TAR, she was dying, and needed to be immediately Bonded by Elayne to
survive. If Gaidal/Olver was ejected in the same way, he would have died.
Perhaps Moggy knows a different way to send a soul out of TAR, which
doesn't cause death. Another problem is that Moghedien turned Birgitte
into a child <EM>after</EM> Birgitte had been made flesh. At that point,
Birgitte dreamed her way into TAR (via the dream ring ter'angreal) just
like any other mortal. We don't know that Moggy could affect an
un-spun-out soul the same way she can a living soul. Furthermore, Birgitte
was vulnerable to Moggy because she "violated the precepts," as Gaidal Cain
said, by helping Ny and El. Gaidal didnot show any inclination to put
himself in a similar situation-- he disapproved of Birgitte involving
herself in the affairs of the living [TSR: 52, Need, 598-599].
<P>
A final problem with this idea is that it seems like a rather obscure
revenge. Moggy's idea of revenge (as evidenced by her threats to Nynaeve
in TAR) involve humiliation and debasement. Dumping Gaidal out of TAR as a
child might be humiliating for him, if he's aware of his situation, but
it's hardly on the scale of making Birgitte "weep for as long as the Wheel
turns." It seems like Moggy's ideal revenge would involve forcing Birgitte
to serve her, while being separated from Gaidal. Maybe Moggy had something
more extensive planned, but it was interrupted by her captivity?
<h3>The "Dreaming into TAR" Theory</h3>
<P>
A third attempt to explain the problem of Olver's age involves supposing
that reborn Heroes can dream themselves into TAR in their "archetypical"
form. Shayne Macfarlane explains, "Maybe, when he dreams, Olver appears as
Gaidal in TAR. Birgitte doesn't know that he has already been born again,
and only sees him when Olver is asleep. Time passes differently in TAR, so
she hasn't realized that he has been born again - after all, a young child
sleeps a lot. As Olver gets older he sleeps less, and Birgitte starts to
notice his absences."
<P>
While this would indeed solve the problem, it doesn't exactly fit what
we've seen happen. From the way Birgitte described Gaidal's "spinning
out," she saw him on a regular basis, and then she stopped seeing him in
TAR altogether. If the "dreaming" theory was true, we'd expect that he'd
appear less and less frequently as the child grew older and developed
his/her own personality; Birgitte would have noticed a gradual fading
away, not an abrupt disappearance. Also, if that was the way things worked
regularly, Birgitte would have known it, and explained the Reborn-Heroes
business that way.
<P>
<h2>Is anybody else Gaidal?</h2>
Many other characters have been suggested as Gaidal's identity. Two of the
most popular are Mat and Uno. Any such suggestion has all the same timing
problems as the Olver idea, but to a much greater degree. There is a
further problem with the idea of Gaidal being Mat or Uno or anybody who
was present at Falme. That is, Gaidal Cain's soul appeared in answer to the
Horn's summons. Neither Mat or Uno passed out or exhibited any symptoms of
a missing soul. Mat even conversed with Gaidal.
<P>
Another suggestion is that perhaps Gaidal has not been spun out, after all.
Daniel Bartlett explains, 'What if he wasn't [spun out]? Moggy promised
Birgitte to "weep alone for as long as the Wheel turns?" What if she
delivered on that promise and GC isn't around simply because Moggy got him?
Would this explain everything, and Birgitte's looking out for all those
little boys simply be wishful tihnking? Much easier than explaining how
Olver is Gaidal and was somehow born at age nine with the memories of
father killed by the Shaido and a mother dead of an illness.'
<h2>Any conclusions?</h2>
We can conclude that, of the characters we've seen so far, Olver is the most
likely to be Gaidal Cain. However, there are some serious problems with
Olver's age. Thus, if Olver is indeed GC, we need an explanation for how
he got to be nine years old, when GC was supposedly spun out a year ago
or less.
