<h1 align="center">2.6.5: The Mystery of the Salidar Sitters</h1>
<P align="center">[P. Korda, John S. Hamby, Karl-Johan Noren]</P>
<hr>
<p>
In [TPOD: 16, Unexpected Absences, 340-341], Siuan tells Egwene about a
pattern she has noticed about the Salidar Hall:
<blockquote>
"Aside from Romanda and Moria, the Sitters chosen in Salidar are... they're
too young.... Escaralde is the oldest, and I'm sure she isn't much
past seventy.... It isn't often the Hall has held more than one Sitter
under a hundred, and here we have nine! ... When a woman is raised too
young, there's a reason.... This time, there were more than enough sisters
of proper age to choose from, and I can't see five Ajahs deadlocking on all
of them. There is a pattern, and I mean to pick it out."
</blockquote>
Egwene doesn't believe that there is anything suspicious going on. However,
SS has been described several times as being very good at noticing
patterns and solving puzzles. From [TPOD: 16, Unexpected Absences, 340]:
"Siuan had shown herself very skilled at detecting patterns where others
saw only a jumble." In [L:NS, 666], Moiraine thinks, "There were too many
questions, and not an answer to be found. She wished Siuan were there;
Siuan was very good at puzzles, and nothing shook her." So, since SS is so
smart, we shouldn't follow Eg's suit by dismissing Siuan's ideas out of
hand.
<P>
Now, to try to figure out what the deal is with the Sitters, we'll
consider several things: the factions, who is new, who is "too young," how
they voted on the War Vote, how they reacted to the result of the War
Vote, whether they stood for Egwene as Amyrlin in the first vote, and
whether they've promoted any hair-brained schemes which could have proven
disastrous for the Salidar AS.
<h2>Who's Who among the Salidar Sitters</h2>
<P>
What information do we have?
<ol>
<LI>In [LOC: 35, In the Hall of the Sitters, 472-476] Egwene is raised:
voting occurs, and at the end, the Sitters line up by age. This last
bit establishes Romanda, Lelaine, and Janya as the three oldest Sitters,
and Delana as being one of the nine youngest.
<LI>From [ACOS: 11, An Oath, 214], we find that all the original sitters
but one follow Romanda or Lelaine. The factions are given in [TPOD:
16, Unexpected Absences, 327]. Lelaine's followers are Faiselle,
Takima, and Lyrelle. Romanda's followers are Magla, Saroiya and
Varilin.
<LI>Siuan's explanation of her "too young" theory to Egwene [TPOD: 16,
Unexpected Absences, 340-341]. From this we learn that there are nine
Sitters who are too young.
<LI>In the same passage, we find that five of the six Ajahs in Salidar raised
Sitters who are too young.
<LI>Of the Sitters raised in Salidar, only Romanda and Moria are old enough.
<LI>Various passages indicate that one or another of the Sitters is
newly-raised, or one of the original ones.
<LI>In [TPOD: 19, The Law, 385-389], the Hall votes on declaring War on
Elaida. The votes of all the Sitters are given.
<LI>Given the rarity of young Sitters, it is not too much of a stretch to
assume that all of the young Sitters are newly-chosen. If nothing else,
Siuan would have mentioned a young original sitter as an exception when
she was explaining her theory. This would mean that there are 11 new Sitters
and 7 original ones. (Note that it <EM>is</EM> possible that there is
a young, original Sitter, but that just complicates matters, so for
now, we'll assume not.)
<LI>From 1, 2, and 5, we can conclude that Janya is the independent
original Sitter.
<LI>From 4 and 5, the Blue Ajah is the only one which didn't raise a
too-young Sitter. (Lyrelle is one of the original Sitters.)
<LI>Seven original Sitters, less Lelaine and Janya, makes five originals
who follow Lelaine or Romanda. Since there are six followers
altogether, only one of the followers is newly-raised.
<LI>After Delana tosses her cookies in [TPOD: 19, The Law, 388], we
have, "Magla and Saroiya... looked as though they might follow her
example. No others who had been chosen in Salidar, though." This
passage is ambiguous, in that we don't know whether "others" refers to
Delana or to Magla and Saroiya, and thus, we don't know if this means
that Magla and Saroiya are newly-chosen or original. However, whichever
way it is meant, it indicates M and S were either both chosen in
Salidar, or both were not. Since they both follow Romanda, both of
them cannot be newly-chosen (because of 11). So, both of them must be
original Sitters.
<LI>From 2, 9, and 12, we can conclude that the Salidar Sitters who were
members of the original Hall are Lelaine, Lyrelle, Janya, Takima, Magla,
Saroiya, and either Varilin or Faiselle.
</OL>
<P>
From [LOC: 35, In the Hall of the Sitters, 472-476], we know that Delana,
Kwamesa, Janya, and Malind stood for the first vote. Samalin, Lelaine, and
Romanda did not. With respect to hair-brained schemes, in [TPOD: 16,
Unexpected Absences, 331] there is a list of suggestions from the sitters
on how to raise money. Moria proposed to stop paying the soldiers, which
any idiot knows would mean the army would melt away. Malind suggested
hitting up nearby nobles for donations, something Egwene thought would turn
the whole countryside against them. Salita wanted to levy a tax on
villages, which Egwene also thought was a bad idea. In [ACOS: 11, An Oath,
215], we hear about a proposal from Delana that Elaida be publicly
denounced as Black Ajah, a move which would cause public confidence in Aes
Sedai to plummet. Romanda suggests that all sisters be interrogated about
being BA, and any who refuse should be shielded and confined, a move sure
to cause a mutiny. In response to Romanda's idea, Lelaine wants Egwene to
forbid mention of the BA as "fomenting discord." This plan "would have
every sister convinced not just that there was a Black Ajah, but that
Egwene was part of it." [ACOS: 12, A Morning of Victory, 247]

<h2>What is the secret in the Hall?</h2>
<P>
Siuan thinks that the "pattern" in the hall is connected with the relative
youthfulness of the new sitters. In fact, when the War Vote is being taken,
and Egwene doesn't get as many votes as she and Siuan expected, Egwene
thinks that the discrepancy might be due to Siuan's pattern.
<P>
Here are some ideas for what the Secret of the Salidar Sitters might be.
<P>
1. Egwene is actually right when she thinks "Older sisters were more likely
to be tied to old ways...everything was shifting... Surely that was why
younger women, more open to the new, had been chosen." [TPOD: 16,
Unexpected Absences, 341] Conceivably, this could be true, but see the
commentary on Siuan's puzzle-solving ability at the start of this section.
<P>
2.The new young Sitters are sacrificial lambs in case things go wrong,
along the lines of Elaida's thoughts on Egwene being chosen as Amyrlin over
Romanda, Sheriam or Lelaine [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 25]. Note
that Elaida is not exactly correct; Siuan and Leane guided the Salidar Six,
and through them the Hall, into choosing Egwene. However, the people
behind choosing the new Sitters (possibly the seven original sitters,
Romanda and Lelaine, or the Salidar Ajah heads?) may have been of Elaida's
school of thought, and so it might still apply to the choice of Sitters in
Salidar. The anomalies of Romanda and Moria can be explained as
exceptions. The Blues have little to nothing to gain from a
re-approachment under Elaida so choosing a traditional Sitter who will
follow Lelaine (so was the idea when Moria was chosen) and present a strong
stable front for the Blues makes sense. Romanda clearly did not think that
the Salidar effort was going to fail or else she would not have joined,
right? After all if she went to Salidar in hopes of becoming Amyrlin she
must have thought it worth the consequences of failure.
<P>
3. All the too-young Sitters are Black Ajah. After all, Delana is BA and
too young. One problem with this is that only Delana upchucks as a result
of the vote. Then again, Delana is probably the only BA who knows about
Halima. Another problem is that this supposes that a full half the Salidar
Hall is BA. While the Hall is disorderly, it sure doesn't show any evidence
of being dominated by Darkfriends.
<P>
4. Perhaps the too-young Sitters were all picked by the Six. But for what
purpose beyond the obvious of hoping to control the Hall? Was it an
attempt to have a Hall and yet keep it from becoming effective in the eyes
of the other sisters? That young Sitters would not be taken seriously or
have as much clout? Or perhaps young sisters suddenly raised would
be blinded by the honor and happily let the Six continue their rule? Was
it because they already had an idea of Egwene as Amyrlin and figured that
Sitters who were younger than normal would be more open to raising an
eighteen year-old as Amyrlin?
<P>
However, It seems from Siuan's comment [TPOD: 16, Unexpected Absences,
341], that it was the Ajahs that chose the Sitters in Salidar. Certainly
Siuan would have known right away if Sheriam and crew had gone out and
hand-picked nine Sitters, right? Also, as far as we know, Myrelle is the
only Ajah Head among the Salidar Six, and thus the only one we can expect
to have any clout in Sitter-choosing. From Siuan's statement about the
choosing of Moria, it seems that Lelaine hand-picked Moria, with Lyrelle's
tacit consent. It <em>is</em> possible that Morvrin, Beonin and Carlinya
are heads of their respective Ajahs in Salidar. But even if that
is so, it still leaves open the question of Salita Toranes of the
Yellow. No Yellow member of the Salidar Six.
<P>
5. The nine were chosen in hopes of never being able to reach a
consensus since they all go their own way (this was anticipated).
<P>
6. The nine were chosen in hopes that they <em>would</em> be able to reach the
lesser consensus even if Lelaine and Romanda were filibustering, as it would
only take one or two Sitters to break ranks to accomplish something.
<P>
7. They were chosen as the best possible means of bringing the Two
Towers together. As young go-getters they would be anxious to act. The
fact that the Hall has a tendency to sit on its collective ass seems to
refute this.
<P>
8. Chosen because they would have less loyalty and awe for the Tower
as an institution and perhaps be more likely to keep the Tower split?
This would fall back once again on BA influence of sorts. Also their
inexperience might lend to this as they would not be able to come
together to get anything major accomplished. Instead, the Hall in Salidar
ends up with two factions that refuse to compromise and nine others who
all don't want an accord that brings them under Elaida but don't know
what their next step should be. Or if they do, they can't get it through
because Romanda and Lelaine consider them children.
<P>
9. Offshoot of 8. Young Sitters were chosen to keep either Romanda
or Lelaine from gaining a clear advantage. Neither would take the
young Sitters seriously, yet could not do so openly as it would undermine
their own positions in the Hall as a legitimate Sitter. At least some
of the young Sitters clearly have issues with being taken seriously
as a Sitter. Might this include how they are treated in the Hall
itself by the venerable Sisters from the Yellow and the Blue?
<P>
10. The nine young Sitters are all Elaida's agents. This is not very
likely, since all the young Sitters except the one in Lelaine or Romanda's
faction voted in favor of declaring War on Elaida.
<P>
11. Escaralde is the oldest of those chosen in Salidar; she is "not much
past seventy." What if the Sitters were chosen due to their age? Not so
much as they are young; but that their age precludes them from having been
in the Tower at a certain time. What this may have been I have no idea.
But maybe the fallout, while not too major, was enough to make any of the
older sisters reluctant to place themselves in a 'target' position. Or
maybe if something did happen it was enough to prompt avoidance of any who
might have been associated with the event. This hypothetical event would
have taken place before Escaralde came to the Tower as a Novice-- probably
between the ages of fifteen and twenty. That would put the timing of the
event at least forty-five to sixty years ago. We don't know of
any significant events involving the Tower during that time period. The AS
might have given themselves a margin of error, so the event could have
happened longer than sixty years ago. Note that all sorts of things seem
to have occurred seventy years ago.
<P>
Looking at the table, the only apparent pattern involving the young Sitters
is that they all voted in favor of War on Elaida, except for the one who
follows Lelaine or Romanda (Faiselle or Varilin). However, Egwene and
Siuan expected <em>more</em> votes in favor of War than they actually got.
This means that more of the older Sitters were expected to vote for War
than actually did. It's reasonable that the Blues all voted for War. All of
Romanda's faction voted against War, as did the two non-Blues (Faiselle
and Takima) in Lelaine's-- much to Lelaine's surprise and displeasure.
<P>
In any case, there seems to be too little information to figure out
the reason behind the youth of the new Sitters.
