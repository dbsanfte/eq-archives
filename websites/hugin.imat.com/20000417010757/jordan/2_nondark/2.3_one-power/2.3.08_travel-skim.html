<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.3.8: What is the difference between Skimming and
Traveling?</h1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">[P. Korda, John Novak]</P>
<HR>
<P>
Skimming requires knowledge of destination and Traveling requires knowledge
of origin [TFoH: 6, Gateways, 121]. For example, Aviendha Travels to
Seanchan which she obviously doesn't know a thing about, but she knew the
bathroom real well.
<P>
Skimming is what Rand does in [TSR: 58, The Traps of Rhuidean, 670-671] to
chase Asmodean to Rhuidean, and in [TFoH: 54, To Caemlyn, 645-646] to bring
the Aiel strike force to Caemlyn. It apparently works by creating a tunnel
through some other space from the point you are at to the point where you
want to go. Going through this tunnel takes a finite amount of time, and
one person can chase another through it, as Rand chased Asmodean. Egwene
learns from Moggy that Skimming (as opposed to Travelling) is "a way to
journey from a place you did not know well to one you did." [ACOS: 9, A
Pair of Silverpike, 175]. The above "chasing" thing contradicts something
Egwene says about it in [ACOS: 12, A Morning of Victory, 241]: "If two
sisters wove gateways on the same spot only moments apart, aiming to Skim
to the same place, they would not see one another, not unless it was
<em>exactly</em> the same spot, with the weaves <em>exactly</em>
identical." So, either this is a difference between men's skimming and
women's, or Rand managed to <EM>exactly</EM> duplicate Asmo's weave, or RJ
messed up. The Skimming place has some similarity to TAR, and may
<em>be</em> a part of TAR. [ACOS: 12, A Morning of Victory, 240].
<P>
Traveling is a far simpler, far more direct, far quicker means of
transport. Traveling opens a "gate" from one physical point to
another. Men do this by boring a hole in the Pattern, so to speak,
while women do this by making the Pattern in both locations identical
[LoC, 37, When Battle Begins, 491]. Moghedien and Rand are of the
opinion that using the wrong method would be catastrophically
bad. Stepping through the gate, one instantly changes location.
Asmodean tells Rand that, unlike Skimming, Traveling requires only
knowledge of the starting point [TFoH: 6, Gateways, 121].
<P>
Now, it's been suggested that what the 3rd Age Randlanders call
"Traveling" is not the same thing as the old-time, AOL Traveling.
The only evidence to support this theory is the manner in which Ish
manifests himself in the TEOTW prologue. He kind of shimmered and
appeared--no mention of a "gate" or a doorway. We've not seen anybody
else do this, though; all of the other Forsaken use the standard Gate
method. This "other" way of Traveling may involve the TP; we know
that Ishy used it extensively. It is possible to do a Traveling-like
thing with the TP, by "stepping outside the Pattern," as the Watcher
does in [ACOS: 20, Patterns Within Patterns, 358].
