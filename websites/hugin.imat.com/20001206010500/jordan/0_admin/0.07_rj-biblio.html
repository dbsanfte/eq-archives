<HR>
<P>
"Robert Jordan" is actually a pseudonym for James Oliver Rigney, Jr., under
which he has written the "Wheel of Time" fantasy series as well as several
books of the "Conan" series (<cite>Conan the Invincible, C.t. Unconquered,
C.t.Magnificent, C.t.Victorious, C.t.Triumphant, C.t.Destroyer,
C.t.Defender</cite>). Other pseudonyms which he has used are Reagan O'Neal
(the "Fallon" series of historical novels), Jackson O'Reilly
(<CITE>Cheyenne Raiders</CITE>, a Western), and Chang Lung (contributions
to various periodicals including Library Journal, Fantasy Review, Science
Fiction Review). [Source: Contemporary Authors vol. 140]. Many, if not
all of the Conan books are still in print. Tor Books has re-released the
Fallon books under the "Forge" imprint, with covers done by infamous
fantasy artist Darrell K. Sweet.
<P>
RJ has told several people, at signings and in letters, that if^H^H
when he completes TWOT, he plans to write another fantasy tale set in a
Seanchan-like culture. The main character will be a more mature figure
than Rand, and the tale involves him being shipwrecked in
pseudo-Seanchan, where whatever is cast up on the shores of one's
estate becomes one's property, even people. Doubtlessly, there'll be
many changes from RJ's description to the actual story, but it gives
us something to look forward to.
