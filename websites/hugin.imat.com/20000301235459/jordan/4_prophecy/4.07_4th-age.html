<hr>
<P>
Are these things written in the 4th age from the Age after the books, or
are they from the previous 4th age (i.e SIX ages ago)? Are they really
prophecy? I think they are supposed to be histories of Rand's age, written
during the age which will start with the end of the last book. Thus, they
are not prophetic in the technical sense-- they are supposedly written
after the fact-- but they are prophetic to <EM>us</EM>, because we don't
know the end of the story.

<h2>From <CITE>The Eye of the World</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TEOTW: prologue, Dragonmount, xv]
<blockquote>
And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would
come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the
hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died. And men
cried out to the Creator, saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the
World, let the Promised One be born of the mountain, according to the
prophecies, as he was in ages past and will be in ages to come. Let
the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow
and the valleys give forth lambs. Let the arm of the Lord of the
Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend
us. Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time. (From <CITE>Charal
Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon</CITE>. Author unknown, the
Fourth Age)
</blockquote>
The "Dark laying heavy on the land" and the failing of plants refer to
the two bouts of (Shadow-caused) bad weather we've had in the series thus
far, which have caused crops to get messed up: the super-long winter in
TEOTW, and the recent hot spell. The reference about singing and
fertility <EM>could</EM> mean that the Song will be found, but it could
just as well be meant figuratively.

<h2>From <CITE>The Dragon Reborn</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TDR: End Prophecy]
<blockquote>
And it was written that no hand but his should wield the Sword
held in the Stone, but he did draw it out, like fire in his
hand, and his glory did burn the world. Thus did it begin. Thus
do we sing his Rebirth. Thus do we sing the beginning.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled--Rand took out the Sword in the Stone.

<h2>From <CITE>The Shadow Rising</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TSR, End Prophecy]
<blockquote>
And when the blood was sprinkled on ground where nothing could
grow, the Children of the Dragon did spring up, the People of the
Dragon, armed to dance with death. And he did call them forth
from the wasted land, and they did shake the world with
battle. (from <CITE>The Wheel of Time</CITE> by Sulamein so Bhagad, Chief
Historian at the Court of the Sun, the Fourth Age.)
</blockquote>
Fulfilled--Rand brought the Aiel out of the Waste to do battle.

<h2>From <CITE>The Fires of Heaven</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TFOH, End Prophecy]
<blockquote>
And the Glory of the Light did shine upon him.<BR>
And the Peace of the Light did he give men.<BR>
Binding nations to him. Making one of many.<BR>
Yet the shards of hearts did give wounds.<BR>
And what was once did come again<BR>
--in fire and in storm <BR>
splitting all in twain.<BR>
For his peace...<BR>
--for his peace...<BR>
...was the peace...<BR>
...was the peace...<BR>
...of the sword.<BR>
And the Glory of the Light did shine upon him.<BR>
(from <CITE>Glory of the Dragon</CITE>, composed by Meane sol Ahell,
the Fourth Age)
</blockquote>
General prophecy. Not too informative.

<h2>From <CITE>Lord of Chaos</CITE></h2>
<P>
[LoC: Header Prophecy]
<blockquote>
The lions sing and the hills take flight.<BR>
The moon by day, and the sun by night.<BR>
Blind woman, deaf man, jackdaw fool.<BR>
Let the Lord of Chaos rule. <BR>
(chant from a children's game heard in Greater Aravalon, the Fourth Age)
</blockquote>
Your guess is as good as mine as to whether this is actually
prophecy/historical or no.
