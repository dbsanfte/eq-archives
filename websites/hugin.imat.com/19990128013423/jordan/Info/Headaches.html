<H1>What is the deal with Halima and Egwene's headaches?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>ACoS</CITE>, Egwene comes down with a spate of nasty headaches. The only way she can manage to get rid of them is
for the lovely Halima to give her a massage. Halima just happens to be one of the DOs recycled agents,
Aran'gar. Coincidence? I think not.
</P>
<P>
It's the oldest trick in the book: Cause problems, so you can win somebody's confidence by fixing them.
</P>
<P>
The evidence: Eg's headaches started the day after Logain escaped, and the day Eg and Halima had their first
conversation (<CITE>ACoS: 12, A Morning of Victory, 249</CITE>). Aran'gar had been trying very hard to get rid
of Logain, either to kill or gentle him again. In <CITE>LoC: 52, Weaves of the Power, 651?</CITE>, Egwene says "They
will gentle him, Siuan.... That, or someone really will do what Delana has been hinting at. I won't allow
murder!" Delana is by now only a pawn, voicing Halima's wishes. To Halima, Logain is dangerous, being the only
one around who can sense her ability to channel saidin, or, rather, her actual channelling. As soon as Logain
is gone, Halima's free to make her move on Eg.
</P>
<P>
It's entirely possible that something more sinister than a Forsaken gaining Eg's confidence is going on. As
Halima rubs Eg, Eg answers questions in her mind. Halima says, "Just put yourself in my hands." Eg's sleepy
response to this is, "That will be nice." Granted, the first interpretation of this is Halima's offer of a
full-body massage, and Eg thinking of "bringing Sheriam to heel." Even so, it's a rather ominous exchange,
considering who the parties are. Could Halima be poking poor Eg with a bit of Compulsion?
