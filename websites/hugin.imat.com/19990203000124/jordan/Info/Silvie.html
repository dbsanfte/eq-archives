Most likely, Lanfear: It was part of her plot to get Rand and/or Mat to
go to Tear.  Egwene and Nynaeve were to be bait to draw him there,
only, Rand was already going there to stop their attacks through his
dreams.  The girls were probably just a backup in case he resisted the
dreams or learned to shield them on his own.  Egwene and Nynaeve were
to be Be'lal and Ish.'s bait to draw Rand, while Liandrin and Co. were
the bait to draw draw Egwene and Nynaeve.  See Perrin's dream about
the trap in <CITE>TDR: 43, 504, Shadowbrothers, 426</CITE> (see section 7.6), which
matches Egwene's dreams about "puppets" in <CITE>TDR: 37, 423, Fires in
Cairhien, 352-3</CITE> (see section 7.1).  Lanfear was playing along with Ish,
but working to her own designs.
<P>
There's no doubt (in my mind) that Silvie was Lanfear.  The reason
for ripping off the ring ter'angreal to throw her out of T'A'R was
just her cruel streak; Lanfear knew she was a Dreamer since she had been
haunting the White Tower as Else, and just wanted Egwene to go to the
Heart of the Stone in T'A'R to make sure the girls decided to go there.
Once she had accomplished that, why not send her out the hard way?
After all, Lanfear claimed T'A'R as her domain (even though Mog. was
stronger there), so there was no need for Egwene to learn too much
about "her domain."  Plus, her precious LTT reborn had once loved this
girl; I'm sure she couldn't resist inflicting a little pain on her,
especially since the fact that Eg was bait to draw Rand to Tear meant
that he still cared about her.  That must have drove Lanfear bonkers.
