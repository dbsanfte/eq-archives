<h1 align="center">2.4.7: What did Ogier do of old?</h1>
<P align="center">[Windsor Williams, Korda]</P>
<hr>
Basically, I'm wondering about the role of the Ogier in pre-Breaking
society. From what we know in general, the stedding did exist during the
period, but the Ogier were not bound to them by the Longing as they are at
the time of the series. So it seems reasonable to assume that they were
fairly common everywhere, although most common in and around the stedding.
<P>
We know they were involved with the seed singing (as per the "through the
eyes of Coumin" scene [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 302-5]), but what
other roles did they have? Some clues exist:
<P>
Ogier soldiers-- from the Coumin sequence, right at the beginning [TSR: 26,
The Dedicated, 302]
<blockquote>
He could see the next field, lined the same way, beyond the soldiers with
their shocklances sitting atop armored jo-cars. A hoverfly buzzed overhead
in its patrol, a deadly black metal wasp containing two men. He was
sixteen, and the women had decided his voice was finally deep enough to
join in the seed singing. The soldiers fascinated him, men and Ogier,
the way a colorful poisonous snake might. They <em>killed</em>.
</blockquote>
The "men and Ogier" phrase seems to imply that there were Ogier soldiers as
well as humans.
<P>
Ogier as police or enforcers-- again, from the Coumin sequence [TSR: 26,
The Dedicated, 304]:
<blockquote>
Abruptly something struck Coumin in the mouth and his legs buckled; he was
pushing himself to his knees before he realized he was down. A hand put to
his mouth came away bloody. He looked up to find an angry-faced townsman
standing over him, nursing a fist. "Why did you do that?" he asked.
<P>
The townsman spat at him. "The Forsaken are dead. Dead, do you hear?
Lanfear will not protect you anymore. We will root out all of you who
served the Forsaken while pretending to be on our side, and treat the lot
of you as we treated that crazy old man."
<P>
A woman was tugging at the man's arm. "Come away, Toma. Come away, and
hold your foolish tongue! Do you want the Ogier to come for you?"
Suddenly wary, the man let her pull him away into the crowd.
</blockquote>
"Do you want the Ogier to come for you?" and the man's response argue that
the Ogier were enforcers of peace/police of some sort, and effective ones
as well. I'm guessing that they would come for him for the killing of
Charn ("that crazy old man"), but maybe it's his statements, instead?
<P>
I hadn't thought of Ogier in terms of soldiers or police before, but these
passages caught my eye while re-reading the series. We've been told at one
point or another that old tales refer to Ogier as bad opponents, who rarely
get angry but are very dangerous when they do. (I can't recall the exact
place...something about Perrin and some line about Ogier and mountains.
Anyone else recall where this is?)
<P>
From the Guide and TPOD, we know that Ogier in Seanchan are not
all as peaceful as those in Randland:
<UL>
<LI>"Ogier make up a portion of the Deathwatch, although they are the only
ones not property, and are considered incredibly fierce and more deadly
than their human counterparts. The Ogier of the Deathwatch are grim in
demeanor and action compared to their brothers and sisters across the
ocean." [Guide: 17, Seanchan, 161]
<LI>"Many Deathwatch Guards went without coat or shirt whenever possible to
display [their raven tattoos]. The humans, anyway. Ogier Gardeners
were not marked or owned, but that was between them and the Empress."
[TPOD: 23, Fog of War, Storm of Battle, 443] This implies that the
"Gardeners" are members of the Deathwatch Guard, despite the odd name.
<LI>The Glossary entry for Deathwatch Guards says: "Deathwatch Guards, the:
The elite military formation of the Seanchan Empire, including both
humans and Ogier." [TPOD: Glossary, 596]
</UL>
The fact that the Seanchan Ogier participate in warfare indicates that the
Ogier may have a history of being fighters which the Ogier of Randland
proper have lost.
<p>
Finally, it is possible that Ogier fought in battle during the Trolloc
Wars. When Rand meets Loial for the first time, he tells Loial that he is
from the Two Rivers, which used to be Manetheren [TEOTW: 36, Web of the
Pattern, 465]. Loial replies, referring to the destruction of Manetheren,
"There was a very fine grove there. Your pain sings in my heart, Rand
al'Thor. We could not come in time." The implication is, of course, that
the Ogier could have helped in the battle if they <EM>had</EM> come in
time.
