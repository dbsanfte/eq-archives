<H1>Who is Mesaana?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Tony Zbaraschuck, Marc Zappala, Pam Korda</H2>
<H2>(<a HREF="WhoMesaana.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>LoC</CITE>, we find out that Mesaana is hiding out in the White Tower
(<CITE>LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 138</CITE>).  Naturally, this leads to
question of <EM>who</EM> she is.  Some folks think that she has taken the
Rahvin/Sammael/Be'lal/Graendal route, and is posing as a high-ranking
AS in the Tower.  <CITE>ACoS</CITE> makes it very clear that Mesaana is <em>not</em> Galina
or Alviarin, by letting us see their thoughts. (Not to mention,
Alviarin talks to Mesaana, and Mesaana would not have had the lack of
skill that led to Galina getting captured by Sevanna.)
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Why Mesaana is Probably Not Anybody That Anybody Knows:<BR>
	 None of the Forsaken (except possibly Demandred) have copied an already-
	 prominent identity.  Rather, they take a little-known or unknown-identity
	 and then promote themselves rapidly. This is probably because supplanting
	 someone is <EM>not</EM> easy, requiring as it does almost a total control of
	 oneself, and the ability to copy the tiniest habits.  Especially in the
	 Tower, where Aes Sedai can doubtless read meaning in the tilt of an
	 eyebrow or the tapping of a finger.  And the head of the Red Ajah would
	 be someone well-known to a lot of Reds, and Alviarin was also an
	 influential White (she convinced her Ajah to side with Elaida).  No real
	 easy way to replace either one.  (Admittedly, Mesaana could just be a very
	 good actress, but there wasn't really any need for it because of point #4.)

<LI>We know the way the BA is run (<CITE>TSR: 5, 115, Questioners, 82</CITE>):<BR>
	 "Before we left the Tower, I knew only Liandrin, Chesmal and Rianna.
	 No one knew more than two or three others, I think." [Amico being questioned by Nynaeve and Egwene]
<P>
From this huge amount of secrecy, we can see that it is possible for
somebody to run the BA from any position within the Tower. Mesaana
(who does seem to be pulling strings there, since it is implied the
capturing-Rand-and-bringing-him-to-the-Tower plot was her plan to get
her hands on the Dragon Reborn <CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 58</CITE>.)
could be anybody, an AS, or an Accepted, or a novice, or a maid.  Since
it would be much easier to pose as a new student or a servant, instead
of impersonating somebody else, and possibly being caught out.
</P>
<LI>As for Alviarin, when Fain tried to steal the dagger she caught him and
	 asked him "Did one of the For- Chosen send you?" (<CITE>TFoH: 19, 368, Memories,
	 260</CITE>) No Forsaken would use the term Forsaken instead of Chosen.  And if
	 she WERE Mesaana, she wouldn't just let him go methinks.  The DO wants
	 Fain's hide. (Recall Slayer's original mission in the Two Rivers -- to slay
	 Fain.)

<LI>From <CITE>TSR: 5, 115, Questioners, 82</CITE>, we know the way the BA is run:
	 "Before we left the Tower, I knew only Liandrin, Chesmal and Rianna.
	 No one knew more than two or three others, I think." [Amico being
	 questioned by Nynaeve and Egwene.]

</P>
<LI>In <CITE>ACoS: Prologue, Lightnings, 41</CITE>, Alviarin thinks "She [Mesaana] must be one of the sisters;
surely she was not among servants, bound to labor and sweat. But who? Too many women had been out of the Tower
for years before Elaida's summons, too many had no close friends, or none at all." Thus, Mesaana could be
posing as one of the long-gone sisters, somebody who'd been gone so long that differences in personality, etc.
would not seem too amiss, or one of the AS who is not known very well. Note that Danelle, the Brown who
assisted in Elaida's coup, is one of the latter (no friends, see <CITE>ACoS: Prologue, Lightnings, 38</CITE>).
</OL>
<P>
As an additional idea, it has been suggested that Tarna, the Red
emissary to Salidar is Mesaana in disguise. Not a lot of evidence for
this, except that in the chapter where Tarna talks to Ny and El <CITE>LoC:
13, Under the Dust, 232</CITE> the chapter icon is the Forsaken icon, and
there is no other obvious candidate in there to be Forsaken.  Of
course, the chapter icons don't always apply 100%, but every other
chapter in <CITE>LoC</CITE> with that icon has a Forsaken, or reference to one, in.
Tarna is good friends with Galina <CITE>LoC: 13, Under the Dust, 237</CITE>, a
known BA and head of the Red Ajah, so this could be an extensive way
to control the Tower with a Red Amyrlin. There is evidence against
this, too -- why would Mesaana run her own errands?  The problem of a
previous history raises its head, here, too.
</P>
<P>
Final point: In the online version of the <CITE>ACoS</CITE> prologue, Alviarin notes
that Mesaana taps her lip with her finger while thinking. This is not a
useful trait in identifying Mesaana, since numerous characters do this,
among them Leane, Alviarin, Nesuane, Theodrin, and Vandene.
