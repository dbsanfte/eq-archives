<h1 align="center">1.1.1: Who are the Forsaken? Where are they now?</h1>
<P align="center">[Mark Looi, Erica Sadun, P. Korda]</p>
<HR>
<P>
During the AOL, many Aes Sedai turned to the Dark Side. The Guide tells us
that "the best of them were given power and ability beyond that of
others....Among themselves they were known as 'Those Chosen to Rule the
World Forever,' or simply 'the Chosen.'" [Guide: 5, The Dark One and the
Male Forsaken, 49] In the Third Age, the term "Forsaken" is used to refer
to the thirteen who were caught in the sealing of the Bore. According to
the Guide [Guide: 5, The DO and the Male Forsaken, 50], those thirteen were
the most powerful of the Chosen.
<P>
The 13 Forsaken (in alphabetical order) are
<UL>
<LI><strong>AGINOR</strong> (M): Alias: Osan'gar. Real name Ishar Morrad
Chuain. Before turning to the Shadow, he was a very famous biologist. He
was the second most powerful of the Male Forsaken. He created the various
Shadowspawn, and was apparently never involved in military operations (RJ
said that the guy who created the Trollocs had no combat experience
[Correspondence]). Killed at the Eye of the World by drawing too much of
the One Power during a confrontation with Rand. [TEotW: 51, Against the
Shadow, 634-5]. He has been recycled into the body of a middle-aged
Borderlander by the Dark One, and is now called Osan'gar. Current
whereabouts are unknown, but one popular speculation is that he is Dashiva.
(<A HREF="../1.2_forsaken2/1.2.2_dashiva.html">See section 1.2.2</A>.)
<P>
<LI><strong>ASMODEAN</strong> (M): Real name Joar Addam Nesossin [TFoH: 45,
After the Storm, 516]. Alias: Jasin Natael. Before turning to the
Shadow, he was a composer and musician. Thought by many to be the weakest
and most cowardly of the Forsaken. Captured by Rand and shielded by
Lanfear at Rhuidean [TSR: 58, The Traps of Rhuidean, 674-7]. Toast at the
end of TFoH...Twice! No body was found, so most people in Randland do not
know he is dead, just that he has vanished. The DO is likely either
unwilling or unable to recycle him, since THOSE WHO BETRAY [the DO] WILL
DIE THE FINAL DEATH. Claimed to have joined the Shadow for the promise of
eternal life, in which to practise songs and music. The identity of his
killer is unknown. (<A HREF="1.1.7_asmo.html">See section 1.1.7</A>)
<P>
<LI><STRONG>BALTHAMEL</STRONG> (M): Real name Eval Ramman. Aliases:
Aran'gar, Halima. In the AOL, he was a historian before turning to the
Dark Side. The Guide [Guide: 5, The DO and the Male Forsaken, 54]
indicates that he may have run a spy network for the Shadow during the War
of Power. He was notorious for being an utter lecher. He was killed
by the Green Man at the Eye of the World [TEotW: 50, Meetings at the Eye,
630-1]. He has been recycled into the body of an attractive woman, and is
called Aran'gar. Currently, she has infiltrated the Salidar Aes Sedai, and
is acting as Egwene's masseuse.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>BE'LAL</STRONG> (M): Real name Duram Laddel Cham. Aliases:
Netweaver, High Lord Samon of Tear. He was a lawyer in the AOL. After
turning to the Shadow, he served as a general and governor. He was balefired
by Moiraine in the Stone of Tear [TDR: 55, What is Written in Prophecy,
557].
<P>
<LI><strong>DEMANDRED</strong> (M): Real name Barid Bel Medar. During the
AOL, played second fiddle to LTT until he went over to the Shadow, where he
served as a general. He hated and envied LTT intensely, and has
transferred that feeling to Rand [TSR: 58, The The Traps of Rhuidean, 677].
He turned to the Shadow because he got tired of being second-best to LTT
[TFoH: 3, Pale Shadows, 76-7], [LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 56-7],
who he considered to be his intellectual inferior. Possibly involved with
the Seanchan [LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 135], also possibly
masquerading as Mazrim Taim
(<A HREF="1.1.6_taimandred.html">See section 1.1.6</A>). Knows how to block
gateways.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>GRAENDAL</strong> (F): Alias: Lady Basene. Steven Cooper
notes, "The nickname 'Maisia,' used by Sammael in ACOS, should perhaps be
mentioned here. I don't know the source, but apparently RJ explained it
was a name commonly given to pets in the AOL (no wonder Graendal was not
amused)." Real name Kamarile Maradim Nindar. In the habit of taking
aristocrats and making them serve in some demeaning aspect, using enough
Compulsion to fry their brains and make them useless. Currently in Arad
Doman, having taken over somebody's palace. She has one of the World's
Greatest Generals, Lord Rodel Ituralde, working for her, and it seems as
though all the reported chaos in Arad Doman might not be quite as chaotic
as it first appears. She appears to visitors as a feeble old lady. Before
turning to the Shadow, she was a celebrated psychiatrist in the AOL [LoC:
6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 130-9], and an ascetic. She seems to be
underestimated by all the other Forsaken, besides Sammael. Was duped by
Sammael, for a short time, into following him, due to his claim of being
Nae'blis. She has recently been "reined in" by Moridin and his minions.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>ISHAMAEL</strong> (M): Real name Elan Morin Tedronai, aka
Ba'alzamon. The most philosophically-minded of the Forsaken, he came up
with many theories on the nature of the battle between the Creator and the
DO [LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 133]. Believed by many to be the most
powerful Forsaken. Was partially or totally free during the Third Age.
)<A HREF="1.1.9_ish-bound.html">See section 1.1.9</A>.) Believed by the
other Forsaken to be partially or totally mad. Frequent user of the "True
Power." Killed by Rand in Tear [TDR: 55, What is Written in Prophecy,
570]. He has been recycled into the body of a dark, handsome young man,
and calls himself Moridin. He has reassumed his pre-death position as Big
Cheese in the Shadow's hierarchy, and is in the process of getting the
other Forsaken under his control.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>LANFEAR</STRONG> (F): Real name: Mierin Eronaile. Aliases:
Selene, Keille, Silvie, Else Grinwell (in TDR). She was the most powerful
of the female Forsaken, and was maybe the second-strongest of all. Former
lover of LTT, who believes she was rudely tossed over for Ilyena. She was
not famous in the AOL [Guide: 6, The Female Forsaken and the Darkfriends],
when she was a researcher into the One Power. She was one of the AS who
opened the Bore, apparently unwittingly. Known for interfering in others'
plans, twisting them to her advantage. Tackled by Moiraine in TFOH, and
fell into Finnland. It is very likely that she has a new body, either
from dying and being recycled, or from a wish to the Finn, and is called
Cyndane
(<A HREF="../1.2_forsaken2/1.2.5_cyndane.html">See section 1.2.5</A>),
who is mindtrapped by Moridin.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>MESAANA</STRONG> (F): Real name: Saine Tarasind. Was rejected
by the Collam Daan (a major research institution during the AOL), so instead
of being a researcher, she ended up a teacher, until she found a way to
Teach Them All! MUAHAHAH! She is currently the power behind the power
behind the throne in the White Tower (<A HREF="1.1.2_mesaana.html">See
section 1.1.2</A>, running Elaida through Alviarin. She has been known to
plot with Demandred and Semirhage.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>MOGHEDIEN</STRONG> (F): Real name Lillen Moiral. Aliases:
Gyldin, Marigan. During the AOL, she was a shady "investment advisor."
During the War of the Power, she ran a spy network. She was captured by
Nynaeve in Tanchico, but escaped [TSR: 54, Into the Palace, 631-3]. She's
believed to be the strongest Forsaken in Tel'aran'rhiod. Captured by
Nynaeve again in Salidar and forced to teach her and Elayne. Released by
Aran'gar and summoned to SG, where she was severely punished, and was
fitted with a mindtrap. Is now a lackey of Moridin.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>RAHVIN</STRONG> (M): Real Name: Ared Mosinel. Alias: Lord
Gaebril. Previously held Queen Morgase in thrall via Compulsion. Balefired
by Rand at the end of TFOH.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>SAMMAEL</STRONG> (M): Real name Tel Janin Aellinsar. Alias
Lord Brend of Illian. During the AOL, he was an athlete. Served the DO as
a general. Was given scar by LTT, hates Rand. Always wanted to be taller.
He'd managed to get ahold of a number of AOL goodies from stasis boxes, and
some stuff from the Kin's stash in Ebou Dar. Vanished during the fight
with Rand in ACOS. Presumed dead by Rand, Graendal, Moggy, and Cyndane.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>SEMIRHAGE</STRONG> (F): Real name Nemene Damendar Boann. Has a
penchant for gruesome torture. Whereabouts unknown. Hates Lanfear. Is
very tall, with dark skin and eyes, and likes wearing black. Was a
brilliant healer who took payment and pleasure in extracting extra pain
from her patients. Knows how to block open gateways. Turned to the Dark
Side to avoid being stilled or bound by an Oath Rod for her sadism.
Current whereabouts unknown. Our only clues are 1. that she has a
"willful" female charge [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 141], and 2.
Demandred's comment in [LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 58]: "When I
think where you two (Mesaana and Semirhage) have placed yourselves, I
wonder. How much has the Great Lord known, for how long? How much of what
has happened has been at his design all along?" Mesaana is in the Tower;
Semirhage is likely in a similarly convenient place.
