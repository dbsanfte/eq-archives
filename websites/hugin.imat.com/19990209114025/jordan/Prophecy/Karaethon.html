Thom in conversation: "One of the Prophecies says that the Stone of
Tear will never fall until the People of the Dragon come to the Stone.
Another says the Stone will never fall till the Sword that Cannot Be
Touched is wielded by the Dragon's hand." {YES to both.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TGH Header Prophecy</CITE>) (<a HREF="Karaethon.html#Break">Survey Says</a>):<BR>
<P>
	 "And it shall come to pass that what men made  shall be shattered,
and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the DO shall
once more lay his hand upon the world of man. Women shall weep and men
quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth. Neither
shall anything stand nor abide...
</P>
<P>
	  Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow...and there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth.(YES) In sackcloth and ashes
shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again by his
coming, tearing apart all ties that bind. (YES) Like the unfettered
dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn
confront the Shadow at the Last Battle(NO), and his blood shall
give us the Light(NO. cf "his blood on the rocks of SG, and Min's vision
of blood on black rocks). Let tears flow, O  ye people of the world.
Weep for your salvation."
</P>
<LI>Vandene talking to Moiraine (<CITE>TGH: 22, 328, Watchers, 275</CITE>):<BR>
	  'Five ride forth, and four return.(YES) Above the watchers shall
	  he proclaim himself, bannered cross the sky in fire...'(YES: the 5 who
		rode forth were Ingtar, Hurin, Rand, Mat, and Perrin. Rand proclaimed
	  himself the DR after the battle at Falme, where he and Ish fought in
	  the sky.)

<LI>Thom to Rand (<CITE>TGH: 26, 387, Discord, 325-6</CITE> <CITE>TSR: 9, 180, Decisions, 126</CITE>):<BR>
	  Twice and twice shall he be marked,YES)
	  twice to live, and twice to die,(maybe Rand and LTT?)
	  Once the heron to set his path. (YES: Portal Stone World)
	  Twice the heron, to name him true.(YES: Falme)
	  Once the Dragon for remembrance lost.(YES: Rhuidean)
	  Twice the Dragon for the price he must pay .(he has been paying,
			but will there be a Real Big Price, i.e. his life and his blood?)

<LI>Thom to Rand (<CITE>TGH: 26, 387, Discord, 326</CITE>):<BR>
	  Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.
	  Once for mourning, once for birth.
	  Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rock of Shayol Ghul.
	  In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.(NO,)

cf. "Twice dawns the day..." with the Greeting the Amyrlin ceremony
when Siuan Sanche arrives in Fal Dara in <CITE>TGH REF?</CITE>: "Against what do
you guard?" "The shadow at noon."

(<a HREF="Karaethon.html#Blood">Survey says</a>)

<LI>Moiraine in conversation (<CITE>TDR: 6, 93, The Hunt Begins, 57</CITE>):<BR>
He has yet to break the nations (YES), or shatter the world.  Even
scholars who have studied the Prophecies for their entire lives
do not know how to interpret them all. What does it mean that
he shall 'slay his people people with the sword of peace, and
destroy them with the leaf'(YES: Rhuidean)? What does it mean that he
shall bind the nine moons to serve him? (NO, something to do with
 the Seanchan.)  Yet these are given equal weight with Callandor
in the Cycle.  There are others. What 'wound of madness and cutting
of hope' has he healed? (NO -- possible reference to healing the Taint?)
What chains has he broken (possibly chains binding people to the
Shadow -- Ingtar, Asmodean, Tear, Andor), and who put into chains?
(Asmodean, maybe? or all the nations he is binding to follow him?)
(<a HREF="Karaethon.html#Taint">Survey Says</a>)

<LI>(<CITE>TDR: Header Prophesy, ix, ix</CITE>):<BR>
And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his
name, for he shall be born among us many times, in
many guises, as he has been and ever will be, time
without end. His coming shall be like the sharp edge of
the plow, turning our lives in furrows from out of the
places where we lie in our silence. The breaker of bonds;
the forger of chains. The maker of futures; the unshaper
of destiny.(General Prophesy, no real judgment needed)

<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 41, 445, Threads in the Pattern</CITE>):<BR>
"On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born of a maiden wedded to no man. " (YES)

<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 3, 99, Reflection, 71</CITE>):<BR>
	  His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, washing away
	  the Shadow, sacrifice for man's salvation.(NO) (<a HREF="Karaethon.html#Die">Survey Says</a>)
<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 6, 131, Doorways, 93</CITE>):<BR>
	  Power of the Shadow made human flesh,(poss. Forsaken, Fain, Slayer, or
		the Bubble of evil at the start of TSR?)
	  wakened to turmoil, strife and ruin. 
	  The Reborn One, marked and bleeding,
	  dances the sword in dreams and mist,(this could be a reference to the 
						  mirror incident in the Stone in TSR)
	  chains the Shadowsworn to his will,(YES)
	  from the city, lost and forsaken, 
	  leads the spears to war once more,(YES)
	  breaks the spears and makes them see, 
	  truth long hidden in the ancient dream.(YES)

<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 21, 349, Into the Heart, 244</CITE>):<BR>
	  Into the heart he thrusts his sword,
	  into the heart, to hold their hearts.(YES)
	  Who draws it out shall follow after, 
	  What hand can grasp that fearful blade?(NO)

<LI>(<CITE>TFOH: Header Prophecy</CITE>):<BR>
	  With his coming are the dread fires born again. The hills burn, and the
	  land turns sere. (YES: the draught) The tides of men run out, 
	  and the hours dwindle. The wall is pierced, and the veil of parting 
	  raised.(The DO breaking loose? This phrase calls to mind a phrase from 
	  the Bible. See section 3.) Storms rumble beyond the horizon, and 
	  the fires of heaven purge the earth. There is no salvation without 
	  destruction, no hope this side of death.

<LI>(<CITE>LoC: Trailer Prophecy</CITE>):<BR>

The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign.(YES)
The seas rage, and stormclouds gather unseen. Beyond the horizon, hidden
fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom. {Something is rotten in
Randland. People are not what they seem. All is not well.) What was
exalted is cast down; what was cast down is raised up. (??? the AS
and male channellers, respectively?) Order burns to clear his path.

<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: Header Prophecy</CITE>):<BR>
There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow, for the land is
one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land. soul of fire,
heart of stone, in pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield. He
calls upon the mountains to kneel, and the seas to give way, and the
very skies to bow. Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears, and
the sould of fire, love. (From a much-disputed translation of _The
Prophecies of the Dragon_ by the poet Kyera Termendal, of Shiota,
believed to have been published between FY700 and FY800)
</P>
<P>
{reference to Rand's increasing self-isolation, hubris, etc. Also note
the 'Dragon is one with the land' stuff matches the Fisher King
legend/reference (see section 3.1)}
</P>
<LI>Rand' thoughts (<CITE>ACOS 34, Ta'veren, p533</CITE>):<BR>
the Prophecies said he would bind together the people of every land--"The north shall he tie to the east, and
the west shall be bound to the south."
<P>
{Rand's interpretation: all the world will follow him. Alternative interpretation: Rand will hold the north
and east; the Seanchan will hold the west and south}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: Trailer Prophecy</CITE>):<BR>
Master of the lightnings, rider on the storm, wearer of a crown of
swords, spinner-out of fate. Who thinks he turns the Wheel of Time,
may learn the truth too late.
<P>
(From a fragmentary translation of <CITE>The Prophecies of the Dragon</CITE>, attributed to Lord Mangore
Kiramin, Sword-bard of Aramaelle and Warder to Caraighan Maconar, into what was then called the vulgar tongue
(circa 300 AB))
<P>
{Similar in tone and meaning to the ACOS header prophecy}
