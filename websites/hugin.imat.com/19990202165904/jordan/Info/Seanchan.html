<H1>What are the Seanchan up to?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
They'd taken Tanchico in <CITE>LOC</CITE>. In <CITE>COS</CITE>, they moved by sea into southern
Altara (Ebou Dar), and by air/land into southwesterm Amadicia
(Amador). It happens that a number of Our Heroes are in the region:
Mat, Thom, and Juilan in Ebou Dar; Elayne, Ny, Lan, Avi, and Birgitte
are at the Kin's farm outside Ebou Dar (assuming they managed to get
out of town before the Seanchan attack), Galad is with the WCs somewhere
in Amadicia; Perrin, Faile, and Berelain are in Ghealdan (near Jehanna, I
guess). There's also the WCs and the Prophet's army in northern
Amadicia, and various bunches of Shaido scattered through the area
"from Illian to Ghealdan" by Sammeal (<CITE>ACOS 40, Spears, 636</CITE>). Further
away, but still possibly within range of the action, are Egwene's army
in northern Murandy, and Rand's forces in Illian. It looks like the
next book will finally bring the Seanchan situation to the forefront.
