<h1 align="center">99.1: When is the next book going to be out?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<strong>When will TPOD be out in paperback?</strong>
<P>
The mass-market paperback edition of TPOD is due out in August, 1999.
<P>
<strong>When will Book 9 be published?</strong>
<P>
There is no official projected release date for Book 9. At a post-TPOD
book signing [San Jose, CA, 25 October 1998, reported by Rick Moen], RJ
said that he'd start working on Book 9 after Thanksgiving of 1998. From
the amount of time taken between the last few installments of the series,
we can guess that Book 9 will come out in mid to late 2000.
<P>
<strong>What will Book 9 be called?</strong>
<P>
We don't know. It's doubtful RJ even has a title for it yet. From a
Barnes and Noble online chat with RJ [19 October, 1998]: "I have to do a little
writing before the title becomes clear to me. I don't start off with a
title. That always comes to me at some point during the writing.
Something that seems to fit the specific book."
