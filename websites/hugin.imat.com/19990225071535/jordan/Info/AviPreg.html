<H1>Is Aviendha Pregnant?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="AviPreg.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Possibly. The WOs have a plot to make Rand "know (the Aiel's) blood for (his) own." Aviendha has "been more
successful than [the WOs] know," according to Amys. (<CITE>TFoH: 54, 908, To Caemlyn, 643</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
Then again, they could just be meaning for him to fall in love with and marry Aviendha, and are congratulating
her on 'getting into Rand's pants,' as Sean Hillyard so eloquently puts it. Evidence for the latter: Rand has
asked Aviendha many times now to marry him, and that at one point a Wise One comments "I will make you know
our blood for yours, if I have to lay the...." (<CITE>TSR: 50, 882, Traps, 570</CITE>) Aiel ask to marry by
laying a wreath of flowers at a man's feet, i.e., their goal is marriage, and Aviendha has been quite
successful -- all she has to do now is accept.
</P>
<P>
If Avi was pregnant, she would surely be showing some symptoms, by now. For sure, she would know it, having
missed a few periods. I'm sure that this would give her more toh towards Elayne, and yet she doesn't say she's
pregnant with Rand's child, when she confesses to El. She only says she is in love with him, and has lain with
him. (<CITE>LoC: 40, Unexpected Laughter, 523</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
Some people have suggested that Aviendha's barfing on the boat in <CITE>ACOS 13, The Bowl of the Winds,
268</CITE> is an indication of morning sickness. However, there is no indication of her being ill on any other
day, and RJ gives us an explanation for her queasiness on the one in question -- the idea of being in an open
boat, surrounded by water, is too much for her.
