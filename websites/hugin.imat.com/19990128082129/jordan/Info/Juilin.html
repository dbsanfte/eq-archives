<H1>Who is Juilin's honey?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Michael Gonzalez, Korda</H2>

(<CITE>ACoS: Glossary, 675</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"Juilin Sander - A thief-catcher from Tear.  A man in love with 
perhaps the very last woman he would ever have thought he could be."
</P>
<P>
So, who is it? People have suggested an Aes Sedai, Nynaeve, Birgitte,
etc. However, there is only one idea backed by any demonstration of
tender feelings on Juilan's part: ex-Panarch Amathera of Tarabon:
</P>
<P>
Now, we know (from <CITE>ACOS: 14, White Plumes, 273</CITE>, as well as other
places) that Juilin does not like nobles, so a high noble of some sort
might seem to be the last person he would think he'd fall in love
with....
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>ACoS, 14, White Plumes, 274</CITE>):<BR>
 "Tarabon must be terrible now for a woman not used to taking care of herself," Juilin murmured.
</P>
<P>
Going back to the group's trip away from Tarabon, I found (<CITE>tFoH: 9, A Signal, 146</CITE>): 
Nynaeve: "Amathera was difficult, but I do not wish her any harm.  Do you?"<BR>
Juilin:  "A pretty woman, especially in one of those Taraboner serving girl's dresses, with a pretty smile.  I
thought she...." (shuts up when Elayne shoots him a dirty look).<BR>
</P>
<P>
So, it looks like Amathera. It just happens that Amathera could do
with some rescuing at the moment, and is wearing a dress that Juilan
would really like to see her in! :)
