<H1>What are the Black Threads on the Forsaken?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Robyn Goldstein, P. Korda</H2>
<HR>
<P>
When Rand battles the male Forsaken, he sees black threads, wires, or cords running off from them. This is
seen when Rand battles Ishy in (<CITE>TEotW: 51, 759-62, Against the Shadow, 637-40</CITE>), and Asmodean
(<CITE>TSR: 58, 965-972, The Traps of Rhuidean, 671-675</CITE>). So what's the deal with these strings?
</P>
<P>
The thick black threads are the Forsaken's connection to the DO.  The connection with the DO is what keeps the
male Forsaken from falling prey to the madness taint of saidin (see Asmodean's statements to Rand in TSR after
his black "thread" was severed).  Rand's thread in TEotW was silver and thinner because it was from that pure
pool of saidin that was the Eye of the World.
</P>
<P>
We've never seen the threads on a female Forsaken, so it is possible that the threads are themselves the
protection from the taint. Perhaps they act as a kind of filter on saidin, or a conduit through which the
DO siphons off the taint when the Forsaken draws upon the Source.
</P>
<P>
It's also been suggested that the threads are a connection for channelling the True Power. The problems with
this theory are: the female Forsaken can use the TP, but nobody ever sees the black cords on them, and the
black cords were seen on <EM>Asmodean</EM>, and of all the Forsaken, the one who we'd least expect to use the
very dangerous TP in an instance where the OP would serve just as well (Skimming) is Asmodean.
