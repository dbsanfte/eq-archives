<DT>Mat and Odin:
<DD>
Has anybody failed to notice that Mat is being set up as Odin,
complete with wide brimmed hat, a spear with ravens drawn on it which
are named "Thought" and "Memory", coincidentally enough the names of
Odin's ravens and will in the future almost certainly lose an eye?
Also, it seems to me there was a Norse myth involving Odin agreeing
to be hung from Yggdrasil (or some other unpronounceable Norse thing
like that) in order to gain wisdom or power or both (he really went
in for this self-sacrifice thing...)- a definite parallel to Mat
being hung from the Tree o' Life in Rhuidean.
<DT>The Midgard Serpent:
<DD>
wound around the roots of above tree, often envisioned as
a symbol of eternity--a large serpent swallowing its own tail. Sound like
any famous Aes Sedai jewelry we know?

<DT>Heimdall's Horn:
<DD>
Heimdall's job was to guard the Rainbow bridge into Asgard
against the Giants. During the Last Battle (Ragnarok), he was to blow the
horn to signal the arrayed gods and _dead heroes_ that it was time to
fight.  cf. Horn of Valere. Granted, there are differences - the Heroes
are bound to the Horn and not to a specific cause,and they live in T'A'R
rather than the afterlife as such (where they'd fight all day, cutting
each other to pieces, then get healed at day's end. Always got a kick
out of that - sounds like a real heavenly afterlife to me), but the
concept of dead heroes waiting around for the final battle stays the same

<DT>Bad Guy under a mountain:
<DD>
Here is the origin of the archetypical
Evil Dude Imprisoned in a Mountain. Loki, the Norse "Evil God,"
(more properly the god of chaos, but he was the antagonist of the
other gods) was chained up in a cave after he killed the god
Baldur.The legend was that he would escape or be freed just before Ragnarok.

<DT>Perrin
<DD>
Thor?? Is it just coincidence that Perrin is impressively
muscled and has a big hammer, just like a certain Norse god of
thunder?

<DT>Rand
<DD>
TEW/Tyr: Tew was a Norse god of war and of justice. This is a
parallel with Rand bringing strife to Randland, and with his concurrent
attempts to rule justly and by the rule of law. Tew's arm was
snarfled off by the monstrous wolf Fenri (Perrin?) when the gods
chained him. (The gods thus defeated one of their greatest enemies, at
the loss of one of their greatest assets, Tew's right (fighting) hand.)
More evidence for Rand losing a hand.
</DL>
<P>
RJ said at a signing in Atlanta that he deliberately made Mat like
Odin and Rand like Tew/Chew.
