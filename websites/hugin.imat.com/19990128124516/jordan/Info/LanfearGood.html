<H1>Why Lanfear may be good</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Ruchira Datta, Pam Korda, and Roy Navarre as the Lanfear Pin-up of the Month Club, Carolyn
Fusinato</H2>

<P>
Lanfear presents a bit of an enigma:  Many of her actions have led some
people to believe that she is not 100% evil.  The argument is that she and
Beidomon drilled the Bore into the DO's prison by accident, and only became
Forsaken after that either due to the DO's direct action, or out of pride.
Moreover, everyone would link her with all the DO's ravages that followed,
thinking she released him on purpose, no matter what she did.  Being an
extremely proud person, it would be hard for her to admit that she had just
made a colossal mistake.
</P>
<P>
<em>Evidence</em>: In the "Eyes of Charn" sequence (<CITE>TSR: 26, 432-437, The Dedicated,
303-6</CITE>), Charn perceives Mierin as a good person, and maintains this belief
even after she became Lanfear.  Up to <CITE>TFoH</CITE> (see refutation), it can be claimed
that she hadn't done any inarguably evil acts.  She has been deceptive - but
what would one expect from an Aes Sedai?  She is jealous and possessive of
Rand -- but note that she had not done anything to harm her competition, which
would probably be very easy for her to do. (She met Egwene in Tel'aran'rhiod,
if I recall correctly, but anyway Egwene had been eliminated from the category
of "competition" by this time.) She told Ishamael in <CITE>TDR</CITE> that she was loyal to
the Dark One and no other.  However, in <CITE>TSR</CITE>, she suggested to Rand that they
supplant the DO together.  As for the scene at the end of <CITE>TFoH</CITE>, she was
insane and not responsible for her actions. (She dislikes being called Mierin
in the extreme.  This could be taken several ways. One way to take it is that
she wants her former self to be disassociated from her current evil ways:
she does not want to be reminded of what she once was; it is too painful.)
</P>
<P>
<em>Refutation</em>: I have always believed that Lanfear was evil, starting way back
when we first meet her as Selene in <CITE>TGH</CITE>.  She made my skin crawl.  LTT, an
"honest man," even the Forsaken admit, said that Lanfear, <EM>even when she was
Mierin</EM>, loved power more than anything else.  What is the DO but the ultimate
temptation of power? All of her actions in "helping" Rand have not been to
further his cause against the DO, but to gain his trust and lust, so that she
could control him. She does not love Rand/LTT; she wants him to be her obedient
lapdog, and to serve him up on a platter to the DO, so that she can be the
most powerful of his servants. She would supplant the DO <em>and</em> the Creator in a
second if she could, and then be disappointed that she wasn't powerful enough.
Having deceived Rand for so long,it would have been simple for her to
deceive Charn, a follower of the Way of the Leaf. (It is obvious from looking
at the Tinkers and the Ancient Aiel that Leafers cannot believe that the
world is a Bad Place with Bad People in it.) Anyway, evidence in <CITE>TFoH</CITE>
closes the case for good: I do not refer to the skinning of
Kadere, torturing of Egwene and Aviendha, killing of many, and attempted killing
of Rand, although that provides plenty of evidence in itself, insanity
or no. I refer to Moiraine's vision in the Rings of Rhuidean (<CITE>TFoH: 53, 900,
Fading Words, 637</CITE>): If Moiraine had not jumped Lanfear, and let her have her
way, Rand would be (a) dead, or (b) Lanfear's love-slave, with the crippled mind
of LTT. These were Lanfear's plans. They are not the plans of a good person.
Oh, and if you need further proof, recall the ecstasy with which she describes
bathing in the DO's presence at Shayol Ghul.
</P>
<P>
Note that Lanfear did <EM>not</EM> send the Trollocs who fought Sammael's
Trollocs in <CITE>TSR</CITE>. They were sent by Semirhage, on order of the DO. The
DO, it seems, has been giving Rand aid for some time now, probably in
the hopes of eventually turning him to the Dark Side. Any "help"
Lanfear has done for Rand was probably in view of this end. Taking
credit for rescuing him is certainly not past her.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn F. adds, that in a letter she got from RJ, he said that
Lanfear fixated on possessing a man who never loved her. (I guess LTT
was just using her for sex, eh?) Her desire for Rand is as much desire
for power as for him personally. She could get her hands on the
remote-control ter'angreal for the kick-ass sa'angreal, and get credit
for turning the Dragon Reborn over to the DO. She seeks power for power's
sake, not for Rand's sake.
