<H1>The Death of Asmodean</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="WhoKilledAsmo.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<H2>Why didn't Rand notice Asmodean was dead?</H2>
<P>
He noticed Asm was gone. He thinks Asm ran away. Note that this
implies there was no body left. "If they discovered that he had held
one of the Forsaken prisoner and allowed him to escape...He would deal
with Asmodean himself if the man ever turned up again." (<CITE>LOC, ?, A
Woman's Eyes, 92</CITE>)
</P>
<H2>Who killed him?</H2>
<P>
Whoever killed Asmodean must have:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>been recognized by Asmodean
<LI>been someone Asmodean did not expect to see, and was terrified of
<LI>been able to be in Caemlyn at the time
<LI>been able to kill Asmodean near-instantaneously ("The word still
		  hung in the air when death took him") 
<LI>had a motive for killing Asmodean
<LI>been able to dispose of the body
</OL>
<P>
Any of the Forsaken would fulfill 2-6, and maybe 1. Padan Fain
fulfills 3, 5, and 6, maybe 4, but 1 and 2 are a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<H3>The Suspects</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Lanfear (but she's missing, presumed dead):
  If Lanfear were alive, where would she go?  She would continue her
  revenge on Rand, I think.  <em>However</em>, having possibly lost her angreal,
  and probably facing a more prepared Rand, and having had some time
  to think about things (like Rahvin ceasing to exist), I don't think
  she'd immediately assault Rand again.  Instead, she'd again methodically
  plan to weaken him.  I think that it is very reasonable (but all
  hypothetical) for her to kill Asmodean immediately. -- Contributed by: <CITE>Amish Dave</CITE>
<LI>Ishamael: Maybe he's been resurrected Aran/Osan'gar-style? Problem
	is, how would Asmodean recognize him in a new body?
<LI>Mesaana: Any Forsaken would have a reason to kill Asmodean.
<LI>Sammael: Might as well get all the unaccounted-for Forsaken in here.
<LI>The Dark One (Shai'....), via the agency of Shadar Haran (Shadow's Hand).
	 Same problem as for Ish: Why would Asmodean recognize him? 
<LI>Fain: Could have been in Caemlyn at the time (via the Ways, if nothing
	 else). Would want to kill any Forsaken, because they would interfere with
	 his plans to be Rand's personal hell. Can use the dagger to kill easily.
	 Problems -- How would Asm recognize him, and, if he did, why would he be
	 terrified of him? (Possible explanation is that Asm recognized
	 the Mashadar taint on Fain's dagger, as Aginor and Balthamel did at the Eye
	 of the World, and that is what he recognized. Problem is,
	 that Asm was no longer tied to the DO, and could hardly 
	 channel, and so how could he recognize Mashadar?) Asm died pretty 
	 fast ("The word still hung in the air when death took him"); 
	 the dagger doesn't kill that quickly. There is enough time for the 
	 stabbed one to gasp, fall to the ground, writhe around a bit, and finally
	 die once the Mashadar-taint spreads through his body enough. (See the 
	 scene in <CITE>TFOH</CITE> where he kills the Accepted <CITE>TFoH: 19, 366, Memories, 259</CITE>,
	 and the part in <CITE>TGH</CITE> where Mat kills the Seanchan guy <CITE>TGH: 45, 636,
	 Blademaster, 538</CITE> NB: This guy seems to die much faster than
	 the Accepted) Of course, Fain could have just stabbed him through the 
	 heart, or cut his throat.   
<LI>Other, unlikely, suggestions include, Slayer, Mat, and Egwene.
</UL>
<H3>Who didn't kill him?</H3>
<P>
From the LoC prologue, we see that Demandred doesn't know what happened to
Asmodean: "Lanfear has vanished without a trace, just as Asmodean did."
Hence, Demandred didn't kill him.  But the Dark One's response seems to
imply the DO <em>might</em> be behind what happened to Asmodean:  "WHO
BETRAYS ME SHALL DIE THE FINAL DEATH. ASMODEAN, TWISTED BY HIS WEAKNESS." (<CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First
Message, 15</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
In <CITE>LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 141</CITE>, Semirhage thinks to
herself, "Asmoden. A traitor, and so doomed, but he really had
vanished..." and later, "If the Great Lord moved her here secretly,
might he not be moving Moghedien or Lanfear, or even Asmodean?"  This
seems to imply that Semirhage doesn't know what happened to Asm, and
thus that she didn't kill him.
</P>
<P>
At a post-<CITE>LoC</CITE> signing in Chicago, RJ said that we have all the clues
to figure out who killed Asmodean. I look upon this statement with
skepticism. (<a HREF="WhoKilledAsmo.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)
</P>
<H2>Why was he killed, anyway?</H2>
<P>
If we can figure out <EM>why</EM> he was killed, we might be able to throw
some light on <EM>who</EM> killed him. One possibility is that he was the
target of a premeditated assassination. The Shadow (i.e., the DO and all
the Forsaken) would want to do this, because he was a traitor. Fain
would want to do this, because either Fain knew Asm was helping Rand,
or he thought Asm was trying to kill/turn/etc. Rand, and didn't want a
Forsaken to defeat al'Thor -- that is Fain's mission in life. (Then
again, Fain might not know anything about Asm's existence at all.)  If
it was premeditated, then how did the killer know Asm was heading for
the wine closet? Maybe Asm was a frequent customer? Maybe the killer
was hiding there, and took his chance when Asm walked in? Maybe he was
close enough nearby to observe Asm's movements?
</P>
<P>
A second possibility is that Asm was <EM>not</EM> the specific target of the
killer; he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Perhaps the
killer was/is spying/plotting/etc. from within the ranks of the Dragon
Reborn. Asmodean bumped into him on his way to the wine closet,
recognized him, and got killed to protect his secret. Quoting from the
relevant passage: "He pulled open a small door, intending to find his
way to the pantry. There should be some decent wine." Then we have,
"You? No!" He was going to <EM>look</EM> for wine. He probably opened a door
to an empty storeroom or hallway. It was <EM>not</EM> a wine pantry. He
hadn't found it, yet. If you re-read the passage, yourself, it seems that
it may have even been an accident he ran into his killer (i.e., the
killer wasn't planning on it, but since Asmodean saw him...). This
motive fits well with the body being removed/destroyed. If the killing
was for punishment, it would have made more sense for the body to be
left, and the death widely publicized, to set an example. So, how could
the body being discovered disclose something about the killer (to the
other characters)? I can think of three possibilities: 1) The killer is
part of Rand's entourage, and a dead Asm could make people suspicious
that there was a traitor in the ranks. 2) There is a hole in Rand's
security, and a dead Asm would inspire people to find it and patch it
up. 3) The killer is hiding (not necessarily only from Rand -- could
also be from the Forsaken), and a dead body could start folks thinking
the killer was active. Think how Asm's death started us thinking that
maybe Lanfear had returned, or that Ish was still around/around again,
or that there had to be <em>some</em> sort of skulduggery going on. 
</P>
<H2>Why is Asmodean's death being kept secret, anyway?</H2>
<P>
Despite RJ's comments to the contrary, it is not at all obvious who
did the dirty deed. One question to ask ourselves is <em>why</em> RJ is keeping
it a secret. The lack of action on that front in <CITE>LoC</CITE> pretty much
demonstrates that the murder itself is <EM>not</EM> a major plot thread, so
there is no point in keeping it secret for the sake of keeping the
reader in suspense. Some people feel that Asm's killing is itself a
clue to something else that is going on, about which we don't know
yet; something like the return of Lanfear or Ish or some other "dead"
character, or that it is tied into the question of <a HREF="WhoTaim.html">who Mazrim Taim
<EM>really</EM> is</a>, and what he's really up to. Now, we are not the only ones
ignorant of the culprit. All of the characters (except one, obviously)
are also ignorant of whodunnit (if they're Forsaken), or of what
actually happenned (if they're Good Guys or rank-and-file DFs). So, if
one of the surviving Forsaken killed Asm, they must have a reason for
hiding it. After all, it's not like anybody would condemn them for
punishing a traitor. Maybe one of the Forsaken is up to something in
Caemlyn that he/she doesn't want any rivals for Nae'blis to know about. 
Anyway, that is something to think about.
