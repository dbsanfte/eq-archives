<h1 align="Center">1.4.3: Can Slayer Channel?</h1>
<p align="center">[John Novak, P. Korda]</p>
<hr>
<P>
Hopper says that Slayer is in TAR "in the flesh."
Folks have taken this as evidence that Slayer can channel. There is no
reason to suppose this. In fact, there are many reasons to think that he
cannot channel.
<P>
<h2>Why Slayer Cannot Channel</h2>
First, we will consider the idea that Slayer can channel the TP, but not
the OP. Moghedien believes that you have to be able to channel the OP in
order to channel the TP. While she may be mistaken, there is no reason to
assume so. Of the 30 people Moggy knows who were
permitted to use the TP, all 30 were channellers of the OP. Why should
Slayer be different?
<P>
Now, for the question of whether Slayer can channel at all. If Slayer
could channel when he was in the Two Rivers, why didn't he? It would
certainly have aided him in his missions to do away with Fain and Perrin.
Even if we assume that he didn't because he would rather fail totally than
chance anybody getting suspicious, why didn't he channel at Perrin in TAR?
[TSR: 53, The Price of a Departure, 614] The only person to see would have
been Perrin, and Perrin would have been dead. He used a bloody
<em>arrow</em> to try to kill Perrin with. That was the best he could
manage.
<P>
In the big battle at Emond's field, the AS, of course, were an advantage to
Perrin's side, but <em>if Isam could channel</em>, he could have done
something to counter that advantage. He clearly didn't (of course, he'd
been shot at that point, but if he could channel, he could have left,
gotten somebody to heal him, and returned for the fight).
<P>
Finally, this question was answered directly by RJ at a signing. From the
post-ACOS signing at Vancouver, 24 August 1996, reported by Lara Beaton:
"Slayer: Can't channel. ... He has certain 'gifts' granted to him by the
DO, but can't channel either the OP or the TP."
<h2>In the Flesh</h2>
<P>
If Slayer cannot channel, then what is up with that "in the flesh"
business?
<P>
The time Perrin saw Isam in the flesh was when Perrin met Hopper and they
discussed Slayer. There is another time when Slayer put himself into TAR
the old-fashioned way, by dreaming-- the time Perrin shot him. How do we
know this?
<P>
Well, the sequence of events goes like this: Perrin is sleeping.
Perrin dreams the wolf dream, and sees Slayer (looking like Isam). He
shoots Slayer with an arrow, producing a wound in the chest. I now
quote: "Slayer faded, him and his cry together, growing misty,
transparent, vanishing." (NOT like he opened a Gateway and walked out,
like he woke up.) Perrin then wakes up, hears a commotion, asks what's
going on, and finds out that Luc's just run off on his horse, hunched
over like he's got a wound. He was NOT wounded earlier. Now, why would
he have to escape from town if he was PHYSICALLY in TAR? He could just
have run someplace else in TAR and exited there. Much easier, and
safer. The whole scene is consistent with all the stuff we've heard
before about people being wounded while dreaming in TAR, and having
the wounds on their physical bodies.
<P>
Thus, we know that Slayer isn't <em>always</em> in TAR in the flesh.
<P>
We don't know enough about Slayer, or even about entering and leaving TAR
in the flesh, to say that the only way to do it is via a gateway. I can
think of at least one way to get into TAR in the flesh without channelling
yourself there. Somebody else can open a gateway for you. There's just as
much evidence for this as for him channelling himself in (that is, none),
and it doesn't produce the contradiction that if Slayer could channel on
his own, his Two Rivers strategy would have been very different.
