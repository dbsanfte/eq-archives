<h1 align="center">4.4: The Dark Prophecy</h1>
<HR>
<P>
[TGH: 7, Blood Calls Blood, 89]
<P>
This may not be actual prophecy. See Verin's commentary [TGH: 7, Blood
Calls Blood, 90]. Some parts may be prophetic, and others may just be
Shadow propaganda. It is a source of information, though, so here it is.
<blockquote>
Daughter of the Night, she walks again.<BR>
The ancient war, she yet fights. <BR>
Her new lover she seeks, who shall serve her and die, yet serve still.<BR>
Who shall stand against her coming?<BR>
The Shining Walls shall kneel. <BR>
</blockquote>
The Daughter of the Night is Lanfear, and she was indeed free at the time
this was written, and she was still fighting the ancient war (i.e. still
working for the DO). If "her new lover" is supposed to be Rand, that
line has definitely not been fulfilled. He might die, but it is very
doubtful at this point that he will serve her. "Shining Walls" is a
reference to Tar Valon, and thus the Aes Sedai. To whom are they
supposed to kneel--Lanfear? Rand? Egwene? The Seanchan?
<blockquote>
Blood feeds blood.<BR>
Blood calls blood.<BR>
Blood is, and blood was, and blood shall ever be.<BR>
<P>
The man who channels stands alone. <BR>
He gives his friends for sacrifice. <BR>
Two roads before him, one to death beyond dying, one to life eternal.<BR>
Which will he choose? Which will he choose?<BR>
What hand shelters? What hand slays?<BR>
</blockquote>
Likely, "the man who channels" is Rand. The bit about giving his friends
for sacrifice is interesting; Rand has been trying to isolate himself,
and focusing on using people as tools. By doing so, he may be playing
into the Shadow's hands. The two roads probably refer to joining with or
fighting against the Shadow. Which one leads to eternal life, which to
eternal death? The Chosen servants of the Shadow are granted
immortality. The last four questions seem to indicate that all is in a
state of confusion, which it is.
<blockquote>
Luc came to the Mountains of Dhoom.<BR>
Isam waited in the high passes.<BR>
The hunt is now begun. The Shadow's hounds now course, and kill.<BR>
One did live, and one did die, but both still are.<BR>
The Time of Change has come. <BR>
</blockquote>
This gives us a bit of history, and is our first clue as to the identity of
Slayer. Luc (Tigraine's brother) was sent into the Blight by Gitara Moroso.
Isam (Lan's cousin) vanished when his mother's party was run down by
Trollocs when Malkier fell. (Isam's mama was one of the people who
betrayed Malkier.) Apparently, Isam's soul got placed into Luc's body
(maybe a la Aran'gar and Osan'gar and Moridin), creating the person
Perrin knows of as Slayer.
<blockquote>
The Watchers wait on Toman Head.<BR>
The seed of the Hammer burns the ancient tree.<BR>
Death shall sow, and summer burn, before the Great Lord comes.<BR>
Death shall reap, and bodies fail, before the Great Lord comes.<BR>
Again the seed slays ancient wrong, before the Great Lord comes. <BR>
Now the Great Lord comes.<BR>
</blockquote>
This phrase deals with the Seanchan invasion. The "ancient tree" refers to
Tarabon, whose symbol is a tree (supposedly a branch of the Tree of Life).
The "seed of the Hammer" are the Seanchan, who claim to be Hawkwing's
descendents (Hawkwing was also known as the Hammer). Thus, the Seanchan
have invaded Tarabon. The bit about "summer burn" most likely refers to
the recent spate of DO-induced hot weather in Randland. The "bodies fail"
bit doesn't seem to have come to pass yet; it's been suggested that there
will be a plague of some sort. I have no idea what "ancient wrong" the
Seanchan (the seed) are supposed to slay before the Great Lord comes.
Perhaps it will be apparent when it happens.

when he (the DO) awakes, the new Dreadlords will be there to praise him."
