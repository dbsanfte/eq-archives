<h1 align="center">1.4.2: Slayer: The Luc-Isam Connection</h1>
<P align="center">[John Novak]</P>
<hr>
<P>
Who are Slayer, Lord Luc, and Isam, and what is their connection?
<P>
Isam is Lan's blood cousin. Lord Luc is the brother of
Tigraine, former Daughter-Heir of Andor, and thus Rand's blood uncle.
Slayer seems to be some amalgamation of the two.
<P>
Isam is first mentioned late in TEOTW. In [TEOTW, 47, More Tales
of the Wheel, 595], Agelmar begins his tale of the history of the
fall of Malkier. Briefly, it is revealed that al'Lan
Mandragoran is the son of al'Akir and el'Leanna. Al'Akir had a
brother, Lain Mandragoran, who was wed to Breyan. Lain and
Breyan were parents to a child named Isam.
<P>
Agelmar goes on to explain Breyan's jealousy and grief over her
husband's death in the Blasted Lands, and her plot with Cowin
Fairheart, hero and Darkfriend, to seize the throne for her son
Isam. This plot failed, and Breyan fled south with her infant
son Isam, and was overtaken by Trollocs. Their bodies were
never recovered.
<P>
It was at this time that el'Leanna and al'Akir sent their own
infant son, al'Lan, south to Fal Moran to safety. The Glossary
of LoC places al'Lan's date of birth in 953 NE, and thus we can
surmise that these events took place no later than 956 NE.
<P>
Lord Luc is the brother of Tigraine, former Daughter Heir of Andor. In
[TEOTW: 34, The Last Village, 441] we learn that Luc died in the Blight
while ostensibly in training to become the First Prince of the Sword.
Tigraine later vanished, before she'd properly assumed her throne.
<P>
Later, in [TSR: 34, He Who Comes With The Dawn, 392] we learn
that Tigraine ran off to become a Maiden of the Spear with the
Aiel at the directions of Gitara Moroso Sedai, some four years
before Laman's Sin. The Glossary of TSR places the Aiel War,
which began as a direct result of Laman's Sin, from 976 to 978
NE. Thus, Tigraine disappeared circa 972 NE.
<P>
On the next page, we learn that Janduin, Rand's biological father, was
killed on a venture to the Blasted Lands by a man who looked so like Shaiel
(who was really Tigraine, Luc's sister) that Janduin would not raise his
spear. This is almost certainly Lord Luc, and is in the third year of the
Aiel War, 978 NE.
<P>
Finally, in [LOC: 16, Tellings of the Wheel, 277] we learn that
Luc himself may have been sent into the Blight by Gitara Moroso
Sedai. After his disappearance, a year before Tigraine's flight,
or about 971 NE, rumors whispered that Gitara sent him to find
fame, or fate, or the Dragon Reborn or the Last Battle. Given
her connection with Tigraine's flight, it seems very likely that
the rumors are true.
<P>
The first reference tying Luc and Isam together in any way comes from the
Dark Prophecy, scrawled on the walls in Fal Dara after the Trolloc raid.
The relevant stanza [TGH: 7, Blood Calls Blood, 89] says:
<bLOCkquote>
Luc came to the Mountains of Dhoom.<BR>
Isam waited in the high passes.<BR>
The hunt is now begun. The Shadow's hounds now course, and kill.<BR>
One did live, and one did die, but both are.<BR>
The Time of Change has come.<BR>
</bLOCkquote>
The exact interpretation of this stanza is uncertain, but
clearly, Isam survived Breyan's flight south as long as circa
971 NE, when Luc went north into the Blight. Curiously, Luc and
Isam would have been roughly the same age, as well. Something
happened-- one died and one lived-- but somehow, both still
exist.
<P>
Now, the only time we know of that Luc or Isam enters the picture
in person, rather than as background, is in those segments of TSR
set around Perrin's trip back home to the Two Rivers.
<P>
The middle-aged Lord Luc who arrives in the Two Rivers, claiming
to help the villagers with the Whitecloaks and Trollocs, is that
same Luc. His age and coloring are correct, and Perrin muses
that if he resembles anyone, it is Rand. A cousinly
resemblance, no doubt. Luc is Rand's blood uncle.
<P>
Isam appears only in the Unseen World (T'A'R), and only by implication.
<P>
In [TSR: 28, To the Tower of Ghenjei, 320-325] Perrin has several
encounters in the Unseen World. One is with a man who tries to
kill him, a man with a cold, inhuman scent to Perrin's nose.
Hopper later identifies this dangerous creature as 'Slayer,' after
Slayer leads Perrin on a chase to the Tower of Ghenjei. Then Birgitte
appears. She identifies the Tower, connects it with the Aelfinn
and the Eelfinn, and warns Perrin away from it from and Slayer.
<P>
Later, Perrin sees Slayer in the Unseen World looking much like
Lan, dressed and styled in the Malkieri fashion [TSR: 42, A
Missing Leaf, 476]. He muses that the man looked enough like
Lan to be a brother.
<P>
In [TSR: 53, The Price of a Departure, 614-615] Perrin faces
Slayer in the Unseen World, and shoots him with an arrow. Slayer
disappears from the Unseen World, and when Perrin wakes up,
learns that Lord Luc had suddenly run off as if wounded.
<P>
Here, Perrin connects the two. He notes the simultaneity of the
wounds, and notes the same icy, inhuman smell from both of them.
<P>
In [TSR, 56, Goldeneyes, 645-646] the Trollocs in the
Two Rivers form a battle cry out of the name Isam. Clearly,
even though his activities seem limited to the Unseen World, his
influence extends to the physical flesh.
<P>
So much for evidence. What the Hell does any of this mean?
<P>
The best anyone has been able to do is note that Luc and Isam now
seem to be parts of a single being, aptly named Slayer
by the wolves he kills in the Unseen World.
<P>
We know from Egwene's training what some of the properties of the Unseen
World are. Relevant properties here include the loss of one's humanity (as
in, a cold, icy, inhuman scent coming from both Luc and Isam) after
repeatedly going to the Unseen World in the flesh, and the Unseen World's
tendency to reflect the traveler's mental state. Given that Slayer always
appears as Lord Luc in the world of the flesh and as Isam in the Unseen
World, it is a fairly safe to assume that Isam is somehow piloting Luc's
body.
<P>
From the Dark Prophecy stanza, it seems likely that Luc is the one who
lived, because his body is still wandering around, twitching and talking,
and that Isam is the one who died. In any other discussion, we'd just call
this a possession, and be done with it. There are no firm answers on how
or why Isam achieved control over Luc's body, nor how much of the future
Gitara Moroso saw when she sent Luc to his doom.
<P>
However, it should be noted that odd phenomena concerning life
and death, the mind, and memory are hardly unknown in the Wheel of
Time. Specifically, channellers of skill and strength are
perfectly capable of forcing spirits bound to wait their next
incarnation in the Unseen World back into the physical world.
See Moghedien and Birgitte. Channellers are perfectly able to
directly and powerfully impose their wills on others through
Compulsion. The Dark One is capable of taking deceased souls and
reincarnating them directly into new bodies, as with Aran'gar, Osan'gar,
and Moridin. (In fact, David Wren-Hardin goes so far as to suggest
that Aran'gar and Osan'gar have undergone the same process as
Slayer.)
<P>
It does not seem unlikely that Ishamael, perhaps with the counsel
or active help of the Dark One, could have managed this feat for
some obscure purpose.
