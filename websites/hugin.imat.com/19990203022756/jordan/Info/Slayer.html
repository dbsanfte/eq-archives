<H1>Who are Slayer, Lord Luc, and Isam?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: John Novak</H2>
<H2>(<a HREF="Slayer.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Isam is Lan's blood cousin.  Lord Luc is the brother of
Tigraine, former Queen of Andor, and thus Rand's blood uncle.
Slayer seems to be some amalgamation of the two.
</P>
<P>
Isam is first mentioned late in <CITE>TEotW</CITE>.  In <CITE>TEotW, 47, More Tales
of the Wheel, 595</CITE>, Agelmar begins his tale of the history of the
fall of Malkier.  Briefly, it is revealed that al'Lan
Mandragoran is the son of al'Akir and el'Leanna.  Al'Akir had a
brother, Lain Mandragoran, who was wed to Breyan.  Lain and
Breyan were parents to a child named Isam.
</P>
<P>
Agelmar goes on to explain Breyan's jealousy and grief over her
husband's death in the Blasted Lands, and her plot with Cowin
Fairheart, hero and Darkfriend, to seize the throne for her son
Isam.  This plot failed, and Breyan fled south with her infant
son Isam, and were overtaken by Trollocs.  Their bodies were
never recovered.
</P>
<P>
It was at this time that el'Leanna and al'Akir sent their own
infant son, al'Lan, south to Fal Moran to safety.  The Glossary
of LoC places al'Lan's birthdate in 953 NE, and thus we can
surmise that these events took place no later than 956 NE.
</P>
<P>
Lord Luc is the brother of Tigraine, former Daughter-Heir of
Andor.  In <CITE>TEotW, 34, The Last Village, 441</CITE>, we learn that Luc
died in the Blight while ostensibly in training to become the
First Prince of the Sword.  Tigraine later vanished, before
properly assuming her throne.
</P>
<P>
Later, in <CITE>TSR, 34, He Who Comes With The Dawn, 392</CITE> we learn
that Tigraine ran off to become a Maiden of the Spear with the
Aiel at the directions of Gitara Moroso Sedai, some four years
before Laman's Sin.  The Glossary of <CITE>TSR</CITE> places the Aiel War,
which begun as a direct result of Laman's Sin, from 976 to 978
NE.  Thus, Tigraine disappeared circa 972 NE.
</P>
<P>
On the next page, we learn that Janduin, Rand's biological
father, was killed on a venture to the Blasted Lands by a man who
looked so like Shaiel that Janduin would not raise his spear.
This is almost certinaly Lord Luc, and is in the third year of
the Aiel War, 977 NE.
</P>
<P>
Finally, in <CITE>16, LoC, Tellings of the Wheel, 277</CITE> we learn that
Luc himself may have been sent into the Blight by Gitara Moroso
Sedai.  After his disappearance, a year before Tigraine's flight,
or about 971 NE, rumors whispered that Gitara sent him to find
fame, or fate, or the Dragon Reborn or the Last Battle.  Given
her connection with Tigraine's flight, it seems very likely that
the rumors are true.
</P>
<P>
The first reference tying Luc and Isam together in any way comes
from the Dark Prophecy, scrawled on the walls in Fal Dara after
the Trolloc raid.  A relevant stanza says:
</P>
<P ALIGN="center">
"Luc came to the Mountains of Dhoom.<BR>
Isam waited in the high passes.<BR>
The hunt is now begun. The Shadow's hounds now course, and kill.<BR>
One did live, and one did die, but both are.<BR>
The Time of Change has come."<BR>
(<CITE>TGH, 7, Blood Calls Blood, 89</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
The exact interpretation of this stanza is uncertain, but,
clearly, Isam survived Breyan's flight south as long as circa
971 NE, when Luc went north into the Blight.  Curiously, Luc and
Isam would have been roughly the same age, as well.  Something
happened -- one died and one lived -- but somehow, both still
exist.
</P>
<P>
Now, the only time we know of that Luc or Isam enter the picture
in person, rather than as background, is in those segments of <CITE>TSR</CITE>
set around Perrin's trip back home to the Two Rivers.
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged Lord Luc who arrives in the Two Rivers, claiming
to help the villagers with the Whitecloaks and Trollocs, is that
same Luc.  His age and coloring are correct, and Perrin muses
that if he resembles anyone, it is Rand: a cousinly
resemblance, no doubt.  Luc is Rand's blood uncle.
</P>
<P>
Isam appears only in the Unseen World, and only by implication.
</P>
<P>
In <CITE>TSR, 28, To the Tower of Ghenjei</CITE>, Perrin has several
encounters in the Unseen World.  One is with a man who tries to
kill him, a man with a cold, inhuman scent to Perrin's nose.
Hopper later identifies this dangerous creature as &#96;Slayer&#39;, after 
Slayer leads Perrin on a chase to the Tower of Ghenjei.  Birgitte
appears, then, identifies the Tower, connects it with the Aelfinn
and the Eelfinn, and warns Perrin away from it, and Slayer.
</P>
<P>
Later, Perrin sees Slayer in the Unseen World looking much like
Lan, dressed and styled in the Malkieri fashion (<CITE>TSR, 42, A
Missing Leaf, 476</CITE>).  He muses that the man looked enough like
Lan to be a brother.
</P>
<P>
In <CITE>TSR, 53, The Price of a Departure, 614-615</CITE> Perrin faces
Slayer in the Unseen World, and shoots him with an arrow.  Slayer
disappears from the Unseen World, and, when Perrin wakes up,
learns that Lord Luc had suddenly run off as if wounded.
</P>
<P>
Here, Perrin connects the two.  He notes the simultaneity of the
wounds, and notes the same icy, inhuman smell from both of them.
</P><P>
In <CITE>TSR, 56, Goldeneyes, 645-646</CITE>, the trollocs in the
Two Rivers form a battle cry out of the name &#96;Isam&#39;.  Clearly,
even though his activities seem limited to the Unseen World, his
influence extends to the physical flesh.
</P>
<P>
So much for evidence.  What the Hell does any of this mean?
</P>
<P>
The best anyone has been able to do is note that Luc and Isam now
seem to be separate parts of a single being, aptly named Slayer
by the wolves he kills in the Unseen World.
</P>
<P>
We know, from Egwene's training, what some of the properties of the
Unseen World are.  Relevant properties here include the loss of
one's humanity (as in, a cold, icy, inhuman scent coming from
both Luc and Isam) after going to the Unseen World in the flesh,
and the Unseen World's tendency to reflect the traveler's mental
state.  Given that Slayer always appears as Lord Luc in the world
of the flesh and as Isam in the Unseen World, it is fairly safe
to assume that Isam is somehow piloting Luc's body.
</P>
<P>
From the stanza, it seems likely that Luc is the one who lived,
because his body is still wandering around, twitching and talking,
and that Isam is the one who died.  In any other discussion, we'd
just call this a possession, and be done with it.  There are no
firm answers on how or why Isam was given control over Luc's
body, nor how much of the future Gitara Moroso saw when she sent
Luc to his doom.  
</P>
<P>
However, it should be noted that odd phenomena concerning life
and death, the mind and memory, are hardly unknown in <CITE>The Wheel of
Time</CITE>.  Specifically, channelers of skill and strength are
perfectly capable of forcing spirits bound to wait their next
incarnation in the Unseen World back into the physical world.
See Moghedien and Birgitte.  Channelers are perfectly able to
directly and powerfully impose their wills on others through
Compulsion.  The Dark One is capable of taking deceased souls and
reincarnating them directly into new bodies, as with Aran'gar and
Osan'gar.  (In fact, David Wren-Hardin goes so far as to suggest
that Aran'gar and Osan'gar have undergone the same process as
Slayer.)
</P>
<P>
It does not seem unlikely that Ishamael, perhaps with the counsel
or active help of the Dark One, could have managed this feat for
some obscure purpose.
</P>
<P>
One further note: Hopper says that Slayer is in T'A'R "in the flesh."
Folks have taken this as evidence that Slayer can channel. There is no
reason to suppose this (also, see section 1.54, at the end, on
evidence for why Slayer cannot channel). What's up with that "in the
flesh" stuff?
</P>
<P>
Let us assume nothing weird like Isam is permanently in T'A'R in the
flesh and controls Luc's body from there. Let us assume that, somehow,
Isam put himself into T'A'R in the flesh by walking through a
Gateway. That was the time when Perrin met Hopper and they discussed
Slayer. There is <em>another</em> time when Slayer was dreaming into T'A'R -- the
time Perrin shot him. How do we know this?
</P>
<P>
Well, the sequence of events goes like this: Perrin is sleeping.
Perrin dreams the Wolf Dream, and sees Slayer (looking like Isam). He
shoots Slayer with an arrow, producing a wound in the chest. I now
quote: "Slayer faded, him and his cry together, growing misty,
transparent, vanishing." (<em>Not</em> like he opened a Gateway and walked out,
like he woke up.) Perrin then wakes up, hears a commotion, asks what's
going on, and finds out that Luc's just run off on his horse, hunched
over like he's got a wound. He was <em>not</em> wounded earlier. Now, why would
he have to escape from town if he was <em>physically</em> in T'A'R? He could just
have run someplace else in T'A'R and exited there. Much easier, and
safer. The whole scene is consistent with all the stuff we've heard
before about people being wounded while dreaming in T'A'R, and having
the wounds on their physical bodies.
</P>
<P>
We don't know enough about Slayer, or even going in and out of T'A'R in
the flesh, to say that the only way to do it is via a gateway. I can
think of at least one way to get into T'A'R in the flesh without channelling
yourself there: Somebody else can open a gateway for you. There's just
as much evidence for this as for him channelling himself in
(i.e., none), and it doesn't produce the contradiction that, if Slayer
could channel on his own, his Two Rivers strategy would have been very
different.
