<h1 align="center">1.3.1: What are those black threads on the male
Forsaken?</h1>
<P align="center">[Hawk, Korda]</P>
<hr>
<P>
When Rand has battled the male Forsaken, he has sometimes seen black
threads, wires, or cords running off from them. This is seen when Rand
battles Ishy in [TEOTW: 51, Against the Shadow, 637-40], and
Asmodean in [TSR: 58, The Traps of Rhuidean, 671-675]. So what's
the deal with these strings?
<P>
The thick black threads are the Forsaken's connection to the DO. The
connection with the DO is what keeps the male Forsaken from falling prey to
the madness from the taint on Saidin (see Asmodean's statements to Rand in
TSR after his black "thread" was severed). Rand's thread in TEotW was
silver and thinner because it was from that pure pool of saidin that was
the Eye of the World.
<P>
We've never seen the threads on a female Forsaken, so it is possible that
the threads are themselves the protection from the taint. Perhaps they act
as a kind of filter on Saidin, or a conduit through which the DO siphons
off the taint when the Forsaken draws upon the Source.
<P>
It's also been suggested that the threads are a connection for channelling
the True Power. This isn't very likely. The problems with this idea are:
1) the female Forsaken can use the TP, but nobody ever sees the black cords
on them, 2) the black cords were seen on <EM>Asmodean</EM>, and of all
the Forsaken, the one who we'd least expect to use the very dangerous TP in
an instance where the OP would serve just as well (Skimming) is Asmodean,
and 3) From [ACOS book signing, Dunwoody, Georgia; 9 October, 1996, report by
Erica Sadun], "Access to the TP is a matter of wanting it and the dark one
letting you. NOT black cords."
<P>
Another suggestion is that the presence or absence of the threads could be
used to identify male Forsaken. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The
black cords are only seen/sensed under very special circumstances. Rand
has only seen them in two places--T'A'R and the in-between space used for
Skimming. Note that Rand has seen male Forsaken without seeing the cords:
Aginor and Balthamel at the Eye and Be'lal in the Heart of the Stone.
Furthermore, he doesn't ALWAYS see the black threads when he's in TAR with
a Forsaken--he never saw them on Rahvin. So, the black threads are not a
reliable way to identify Forsaken under any circumstances, even those
under which the threads have been seen in the past.
