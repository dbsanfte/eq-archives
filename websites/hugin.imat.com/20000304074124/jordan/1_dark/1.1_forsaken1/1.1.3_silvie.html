<h1 align="center">1.1.3: Who was "Silvie"?</h1>

<P>
"Silvie" is the name given by the "old woman" Egwene meets in TAR in [TDR:
27, Tel'aran'rhiod, 257-9]. Most likely, she was Lanfear; it was part of
her plot to get Rand and/or Mat to go to Tear. Egwene and Nynaeve were to
be bait to draw him there, only Rand was already going there to stop their
attacks through his dreams. The girls were probably just a backup in case
he resisted the dreams or learned to shield them on his own. Egwene and
Nynaeve were to be Be'lal and Ish's bait to draw Rand, while Liandrin and
Co. were the bait to draw draw Egwene and Nynaeve. See Perrin's dream
about the trap in [TDR: 43, Shadowbrothers, 426] which matches Egwene's
dreams about "puppets" in [TDR: 37, Fires in Cairhien, 352-3]. Lanfear was
playing along with Ish, but working towards her own goals. Another
possibility is that Lanfear sent them to mess up Be'lal and Mesaana's plan.
<P>
There's no doubt that Silvie was Lanfear. The reason for ripping off
Egwene's ring ter'angreal to throw her out of T'A'R was just her cruel
streak; Lanfear knew she was a Dreamer since she had been haunting the
White Tower as Else, and just wanted Egwene to go to the Heart of the Stone
in T'A'R to make sure the girls decided to go there. Once she had
accomplished that, why not send her out the hard way? After all, Lanfear
claimed T'A'R as her domain (even though Mog. was stronger there), so
there was no need for Egwene to learn too much about "her domain." Plus,
her precious LTT reborn had once loved this girl; I'm sure she couldn't
resist inflicting a little pain on her, especially since the fact that Eg
was bait to draw Rand to Tear meant that he still cared about her. That
must have driven Lanfear bonkers.
