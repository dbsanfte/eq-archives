<H1>What is the range on sensing other channelers?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
A channeler can sense another channeler, under various conditions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A female can sense another female, even if neither of them are
holding the Source at the time. This is a skill which takes some time
to learn. If one is really good, it is not necessary to see the other
woman in order to know she is there. (One of the Tower AS sensing Eg
in Cairhien.) In addition, a female can tell when another is embracing
the Source, by a great glow surrounding the channeler.

<LI>Females cannot naturally sense male channeling. It may be that
they can do so through the use of some sort of OP trick.

<LI>Male channelers can sense females embracing the Source, and/or
channeling, by a prickling feeling on the skin. There is some range on
this, an idea of which we can get from (<CITE>TFOH: REF?</CITE>) where Moiraine is
using the OP to eavesdrop on Rand and Asm, Moiraine's tent is said to
be "not far" from Rand's, maybe around 20m. Note that the amount of
channeling going on is probably very small; a bigger flow could
increase the detection range. 

<LI>Male channelers can sense male channeling, as well as other men
holding the source (<CITE>LOC, 3, ?, A Woman's Eyes, 92</CITE>). The sensing is not
as obvious as when females sense other females. The range is less: And
here is another quote which contradicts the idea that men can sense
men far away: "Women who could channel saw a glow surrounding another
woman who had embraced saidar and felt her channeling clearly, but he
never saw anything around Asmodean, and felt little." (<CITE>TFOH,?,?,?,75</CITE>)
This is with Asm is in the same room.
</UL>
<P>
However, there seems to be some confusion of exactly _how_ far this
range is. When Rand is running around trying to balefire the hell out
of Rahvin, <EM>even though Rahvin is holding saidin</EM>, Rand can't feel
where he is. Also, Asm describes trying to locate another man
channeling is "Like trying to find a lion in high grass." -- <CITE>TFOH: 55,
934, The Threads Burn, REF?</CITE> After a Draghkar attack on Rand's camp,
Asmodean tells him that he had sensed the Draghkar, but had not done
anything about it, since he thought Rand could deal with it, which he
did. Rand replies: "'Well for you that you didn't,' Rand cut him off,
sitting cross-legged in the dark.  'If I had felt you full of saidin
out there tonight, I might have killed you.'  "The other man's laugh
was shaky. 'I thought of that, too.'"  (<CITE>FOH: 22, 405, Birdcalls by
Night, 287</CITE>) This little snippet of conversation seems fairly clear.
Rand obviously felt capable of sensing Asm from as far away as Rand
was from Asm during the fight.  Also, in LOC, Rand says to Taim (<CITE>LOC:
42,The Black Tower, 545</CITE>): "If I feel a man channel in Caemlyn...and
don't think you can stay far enough from the Palace that I won't feel
it and be safe."  (NB: Rand may just be bluffing, here. Or it might
just be something along the lines of "If I hear you use that sort of
language in this house, young man, I'll wash your mouth out with
soap!") Rand was able to sense lightening from Sammael (He thinks it
is Sammael, at least) during the battle of Cairhien.  (<CITE>TFOH: 44, ?,
The Lesser Sadness, 495</CITE>) Maybe the ability to sense male channeling is
dependent on the strength of the particular flow being channeled.
This seems to be implied by Asmodean when he talks to Rand about
blocking Aviendha's gateway to Seanchan: "I felt your weave - anybody
within a mile could have felt it - I never saw anything like it - I
didn't know that anyone but Demandred could block a gateway that was
closing." (<CITE>TFOH:?,?,?,374</CITE>)
