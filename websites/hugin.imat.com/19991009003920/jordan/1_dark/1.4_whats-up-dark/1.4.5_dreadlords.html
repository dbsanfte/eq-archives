<h1 align="center">1.4.5: Who will be the Dreadlords in the Last Battle?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>
<Strong>Dreadlords</strong>: Those men and women who, able to channel the
One Power, went over to the Shadow during the Trolloc Wars, acting as
commanders of the Trolloc forces. [TEOTW: Glossary, 662]
</blockquote>
<P>
So, the question is, will the Shadow have similar human commanders of
Trollocs for the Last Battle? If so, then who will these commanders be?
Here are some possibilities:
<OL>
<LI>Black Ajah. Pro: loads of experience in both channelling and bossing
folks around. Con: not much battle experience, except for Reds who
hunt down False Dragons, and Greens, who do that sort of thing for
fun.
<LI>Darkfriend sul'dam, with a damane or two as a Power source. Pro:
Battle experience. Con: depends upon a possibly non-loyal damane for
Power. This could cause problems in the middle of a fight. No
experience in using the OP by themselves.
<LI>Runaway DF damane. Pro: knows how to use OP in battle. Con: No
experience in commanding things, making decisions, or any sort of
independent thought.
<LI>Asha'man. Pro: big motivation to be sworn to the Shadow-- protection
from the Taint. Specifically trained to use the OP in battle. Possibly, a
recruiting agent right in the camp ("Mr. Taimandred? I'd like to join the
<em>Black</em> tower, if you know what I mean."). Con: Some have less
experience in command, and thus would make poor commanders.
<LI>DF Windfinders. Not much to say pro or con, since we know next to
nothing about the Sea Folk or Windfinders at all.
<LI>Male Aiel Channelers: Pro: tradition is to go into the Blight to
fight Shadowspawn until you die. Maybe some don't die, but get picked up
and offered a second chance at eternal life, sans Taint. Con: the Blight
is <em>nasty</em>. It's doubtful even an Aiel could survive a long time
there, if he was bent on fighting. Not likely that many survive long
enough to get recruited or converted. Plus, nobody has ever <em>seen</em>
these supposed Aiel Dreadlords, either in the Blight, at SG, or in
Randland.
<LI>Random Joe Randlander who finds out he can channel. Pro: Why not?
Again, a great incentive to join up-- no Taint. If Joe is already a DF
when he discovers channelling, all the more reason. Con: With all
those other great candidates, why would the Shadow bother searching
the populace for the 1:10000+ men who channel?
<LI>Dreadlord Search Program: Darkfriends are screened for the ability
to channel, and then put into a Dreadlord Training Program. (Liandrin
was recruited as a DF before she ever went to the Tower. She learned
some channelling, too. [TFOH: 18, A Hound of Darkness, 303].)
<LI>Non-Channelers. Pro: In TGH, Bors thinks he has a chance of being a
Dreadlord, even though he cannot channel. Con: You need to be Fain or
a channeler to have enough power over a Fade to command him. We
already know J. Carridin never stood a chance with a Fade.
<LI>No Dreadlords--the DO has something better. Pro: Look at that shiny
new Myrddraal the DO has! Even the Forsaken are frightened by it. It
can scare channelers, channelers can scare normal Fades, Fades scare
Trollocs. Cut out the middlemen, and make a bunch of Super-Fades to be
dreadlords? What Lord of Evil needs humans anyway? It's not like he's
going to leave them around after he wins, after all. Con: Shaidar Haran
is special, we've only seen one of his kind. Maybe the DO can't make
any more like him. Maybe the DO doesn't want to. SH is too much of a
mystery to assume he is the first of a new model of Fade.
