<H1>Why did Sammael claim he had a truce with Rand?</H1>

1) Andris died in a pool of blood, delivering the message to Sammael
that there would be no truce and Sammael lied to Graendal. Why would
Sammael lie? All the Forsaken want to be Nae'blis. All the Forsaken
think that Rand stands a chance at becoming Nae'blis if he caves to
the Dark One.  Therefore, all the Forsaken want Rand dead. The Dark
One, on the other hand, most explicitly does <EM>not</EM> want Rand dead.  He
will punish any Forsaken who kills Rand.  Therefore, all the Forsaken
want to make the other Forsaken paranoid enough to bump Rand off on
their own.  This eliminates <EM>two</EM> contenders to the title of
Nae'blis: Rand, and whichever idiot kills him.

2) Andris died in a pool of blood, delivering the message to Sammael
that there would be a truce because someone else intervened to put
Sammael off his guard while Rand readies his counter-stroke from Tear
and the Plains of Maredo. Someone who knew that Sammael's emissary was
meeting with Rand at that moment. Who was present?  Bashere, a
Saldaean named Hamad, some Aiel, and -- hiding behind a column --
Aviendha. <em>Con:</em> Rand should have been able to feel another man
channeling or have experienced goosebumps if Aviendha channeled, and
Sammael's thoughts about manipulating Graendal (<CITE>LoC: 23, To Understand
A Message, 349</CITE>) don't make sense if he isn't lying.
