<h1 align="center">1.5.4: Sheriam: Black or Blue?</h1>
<hr>
Prior to TPOD, there was little reason to really believe Sheriam was BA.
There was some speculation, based mostly on the fact that Mistress of
Novices would be a good position for a Black Sister. Certain examples of
Sheriam's behavior towards El, Eg, and Ny could indicate that she is BA,
but they all are explained equally well by considering that, in all these
instances, she is a high-ranking Aes Sedai (either Mistress of Novices or
part of the original Salidar Cabal) and El, Eg, and Ny are students. Here
are the examples:
<UL>
<LI>Egwene's Accepted test: she says something like "He said they
could turn him to the Shadow, against his will. Can they?" [TDR: 22,
The Price of the Ring, 202-3]. Sheriam then tells her about the 13
Dreadlords + 13 Fades trick, but she doesn't wonder who "he" was. On
the other hand, why would a Darkfriend tell Egwene about that trick,
so that she'd know to watch out for it? As for "he," why should she
wonder? The "people" who appear in the testing ter'angreal aren't even
always real.
<P>
<LI>The incident with the Gray Men in the Tower. One of them is found dead
in Sheriam's bedroom, the other is found killed. Nynaeve points out
that Sheriam never once wonders about who killed the Soulless. She
acts rather suspicious in general during that whole scene. [TDR: 15,
The Gray Man, 142-146]. This can be explained by saying she was just
being brusque with the kids because she wanted them to keep quiet.
Why <em>should</em> she wonder who killed him in front of the Accepted?
To her, they're irresponsible runaways.
<P>
<LI>Sheriam's also the perfect operative of the Shadow for the
tower-in-exile in Salidar. There were many suspicious things about
her treatment of Elayne and Nynaeve when they arrived in Salidar.
Sheriam seemed to be the most ardent about confiscating the
ter'angreal. Again, it could very well be that she's just being Aes
Sedai. Why should she let the kids keep the ter'angreal, or approve
of them gallivanting about the glove, instead of studying like they
should be?
<P>
<LI>The only maid of Egwene's who wasn't killed by Halima was Chesa. Chesa
was assigned by Sheriam [LOC: 36, The Amyrlin is Raised,479]. Chesa is
possibly a spy for Sheriam, or for Sheriam's master (see below).
</UL>
<P>
In [TPOD, 16, Unexpected Absences, 345], however, we discover that Sheriam
is definitely under somebody's thumb. In this scene, Sheriam is tortured
for information by a mysterious channeler. It is clear that this is not
the first time that this has happened. What can we tell from this scene?
<UL>
<LI>Sheriam's tormenter is a channeler. Sheriam is restrained, shielded,
and stripped with the Power. We can't say whether this person channels
saidin or saidar. One might think that Sheriam would sense a female
channeler in her tent. In fact, she might have done so, but it was too
late to run away: "She had only time to realize she was not alone when
she was shielded..."
<LI>The tormenter is not particularly subtle in her/his use of the OP in
torturing Sheriam. Sheriam is beaten-- "when she was left alone... it
was to lie... whimpering from her welts." This tells us little, but
it is definitely not Semirhage's style. (Sem's torture of Cabriana in
[LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 139-143] is much more complex. Sem
stimulates the pain centers of her subject's brain directly.)
<LI>The tormenter is questioning Sheriam because he/she wants to know what
Egwene was planning: "That girl is up to something, and I want to know
what."
<LI>This has been going on for some time. The torturer says, "you were
supposed to keep me informed."
<LI>Sheriam believes her predicament stems from talking to at least one of
the Sitters. She wishes "that she had never in her life spoken to a
single sister in the Hall."
</UL>
<P>
So, what is going on? Either: 1) Sheriam is BA, and her tormenter is
either BA or a Forsaken, 2) Sheriam is BA, and her tormenter is not
somebody related to the Dark, 3) Sheriam is not BA, but her tormenter is BA
or Forsaken, or 4) Neither Sheriam nor her tormenter is of the Dark. This
all basically boils down to two questions: 1) Who is Sheriam's torturer? 2)
Does Sheriam's predicament mean she is BA?
<h2>Who is pummelling Sheriam?</h2>
<P>
Before attacking the question of specific suspects, let's address a general
question: is the culprit a channeler of saidar or saidin? One argument in
favor of saidin is that Sheriam was easily shielded and bound before she
noticed anybody was in her tent. Female channelers are supposedly able to
sense the presence of other female channelers. Furthermore, no one else,
e.g. Egwene, noticed a lot of the OP being used in Sheriam's tent.
<P>
However, it's not really possible to eliminate saidar-channelers on this
basis. Sheriam may have been able to sense the channeler in her tent if
she'd been looking for one. However, she was not expecting her visitor.
From [LOC: 27, Gifts, 389-390] we know that an AS can't always pinpoint the
location of a channeler she can't see. Thus, even if Sheriam sensed the
presence of another woman channeler, she may not have thought it was
important, since she's surrounded by woman channelers. Since it is not at
all clear she could have pinpointed the channeler's presence to her own
small tent, we shouldn't be too surprised that she didn't sense her
assailant, even if it was a woman.
<P>
The question of somebody else detecting the flows is a greater objection.
However, it is not even close to being an insurmountable obstacle. For one
thing, the scene occurs late at night, so most potential witnesses would
have been asleep, or at least inside their own tents. Secondly, Sheriam's
assailant would have taken precautions to prevent detection-- inverting and
tying off the flows which shielded and bound Sheriam, for example. As for
the beating itself, as Amy Gray points out, it is possible that "it doesn't
take a significantly higher amount of the Power to make clubs of Air and
move them around than it does to, say, move a chair with the Power or
channel your lamp lit-- the sort of things she might actually be doing in
her tent." Furthermore, while it is reasonable to assume that the beating
was done with the Power, nothing in the scene indicates that it was
actually done that way. It's quite possible that Sheriam was beaten
with a stick.
<P>
Therefore, we cannot rule out all female channelers as suspects. Let us now
turn to the question of particular suspects. The general categories are a
Forsaken, a Black Sister, or Somebody Not Affiliated with the Shadow.
<h3>Forsaken</h3>
<P>
<strong>General comments:</strong> In general, the Forsaken have not shown
a predilection for using physical torture to extract information from
informants. When the informant is a Darkfriend, they tend to rely on that
person's greed, their DF Oaths, and good old-fashioned fear. When the
informant is not a sworn DF, most of the Forsaken tend to use Compulsion.
If the attacker was a Forsaken, it shouldn't have taken "a long time to
convince her questioner that she had already told all she knew, that she
would never hold back a word, not a whisper." A Forsaken could have simply
Compelled her to spill her guts. However, while this general consideration
makes it less likely that the attacker was a Forsaken, we certainly can't
rule it out. There is evidence that the attacker was a Forsaken; the
method used to strip Sheriam ("Dress and shift burst away from her body
like a pricked bubble.") sounds similar to the method Semirhage uses in
[LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 139]: "she wielded Fire and Wind, slicing
away dress and shift." Semirhage then thinks, "she doubted [the captured
Aes Sedai] could duplicate those simple feats even if she had been able to
follow them." Semirhage, at least, thinks that modern AS don't know how to
do the clothes-stripping trick. Among the Forsaken, the most likely
candidates for Sheriam's assailant are Semirhage, Aran'gar/Halima, and
Mesaana.
<P>
<strong>Semirhage</strong>: She is the only Forsaken who has shown or
expressed a preference for torture over Compulsion as a way to gain
information and loyalty [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 140]. However,
Sheriam's interrogation is a far cry from that of Cabriana Mecandes in
[LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 139-143]. Physically beating her subject
seems too mundane, too unsophisticated for Semirhage. Sem has mastered the
art of stimulating her subject's brain to feel pain and pleasure directly,
a method much more effective than physical attack, and it doesn't leave any
marks. It's unlikely that she'd stoop to beating a subject with Air, or
Light forbid, a stick.
<P>
<strong>Aran'gar</strong>: There is evidence which provides a connection
between Sheriam and Aran'gar: Egwene's maid Chesa. Chesa was hired by
Sheriam. Eg's other two maids were hired by Romanda and Lelaine, and it's
strongly implied that all three were intended to spy on Egwene for Sheriam,
Romanda, and Lelaine, respectively.
(<A HREF="1.5.5_chesa.html">See Section 1.5.5</A> for more on Chesa.)
Now, Aran'gar killed Romanda and Lelaine's hirelings, leaving Chesa to
attend Egwene 'round the clock. This makes sense if Aran'gar is Sheriam's
master. Either Chesa reports to Sheriam, and Sheriam to Aran'gar, or Chesa
is a DF who reports directly to Aran'gar, and Sheriam hired her at
Aran'gar's instructions. Aran'gar also explains Sheriam's regrets about
talking to Sitters/a Sitter. Aran'gar attached herself to Delana, a BA who
is a Sitter. Delana could be the Sitter Sheriam is thinking of.
<P>
On the other hand, since Halima has direct access to Egwene and should have
no compunction at using Compulsion on her, what info could she possibly
require from Sheriam? Egwene does not confide in Sheriam, and Halima is
unlikely to get better intelligence by this route than by her own direct
efforts. As for acquiring info on other SAS Sitters (as opposed to info on
Egwene or her plans), Halima has Delana. Thus the problem with Halima is
that it is difficult to imagine her needing Sheriam's information on
<em>anything</em>, making the scene make no real sense with her as the
torturer except as a "look, the bad guys are bad because they do bad
things" establishment sequence (in which case, the author might as well
show us the identity of the the bad guy, so we can shudder and say "wow,
s/he's <em>really</em> bad!"). [Elizabeth Cornwell]
<P>
<strong>Mesaana</strong>: "Mesaana (who neither knows about nor is working
with Halima), but who does have a vested interest in all events concerning
the Tower, is a good suspect for the torturer. She <em>does</em>
need info on Egwene's plans and, since Sheriam is Egwene's Keeper, would
have every reason to believe that Sheriam would be a good source of such
information." [Elizabeth Cornwell] However, as far as we know, Mesaana has
never shown any interest in the Salidar Aes Sedai; she seems to be
concentrating her efforts on the Tower.
<h3>Black Ajah</h3>
<P>
<strong>General Considerations</strong>: The relative lack of
sophistication in Sheriam's interrogation (no Compulsion or other
Forsaken-style tricks) makes the Black Ajah (rather than the Forsaken) a
good place to look for Sheriam's abuser. Narrowing this suspect pool is
difficult, since we only know of one BA in the Salidar group-- Delana.
Another Black suspect is Alviarin, who can Travel, and who may have been
out of the Tower when Sheriam was being beaten up. Apart from these two,
the only other BA we know about are too far away from the Salidar army to
be candidates. (Of course, there is the possibility that an unknown BA in
the Salidar group is the culprit.)
<P>
<strong>Delana</strong>: Delana is a Sitter, which would explain Sheriam's
regrets about talking to a Sitter. Delana could be interrogating Sheriam
either at Aran'gar's instigation or as an independent effort. (She may be
trying to gather information which would put her in good standing with
Aran'gar.) A point against her is that she seems like something of a wet
hen, so far as BA are concerned, and may not have it in her to torture
Sheriam so brutally.
<P>
<strong>Alviarin</strong>: Like Mesaana, Alviarin has a vested interest in
keeping tabs on the SAS. If Elaida were to be deposed by the rebels,
Alviarin would fall with her. Since she can Travel, we know she's not
particularly weak in the OP, and thus could possibly shield Sheriam, who is
also relatively strong. Torturing people for information is not beyond
her-- she is most likely the one who tortured the novice Sahra in [TSR:
17, Deceptions, 204-205], to gain information which led to the Tower coup.
She also happily participated in the Questioning of Siuan and Leane. From
Elaida, we know that Alviarin may have been out of the Tower at the time
Sheriam was being attacked [TPOD: 25, An Unwelcome Return, 492], and since
she can Travel, she could have easily made a trip to Salidar. One problem
with Alviarin being the attacker is that it doesn't explain Sheriam's
thoughts about Sitters. The only possibility which comes to mind is if
Elaida's secret plan [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 24-26] involves the SAS
Sitters, and Alviarin knows of it. Needless to say, this is a very tenuous
connection.
<h3>Non-Dark Person</h3>
<P>
<strong>General Considerations</strong>: The nature of the attack certainly
seems to imply that a Person of the Dark was behind it. The OP was
apparently used, and non-Black AS cannot use the OP as a weapon. There are
loopholes, as indicated by Rand's adventures with his TAS kidnappers.
However, the non-Black TAS quickly became unable to participate in Rand's
torture, when they started to believe that it <em>was</em> torture, and not
punishment. However, it is conceivable that a non-Black AS could convince
herself that using the OP to torture Sheriam was not "using the OP as a
weapon." An agent of Elaida's, for example, might regard Sheriam as a
rebel, and thus deserving of punishment. Note that Sheriam's treatment
falls within Tower custom on questioning by another Aes Sedai [TPOD: 4, A
Quiet Place, 106-107]. No blood as far as we know was drawn and the
prohibition of dusk and dawn were also met seemingly. People who have been
suggested as non-Black attackers are Romanda and Lelaine, mostly because
they are Sitters, and they have an interest in knowing what Egwene is up
to. John Hamby points out, "Both Romanda and Lelaine are caught off-guard
by the news of the Andoran and Murandian armies. I think that Sheriam
mentioned something in the Hall that might have let one of the two gain
power over her. What this may be is of course not known but my suspicions
are that it is the knowledge of the ten spies sent without the Hall's
knowing. This is the only piece of info that comes to mind that could bind
Sheriam and let this person treat her as such. Also both of these two
sisters are considerably older and stronger. So part of her submission
could be deference as well as being blackmailed."
<P>
<strong>Lelaine</strong>: Between the two of them, there is a bit more
reason to suspect Lelaine than Romanda. Rich Boye' points out, "The fact
that Lelaine tries to be sweet and kindly all the time pretty much makes me
distrust her. Something must be swimming in her depths, and I think she's
prone to lashing out in private. Anyway, she is always patting Egwene and
those who deems inferior (Siuan, being the most notable other one) touching
cheeks, stroking hair, etc... Before Sheriam's assailant lets fly with the
OP, he or she strokes Sheriam's hair." John Hamby adds, "Since Lelaine is
Blue and so is Sheriam that might add another layer to the control that
Sheriam's questioner has over her. Also this would fit with the part about
the ten spies as no Blues were a part of that group. So Lelaine gains much
more with Sheriam under her thumb than she would in exposing a Blue agent."
<h2>Does Sheriam's predicament mean she is a Darkfriend or not?</h2>
<P>
Sheriam's situation has been taken (by different people, obviously) as an
indication that a) she is a Darkfriend, and b) she is not a Darkfriend.
Here are the arguments:
<h3>Sheriam is Black</h3>
<P>
Prior to this incident, there had already been suspicion cast on Sheriam,
most especially from the Gray Men business in TDR. Darkfriends can treat
one another quite badly, especially if revenge or a reversal of position is
involved (for example, Shiaine's treatment of Falion and Carridin in [TPOD:
28, Crimsonthorn, 553-554]). If Sheriam is not BA, then she must be bound
the the Three Oaths, and cannot lie directly. Because of this, her abuser
should have been able to easily determine that she had told them all she
knew. Of course, her abuser may have thought Sheriam had a poor memory, or
maybe they just enjoy beating Sheriam up. Furthermore, Sheriam has sworn
fealty to Egwene, and should be bound to it by the First Oath. Spying on
Egwene surely violates this.
<h3>Sheriam is not Black</h3>
<P>
Sheriam's thoughts in the torture scene don't seem to be entirely
consistent with the theory that she is BA. Consider her thought to herself
along the lines of "I'll never talk to another Sister." Clearly her
torturer <em>wants</em> her gathering information, so the comment reflects her
regret at getting into this situation in the first place, not her
obedience to her controller.
<P>
Elizabeth Cornwell: "If she's BA, the comment would have to indicate that, at some point, a
Sister, working as an evangelist for the Dark Side, got Sheriam into a
conversation about the terrific feeling you get working for the Dark Lord,
and, after shoving a few inspriational pamphlets at her, converted her to
the cause. This doesn't, to me, really sound like the way BA would be
recruited. I paint the scenario in the way I do because Sheriam's rueful
comment doesn't seem to indicate a dislike for her current position within
the Dark hierarchy (someday I'll be in charge and make her pay), but regret
for getting sucked into the system to start with. Blabbing a blackmailable secret to the wrong gal-pal in an unguarded
moment seems to fit a little better. If the secret spilling and
consequent blackmail date back a while, it works to explain the Gray Man
as well."
<P>
One thing which should be noted is that Sheriam's interaction with her
abuser is not typical of Darkfriends. Generally, when DFs and BA are
punished by their superiors, they are given the "opportunity" to do a lot
of grovelling and kissing-up, instead of just getting tied up and beaten.
For example, compare Liandrin and Moghedien to Sheriam and her abuser.
Furthermore, if Sheriam is BA, why didn't Halima attach herself to her?
She was very powerful in Salidar (arguably as powerful as, if not more so,
than any Sitter) even <EM>before</EM> she became Keeper.
<P>
Another piece of evidence in favor of Sheriam's innocence is, oddly enough,
her slacking of her duties as Egwene's Keeper. In [TPOD: 16, Unexpected
Absences, 330], Egwene notes, "The post of secretary provided [Siuan and
Egwene] another reason to be seen talking, and Sheriam had not minded at
all giving up the work." Contrast this with Sheriam's previous behavior;
she was only too happy to take care of all the paperwork [ACOS: 8, The
Figurehead, 158]. Consider that the secretarial duties of being Keeper
give Sheriam access to all of Egwene's doings, and all the details of what
the Amyrlin is up to. Perhaps she allowed SS to take over the position of
secretary to limit her own knowledge. After all, she can't report on what
she doesn't know. Avoiding her responsibilities as
Keeper could be her way of keeping her oath of fealty while being under
the thumb of her abuser.
