<H1>Where did Artur Hawkwing come from?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Emma Pease, John Novak</H2>

<P>
Artur Hawkwing might have originated in Tear. (Or at least in the area
presently known as Tear.) Why?
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The symbol of Tear is three crescent moons.  A symbol of the
Seanchan (descendents of Hawkwing's armies) is nine moons.

<LI>Artur hated Aes Sedai.  The rulers of Tear hate Aes Sedai.  Not
much as a fair number of people do but Tear has a law against
channeling which is more than any country except Amadicia.

<LI>Tear had a king before Artur but doesn't after.  Perhaps they chose
no king because no king could live up to what Artur did. 

<LI>The Mayene firsts claim to be descendants of Artur.  Perhaps a bit
of a stretch but Mayene may have been part of Artur's original lands
and after his death his surviving heirs retreated to it (as a place
where they had many supporters) and split off from Tear.  Hence one of
the reasons the Tairen high lords are so intent on regaining Mayene is
that they consider it part of Tear.  We know that Mayene did not exist
as a separate country before the 100 years war.

<LI>Tear has never fallen yet Artur ruled all the land between the sea
and the spine.  One way would be if he ruled Tear not by conquest but
by right of birth or election if the Tairen high lords elected a king
from among their numbers just as lords of the land were raised to be
high lords when a high lord died.  Note also that Seanchan were also
promoted to being lords without necessarily a blood right.

<LI>Tear and Seanchan are the only countries who use the title "High Lord."
