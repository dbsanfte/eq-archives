<HR>
<UL>
<LI>(<CITE>TEotW: prologue, xv, Dragonmount, xv</CITE>):<BR>
O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One
be born of the mountain(YES), according to the prophecies, as he
was in ages past and will be in ages to come.  Let the Prince of
the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the
valleys give forth lambs.  Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn
shelter us from the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend
us.  Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.(NO)

<LI>The prophecy for the Horn of Valere (<CITE>TEotW: 26, 389, Whitebridge, 327</CITE>):<BR>
In the last, lorn fight {Tarmon Gaidon}<BR>
'gainst the fall of long night, {Victory of the DO}<BR>
the mountains stand guard, {??? The Mountains of Dhoom?}<BR>
and the dead shall be ward,<BR>
for the grave is no bar to my call. {Heroes will fight against the
Shadow at the Last Battle} (NO)<BR>

<LI>Elaida's Foretelling (<CITE>TEOTW: 40, 614, The Web Tightens, 514</CITE>):<BR>
'This I Foretell...and swear under the Light that I can say no
clearer. From this day Andor marches toward pain and division. The
Shadow has yet to darken to its blackest, and I cannot see if the
Light will come after. Where the world has wept one tear, it will
weep thousands....This, too, I Foretell. Pain and division come to
the whole world, and this man [Rand] stands at the heart of it.'(YES)

<LI>(<CITE>TEOTW: Glossary, ?, REF?</CITE>):<BR>
DRAGON REBORN:...the prophecies say the Dragon Reborn will bring
a new Breaking to the world...{YES--in progress}

<LI>(<CITE>TEOTW: Glossary, REF?</CITE>):<BR>
FAR DAREIS MAI:...it is prophesied that a child born of a Maiden
will unite the clans {YES, except the Shaido} and return to the
Aiel to [sic.] the greatness they knew during the Age of
Legends.{NO?}

<LI>(<CITE>TDR: Trailer Prophesy, 675, 578</CITE>):<BR>
And it was written that no hand but his should wield the Sword
held in the Stone, but he did draw it out, like fire in his
hand, and his glory did burn the world. Thus did it begin. Thus
do we sing his Rebirth. Thus do we sing the beginning.(YES)

<LI>Answers to Mat's questions [What fate?] (<CITE>TSR: 15, 253, Into the Doorway, 177</CITE>):<BR>
To marry the Daughter of the Nine moons.(NO)<BR>
To die and live again, and live once more a part of what was.(YES)<BR>
To give up half the light of the world to save the world.(NO)<BR>

<H2>Survey Says: What does giving up 1/2 the light of the world mean?</H2>
<UL>
<LI>He loses an eye:                       78% (174)
<LI>The OP won't work in the next Age:      2%   (5)
<LI>Something involving Mayenne and lamp oil: 1%   (2)
</UL>
<LI>Coramoor (Jendai Prophecy) (<CITE>TSR: 19, 315-6, The Wavedancer, 220-1</CITE>):<BR>
He can wield the One Power ... and he holds the Sword That Cannot
Be Touched.  The Aiel have come over the Dragonwall to his call.
... The Stone of Tear has fallen, and war breaks over the nations
of the land.  Those who once ruled have returned, and been driven
back for the first time. ... The White Tower shall be broken by
his name(YES), and Aes Sedai shall kneel (YES) to wash his feet and dry
them with their hair.(NO--icky. Note that the foot-washing thing happens
 in the Amyrlin Seat induction ceremony)

<LI>Wise One Dreaming (<CITE>TSR: 23, 385, Beyond the Stone, 270</CITE>):<BR>
(Moiraine, Melaine, and Seana in conversation on Chaendaer)<BR>
"We did not see Egwene or Mat Cauthon at all. It was no more than
an even chance that the young man who calls himself Rand Al'Thor
would come.  If he did not, it was certain that he would die, and
the Aiel too.(ONGOING)  Yet he has come, and if he survives
Rhuidean, some of the Aiel at least will survive. This we know.
If you(Moiraine) had not come, he would have died(YES-she saved him
 from Lanfear at the Docks in TFOH). If Aan'allein had not come,
you would have died(???). If you did not go through the rings..."

<LI>From Rhuidean (<CITE>TSR: 25, 408, The Road to the Spear, 285-6</CITE>):<BR>
The stone that never falls will fall to announce his coming.(YES)
Of the blood(YES), but not raised by the blood(YES), he will come from
Rhuidean at dawn(YES), and tie you together with bonds you cannot
break(I GUESS SO...).  He will take you back(YES), and he will
destroy you(YES, BUT MORE TO COME).

<LI>Mat's wishes (<CITE>TSR: 24, 402, Rhuidean, 281-2</CITE>):<BR>
Holes in memory restored/a way to be free of Aes Sedai and the Power/Away and back to Rhuidean (YES to all)

<LI>Elaida in conversation (<CITE>TFOH: Prologue, REF?</CITE>):<BR>
"Or do any of you believe he [Rand] will go willingly to his prophesized death to save the world?"

<LI>(<CITE>LoC: Header Prophecy</CITE>):<BR>
The lions sing and the hills take flight.<BR>
The moon by day, and the sun by night.<BR>
Blind woman, deaf man, jackdaw fool.<BR>
Let the Lord of Chaos rule.<BR>
<P>
{your guess is as good as mine as to whether this is actually prophecy or no}

<LI>Nicola's Foretelling(<CITE>LoC: 14, Dreams and Nightmares, 255</CITE>):<BR>
"The lion sword, the dedicated spear, she who sees beyond.  (YES? El, Avi, and Min --  do they have something
special to do?)  Three on the boat, and he who is dead yet lives." {??? I have yet to hear a satisfactory
explanation of this one, although it resonates with the WOs boat dream, and the King-Arthur funeral deal in
one of Min's vision}  The great battle done, but the world not done with battle. {??? perhaps the Last Battle,
yet the struggle between the Shadow and the Light continues? There'll be more fighting after Tarmon Gaidon?
There'll be a big battle BEFORE Tarmon Gaidon?} The land divided by the return {NO. "return" could be the
Seanchan Corenne, or the Return of the Great Lord, as spoken of by DFs} and the guardians balance out the
servants.  {YES, the Asha'man and the Aes Sedai.} The future teeters on the edge of a blade {metaphorical
melodramatics -- this war is crucial}."

<H2>Survey Says:</H2>
<H3>Does "Land split by Return" refer to the Seanchan?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes: 80%
<LI>No: 9%
<LI>Undecided: 8% (18)
</UL>

<LI>Wise Ones Dreams (<CITE>LoC: 19, Matters of Toh, 312</CITE>):<BR>
"Melaine and Bair dreamed of you on a boat with three women whose faces they could not see{??? something to do
with Min, El, and Avi}, and a scale tilting first one way and then the other."{YES--everything seems up in the
air now. Rand might win, the Shadow might, who knows?} Melaine and Amys dreamed of a man standing by your side
with a dagger to your throat, but you did not see him. {??? Poss a Grey Man, Poss. refers to Taim?} Bair and
Amys dreamed of you cutting the wetlands in two with a sword. {YES--Randland is polarizing into pro- and anti-
Dragon factions. there will soon be no sitting on the fence.} All three had this dream, which makes it
especially significant. Rain, coming from a bowl. There are snares and pitfalls around the bowl. {NO, but this
is obviously the bowl ter'angreal El and Ny are looking for} If the right hands pick it up, they will find a
treasure perhaps as great as the bowl. {NO. Maybe there is something else in the bowl room? Angreal, etc?}  If
the wrong hands, the world is doomed. {Well, duh.} "The key to finding the bowl is to find the one who is no
longer."{NO--???}

<H2>Survey says:</H2>
<H3>Who is the one who is no longer?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Moiraine: 25% (56)
<LI>LTT:             4% (8)
<LI>Green Man: 2% (4)
<LI>Luc:       7% (15)
<LI>Runaway novice:  4% (8)
<LI>Corianin:  1% (3)
<LI>Mat:       4%  (4)
<LI>Jain Farstrider: 2% (5)
<LI>Shemerin:  1% (3)
</UL>

<LI>Behind the Red Door (in Tear) (<CITE>LoC: 26, Connecting Lines, 373</CITE>):<BR>
"He [Rand] knew he had a chance to live, if a seemingly impossible one.  <EM>If you would live, you must
die</EM>." {NO. Maybe means "if you would live future lives, you must die (physically) in this one.  cf LTT's
wanting to die for good, never be spun out again.(<CITE>LoC: 18, A Taste of Solitude, 299</CITE>). Or, Rand will
die, but will get resurrected.}

<H2>Survey says:</H2>
<H3>Rand will</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Die and come back:  46% (102)
<LI>Not die, not even fake it: 14% (31)
<LI>Die and stay dead:  27%  (61)
<LI>Fake his death:             4% (10)
</UL>

<LI>Elaida's Foretelling #2: (<CITE>ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 26</CITE>):<BR>
The White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever.
Rand al'Thor will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire,
and sisters will walk its grounds."
<P>
{None has happenned, but it sounds very interesting, no? One of the AS factions will be triumphant,
eventually. Either Elaida or Egwene is going to get pissed at Rand. the Asha'man will either undergo a split
(followers of Taim and followers of Rand?), or will be destroyed (depending on how one defines "rend"}
<P>
<LI>Jendai Prophecy, pt 2: (<CITE>ACOS: 34, Ta'veren, 538</CITE>):<BR>
Rand: "That is what the Jendai Prophecy says. The Sea Folk will serve the Coramoor."<BR>
Harine: "The Jendai prophecy says you will bring us to glory, and all the sea of the world will be ours. As we
give to you, you must give to us."<BR>
