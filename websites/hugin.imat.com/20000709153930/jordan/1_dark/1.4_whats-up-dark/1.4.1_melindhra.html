[TFOH: 34, A Silver Arrow, 390] Nynaeve and Birgitte were eavesdropping on
the Forsaken Conference in Tel'aran'rhiod. Rahvin says, "He [Rand] will
concentrate on you [Sammael], ... If need be, one close to him will die,
plainly at your order. He will come for you. And while he is fixed on you
alone, the three of us, linked, will take him. What has changed to alter
any of that?" So, it seems Melindhra was ordered to kill Mat with a golden
bee dagger (golden bees are the symbol of Illian, where Sammael was
situated), if the need arose. Mat told her that Rand was going to Caemlyn,
instead of "concentrating of Sammael", and she attacked Mat right away
[TFoH: 51, News Comes To Cairhien, 617], in an attempt to return his
attention to Sammael.
