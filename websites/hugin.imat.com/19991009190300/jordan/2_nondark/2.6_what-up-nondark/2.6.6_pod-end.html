<h1 align="center">2.6.6: What was going on at the end of TPOD?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
The fight at the end of TPOD raises many questions. Who was behind the
attack? What was the true goal of the attack? What was Dashiva doing there?
As one might expect, there isn't total agreement on these questions. We'll
go over the facts of what happened, and then we will present various
theories and ideas about what was going on.
<h2>Just the facts, ma'am</h2>
<P>
The scene under discussion occurs in [TPOD: 29, A Cup of Sleep, 558-573].
Min, Rand, and Fedwin Morr are in Rand's apartment in the Cairhien Palace.
Sorilea drags the re-educated Aes Sedai in to swear fealty to Rand. Sorilea
then tells him that Cadsuane is in the palace, and goads him into seeking her
out. Sorilea and the AS leave. Rand, Min, and Morr leave Rand's rooms to
find Cadsuane. When they've gone down the hall a bit, the apartments are
smashed with the OP. We know that Rand et al are a little ways down from
the rooms, because they survive with minor injuries, while the Maidens who
were guarding the doors are killed. Rand charges Morr with taking Min to
safety and guarding her, then sets out to track down his attackers.
<P>
Rand skulks around for a while, seeking the male channelers who blew up
his rooms (he thinks it might have been Demandred or Asmodean). He thinks
that the attackers must have spies in the palace, since they must have
known he was in his rooms (or had been) at the time of the attack. A
couple of Sea Folk women see him, and he ties them up, shielding the
Windfinder. He worries that somebody could have detected the quantity of
OP used to do that shielding.
<P>
Just after the Windfinder's quarters, Rand comes to a set of stairs which
lead down into a hall of some sort. He sees Dashiva, Gedwyn, and Rochaid
in the hall. Gedwyn says, "<em>I</em> felt nothing. He's dead!" Dashiva
spies Rand at the top of the stairs, snarls, and shoots some
bolt-o-nastiness at Rand. Rand channels a super-shield around himself.
Dashiva's bolt knocks him back down the corridor, and the bits of it which
bounce off the shield do a number on the hallway. Rand sends his own nasty
thing towards where he'd seen the three men. Then, he runs back up the
hallway, and takes an alternate route down to the room where he'd seen the
men. It is clear to him that they'd escaped. Rand scares some servants, and
then feels a man channel "enough of the Power to make a gateway." Rand
wanders around in a killing rage for a while longer, almost toasting
Narishma and Flinn. He searches the palace for hours, and doesn't find
Dashiva, Rochaid, and Gedwyn.
<P>
Finally, he finds Min in the company of a now-mad Morr. An odd thing worth
noting is that the Laurel Crown and Dragon Scepter made it through the
attack unscathed, while the Dragon Throne (which they were sitting on) was
reduced to splinters. Taim arrives, claiming to have come to report
deserters: Gedwyn, Rochaid, Torval, and Kisman. Rand puts Morr down, and
tells Taim to add Dashiva to the list of deserters. Taim is clearly
angered and surprised to learn about Dashiva. Taim leaves, and Rand tells
Min that he's planning to go on the lam. Min declares that she'll go with
him.
<h2>Some Theories</h2>
<P>
Disclaimer: Here's how the scene appears, when taken at face value: Gedwyn,
Rochaid, and Dashiva deserted from the BT, and decided to make a statement
by trying to kill Rand. After blowing up his apartment, they found out
that Rand was still alive. Dashiva took a shot at Rand, but Gedwyn and
Rochaid chickened out, and ran off. Later, Taim discovered Gedwyn and
Rochaid's desertion (and Torval's and Kisman's), and was shocked and
amazed. He Traveled to Cairhien to report it to Rand immediately, and was
shocked and amazed to discover that Dashiva, too, had deserted. If that's
all that happened, then there is nothing more to discuss. The following
ideas are reasonable conclusions to draw, <em>if we assume that everything
was not exactly as it appeared</em> in the scene.
<P>
The following discussion attempts to stick with the facts of the matter, as
depicted in the books. To keep things simple, nothing is being assumed
about the possible secret identities of Taim and Dashiva. That is, we will
only discuss things which can be concluded directly from Taim and Dashiva's
actions, and which don't depend on them being Demandred (or not) and
Osan'gar (or not). (However, the general idea that Taim and/or the
attackers are working for the Shadow is considered.) The reader is invited
to consider, for her or his own personal edification, what these ideas
imply for the Taimandred and Dashivan'gar theories.
<h3>Was Taim behind the attack?</h3>
<P>
Two of the attackers, Gedwyn and Rochaid, were on Taim's list of
"deserters." Now, note that these four deserters (those two, plus Torval
and Kisman) seem to have been Taim's favorites among the Asha'man. Torval
and Rochaid are the two Asha'man Taim recommends to Rand in place of
Dashiva [ACOS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 84]. The four deserters are the four
men Taim calls for when he prepares to depart after Rand rejects Torval and
Rochaid. During TPOD, we find that Taim has "created new ranks." Gedwyn
and Rochaid are the "Storm Leader" and "Attack Leader"; they are the
commander and second-in-command of the Asha'man on the Seanchan campaign.
Gedwyn and Rochaid kill the assassin in [TPOD: 22, Gathering Clouds,
428-430], who is found with a large quantity of Tar Valon coin. Rochaid
tries to convince Rand that Aes Sedai were behind the attack. The whole
scene smells bad-- it's more like Gedwyn and Rochaid set the archer up, so
that Rand would think that AS were trying to kill him. Taim has, on many
occasions, worked to drive a wedge between Rand and the AS. In any case,
the four "deserters" reported by Taim were his right-hand men, the ones
with the least reason to leave the BT.
<P>
Now, it just seems too much of a coincidence that Taim showed up in
Cairhien to tell Rand about the "desertion" just a few hours after two of
those deserters blew up the palace in a spectacular fashion. Not only did
he discover their desertion awfully quickly, he knew the reason for their
desertion: "they were malcontented over events in Altara." Did they give a
speech before leaving? March into Taim's office and tender their
resignations? Furthermore, Taim seems very calm and collected over the
desertion of his four most-trusted men. This isn't very characteristic for
a man who has so carefully created his own cult of personality.
<P>
It's much more likely that the whole "desertion" and attack were arranged
by Taim. It's clear that he chafes under the restrictions Rand has placed
on him. It's also clear that Rand doesn't trust him at all, and that if
Taim had simply reported that his four had deserted, Rand probably would
not have believed him. However, after the attack, Rand doesn't even
question Taim's word. Note that the desertion and attack, if organized by
Taim, have produced a group of male channelers who are loyal to Taim, not
to Rand, and whose actions Taim can disavow. This is just too much of a
good deal for Taim for it not to be the case. Note the difference between
Taim's calm reaction to the desertion of his four favorites, and his anger
at learning that Dashiva (who Taim did not like) had joined the four. He's
more upset at Dashiva's interference than at the desertion of his four most
trusted followers. That doesn't make sense, unless Taim engineered the
desertion in the first place.
<h3>Were they really trying to kill Rand? If not, what were they trying to
do?</h3>
<P>
Rand, of course, assumes that the attack on his rooms was an attempt to
kill him. However, it's very likely that the <em>real</em> goal of the
attackers was something entirely different. Taken at face value, the
attack was not orchestrated very well. Blowing up Rand's rooms caused only
minor damage to Rand himself, since he was walking away from them when it
happened. When Rand comes upon Rochaid, Gedwyn, and Dashiva in the
hall, they have a perfect opportunity to gang up on him and finish
him off. The only one who attacks Rand is Dashiva, and that only happens
once. The three just ran away after that. If they were really out to kill
Rand, they didn't seem to put much effort into it.
<P>
While Dashiva has a few screws loose, Gedwyn and Rochaid have shown
themselves to be fairly competent at OP combat, plotting, and scheming.
Taim certainly believed they were competent enough to promote them above
the other Asha'man. This lame assassination attempt couldn't have come
from the same careful plotters who set up the archer "assassin" in Illian.
Surely the commanders of the Asha'man would know how to plan a strategy for
hunting Rand down and killing him, when they had the advantage of
three-to-one odds. Note that while Rochaid and Gedwyn are not nearly as
strong as Rand, not even as strong as Flinn and Narishma [TPOD: 22,
Gathering Clouds, 429], Dashiva is very strong (<A HREF="../../1_dark/1.2_forsaken2/1.2.2_dashiva.html">See section 1.2.2</A>).
The three of them should have been able to kill Rand, if they'd all been
out to do so.
<P>
As Rand comes upon the three in [TPOD: 29, A Cup of Sleep, 568], Gedwyn is
overheard saying, "[I'm] telling you <em>I</em> felt nothing. He's dead!"
Presumably, this is in reference to Rand. This sentence can be taken two
ways. One is that the three guys were trying to kill Rand, and Gedwyn
thinks that the explosion in Rand's rooms did the job. The problem with
this is that Gedwyn is a pretty competent guy, and if his goal was to kill
Rand, he probably wouldn't blow up a few rooms and then leave, without
getting confirmation that his target was indeed dead. The other way
Gedwyn's words can be taken is that one member of the party (probably
Dashiva-- Gedwyn and Rochaid seem to be joined at the hip) thought that the
goal was to kill Rand when it really was not. Gedwyn was trying to
convince that person that Rand was already dead, so that that person
wouldn't go and try to kill him.
<P>
It has been suggested that the attackers were working under the auspices of
the Shadow, and the true goal of the attack (or one of the goals) was to
kill Min, not Rand. What motive would the Shadow have for killing Min?
Paul Khangure proposes two motives: 1) Her death would affect Rand in many
possible ways, none of them good. 2)She's been studying Herid Fel's work.
She could be on the brink of discovering the same thing which Herid Fel
discovered. It got Herid killed, why not Min also?" Apart from motive,
there isn't much evidence to support this idea. It has a similar problem
to the idea that the attackers were really trying to kill Rand-- apart from
the initial attack, nobody tried to kill her. With three attackers, two
could have kept Rand busy while the third finished Min off, but the only
danger Min faced during the whole episode came from her "protector," the
cracked Fedwin Morr.
<P>
Now, Dashiva, at least, took a direct, and very lethal-looking shot at
Rand, right after Gedwyn said he thought Rand was dead. That piece of
channeling was strong enough to knock Rand, in his impervious shield, all
the way down the corridor, and to destroy a good bit of the corridor
itself: "The fire that leaped from Dashiva erupted, shattering marble..."
The aftermath of the blast is described: "the crash of explosions still
ringing in the air, dust still hanging and bits of broken marble tumbling."
Whatever Dashiva shot at Rand, it was nothing trivial. Since Rand's
super-shield was dredged up out of LTT-memory at that very instant, there was
no way Dashiva could have known that Rand would block it. The reasonable
conclusion is that Dashiva, at least, was really trying to kill Rand.
Perhaps he thought better of it right afterwards, or perhaps Gedwyn and
Rochaid convinced him to leave some other way, but it seems that all three
must have left the area shortly after Dashiva shot at Rand. After Rand
feels "enough of the Power to make a gateway" being channeled, there is no
more sign of the three attackers in the Palace. That channeling must have
been them channeling to leave. This brings us to our last point of
discussion:
<h3>What was Dashiva doing there?</h3>
<P>
At the start of the attack, Rand notes "A man, Demandred, or perhaps
Asmodean come back at last. Maybe both; there had been an oddity, as if
the weaving came from different directions." Rand thinks the "different
directions" possibly came from two attackers. It isn't unreasonable to
suppose that this is the case, since there are indeed multiple attackers,
and, being men, they can't link together to form a single weave. So, let
us suppose that the initial attack was launched by two men. The third one
joined after the attack had begun. The most reasonable scenario is that
Gedwyn and Rochaid Traveled from the BT to Cairhien and made the first
attack on Rand's apartments. Dashiva was part of Rand's entourage, and
Taim didn't like him, anyway, so there isn't any reason to suppose that
Dashiva was at the BT and hooked up with Gedwyn and Rochaid there. More
likely, he was in Cairhien like the rest of Rand's Asha'man (Morr, Flinn,
and Narishma), and joined Gedwyn and Rochaid after the attack was in
progress. The facts 1) that he's the only one of the three to take a
direct shot at Rand, and 2) Taim was inordinately upset at the news of his
desertion support the idea of Dashiva as "odd man out" among the three
attackers. So, the general idea is that Dashiva joined in unexpectedly,
and either didn't understand that the goal was not to kill Rand, or took
advantage of the situation to launch his own attack on Rand.
<h3>Summary</h3>
<P>
[Bryon Wasserman]
<P>
Taim had the fearsome foursome (Gedwyn, Rochaid, Torval, Kisman) attack
Rand and Min for the purpose of causing a formal split within the Asha'man
and/or killing Min. Dashiva latched on after the fact, not knowing that
they were not supposed to kill Rand . You will notice that that Dashiva is
the only one who attacks Rand directly. This answers the following
concerns:
<OL>
<LI>Why Taim knew about Torval, Gedwyn, Rochaid , and Kisman, but
he did not know about Dashiva. He is specifically surprised and
outraged when Rand mentions Dashiva's involvement. The fact that a
fifth assassin was involved should not have been so shocking. This
response suggests that he had a general idea what was going on and
Dashiva was not part of the plan.
<LI>Why Gedwyn would try to talk Dashiva into leaving without seeing
a body.
<LI>Why Taim's lackeys would all spontaneously revolt together.
