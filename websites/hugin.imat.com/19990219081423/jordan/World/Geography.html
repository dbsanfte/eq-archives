<H2>General Notes on Randland/Randworld Geography</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Illian is approximately at the same latitude as the Florida Keys (<CITE>book signing info, 10/94</CITE>).

<LI>The timing of Rand &amp; Avi's MPS in the Snow (<CITE>tFoH: 31, ?, The Far Snows,
362</CITE>) is not an error. It is properly indicative of where (part of) the
Seanchan Empire is located. Seanchan has parts in the north &amp; south
hemispheres, Rand &amp; Avi were in the south. (<CITE>book signing info, 10/94</CITE>)
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Note on Heraldry:</H2>
Randland heraldry sometimes violates our heraldic rules.
According to our heraldic rules, "white" is the same as "silver."
"White" is used if the banners are given in their simple version,
"silver" is used in their normal version. The same holds for
"yellow" (simple) and "gold" (normal).
</P>
<P>
According to our rules, "silver" and "gold" count as "metallic"
in opposition to "red," "blue," "green," and "black," which
are colors. In banners metal and color have to alternate. That means
if the symbol is metallic, it has to be put on a colored field. If
the symbol is in color, the field is metallic. Thus, every banner
includes "gold" or "silver." -- Contributed by <CITE>Ulrich Shade</CITE>

Current Events: The False Dragon Logain ripped through here at the 
beginning of the series, defeated some AS sent to stop him,
and departed, possibly at the instigation of the Red Ajah.
Suffered serious riots due to the presence of the Prophet in
which thousands died. Alliandre is the fourth monarch on the
Ghealdan throne in the last year (two of the previous three are dead,
and one is currently married to some businessman), the others
having been toppled by the Prophet's followers (in one way or
another). The situation is probably still unstable. Alliandre
has secretly communicated her support for Rand. Perrin's army
has landed near Jehannah.
</P>

General: Capital: Lugard. Very fractious country. Allied with Altara and 
	Illian against Amadicia in the Whitecloak War. Hostile to Andor.
Gov't: Loose confederation of lands controlled by various lords. Possibly

			appears to have consolidated her position, and there are rumors
	that she has retired to a country estate. Clashes between Pro- 
	and anti-Dragon factions. Davram Bashere is in 
			Andor with a chunk of the army. The Blight border is quiet.
Home of:  Faile, Davram Bashere, Mazrim Taim.
<HR>
<H2>Shara</H2>
<P>
General: Not much is known about the lands east of the Aiel Waste. They produce silk, and have a slave trade.
Trading with outsiders is only permitted in walled trade cities. The are has several names (or maybe these are
all different countries east of the Waste): Shara, Shamara, Kigali, Co'dansin, Tomaka.
</P>
<P>
Government: At least one area of Shara is ruled by a hereditary class
of channellers who live separate from the general populace. the order
of succession goes something like this: First the man takes a spouse,
rules for 7 years absolutely, then is executed.  Then the woman takes
a spouse and rules for 7 years absolutely, then is executed.  Her
husband succeeds her, taking a spouse, etc. The 14-years-then-you-die
thing is probably a result of the male channellers going mad from the
Taint--they kill them before they get a chance to go mad. (What if
they go mad before their time is up?)
</P>
<P>
Current Events: Not much known at all, but, we've heard (from Graendal?)
that there is fighting going on in Shara, a sign of the nearness of
Tarmon Gai'don: according to Rhuarc there is <EM>never</EM> fighting in Shara.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Shienar</H2>

</P>
<P>
Gov't: Although it is officially part of Andor, it "has not seen a tax
	 collector in six generations, nor the Queen's Guards in seven."
	 Each autonomous village is run by two elected bodies--the Women's

	 (men), headed by the Mayor. If there is a need for inter-village
	 action, it is negotiated by the mayors or Councils of the villages
