<h1 align="Center">1.3.7: What is the deal with the Black Ajah and Warders?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
Can Black Ajah have Warders? Would a Warder know if his AS was Black?
<P>
Well, we know BA can have Warders; one the Greens from Liandrin's posse
complained about having to leave her Warders behind when they fled the
Tower [TSR: 38, Hidden Faces, 439]. There has been some indication that
those Warders were actually killed. (More on this later.) So, given that
BA can have Warders, we now need to ask what the deal with Black Ajah
Warders is. RJ has said several things on the subject. At a post-POD
signing in Seattle, he told Kevin Bartlett that the easiest thing would be
to pick a Darkfriend for a Warder. This tells us that there most likely
are Black Warders. At a post-POD signing in Pennsylvania, RJ "made some
comments about how warder of the BA might sometimes meet with "accidents"
so the BA can remain secret. Alternatively, BA might intentionally bond
darkfriends." (Melinda Yin)
<P>
Finally, at a post-POD signing in Northern Virginia, he discussed the
topic. John Novak's synopsis: "If an Aes Sedai becomes Black Ajah, the
Warder would know instantly that something was up, but wouldn't know
exactly what. The Black Ajah has three choices, then-- hope the Warder is
a Darkfriend or amenable to being one, hide the affiliation, or arrange for
an accident. Yes, this would be painful for the Aes Sedai, but it might
become necessary. The process of becoming Black Ajah is evidently quite
painful in its own right and thus probably involves more than just swearing
new Oaths on the Rod. (I submit that this is why the Red Ajah is rife with
Black Ajah-- they have an easier time actively recruiting from that pool.
By the same token, I claim that the Green Ajah is more pure than the
others.)"
<P>
Now, the question is, if the Green Warders from Liandrin's group were
indeed killed, why? There are several possible explanations: 1) the
Warders were not DFs, and the Green-Blacks took the opportunity to kill
them off. 2) The Warders were DFs, but they were killed because if they
stayed, they could have been used to track the escaped BA, and if they left
with the AS, the Tower would know that there was such a thing as Black
Warders. (Note that, apparently, this has not been realised by the AS. For
all the talk of Black Ajah, not a single person has mentioned the
possibility of Black Warders.)
