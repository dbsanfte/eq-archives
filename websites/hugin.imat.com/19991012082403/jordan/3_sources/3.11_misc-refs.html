<P>
1) <STRONG>Birgitte in Conversation</STRONG>: Mentions a past life named
"Maerion": Maid Marion?
<P>
2) <STRONG>Sammael = Napoleon?</STRONG> Sammael is described as a great
general. He is short. Illian's symbol is nine golden bees; Napoleon's
symbol was a golden bee.
<P>
3) <STRONG>Yin-Yang symbol/Ancient Aes Sedai symbol</STRONG>: He (RJ) also
spoke for quite some time on the splitting of the One Power into male and
female halves, and on the disharmony produced when they don't work
together.. this came across as one of the core elements in the origin of
WOT. [ re: Yin/Yang - leaving out the little dots in the symbol is an
intentional representation of the lack of harmony between male/female Power
in Randland] [Emmet O'Brien, Dublin talk, 11/93]
<P>
4) <STRONG>The sword forms</STRONG>: It's research (books, not doing), and
the forms come from Japanese sword fighting and some European fencing,
before the advent of well-designed and well-made guns made swords obsolete.
[Matthew Hunter at a signing, also mentioned by others]
<P>
5) <STRONG>Tolkien</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>"The only deliberate connection between WOT and any other modern
fantasy was giving the first 100-odd pages of TEOTW a <CITE>Lord of the
Rings</CITE>-esque flavor, to start people off in familiar territory."
[from Dublin talk, 11/93, Emmet O'Brien]
<LI>The Nine Rings Inn [TGH: 21, The Nine Rings, 258]
</UL>
<P>
6) <STRONG>Wolf-brother</STRONG>: a moosh of various myths from Europe, Native
Americans, and Australian Aborigines. [America OnLine conference, 10/94]
<P>
7) <STRONG>Stones/Go</STRONG>: The game of Stones is based on the Asian game
Go.
<P>
8) <STRONG>Tower of Ghenjei</STRONG>: There is a Japanese novel called
<CITE>The Tale of Genji</CITE>. It is generally considered the first piece of
work which qualifies as a novel, as the genre is defined today. Note
the name's similarity to the Tower of Ghenjei in WOT. It was written
by Lady Murasaki Shikibu in the early 10th century, during the Heian
Period of Japanese history. [Jeff Han]
<P>
9) <STRONG>Millenarianism</STRONG>: The End of The World will come
at the end of the millennium, or so some folks say. The year in
Randland is pretty much congruent with that used in the West of our
own world. Galldrian of Cairhien was assassinated in 998 NE. Since
then, one winter has passed (taking us to 999) and most of the next
year. The Feast of Lights that scandalized Perrin so much (in LoC)
marks the last day of the old year; the Battle at Dumai's Wells takes
place some days after that, and so must be early in 1000 NE. Tarmon
Gai'don is coming soon, folks! [Don Harlow]
<P>
10) <STRONG>Gholam</STRONG> = Golem from Jewish folklore. According
Gershon Scholem in "The Idea of the Golem," the Golem (pronounced goy-lehm),
dates back to the Kabbalah, the ancient book of Jewish Mysticism. The most
famous legend dates back to 16th century Prague, to a famous rabbi, Rabbi
Loew, but it is a bastardization of an earlier, far more appropriate (from
a TWOT persective) story of a Rabbi Elias in Poland, who shaped clay into a
man-shape (very biblical), and then inscribed, in Hebrew, EMETH, which
means TRUTH, on its forehead, granting it life. The Golem did menial tasks
and the like for Elias, but the longer it lived, it grew in size and
consequently in strength. When the Golem grew to an awesome size, Elias
felt threatened by it, and attempted to destroy it by erasing the first
letter (aleph) in EMETH, changing it to METH, Hebrew for DEATH. Elias
succeeded, but was subsequently killed by the collapse of the creature into
a big pile of clay. There are dozens of variants of the golem legend. In
the Loew story, the golem collapsed, but did not kill Loew. Loew buried
the remains in the attic of his ancient synagogue, where they remain to
this day, and make for an unusual tourist attraction. Additional stories
tell of the golem growing in both strength and lustiness, which added a
whole new dimension of trouble to be caused.[Stewart S. Bushman]
<P>
11) <STRONG>Aelfinn/Eelfinn</STRONG>: The Elves/Faerie/Sidhe of Celtic
mythology. The Sidhe were vulnerable to iron ("iron to bind"), and liked
music ("music to daze"). There were two subgroups of Faeries, as Matthew
Hunter elaborates: "The Seelie and Unseelie courts, of which one the Seelie
were comparatively "nice" and honorable, although tricksters and inhumanly
magical, while the Unseelie were essentially their evil counterparts --
delighting in tormenting and the kind of pranks that have nasty
consequences. The spelling is phonetic, and the real spelling is somewhat
different... I think 'Seighlie' is closer but still not right."
<P>
12) <STRONG>Another Celtic Connection</STRONG>: [TSR: 6, Doorways, 95] wrt
the Snakes Doorway: "Elayne's first thought was for the children's tale
<CITE>Bili Under the Hill</CITE>, but only because of the three answers."
Compare to various tales of common humans visiting some Sidhe under a hill,
and having various mystical experiences.
<P>
13) <STRONG>Nae'blis</strong>: Iblis, Another name for the devil in
Muslim circles.
<P>
14) <STRONG>Asha'man</STRONG>: It has been pointed out that there are many
similarities between the Asha'man and the Nazi SS. SS stands for
Sch&uuml;tz Staffeln (Guardian Group) and was originaly created to protect
Hitler. Asha'man means Guardians, and one of their functions is
(nominally) to protect Rand. Both organizations use black as their color.
The leader of the Asha'man is called "M'Hael," which is "leader" in the Old
Tongue. The leader of the SS was the "F&uuml;hrer," which is "leader"in
German. Six of the total 19 officer ranks the Waffen-SS contained the two
words Sturm (storm) and F&uuml;hrer (e.g. Sturmbahnf&uuml;hrer,
Obersturmf&uuml;hrer, Sturmscharf&uuml;hrer). This is also seen within the
Asha'man in the Tsorovan'm'hael (Gedwyn's title, from [TPOD: 21, Answering
the Summons, 407]). Also, the SS was nominally created to fight Communism
(color = red). The dedicated enemy of the AM is the Red Ajah. [Jimmy
Sj&ouml;berg]
