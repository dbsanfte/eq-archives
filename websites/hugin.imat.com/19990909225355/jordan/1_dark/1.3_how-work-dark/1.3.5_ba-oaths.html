<h1 align="center">1.3.5: Are Black Ajah bound by the Oath Rod?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
First, we know that BA can violate the three AS Oaths with impunity:
<UL>
<LI>They can violate the Third Oath: In [TSR: 38, 863, Hidden Faces,
438], Liandrin wishes she had the ability to kill with the Power,
like Chesmal (another BA). This implies that Chesmal can, and has
done so.
<P>
<LI>They can violate the First Oath: In [TFOH: 34, A Silver Arrow,
394], Liandrin attacks the wounded Moghedien, attempting to Compel
her. Moggy strikes back, and Liandrin says, "Y-you do not
understand, Great M-mistress...I only wished to help you to have
the good sleep." This was <em>definitely</em> not her intention. Her
intention was to have Moggy be her obedient slave. A few pages
later, Liandrin tells Moggy that she will be Moggy's "faithful
dog," and in the next sentence tries to get Temaile and Chesmal to
try to betray Moggy. If she meant one, the other must be a lie. In
[TFOH: 19, Memories, 260], Alviarin says to Fain, "Now answer
my questions, or two corpses will be found here in the morning
instead of one." (The one being the dead Accepted)
Fain thinks to himself, "There would be two
in any case, whether he answered her with suitable lies or not;
she did not mean to let him live." Obviously Fain thinks she can
lie, and do you really think Alviarin meant to let him go?
<P>
<LI>In [ACOS: 40, Spears, 626] Galina makes it clear that the BA are
not bound by the Three Oaths: "She had broken free of the Three
Oaths on joining the Black Ajah, replacing them with a new
trinity..." So, the BA are not bound the the Three Oaths that the
non-black AS swear.
</UL>
<P>
However, the BA still have the Ageless look and the shortened lifespan
which are characteristic of people bound by the OR. They have to, in order
to blend in with non-black AS. So, it is likely that the "new trinity" of
Dark Oaths sworn by the BA are taken on the Oath Rod. There is further
evidence for this. Galina knows that Oath Rods can be used to remove
Oaths: "If [Sevanna's "binder"] was a second Oath Rod, it could be used to
remove any oath she swore now." [TPOD: 11, Questions and an Oath, 255] This
is not general knowledge among AS (Seaine and Pevara, both high-ranking AS,
had to figure that by themselves.), so we can conclude that she knows it
from experience. That is, the BA are freed from the Three Oaths via the
Oath Rod. It means that the BA induction involves the Tower's OR-- Galina
is only familiar with the Tower's Rod (Number 3). It's therefore
reasonable to guess that the Black Ajah Oaths are administered via Oath
Rod.
<P>
What sort of Oaths? In TPOD, we have the supposition that there is some
sort of Oath that the BA must take, to not betray the BA or perhaps their
plans. This comes up when the golden girls can't get Ispan to spill her
guts about the BA no matter what they do [TPOD: 20, Into Andor, 399]. This
would also explain Joiya Byar's "confession" about the supposed BA plan to
use Taim as a False Dragon to discredit Rand. That obviously never
happened, and so it appears that Joiya lied, while her fellow prisoner,
Amico, told the truth about the plan to get something in Tanchico to harm
Rand. This fits well with the idea that the BA swear an Oath not to betray
the Ajah. Amico, having been stilled, was released from any Oaths that she
took on an Oath Rod. Thus, she could spill the beans when pressed. Joiya,
however, had no such release, so had no alternative than to either lie, or
to grovel saying "I'd LIKE to tell you, really, but I can't!!" [Laura
Parkinson]
