<H1>What was up with Gawyn during the coup?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
Perhaps he was involuntarily bonded to a Black or a Forsaken. His eyes
were glazed, and he was not necessarily in control of himself (<CITE>TSR: 47,
779-782, The Truth of a Viewing, 539-41</CITE>).   Alviarin says with some
confidence that "Gawyn will be brought under control". (<CITE>TFOH: Prologue,
19, The First Sparks Fall, 17</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
Then again, it is personally reasonable to assume that he was in full
control of his faculties during the coup. By that time, he had
developed a good and solid hatred for SS, due to Elayne and Egwene's
mysterious disappearance.
</P>
<P>
From his behavior in LoC, it seems pretty apparent that he acted under his
own will during the Coup, motivated by grief and anxiety over Elayne and
Egwene.  He develops a similar fierce hatred for Rand due to the rumors
that Rand killed Morgase.
