<LI>Birgitte in Conversation:
<UL>
<LI>Mathena: Athena/Artemis
<LI>Zheres: Teiresias? Orion?
</UL>
<P>
Actually, it was the goddess Artemis who turned the hunter into a stag so he
would be killed by his dogs, after he saw her bathing.  Athena was also
surprised by Teiresias while bathing, but she blinded him and gave him the
gift of second sight in return.
</P>
<LI>Birgitte's silver bow seems straight out of Greek Mythology. Artemis had a silver bow, to match her
brother Apollo's golden one.
<LI>Oedipus: Doomed king of Thebes who killed his father and married his mother. When he discovered what he
had done, he blinded himself and exiled himself from his city. He led the life of a blind beggar until he    
died near Athens. (<CITE>Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus, by Sophacles</CITE>).  Possible connection to the
vision of Rand as a blind beggar.
<LI>Orpheus: A great musician whose wife, Eurydice, was killed on their wedding night by a snake. Orpheus
travelled to the kingdom of Hades to try to get her back, and his music so moved the King/Queen(?) of the
underworld that he was allowed to take her back, provided that he leave, and not look back at her until he had
reached the surface. He couldn't control himself, so he looked, and she went back to Hades. Orpheus ended up
getting ripped to shreds by the M-somethings, a tribe of ferocious women, during a Bacchanale. Possibly a
connection to Thom rescuing Moiraine from the *finn. (<CITE>D. Sohl</CITE>)
