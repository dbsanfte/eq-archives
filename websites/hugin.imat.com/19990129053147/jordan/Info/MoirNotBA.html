<H1>Why Moiraine is not Black Ajah</H1>
<HR>
<P>
I thought this was a dead issue, but apparently it is not. sigh. Okay, why would anybody think Moiraine was
BA? Well, during <CITE>TGH</CITE>, RJ seems to be putting down clues in that direction.  Namely, she was missing during the
time of the DFS. Also, she was wearing her ring on a different finger than she had before. (Oh no! Not
that!!!!) Well, this was all a red herring, because, since then, we have been privy to Moiraine's thoughts,
which show that she walks in the Light. Okay, maybe she has multiple personalities, but I doubt it.
