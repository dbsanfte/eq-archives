Luke Mankin tells us more about the bracelets:<BR>

"Egeanin touched the collar, pushed the bracelets away from
the collar.  If she felt the emotions trapped in them ... ability to
channel.  `It is not a'dam,&#39; the Seanchan woman said.  `That is made
of a silvery metal, and all of one piece.'"
<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 52, 866, Need, 600</CITE>):<BR>
 "...-a necklace and two bracelets of jointed black metal-..."
<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 54, 905, Into the Palace, 628</CITE>):<BR>
" ...dull black collar and bracelets...   ...wide jointed collar..."
</UL>
<P>
The last we saw of the bracelets/collar was Egeanin and Bayle going off to dump them in the ocean, near the
Aile Somara. That just happenned to be where High Lady Suroth was camping out at the time.  Since we assume
that the Seanchan will get the collar, what will they do with their male channeller? <em>Or</em>, will the BA get the
collar and bracelets through the Darkfriend connection?  Wouldn't the best means of destroying them
be separating them and throwing them in say the sea, a volcano, and such?

Now, of course, the Sad Bracelets can be used on any of the poor sods who signed up to become asha'man.

Did Sammael somehow get ahold of the Sad Bracelets? In <CITE>ACOS: 20 Patterns within Patterns, 354</CITE>
"What I have will control him once he is taken, but it cannot overcome him." This description applies to the
Bracelets, but it could also apply to a "binding chair", or something like that.
