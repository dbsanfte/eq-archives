<h1 align="center">2.3.5: What is the range on sensing other channelers?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
A channeller can sense another channeller, under various conditions:
<P>
1) A female can sense another female, even if neither of them are holding
the Source at the time. This is a skill which takes some time to learn.
If one is really good, it is not necessary to see the other woman in order
to know she is there. For example, one of the Tower AS senses Eg in the
throne room in Cairhien, even though she was invisible. In addition, a
female can tell when another is embracing the Source, by a great glow
surrounding the channeller. Of course, female channellers can sense active
female channeling, as well as the presence of other female channelers.
<P>
2) Females cannot naturally sense male channelling. It may be that they
can do so by using the OP somehow, although Moggy's "technique" of [LoC, 8,
The Storm Gathers, 178] was simply a trick.
<P>
3) Male channellers can sense female channelling, by a prickling feeling on
the skin. There is a finite range on this. We can get some sense of the
range from [TFoH, 15, What Can be Learned in Dreams, 213] where Moiraine is
using the OP to eavesdrop on Rand and Asmo. Moiraine's tent is said to be
"not far" from Rand's, let's guess around 20 meters. Note that the amount
of channelling going on is probably very small; a bigger flow would
probably increase the detection range.
<P>
4) Male channellers can sense male channelling, as well as other men
holding the source [LOC: 3, A Woman's Eyes, 92]. The sensing is not as
obvious as when females sense other females. It is likely that it is more
difficult for men to sense other men channeling at a distance. In [TFOH,
3, Pale Shadows, 75], Rand thinks, "Women who could channel saw a glow
surrounding another woman who had embraced saidar and felt her channelling
clearly, but he never saw anything around Asmodean, and felt little." This
is with Asm is in the same room.
<P>
However, there seems to be some confusion of exactly how far the range on
male-male sensing is. Here are some examples:
<UL>
<LI>[TFOH: 55, The Threads Burn, 664]: When Rand is running around trying
to balefire the hell out of Rahvin, <em>even though Rahvin is holding
saidin</em>, Rand can't feel where he is.
<LI>[TFOH: 55, The Threads Burn, 662]: Rand recalls Asm describing trying
to locate another man channelling as "like trying to find a lion in
high grass." (That is, very difficult.)
<LI>[TFOH: 22, 405, Birdcalls by Night, 287]: After a Draghkar attack on
Rand's camp, Asmodean tells him that he had sensed the Draghkar, but
had not done anything about it, since he thought Rand could deal with
it, which he did. Rand replies: "'Well for you that you didn't,' Rand
cut him off, sitting cross-legged in the dark. 'If I had felt you full
of saidin out there tonight, I might have killed you.' "The other
man's laugh was shaky. 'I thought of that, too.'" This little snippet
of conversation seems fairly clear. Rand obviously felt capable of
sensing Asm from as far away as Rand was from Asm during the fight, and
Asmodean also thought it was possible.
<LI>[LOC: 42,The Black Tower, 545]: Rand says to Taim: "If I feel a man
channel in Caemlyn...and don't think you can stay far enough from the
Palace that I won't feel it and be safe." (NB: Rand may just be
bluffing, here. Or it might just be something along the lines of "If I
hear you use that sort of language in this house, young man, I'll wash
your mouth out with soap!")
<LI>[TFOH: 44, The Lesser Sadness, 495]: Rand was able to sense lightning
from Sammael (He thinks it is Sammael, at least) during the battle of
Cairhien.
</UL>
<P>
5) For both men and women, the ability to sense channeling seems to
depend on the strength of the particular flow being channeled. For men,
this is implied by Asmodean when he talks to Rand about blocking Aviendha's
gateway to Seanchan: "I felt your weave - anybody within a mile could have
felt it - I never saw anything like it - I didn't know that anyone but
Demandred could block a gateway that was closing." [TFoH, 32, A Short
Spear, 374]. For women, the dependence is implied by Elayne, Nynaeve, and
Sareitha's detection of the Seanchan channelling in Ebou Dar at [TPOD, 5,
The Breaking Storm, 129]-- Elayne thinks, "Sareitha was not strong enough
to sense saidar being wielded at that distance....<em>She</em> was not strong
enough. Unless someone was using as much as they had on this hilltop."
This quote shows that, for females at least, the ability to sense
flows depends on both the strength of the flow <em>and</em> the strength of
the woman doing the sensing. This may also be the case for men.
