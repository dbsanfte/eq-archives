<h1 align="center">2.3.3: Effects of the Oath Rod: Binding, Agelessness, and
Death</h1>
<P align="Center">[Daniel Rouk, Burr Rutledge, Andrea Leistra, Korda]</P>
<hr>
<h2>Binding</h2>
In the AOL, there were multiple "Oath Rods." They were apparently
fairly common devices used to discipline criminals who could
channel. The Forsaken refer to them as a type of "binder"; according
to Sammael [ACOS: 40, Spears, 631], Oath Rods only work on
channellers, and the one <EM>he</EM> gives to Sevanna only works on female
channellers. There are other types of binding devices, such as
"binding chairs" that work on anybody.
<P>
One of the first references to "binding" is in [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of
Shadow, 136]. Graendal is showing off her Sharans. While discussing the
Sharan channellers, Sammael asks her if they 'bind themselves like
criminals.' Sammael thinks he's revealing something Graendal didn't know,
but she thinks about how she found out about the AS use of the Oath Rod from
Mesaana [LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 138]. We later find out Mesaana
is in the White Tower. The only 'binding' that we know about that occurs
in the White Tower is the bonds willingly taken by Aes Sedai via the Oath
Rod.
<P>
Next scene: [LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 139-143] Semirhage is
torturing the Aes Sedai, and thinking on how she was 'wronged' because
the Age of Legends Servants didn't understand why she gave a little
pain with her healing. After all, nobody complained when they owed
their life to her. She recollects that she was given two choices, to
be severed, or to accept binding. The actual quote is "to be bound
never to know her pleasures again, and with that binding be able to see
the end of life approach." This illustrates that 'binding' is in fact
as Sammael said, something done to criminals.
<P>
In [Guide: 3, The Age of Legends, 37], we learn about the criminal justice
system in the AOL. "When the perpetrators of violent acts were caught, they
were not sent to prison. Rather, they were constrained... against repeat
offenses. This binding made it impossible for the criminal ever to repeat
his crime." In [Guide: 5, The Dark One and the Male Forsaken, 54], we also
find out that this binding was done with the OP. Describing Balthamel, ne
Eval Ramman, it says, " More than once he supposedly came very close to
being <em>bound with the Power</em> against doing violence."
<P>
Finally, we have [ACOS: 40, Spears, 630-631], in which Sammael gives
Sevanna an OR, which he probably got from the Ebou Dar stash. He
explains how it works: "'You might call it an Oath Rod,' Caddar
said...'It only came into my hands yesterday, and I immediately
thought of you.'... 'All you need do is have your AS...or any woman
who can channel, hold the rod and speak whatever promises you wish
while someone channels a little Spirit into the number. The marks on
the end of the rod?'...'It only works on women?' [Sevanna said.]
'Women who can channel, Sevanna,' Caddar said."
<P>
We learn a few other things about the OR and binding:
<OL>
<LI>It can be used to remove Oaths, according to Sammael [ACOS: 40, Spears,
631], and from Pevara and Seaine's experiments described in [TPOD: 26, The
Extra Bit, 503]. It makes sense that there should be some way to remove
the Oaths, since it was a method of punishing criminals. If the criminal
was later proven innocent, or truly reformed, one would want the OR binding
removed, considering its unhealthy effects (see below).
<LI>It is harder to bind non-channellers than to bind channellers [ACOS:
40, Spears, 631]. This implies that the OR's binding mechanism involves
the bound individual's channelling ability.
<LI>The OR is NOT a "Rod of Dominion." The way the Nine Rods of Dominion
were mentioned in TEOTW Prologue, they were something special. The OR,
OTOH, is referred to as a "binder," lower case. Nothing special.
Furthermore, in TPOD, we find out what Sammael meant by "the number" in
[ACOS: 40, Spears, 630-631]-- the Oath Rods are numbered. The Tower's Rod
is number three, while Sevanna's Rod is number one hundred and eleven
[TPOD, 11, Questions and an Oath, 253]. So, it seems like there are way
more than nine Oath Rods.
</OL>
<h2>Agelessness</h2>
<P>
The question is: is the "ageless" look attributed to Aes Sedai in the
Third Age something unique to them, or is this appearance attained by
all channellers? If it is only found in modern AS, then it seems
likely that the look is caused by the Oath Rod-- one of the only major
differences between the current Aes Sedai and other channellers.
<P>
What is the Ageless Look? It is not mere youthfulness. People looking
at AS with the look are unable to put any age at all to them. Here is
evidence:
<OL>
<LI>In [TDR: 3, "News from the Plain," 23] Perrin describes Moiraine:
"She was a slender, dark-haired woman no taller than his shoulder,
and pretty, with the ageless quality of all Aes Sedai who had
worked with the One Power for a time. He could not put any age at
all to her..."
<P>
<LI>In [LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 25-26], Elayne describes
Janya Sedai and Anaiya Sedai: "Janya Sedai was quite neat, every
short dark hair tidy around the ageless face that marked Aes Sedai
who had worked long with the Power.... "You are making great
strides, Elayne," Anaiya said calmly. The bluff-faced woman was
always calm. "Motherly was the word to describe her, and comforting
usually, though Aes Sedai features made putting an age to her
impossible."
<P>
<LI>In [ACOS: 1, High Chasaline, 60] Perrin describes the TAS who were
captured, discounting the ones who were stilled: "The others looked
ageless, of course, maybe in their twenties, maybe in their
forties, changing from one glance to the next, always
uncertain. That was what their faces said, though several showed
gray in their hair." From this, we know that if an observer can put
a definite age to a channeller, then the channeller DOES NOT have
the Ageless Look.
</ol>
<P>
Note: the Ageless Look takes some time to manifest itself after a
woman is raised to full AS. 1) Elaida's spy in Caemlyn is "'A Red
Sister....Newly raised, so she can easily pass for other than AS.' She
meant that the woman had not yet taken on the agelessness..." [TFOH,
Prologue, The First Sparks Fall, 16] 2) In [ACOS: 24, The Kin, 408],
Elayne says, "I don't think anyone has ever reached that [the Ageless
Look] until they've worn the shawl at <EM>least</EM> a year or two, sometimes
five or more."
<P>
Now, let us look at the descriptions of all other channellers, to see
that they do NOT have the Ageless Look.
<h3>A Look at non-Aes Sedai Channellers</h3>
<h4>Aiel Wise Ones</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Perrin describing the WOs after rescuing Rand: "Every Wise One
who had come here from Cairhien was able to channel, though none
had the ageless look." [ACOS: 1, High Chasaline, 64] Amys is one of
these WOs--she appears in [ACOS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 80].
<LI>Sevanna describing Graendal, lets slip what is perhaps the most
glaring example that the ageless look is actually different from
what the Wise Ones have:
<blockquote>
As dark of face and hair as he [Sammael], and beautiful enough
to tighten Sevanna's mouth, she wore red silk, cut to expose
even more of her bosom than Someryn showed.... Right then, she
did not care whether the woman could move mountains or barely
light a candle. She must be Aes Sedai. She did not have the
face, yet some Sevanna had seen did not. [She's probably
thinking about Egwene, who was masquerading as AS]
</blockquote>
If the WOs had the same ageless look as Aes Sedai, Sevanna would not
think of "the face" as an identifying feature of AS.
<LI>In [TSR: 23, Beyond the Stone, 262], we have a description of
Melaine from Egwene's point of view, before she knows that Melaine
can channel. "The last of the four, a handsome woman with
golden-red hair, no more than ten or fifteen years older than
Egwene, hesitated." Note that Eg puts a definite age to her.
<LI>Egwene, describing Amys: "Suddenly Amys's youthfully smooth
features beneath that white hair leaped out at her for what they were,
something very close to Aes Sedai agelessness." [TSR, 23, Beyond the
Stone, 262]. "Amys was white-haired, too... but she did not look old.
She and Melaine could both channel -- not many Wise Ones could -- and
she had something of the look of the Aes Sedai agelessness about her."
[TFOH: 5, Among the Wise Ones, 99] Note that Amys is <EM>close</EM> to
ageless, has <EM>something</EM> of the look, but NOT the exact same
look.
<LI>In [TGH: 28, A New Thread in the Pattern, 345], Urien meets
Ingtar's party, and says to Verin, "No, Wise One. But you have the
look of those who have made the journey to Rhuidean and
survived. The years do not touch the WOs in the same way as other
women." This seems to tell us that the WOs <EM>do</EM> have the Ageless
look. However, the huge quantity of contradictory quotes,
especially Perrin's and Sevanna's above, leads us to believe that
either RJ changed his mind, or Urien was mistaken, or Urien
only meant that Verin doesn't look as old as her grey hair would
indicate.
</UL>
<P>
<h4>Sea Folk Windfinders:</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Elayne and Ny do not recognise Jorin, the Windfinder of
<CITE>Wavedancer</CITE>, as a channeller until Elayne actually SEES her
channel [TSR: 20, Winds Rising, 233]. If she had the distinctive
Ageless look, they'd have noted it immediately. This is not merely a
case of Jorin being young; she is not. Her sister Coine has "gray
touches in her black hair and fine wrinkles at the corners of
her...eyes....It was a surprise that the two were sisters. Elayne could
see the resemblance, but Jorin looked much younger." [TSR: 19, The
Wavedancer, 217]. Furthermore, Joine has children older than Elayne.
[TSR: 20, Winds Rising, 234]
<LI>The Windfinders Rand meets in [ACOS: 34, Ta'veren, 535-536] look
young, not ageless:
<blockquote>
"Harine did a lot of the talking, and so did a young, pretty
woman in green brocade with eight earrings altogether, but the
pair in plain silk put in occasional comments....Harine turned
so calmly there might never have been any hasty conference.
"This is Shalon din Togara Morning Tide, Windfinder to Clan
Shodein," she said with a small bow toward the woman in green
brocade, "and this is Derah din Delaan Rising Wave....""
<P>
"She [Derah] made a small bow toward the fourth woman, in yellow.
"This is Taval din Chanai Nine Gulls, Windfinder of White Spray."
Only three rings hung from each of Taval's ears, fine like those
of the Sailmistress. She looked younger than Shalon, no older
than himself."
</blockquote>
</ul>
<P>
<h4>Seanchan Damane and Sul'dam</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In [TGH: 40, "Damane," 477] Egwene sees Renna, her new sul'dam:
"With long, dark hair and big brown eyes, she was pretty, and
perhaps as much as ten years older than Nynaeve." Note she can put
a specific age to Renna.
<LI>In [TGH: 40, Damane, 482], a damane is described: "One of the other
sul'dam snorted loudly; she was linked to a pretty dark-haired
woman in her middle years who kept her eyes on her hands." Again,
we have a specific age.
</UL>
<P>
<h4>Forsaken and Other Old-time Aes Sedai</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>AoL Aes Sedai don't seem to have had the look, although we have
little evidence one way or the other. (Plus, aging was weird in the
AoL. Jonai [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 300] is 63 years old and
considers himself young. Jonai doesn't mention his Aes Sedai having
an "ageless" look, but he doesn't mention her lack of it,
either. He says she "looked younger than he." None of the Forsaken
are "ageless."
<LI>Many years after the Breaking, when Rhuidean is built, the Aes Sedai
with the Jenn Aiel are described as "ageless." [TSR: 25, The Road to
the Spear, 284]. While one of these AS has the same name as one of the
AOL AS we see in TSR, it is not the same person. At a post-POD book
signing in Dayton, RJ was asked, "Was the Aes Sedai who initiated the
Pact of Rhuidean from the Age of Legends?" RJ's answer: (Pause)"No."
(Pause)"No, she was not from the Age of Legends." [from Michael Martin]
When was the OR first put into use? The first of the Three Oaths to be
put into effect, the Second Oath against making weapons with the Power,
was adopted after the War of Power [TGH: 1, The Flame of Tar Valon, 5],
[Guide: 24, The White Tower, 213]. However, Sheriam's statement in
[TGH: 23, The Testing, 282] implies that the Oath Rod itself wasn't put
into use until after the Trolloc Wars. Needless to say, this point
needs clarification.
</ul>
<P>
<h4>Stilled Aes Sedai</h4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>After being stilled, Siuan and Leane look like young women again,
not "ageless." [TSR, 47, The Truth of a Viewing, 535] They look
different enough that it is hard to recognise them. When they get
the OP back, they don't get the Ageless look back, either: In [LOC:
44, The Color of Trust, 556], Mat sees SS after she has been healed
by Ny--"He gave her a shallow bow and walked quickly to where a
pretty blue-eyed young woman was tapping her foot to the music.
She had a sweet mouth, just right for kissing, and he bloody well
wanted to enjoy himself."
<LI>The BA stilled in Tear (Amico) looks different: 'Amico looked
young, perhaps younger than her years, but it was not quite the
agelessness of Aes Sedai who had worked years with the One Power.
"You have sharp eyes, Aviendha, but I don't know if this has
anything to do with stilling. It must, though, I suppose. I don't
know what else could cause it."' [TSR: 5, Questioners, 84]
<LI>The TAS stilled by Rand at Dumai's Wells also look young, as
opposed to ageless [ACOS: 1, High Chasaline, 60].
</ul>
<P>
<h4>Students in the Tower and the Kin</h4>
<P>
As noted above, no AS gets the Ageless look until after they've been
raised to full AS [ACOS: 24, The Kin, 408]. This is not a matter of
time spent channelling, or of strength in the OP, but of passing a
certain point-- being raised.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Elayne mentions an Accepted who is older than 40, (and thus has
been channelling a LONG time, at least as long as some of the
younger sisters) and looks YOUNG-- Ny's age, not ageless [ACOS: 24,
The Kin, 408].
<LI>In [ACOS, 31, Mashiara, 497], Elayne and the AS meet the Knitting
Circle: "Most wore Ebou Dari dresses, though only one possessed the
olive skin; most had lines on their faces and at least a touch of
gray; and every last woman of them could channel to one degree or
another." No AS has a lined face; it's part of being Ageless.
<LI>In [ACOS, 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 393], Ny meets Reanne Corly:
"From the exchange, she had expected someone younger than Setalle
Anan, but Reanne had hair more gray than not and a face full of
what might have been smile lines..." Again, Reanne is old-looking.
<LI>It can't be put any clearer than this: "There had to be a reason why
the Kin looked neither ageless nor anything near the ages they claimed."
[TPOD: 3, A Pleasant Ride, 94]
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Physical Effects of the Oath Rod</h3>
<P>
In L:NS and TPOD, we get ample evidence that swearing on an Oath Rod
produces a physical effect-- some kind of "tightening" of the skin:
<UL>
<LI>[L:NS, 653]: Moiraine, a newly-raised Aes Sedai, thinks, "The Three
Oaths still made her skin feel too tight."
<LI>[L:NS, 662-663]: Merean is describing how Moiraine and SS were
punished for putting mice in Elaida's bed the night before they were
raised: "I doubt any other women have been raised Aes Sedai while still
too tender to sit from their last visit to the Mistress of Novices. Once
the Three Oaths tightened on them, they needed cushions a week."
<LI>[TPOD, 11, Questions and an Oath, 256]: Galina takes an Oath on
Sevanna's OR, after being tortured by the Shaido WOs: "Galina felt the oath
settle on her, as if she suddenly wore a garment that covered her far too
tightly from her scalp to the soles of her feet.... it suddenly seemed as
if the burning of her skin was being pressed deep into her flesh..."
<LI>[TPOD, 26, The Extra Bit, 504]: Seaine reswears the Three Oaths:
"Seaine retook the Oaths in turn, each producing a slight momentary
pressure everywhere from her scalp to the soles of her feet. In truth, the
pressure was difficult to detect at all, with her skin still feeling too
tight from retaking the Oath against speaking a lie.
</ul>
<P>
This "tightening of the skin" could be what causes the Ageless Look,
kind of like a permanent face lift.
<P>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Ageless look is not the result of anything the AS experience until
the actual raising ceremony. The Kin are made up of women who trained
in the Tower, who flunked out or ran away at various points in their
training. This includes women who have passed the Accepted Test, and
even women who made it through various parts of the AS Test [ACOS, 24,
The Kin, 405-406]. None of them are ageless.
<P>
<LI>The Ageless look is not the result of strength in the OP. The Kin
contain women who are fairly strong channellers: "Of course, Reanne
could channel -- she had expected that; hoped for it, anyway -- but
she had not expected the strength. Reanne was not as strong as
Elayne, or even Nicola -- burn that wretched girl! -- but she
easily equaled Sheriam, say, or Kwamesa or Kiruna." [ACOS: 23, Next
Door to a Weaver, 394]. So do the WOs and the Windfinders. The strongest
channellers of all, the Forsaken, definitely do not have the
Ageless Look.
<P>
<LI>The agelessness is not the result of the total amount of OP
channelled. The obvious example of this is the Forsaken. Certain
members of the Kin are very old (Reanne Corly is older than 400),
and must have channelled as much in their lifetime as any of the
younger AS.
<P>
<LI>Here is the part where Elayne starts putting it all together:
After talking about the 40+ Accepted who looks 26, she says, "We
<em>slow</em>, Nynaeve. Somewhere between twenty and twenty-five, we
begin aging more slowly. How much depends on how strong we are, but
when doesn't. Any woman who can channel does it. Takima said she
thought it was the beginning off achieving the ageless look, though I
don't think anyone has ever reached that until they've worm the shawl at
<em>least</em> a year or two, sometimes five or more. Think. You
<em>know</em> any sister with gray hair is <em>old</em>, even if you
aren't supposed to mention it. So if Reanne slowed, and she must have,
how old is she?" [ACOS: 24, The Kin, 408]
</ul>
<P>
Nobody in all of Randland has the Ageless look besides AS raised in
the White Tower. Thus, there must be something done to them in the
raising ceremony which brings about the Ageless Look. The only such
thing of which we know is swearing on the Oath Rod. Given the evidence
that we have, it must be the OR which causes agelessness. The only
other possibility is that there is something else done in the Raising
ceremony which we don't know about and which causes the
agelessness. Any such thing would have to involve the woman's
channelling ability, in order to explain why the Agelessness vanishes
when a person is stilled. There may indeed be other items used in the
AS-Raising ceremony besides the Oath Rod, as indicated by this quote:
[LOC: 39, Possibilities, 513] "Romanda wanted to use gateways to
remove the OR and certain other items...from the Tower so they could
make true AS in Salidar while depriving Elaida of the ability." These
items may be used in the AS TEST, as opposed to the actual final
ceremony, though.
<P>
<h3>Misc. Notes</h3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Stilling and the Oaths</STRONG>: When an AS is severed from the
Source (i.e. stilled), she loses the ageless look, AND is freed from the
Oaths. This, combined with the fact that the OR only works on channellers,
implies that the OR somehow works by tapping into the AS's own channelling
ability, causing the binding and the agelessness.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Egwene's Accepted Test</STRONG>: In one of Egwene's three
experiences in ter'angreal used in the test to be raised Accepted, she is
the Amyrlin seat. She looks in a mirror, and sees that she has the Ageless
Look [TDR: 22, The Price of the Ring, 203]. A few pages later, she says
that she has not sworn on the Oath Rod. If she never held the OR, then why
does she look Ageless?
<P>
Richard Boye' explains this nicely: "The reason is that the ter'angreal
weaves illusions and testings from what the subject knows, expects, and
fears. How else would it know that Nynaeve wants to marry Lan or that her
mother's name was Elnore? Egwene saw herself with the Ageless look because
from her knowledge and point of view, she was supposed to." Note that
in that same vision, Egwene's Keeper, Beldeine, was stilled, but she still
had the Ageless Look. In the real world, we know that stilling removes the
Look. However, at that point in time, Egwene didn't know that.
</UL>
<h2>Death</h2>
<P>
A final effect of the OR is that it seems to shorten the lifespan of
channellers bound by it. It seems to work this way: use of the OP
increases one's lifespan by a great deal. The more you channel, the
better the anagathic effect. Being bound by the OR decreases one's
lifespan, or perhaps lessens the anti-aging benefits of
channelling. In any case, the net effect is that OR-bound channellers
live longer than non-channellers, but not as long as channellers who
are NOT bound by the OR.
<P>
Evidence that Oathbound channellers don't live as long as nonbound
ones:
<UL>
<LI>Cadsuane Melaidhrin is most likely the oldest living AS, at around 295
years old [ACOS: Glossary, 671]. She considers <em>herself</em> to be
very old, expecting to die RSN: "Over two hundred and seventy years had
passed since she last encountered a task she could not perform. Any day
now might be her last, but young al'Thor would be a fitting end to it
all." [ACOS: 19, Diamonds and Stars, 347].
<LI>Elayne to Reanne Corly: "apparently no Aes Sedai since the
Breaking has lived as long as any of you in the Knitting Circle
claim....In your own case, not by over a hundred years." [ACOS: 37,
A Note from the Palace, 577]. Reanne Corly is 411.
</ul>
<P>
From these quotes, we can conclude that the maximum lifespan of modern
AS is around 300 years.
<P>
Ages of other channellers:
<UL>
<LI>The above quote also tells us that the Kin live at least 25%
longer than AS. Since Reanne Corly is hardly on her last leg, Kin
probably outlive AS by an even greater amount.
<LI>In [LOC: 15, A Pile of Sand, 262], we have a reference to an Aiel
WO who died at age 300 of a snake bite, but still looked
young. Since she looked young, she probably still had a good bit of
her natural lifespan ahead of her. So, from this, we know that WOs
at least have the <EM>potential</EM> to live longer than 300 years,
i.e. longer than AS. In practice, they probably don't live that
long (the WO telling the story of the 300-year-old WO regards it as
a legend, and possibly exaggerated), due to the harsh conditions in
the Three-Fold Land.
<LI>The Forsaken are all way old, and were even before they got locked up
in the Bore.
<LI>We have no evidence as to the longevity of Seanchan or Sea Folk
channellers.
</ul>
<P>
From the evidence that we have, modern-day AS have a shorter maximum
lifespan than other channellers. As with the Ageless look, there must
be something done in the AS-raising ceremony which causes this. The
only such thing of which we are aware is being bound by the OR. Again,
there is a possibility that there is some other thing in the ceremony
which we don't know about, and which causes this effect. However,
there is less chance of this being the case with the shorter lifespan
than with the ageless look.
<P>
This is because we have independent evidence from Semirhage. In [LoC:
6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 139-143] Semirhage is thinking about how
the AOL AS wanted to "bind" her to put an end to her medical
malpractice. The actual quote is "to be bound never to know her
pleasures again, and with that binding be able to see the end of life
approach." Now, we know that "binding" of channellers (esp. female
channellers) was done with an OR. Semirhage seems to be thinking that
the binding would cut her life short.
<P>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<P>
The primary effect of the OR is to compel obedience to oaths sworn on
it. It probably does this by tapping into the oathbound channeller's
own channelling ability in some unknown way. (We know this bc the
binding to the oaths vanishes when the oathbound woman is severed.) It
has some secondary effects, in particular 1) it probably shortens the
lifespan of the bound channeller, and 2) it probably causes the bound
channeller to develop the "ageless look" unique to modern AS. It is
unknown if these secondary effects are deliberate (i.e. a kind of
death sentence and a way of marking criminals, respectively) or if
they are an inherent side effect of the binding mechanism.
