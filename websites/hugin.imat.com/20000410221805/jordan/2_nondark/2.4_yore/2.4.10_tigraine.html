<P>
It is a certainty that Tigraine was Rand's mother, Shaiel.
<P>
Tigraine was the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and was married to Taringail
Damodred. They had a son, Galad. Tigraine and her brother Luc were sent
to Tar Valon, in the usual tradition of the royalty of Andor. Tigraine
vanished mysteriously from Tar Valon, never to be heard from again.
[TEOTW: 34, The Last Village, 441-2]
<P>
In [TSR: 34, He Who Comes With the Dawn, 392-3], we learn about Rand's
mother, Shaiel. Her tale corresponds marvelously with Tigraine's.
<P>
Add to this the fact that many people comment on how Rand looks like the
Royal Family of Andor (Lord Barthanes [TGH: 32, Dangerous Words, 392],
and many Andoran nobles [LOC: 26, Connecting Lines, 380]), the description
of Luc [TSR: 33, A New Weave in the Pattern, 368]), and there you have
it.
<P>
In LOC at one point in Caemlyn, Rand finally learns about Tigraine's story
and is very upset until he figures out that he is not actually directly
related to Elayne. Thus, he has placed himself in the family tree (<A HREF="../2.5_lurv/2.5.1_whos-who-fam.html">See Section 2.5.1</A>) even if no
one else has.
<P>
Yes, this means that Galad is Rand's half-brother.
