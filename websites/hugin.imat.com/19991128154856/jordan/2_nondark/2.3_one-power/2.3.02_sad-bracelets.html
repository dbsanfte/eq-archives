Descriptions of the item:
<UL>
<LI>[TSR: 55, Into the Deep, 638] 'Egeanin touched the collar,
pushed the bracelets away from the collar.... "It is not a'dam," the
Seanchan woman said. "That is made of a silvery metal, and all of
one piece.'
<LI>[TSR: 52, 866, Need, 600] "...-a necklace and two bracelets of
jointed black metal-..."
<LI>[TSR: 54, 905, Into the Palace, 628] "...dull black collar and
bracelets... ...wide jointed collar..."
<LI>[TSR: 54, Into the Palace, 630] Moghedien: "[The bracelets are] not
metal, but a form of cuendillar.... Put the collar on a man who channels,
and a woman wearing the bracelets can make him do whatever she wishes,
true, but it will not stop him from going mad, and there is a flow the
other way, too. Eventually he will begin to be able to control you,
too....Or two women can each wear one bracelet, if you have someone you
trust enough; that slows the seepage considerably, I understand, but it
also lessens your control....Eventually, you will find yourselves in a
struggle for control with him, each of you needing him to remove your
bracelet as surely as he needs you to remove the collar."
<LI>[TSR: 54, Into the Palace, 630] Moghedien: "The collar and bracelets
were made after I was [bound in the Bore]"
</UL>
<P>
The last we saw of the bracelets/collar was Egeanin and Bayle going off
to dump them in the ocean, near the Aile Somera. That just happened to
be where High Lady Suroth was camping out at the time. Since we assume
that the Seanchan will get/have got the collar, what will they do with their
male channeller? Or, will the BA get the collar and bracelets through
the Darkfriend connection? Wouldn't the best means of destroying them
be separating them and throwing them in say the sea, a volcano, and
such?
<P>
Now, of course, the sad bracelets can be used on any of the poor sods
who signed up to become Asha'man.
<P>
Did Sammael somehow get ahold of the Sad Bracelets? In [ACOS: 20
Patterns within Patterns, 354] "What I have will control him once he
is taken, but it cannot overcome him." This description applies to the
Bracelets, but it could also apply to a "binding chair," or something
like that.
