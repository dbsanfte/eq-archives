<HR>
<P>
Elayne denies that Galad is her brother. Thom was around at the right
time. Thom clearly had something to do with Taringail's disappearance.
Thom was Morgase's lover. In [TFOH: 19, Memories, 252], Morgase thinks
about Taringail, and how the only good to come of the marriage were "two
beautiful children." This could be Elayne and Gawyn, or she could mean
Galad (adopted) and Gawyn.
<P>
Evidence from the Glossary: "A Royal Prince of Cairhien, he married
Tigraine and <em>fathered</em> Galadedrid. When Tigraine disappeared and was
declared dead, he married Morgase and <em>fathered</em> Elayne and Gawyn."
[TEotW: Glossary, entry "Damodred, Prince Taringail", 661]
<P>
In [TSR: 17, Deceptions, 194], Moiraine says Thom was "Morgase's
lover for a time, <em>after Taringail died</em>" (emphasis mine). Here,
Moiraine is trying to impress Thom with how much she knows. She
wouldn't include a detail she had any doubt about. To be wrong about
something in such a situation would indicate faulty research, and
Moiraine would not risk showing any gap in her knowledge. If she had
any doubt at all, she wouldn't have mentioned the timing of
events. Plus, Thom didn't say or think anything to contradict
Moiraine's statement.
<P>
If Morgase had been having an affair with Thom while still married to
Taringail, it is very unlikely that she would have been able to keep
it entirely under wraps; surely some rumor would have been around,
especially in Cairhien. However, we see no evidence of such a rumor
existing. Specifically, in [LoC: 50, Thorns, 628] when Rand mentions
to some Cairhienin that he means to have Elayne rule Cairhien, the
Cairhienin think she'd be a good choice, due to her descent from her
father Taringail Damodred. If Morgase was unfaithful, surely there would
have been some doubt as to Elayne's right to the throne of Cairhien.
<P>
At a post-ACOS signing [Dunwoody, GA, 9 October, 1996], RJ strongly denied
that Thom was Elayne or Gawyn's father. "Thom is exactly who he says he
is."
