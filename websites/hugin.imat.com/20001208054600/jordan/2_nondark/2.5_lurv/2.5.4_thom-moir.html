<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.5.4: Why do we think that Thom will marry Moiraine?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
Moiraine says she knows the face of the man she will marry better than
El/Eg/Ny know their future husbands [TSR: 6, Doorways, 90-1]. This could
mean that she will never wed, but it could mean that she really does know
who she will end up marrying. Support for the latter case is that,
according to Elayne, Moiraine had some passion in her voice when she
mentioned a husband, despite her attempts to then brush it off. After
going through the Tear twisted doorway, she immediately tells Thom that he
will live through the next set of adventures. This is not the only example
of Moiraine being so sure of Thom's fate; while the party is traveling
through the ways in TEOTW, Moiraine implies that Min saw something about
Thom which makes her think that Thom was not killed by the Fade [TEOTW: 45,
What Follows in Shadow, 568]. She certainly seems to have some sort of
knowledge of Thom's future. Thom keeps referring to Moiraine as a
good-looking woman with more and more sincerity as time progresses and he
discovers he no longer loves Morgase.
<P>
Possible scenario: How would she know who it was? Being Aes Sedai
she'd likely have a lot of chances, but here's a guess. When Min
describes how her viewings work her standard example is this: I see
two people who have never met and know they will marry-- and of course
she had both Thom and Moiraine in front of her in Baerlon. So, this
would also be the reason why 1) Moiraine was so sure Thom hadn't been
killed by a Fade, despite Rand's and Mat's protestations, and 2) why
she tells Thom "I will see you again. You will survive Tarabon."
[TSR: 17, Deceptions, 195] At this point, she is absolutely
certain that she will see Thom again. This is before she goes to
Rhuidean and goes through the rings that show possible futures. When
she did that, she saw nothing beyond the point where she tackled
Lanfear through the Twisted Doorway. She thus decided that Min (or
whatever oracle led her to think she would see Thom again) had been
wrong. [Sean Hillyard] Note that, right before tackling Lanfear, Moiraine
suppresses a "small bubble of hope," which she feels, even though she is
sure she's about to die [TFOH: 52, Choices, 632].
<P>
Add to all this speculation Egwene's Dream of Thom pulling Moiraine's blue
head jewel out of a fire (i.e. Thom rescuing Moiraine from durance vile in
Finnland). Nothing sparks a romance (in stories, at any rate) like a rescue.
