<h1 align="center">1.6.1: More of the Fain</h1>
<hr>
<P>
Padan Fain was a Lugard peddler, who moonlighted as a Friend of the
Dark. When it came time for the Dragon to be reborn, Fain was taken to
Shayol Ghul and made into the Dark One's Hound, to search out the
Dragon Reborn. He followed the boys to Shadar Logoth and had a run-in
with Mordeth. Mordeth tried to devour Fain's soul, but couldn't,
because of the hold the DO had on him. So Fain became part Mordeth,
part renegade minion of the DO. This is basically what the books tell us.
<P>
What is he up to now? Not much, for somebody who is supposedly as
dangerous as the Shadow. He went to the Fortress of the Light and the
White Tower to sow seeds of dissension, and make sure Pedron Niall and
Elaida would never join Rand. He seems to be currently involved in causing
Rand trouble, in little instances which could, admittedly, build up. He
instigated a failed assassination of Rand by his ex-WCs in Caemlyn. He
might also have been responsible for the attack on the Brown AS in Caemlyn
which ended up driving a rift between Rand and the Salidar AS, and sending
him into the hands of Elaida's AS in Cairhien, but this could just as
easily have been part of some Forsaken's plot, or a plot by the Tower AS
and the Shaido to alienate the Salidar AS from Rand (<A HREF="../1.4_whats-up-dark/1.4.6_demira.html">See Section 1.4.6</A>). Last time
we saw him, he was hanging with Toram Riatin (a Cairhienin rebel) and
calling himself "Jeraal Mordeth." In TPOD, Lord Dobraine reports a rumor
that Mordeth has deserted Toram, who has disappeared.
<P>
As far as we know, Fain still has his pet Fade.
<P>
<h2>Is Fain the Dark One's avatar?</h2>
Roy Navarre and Tony Z came up with a loony theory that Fain is actually the
avatar of the DO. Roy says: "First, if you check the glossary, you will
see that the DO is described as the source of all evil. Hence
Mashadar must flow from the DO or the glossary is wrong. (Note that that
last option <em>has</em> been known to happen.) Next, Myself and Tony Z
presented detailed evidence suggesting that Fain is the avatar of the
DO. With each broken seal, Fain gets stronger. Thus, the DO has been
in our midst all this time but we just didn't know it. At first only a
trace of him in Fain, but growing stronger and stronger until now his
presence in Fain seems unmistakable."
<P>
Eric Ebinger counters: "Fain no longer exists. Padan Fain was summoned
to Shayol Ghul, was broken and reformed into a bloodhound for the DO,
as part of which he was imprinted by the DO. This happened twice at
Shayol Ghul and once in a dream. Padan Fain/DO bloodhound went to
Shadar Logoth and fell prey to Mordeth. Normally, Mordeth would just
destroy the existing "soul/personality", but Padan Fain's having been
"remade" by the DO seems to have changed things sufficiently so that
there was a slow gradual merging of <em>all</em> of the different
personalities (Fain/Mordeth/DO's imprint). The most accurate term for
the combination is the name that he took: Ordeith. Over time, the
Mordeth portion has gained more and more control over the gestalt. The
DO's imprint has given Ordeith the unreasoning hatred of Rand, Perrin,
and Mat. There doesn't seem to be much of anything of Padan Fain left.
As the Mordeth fragment has gained more complete control of the
gestalt, Ordeith has increased in power. The seeming relationship
between the breaking of the Seals and Ordeith's power is due only to
the fact that as time passes Ordeith gets stronger and as time passes
the Seals break. The same relationship is evident with Rand, Perrin,
Mat, Elayne, Egwene, Aviendha and Nynaeve." Note that Fain is now calling
himself "Mordeth," which suggests that the Mordeth part is dominating,
which makes it very unlikely that Fain is the DO's avatar.
<P>
Furthermore, as John Novak states: "If Fain is now an embodiment of the
Dark One, why in Hell was Slayer hunting him down as a renegade in tSR?
Does the Dark One <em>like</em> being hunted by his own servants?"
<P>
Finally, it's pretty apparent that if <em>anybody</em> in these books is
the Dark One's avatar, it's Shaidar Haran.
