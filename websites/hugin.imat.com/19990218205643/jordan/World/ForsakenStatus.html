<H1>Who are the Forsaken?  Where are they now?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Mark Looi, ETC.</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The Forsaken were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.
They went over to the Dark One's side during the War of the Shadow.  Legend
has it that they were sealed with the Dark One when the Dark One's prison
was re-sealed.
<P>
The 13 Forsaken (in alphabetical order) are:
<UL>
<LI>AGINOR (M):  Killed at the Eye of the World (by drawing too much of the One Power) <CITE>TEotW: 51, 756-9,
Against the Shadow, 634-5</CITE>. Probably resurrected as Osan'gar. He was involved in creating the various
Shadowspawn.

<LI>ASMODEAN (M):  Real name Joar Addam Nesossin <CITE>TFoH: 45, 727, After the Storm, 516</CITE> aka Jasin
Natael.  Thought by many to be the weakest and most cowardly of the Forsaken. Captured by Rand and shielded by
Lanfear at Rhuidean <CITE>TSR: 58, 973-8, The Traps of Rhuidean, 674-7</CITE>.  Toast at the end of
TFoH...Twice! No body was found, so most people in Randland do not know he is dead, just that he has vanished.
The DO is unlikely to resurrect him, since THOSE WHO BETRAY [the DO] WILL DIE THE FINAL DEATH. Claims to have
joined the Shadow for the promise of eternal life, in which to practise songs and music.  NB: Maybe is not
dead/has been resurrected, and is the prisoner of Moridin's second mindtrap.

<LI>BALTHAMEL (M):  Killed by the Green Man at the Eye of the World (<CITE>TEotW: 50, 751-2, Meetings at the
Eye, 630-1</CITE>). Probably resurrected as Aran'gar.

<LI>BE'LAL (M): aka High Lord Samon of Tear, balefired by Moiraine in the Stone of Tear <CITE>TDR: 55, 651-2,
What is Written in Prophecy, 557</CITE>.  Was a leader in the fight against the Shadow, but joined the DO
because he was envious of LTT.  Also known as "Netweaver."

<LI>DEMANDRED (M):  Real name Barid Bel Medar. Dislikes Rand/LTT intensely. (<CITE>TSR: 58, 975, The The Traps
of Rhuidean, 677</CITE>).  Turned to the Shadow because he got tired of being second-best to LTT (<CITE>TFoH: 3,
105, Pale Shadows, 76-7</CITE>), (<CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 56-7</CITE>), whom he considered his
intellectual inferior in the AoL.  Possibly involved with the Seanchan (<CITE>LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow,
135</CITE>), also possibly masquerading as Mazrim Taim. Knows how to block gateways.

<LI>GRAENDAL (F): In the habit of taking aristocrats and making them serve in some demeaning aspect, using
enough compulsion to fry their brains to make them useless. Currently in Arad Doman, having taken over
somebody's palace. She has one  of the World's Greatest Generals, Lord Rodel Itruralde, working for her,    
and it seems as though all the reported chaos in Arad Doman might not be quite as chaotic as it first appears.
She appears to visitors as an enfeebled old lady. Before turning to the Shadow, she was a celebrated
psychiatrist in the AOL (<CITE>LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 130-9</CITE>), and an ascetic.  She seems to be
underestimated by all the other Forsaken, besides Sammael.  Has been duped by Sammael into following him, due
to his claim of being Nae'blis.  Original name is maybe Maisia.

<LI>ISHAMAEL (M):  Real name Elan Morin Tedronai, aka Ba'alzamon. Probably killed by Rand in Tear <CITE>TDR:
55, 666, What is Written in Prophecy, 570</CITE>. The most philosophically-minded of the Forsaken, he came up
with many theories on the nature of the battle between the Creator and the DO <CITE>LoC: 6, Threads Woven of
Shadow, 133</CITE>. Believed by many to be the most powerful Forsaken.  Was partially or totally free during
the third age. Believed by the other forsaken to be partially or totally mad.  Frequent used of the "True
Power."  Possibly reincarnated as Shaidar Haran or Moridin.

<LI>LANFEAR (F):  Real name: Mierin <CITE>TSR: 58, 973, The Traps of Rhuidean, 676</CITE>, aka: Selene, aka
Keille, aka Silvie, aka Else Grinwell in TDR.  Former lover of LTT, who believes she was rudely tossed over
for Ilyena. Known for interfering in others' plans, twisting them to her advantage. Tackled by Moiraine in
TFOH. May be toast or in Aelfland.  Was one of the two AS who created the Bore.
(<a HREF="ForsakenStatus.html#Lanfear">Survey</a>)

<LI>MESAANA (F): The long-anticipated Forsaken in the Tower (<CITE>LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow,
138</CITE>). Was rejected by the Collam Dam, so instead of being a researcher, she ended up a teacher, until
she found a way to Teach Them All! MUAHAHAH! Feels uneasy around Semirhage (Don't we all? :).

<LI>MOGHEDIEN (F):  aka Gyldin, aka Marigan.  Captured by Nynaeve in Tanchico, but escaped <CITE>TSR: 54,
909-13, Into the Palace, 631-3</CITE> believed to be the strongest Forsaken in Tel'aran'rhiod <CITE>TSR: 52,
864, Need, 599</CITE>.  Captured by Nynaeve in Salidar and forced to teach her and Elayne.  Released by
Aran'gar and summoned to SG <CITE>LoC: Epilogue, The Answer, 697-8</CITE>, wheree she was disciplined and
fitter with a mindtrap.  Is now a lacky of Moridin.  Ny thinks she was some sort of con artist or criminal
during the AOL.

<LI>RAHVIN (M):  aka Lord Gaebril.  Was active in Caemlyn (<CITE>TDR: 46, 534-40, A Message Out of the Shadow,
452-7</CITE>).  Balefired by Rand in tFOH (<CITE>TFoH: 55, 948, The Threads burn, 672</CITE>).

<LI>SAMMAEL (M):  Real name Tel Janin Aellinsar (<CITE>TFoH: 45, 727, After the Storm, 516</CITE>), aka Lord
Brend of Illian (<CITE>TDR: 44, 508-9, Hunted, 429-30</CITE>).  Was given scar by LTT, hates Rand (<CITE>TFoH:
Prologue, 35, The First Sparks Fall, 28</CITE>).  Always wanted to be taller. A great military leader for the
Light before turning to the Dark Side.  Claiming (to Graendal) to be Nae'blis.  Has managed to get ahold of a
number of AOL goodies from stasis boxes, and some stuff from the Kin's stash in Ebou Dar.  Vanished during the
fight with Rand in ACOS.  Presumed dead by Rand.

<LI>SEMIRHAGE (F):  Has a penchant for gruesome torture.  Whereabouts unknown.  Hates Lanfear. Is very tall,
with dark skin and eyes, and likes wearing black. Was a brilliant healer who took payment in extracting extra
pain from her patients. Knows how to block open gateways. Turned to the Dark Side to avoid being stilled or
bound by an Oath Rod for her perversion. (<a HREF="ForsakenStatus.html#Semi">Survey</a>)
