<H1>Is the voice of Lews Therin Telamon in Rand's head real, or is Rand insane?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Carolyn Fusinato, Pam Korda</H2>
<H2>(<a HREF="LTTReal.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
So, Rand is hearing voices. Is Lews Therin a real entity, or is he a
product of Rand's taint-maddened imagination?
</P>
<H3>Option One</H3>
<P>
Two minds inhabit Rand's body; Rand and LTT. This seems to
be supported by Min's vision (<CITE>ACoS: 33, A Bath, 526</CITE>) in which Rand
and another man touched and merged into one another. Rand certainly
takes it that way (which should alert the cynical reader to the
distinct possibility that this is probably the <EM>wrong</EM> interpretation
:). This theory implies that Rand is relatively sane still and his
problems can be attributed to stress, paranoia, fear and another mind
trying to take him over and that Lews is completely insane.
</P>
<P>
However, it doesn't make much sense for LTT to be talking to Rand. If
we look at the other people who have lived past lives, we don't see
this happening. Mat's memories of his past life/lives are integrated
into his own personality. Same with Birgitte -- she doesn't talk to
"Marion," she says she was once called Marion. If LTT <em>is</em> a separate
entity, it could imply that Rand is just some poor sod who happened to
be born into the same body that LTT was reborn into, and that not
Rand, but LTT is the actual Dragon Reborn. OTOH, it was <em>Rand</em> who
pulled the Sword that Ain't, not LTT; he hadn't even shown up
then. There is only one case in which we definitely know that two
entities coexist in one body: the Fain-Mordeth combo, and they are
melding into a single entity over time.  (*'gar don't count, because
there is only one mind in the body. Slayer doesn't count, because we
have no evidence that any of Luc's consciousness survives. In fact, in
TAR, we see only Isam.)  However, this wasn't a rebirth.  This theory
also neglects to explain the fact that there is no manifestation of
LTT prior to Rand channelling.
</P>
<P>
Another possible argument, proposed by Joseph Rosenfeld against this
is that, if the Dragon has been reborn over and over through all time
(as claimed by Ish and others), there must have been <EM>other</EM> "dragons"
before LTT. Why, then, is only Lews Therin Telamon Kinslayer, the Age
of Legends version of the Dragon, inhabiting Rand's head? Why not a
whole committee? Counter to this, also suggested by Mr. Rosenfeld:
maybe LTT is the easiest to get get to because he was the most recent.
If Rand tried really hard, he could maybe contact the 1st Age Dragon,
and the previous 7th Age one, etc. 
</P>
<H3>Option Two</H3>
<P>
The LTT personality is the manifestation of Rand's
encroaching insanity. "...Everybody has been telling him he is Lews
Therin reborn, so he starts perceiving Lews Therin is in his head. Not
only that, but he finds the voice responds to him. Now he's trying to
carry on conversations with this voice. It all seems logical to us,
but then it seems logical (sort of) to Rand, as well. I found myself
thinking he should tell somebody he was hearing a voice in his head.
When I thought how absurd this sounded, it struck me that I had been
fooled into thinking Rand was still completely sane." (<CITE>James Beavens</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
Then, there is also, "He raised the point that Rand's creeping
insanity may manifest in much more subtle ways than the people of
Randland expect..." (from Emmet O'Brien's account of Jordan's talk at
Trinity College in Dublin).
</P>
<P>
This theory is supported by Cadsuane's statement that "some men who can
channel begin to hear voices....It is part of the madness. Voices
conversing with them, telling them what to do." (<CITE>ACoS: 18, As the Plow
Breaks the Earth, 331</CITE>) If we assume Dashiva is not a Forsaken, but just a
crazy channeller (see <A HREF="Dashiva.html">section 1.52</a>), then Dashiva's reaction to
Cadsuane's statement, as well as some of his other behaviour, seem to
support it.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this doesn't take into account that "LTT" knows
things that Rand could never have known on his own -- stuff about the
AoL, the Forsaken, channelling, etc.
</P>
<H3>Option One and a Half</H3>
<P>
Option 1.5 -- This is a kind of compromise between 1 &amp; 2. Rand's
taint-maddened subconscious could be constructing the LTT voice out of
past life memories like Mat's. That is to say, the memories and
knowledge expressed by LTT are real effects of being somebody Reborn,
but the LTT voice is not, Rand has multiple personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
Option 3 -- (This is a bit out in left field, IMO, but some people do
believe it, so I'll mention it.) There <em>is</em> a voice in Rand's head, but
it is <em>not</em> LTT, or Rand being crazy. Rather, it is the result of some
skullduggery on the part of the Shadow to infiltrate Rand's brain.
Variations on this theme have been Mesaana (disproven by her actual
appearance in <CITE>LoC</CITE>), Ishamael, and maybe others.
</P>
<P>
An interesting thing to note is that, as soon as Cadsuane mentions
hearing voices, "LTT" stops talking to Rand. Another thing to note is
that Cadsuane channelled while making that statement. The obvious
thing she did was fetching the teapot to her, but it is possible that
she used the channelling of the teapot to disguise something else she
did. So, we're left with the question of why did LTT go away? Was it
something Cadsuane did? Did he go away of his own volition (is he in
hiding)? Did Rand subconciously supress him? Also, what does his
disappearance signify?
