<h1 align="center">2.6.2: The Severed Hand</h1>
<hr>
The "Severed Hand" controversy centers around several of Min's visions.
For Elayne, she has seen: 1) A severed hand, not hers [TGH: 24, New Friends
and Old Enemies, 305], 2) A red-hot iron and an axe [TGH: 43, A Plan, 511].
For Rand, we have: A bloody hand and a white hot iron [TEotW: 15, Strangers
and Friends, 181]. Here are the ideas:
<P>
1) Elayne gets captured and leashed by the Seanchan. Rand, or somebody
else, is somehow forced to wear the bracelet (recall that little Seanchan
game?) [TGH: 40, Damane, 484]). Somebody then chops off Rand's hand
(with an axe) to save the two of them. The wound is then cauterized with a
hot iron that happens to be lying around. [Judy G, Arthur Bernard Byrne,
John Novak]
<P>
2) Joe Shaw has suggested: During Rand's battle with Ba'alzamon at the end of
TGH, we have "Rand screamed as he felt [Ba'alzamon's staff] pierce his
side, burning like a white-hot poker." At the same time, he gets a second
heron branded onto his hand [TGH: 47, The Grave Is No Bar To My
Call, 564]. I still think this was the fulfillment of Min's viewing about
Rand, and that Elayne's similar viewing is completely unrelated.
<P>
3) In [TFoH: 16, An Unexpected Offer, 224] we learned that the punishment
for stealing in Amadicia is: First Offense--branding (with a red-hot iron?)
Second Offense--Right hand chopped off. Scenario: somebody Elayne knows
gets accused of stealing in Amadicia (Morgase? Galad? Lini?) and is
branded. The person gets into more trouble, and has their hand chopped
off. Rand has nothing to do with it. His bloody hand is something else.
Problem with this theory is that Amadicia is now under Seanchan control,
and old Amadician laws probably don't apply any more.
<P>
4) Galad's hand gets chopped for having stolen the boat in Samara from the
loony Prophet (according to the Prophet's new law, thieves get their hands
chopped). Problem: I see this having more to do with Ny than with El,
since she was the one who told both Galad and the Prophet to get a boat for
them. [Judy G.]
<P>
RJ said, at a signing, that he deliberately made Rand like Tew,
the Norse god of strife, who lost a hand.
