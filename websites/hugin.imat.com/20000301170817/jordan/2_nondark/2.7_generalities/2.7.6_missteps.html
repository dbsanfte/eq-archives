<h1 align="center">2.7.6: Mis-steps (Errors along the way)</h1>
<HR>
<P>
NB: Typographical errors are, in general, not listed. There are too many
of them, and they are often corrected in later editions.
<P>
<h2>The Eye of the World</h2>
In TEOTW, Thom teaches Mat and Rand to juggle. By the time they reach
Caemlyn Mat can perform "six ball circles", which I interpreted as a
six-ball shower. No way. You could probably count the number of people in
the world today who can shower six balls to a performance standard on the
fingers of one hand. Assuming there are any. I've only twice seen a five
ball shower done well. It's certainly not something somebody could learn
in a few weeks. [David Mortman, others]
<P>
Q: What about those Warders in Caemlyn around Logain in TEOTW? [TEOTW: 42,
Remembrance of Dreams, 535] Didn't Moiraine say that they were all Red
sisters? Reds don't have Warders! RJ's answer, as reported by Tony Z:
Moiraine never mentioned the sisters escorting Logain (not all of whom were
Red). The ones with Logain weren't in Caemlyn at the time (evidently they
stayed with the army, which stayed outside the city). Moiraine was
referring to those that <EM>were</EM> in Caemlyn.
<P>
<h2>The Great Hunt</h2>
Ba'alzamon's goals: [TGH: 47, The Grave Is No Bar To My Call, 563] "But
this time I will destroy you to your very soul, destroy you utterly and
forever." Maybe he forgot [TGH: 41, Disagreements, 497] "Fool! You
will destroy yourself!" where he stopped Rand from burning himself out.
Ba'alzamon is either forgetful, confused, or trying to appear so. [Morgan
Donald Scott]
<P>
Why does Moiraine wear her great serpent ring on her left hand in [TEOTW:
2, Strangers, 22-3] and [TDR: 3, News from the Plain, 26] and on her right
hand in [TGH: 4, 46, Summoned, 39]? I can think of four possible reasons:
<OL>
<LI> a cunning plan by Jordan to make us believe sweet,
innocent Moiraine was at the Darkfriend social.
<LI> Moiraine has an evil, identical twin sister who wears
her ring on the other hand.
<LI> It's Moiraine's ring and she can wear it on whatever
hand she damn well pleases.
<LI> none of the above. [Damien Cole]
</OL>
<P>
When Rand returns Thom's harp and flute to the gleeman in Cairhien, Thom
grumbles: "You could at least have kept it (the harp) in tune" [TGH: 26,
Discord, 323]. For travel, harps (and many other stringed instruments) are
ALWAYS detuned -- the tension on the strings is reduced to prevent string
wear and possible snapping. [Erica Sadun] {NB: In later printings, this
has been corrected, with Thom saying, "At least you were't fool enough to
try keeping it tuned."}
<P>
<h2>The Dragon Reborn</h2>
In [TDR: 6, The Hunt Begins, 63], the beginning at-camp scene, Perrin tells
Min that he loves her like a sister--and that he has no sisters of his own.
In [TSR: 29, Homecoming, 333], his two sisters and his brother are killed.
[Erica Sadun] {NB: this has reportedly been corrected in later printings of
TDR}
<P>
In [TDR: 41, A Hunter's Oath, 388] Perrin is remembering a confrontation
between Moiraine and Zarine. "Once she learned the girl thought they would
lead her to the Horn of Valere, ...then her cold blue stare had taken on a
quality that made him feel he had been packed ..." Which left me wondering
whose cold blue stare? Both Moir. and Zarine have dark eyes.[Aline
Thompson] The quote continues "The Aes Sedai said nothing, but she stared
too often and too hard for any comfort.", implying that it refers to
Moiraine. [Joe Shaw] [TEOTW: 2, Strangers, 22], [TGH: 4, Summoned, 38],
[TDR: 6, The Hunt Begins, 55], [TSR: 3, Reflection, 71] and [TFoH: 2,
Rhuidean, 68] all describe Moiraine as having "dark eyes", and [TDR: 33,
Within the Weave, 319], [TDR: 35, The Falcon, 333], and [TSR: 2, Whirlpools
in the Pattern, 40] describe Faile as having "dark, tilted eyes".
<P>
Metallurgy Mistake, from John Palmer and Don Harlow: Maybe others have noted
this metallurgy mistake, as a engineer this bugged me. In the Dragon
Reborn, when Perrin takes a day at the Smithy, he notes the three quenching
media: "As soon as he had made the hot-cut, he tossed the glowing metal
into the salted quenching barrel. Unsalted gave a harder quench, for the
hardest metal, while the oil gave the softest, for good knives." [TDR: 50,
The Hammer, 506] Wrong. In order of resultant hardness, it goes Oil,
Water, Salt Water, with Salt water yielding the hardest blade because of
best heat transfer and higher boiling point than plain water. Oil is
softer because of slower heat transfer but is commonly used for cutlery
because it causes less thermal stresses and a tougher blade. (won't break
from shock) Salt water quench is definitely a harder quench than fresh
water. It's due to the higher boiling point of salt water precluding the
formation of an insulating vapor layer over the steel which slows heat
transfer from the steel to the water.
<P>
Hey, what's the scoop with Shadowman steel? First, Thom Merrilin runs into
a Fade and it left him "a little present of a stiff leg." Then after the
fight where the Aiel come to the rescue of the girls: [TDR: 39, Threads in
the Pattern, 382] "Shadowman steel kills," Aviendha said, "it does not
wound." Finally, Rand's thought while fighting a Fade: [TSR: 10, The Stone
Stands, 132] "That black metal could make wounds that festered, almost as
hard to heal as the one that ached in his side now." Is there something
that I'm missing, like it just kills Aiel, or does this qualify as a Jordan
mis-step? [Dash Wendrzyk] {NB: the obvious explanation is that the Fade
did not stick Thom with its sword; the Fade just smacked him one,
instead.--Pam}
<P>
<h2>The Shadow Rising</h2>
[TSR: 47, The Truth of a Viewing, 531]: During the Tower Coup, Siuan's
Warder gets killed. She doesn't notice until she sees his dead body.
[Michael Hanneman] This cannot be because she was shielded, because in LOC,
Cabriana and her warder are being tortured by Semirhage in different rooms.
Cabriana is shielded, but she still feels it when her warder dies. [Lars
Kremers]
<P>
Courtenay Footman tells us more about the Siuan's Warder incident: This has
been the subject of extensive discussion here. The consensus has come down
to three possibilities: 1) Jordan screwed up. 2) Being shielded interferes
with the bond. IMHO, this last is refuted because Jordan gives a different
explanation: 3) Siuan was distracted by other things going on at that
moment: [LoC, 30, To Heal Again, 427], Siuan thinks "Alric, her Warder.
Her dead Warder, murdered when Elaida deposed her. She could lie--the
Three Oaths were still gone--but some part of her bond to Alric, a bond
flesh to flesh and mind to mind, had been resurrected. The pain of his
death, the pain first masked by the shock of what Elaida intended and then
buried by stilling, that pain filled her to the brim."It seems to me that
there is no choice but to accept this statement. Whether one believes that
Jordan meant this all the time, or that this is just an after-the-fact
rationalization of a mistake, seems to me to be a matter of personal
opinion.
<P>
<h2>The Fires of Heaven</h2>
Something very strange happened between 10 and 20 years ago. In [TGH: 4,
Summoned, 49] the Amyrlin says to Moiraine "I am the fifth in a row
raised to the Amyrlin Seat from the Blue." Two pages earlier, we learn
that Siuan Sanche has been Amyrlin for ten years. In [TFoH: 15, What
Can Be Learned in Dreams, 214], Moiraine says to Egwene: "In a few months
it will be twenty-one years since we began the search for the Dragon
Reborn. Sieren Vayu was raised to Amyrlin shortly after, a Gray with more
than a touch of Red in her." [C. Footman] This has been admitted by RJ as
an error. The correct sequence is: "The correct sequence is: Kirin Nelway
(Brown) 922-950 NE; Noane Mosadim (Blue) 950-973 NE; Tamra Ospenya (Blue),
973-979 NE; Sierin Vayu (Gray), 979-984 NE; Marith Jaen (Blue), 984-988 NE;
Siuan Sanche (blue), raised 988 NE. The correction is being made in the
body of TGH and in the glossary." [Carolyn F., I think] The quick
succession of Amyrlins prior to SS is discussed in further detail in ACOS.
<P>
In [TFoH: 36, A New Name, 409], Birgitte tells Elayne "You saved my life,
Daughter-Heir of Andor. I will keep your secret and serve you as Warder."
But later in [TFOH: 47, The Price of a Ship, 550] Birgitte verbally scolds
Elayne for telling Cerandin she was heir to a throne, and doesn't believe
it until Nynaeve makes an offhand comment in [TFOH: 49, To Boannda, 570].
<P>
Rand balefires Rahvin, erasing his actions, etc. However, none of Rand's
injuries, all sustained at the hands of Rahvin, disappear--they were
instead Healed by Nynaeve afterwards. [TFOH: 55, The Threads Burn, 672-3]
[Sean Hillyard] (This is arguably an effect of either Tel'aran'rhiod or
balefire.)
<h2>Lord of Chaos</h2>
<P>
In previous glossaries, it says that the AS cannot sense in what direction
her Warder is. In LOC, Alanna does just that. What gives? Edward Liu
says that, at a signing, RJ said that the ability is not exact, but
something like they can only sense distance (and I guess) direction in that
the feeling of the other person becomes stronger or weaker. Tony Z. said
RJ said the Glossaries are in error, and that there are references in other
books to AS sensing the direction of their Warders. (Anybody find such a
thing? I can't think of one). Joe thinks RJ changed his mind, to put it
charitably.
<P>
In [TFOH, 52, Choices, 624] when Moiraine hands Rand two letters, just
before the Big Scene at the docks, their (the letters') seals are described
as having the imprint of Moiraine's Great Serpent Ring. Later on, in [LOC:
40, Unexpected Laughter, 516], when Thom receives his letter from Moiraine,
the seal is now some sort of wide-spreading tree topped with a crown.
[A.M. Gabutero]
<P>
In the LOC Glossary, under linking, it says that in mixed circles less
than 13, a man must control the flow, and that there must be more women
than men in circles greater than two [TFOH: 34, A Silver Arrow,
390]. However, In TFOH Nynaeve overhears Lanfear, Graendal, Sammael, and
Rahvin discussing their plan against Rand. In particular Sammael is to
tempt Rand into attacking and the other three would link to overwhelm
him. [Emma Pease] At a signing, RJ said that the LOC glossary entry is
wrong. It is certainly different in the ACOS entry: 43 vs 34, and the
numbers where men can equal or exceed women are changed. Still doesn't
explain the TFOH gaffe. [John Novak]
<h2>A Crown of Swords</h2>
<P>
We encounter more closely two of Liandrin's 13 in this book: Falion Bhoda
and Ispan Shefar and learn Falion was white and Ispan blue. We also have a
mention that Rianna was also white (which had been mentioned in earlier
books). However, Joiya Byir was also white which means we now have three
former whites among Liandrin's 13, yet we are told that two and only two of
each Ajah except red went with Liandrin. What gives? First could it be a
simple typo? I don't think so as both Falion and Joiya acted as I would
expect whites and because Rianna is mentioned several times as being white.
Second, could it be a Jordan error? Possible, but I would think it a
fairly major blunder as I would hope he would have who is who in Liandrin's
group clearly marked from the beginning. Third could it be deliberate? If
so, this means either Verin is mistaken about who was from which Ajah and I
can't see Verin making this mistake, or she deliberately gave the girls
misinformation. [Emma Pease] {NB: In later printings of TSR Joiya is
transformed from a "cold White" to a "characteristic cool Grey". No doubt
RJ wanted her as a White personality, but when it came out in the FAQ he had
three, he went "Oh shit. Now which one did I kill off already so I can
change her to something else?" At any rate, the suspicions connecting this
with Verin ought to be erased, since it's been retroactively corrected.
[Michelle Haines]}
<P>
Timing problem: There is an inconsistency in ACOS regarding Colavaere's
coronation. In [ACOS: 4, Into Cairhien, 117], Dobraine says, "The ninth
sunset after her coronation already. She wasted no time." However, in
[ACOS: 5, A Broken Crown, 125], Colavaere says, "Nine days ago at sunrise I
was crowned Queen of Cairhien." This is a contradiction because the first
statement includes the current day as one of the nine, while the second
doesn't. [Steven Cooper]
<P>
In [ACOS: 13, The Bowl of the Winds, 263], Aviendha introduces herself as
"Aviendha of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel." She's previously
been from the Bitter Water sept, from when we first meet her [TDR: 38,
Maidens of the Spear, 361] onwards. Now here's the interesting bit. The
Maiden that Nynaeve heals in [TDR, 38, Maidens of the Spear, 368] (Dailin)
is first referred to as being from Aviendha's sept and clan; i.e., the
Bitter Water Taardad. Later, she's referred to as being from the Nine
Valleys sept. So what gives? Two errors that are fortuitously similar, or
a particularly odd attempt at retconning an old error? [Andrea Leistra]
{NB: This error has reportedly been corrected in later printings to
give Aviendha's sept consistantly as the Nine Valleys Sept.}
<h2>The Path of Daggers</h2>
<P>
The chronology of the Seanchan attack on Ebou Dar is inconsistent between
ACOS and TPOD. In ACOS, the finding of the Bowl, the Seanchan invasion, and
the wall falling on Mat take place on the day after the Festival of Birds.
In TPOD, chapters 1-6 are described as taking place two days after the
Festival. Since these events must clearly all take place on the same day,
one of the books is wrong. From other evidence, it's clear that TPOD is
the one that's in error. [Steven Cooper]
