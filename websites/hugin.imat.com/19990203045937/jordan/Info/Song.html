<H1>The Green Man and the Song: (Tinker, Green Man, Soldier, Aiel)</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Erica S., P. Korda, Teri Pettit, Aaron Bergman</H2>
<HR>
<H2>Who is the Green Man?</H2>
He is the last of the Nym, a type of creature that was made of vegetable
matter. He is described first in <CITE>TEotW: 49, 739-40, The Dark One Stirs,
621</CITE>.  However, we find out exactly who he is in the fourth book.
<P>
	 "A stir at the end of the field told him one of the Nym was
	 approaching.  The great form, head and shoulders and chest
	 taller than any Ogier, stepped out onto the seeded ground, and
	 Coumin did not have to see to know he left footprints filled with
	 sprouting things.  It was Someshta, surrounded by clouds of
	 butterflies, white and yellow and blue....Each field would have
	 its Nym, now...the Nym were older than anyone.  Some said the
	 Nym never died, not so long as plants grew..." -- <CITE>TSR: 26, 432, The Dedicated, 303</CITE>
<P>
Many years later, after the breaking, we see him again, this time with
the characteristic fissure in his face.  He is being set to the task
of guarding the Eye of the World, the Horn, the Dragon banner, and one
of the Seals. <CITE>TSR: 26, 428, The Dedicated, 300-1</CITE>
<H3>What is the Song?</H3>
The Tinkers, an early offshoot of the Aiel, decided to give up their
duty of hiding *'angreal, and instead dedicate their lives to re-finding
the safety and peace of their past. <CITE>TSR: 26, 423, The Dedicated, 296</CITE>. 
They believe this will come about through finding the "growing song,"
described in:
<P>
	"The Ogier began it, as was fitting, standing to sing, great bass rumbles
	like the earth singing.  The Aiel rose, men's voices lifting in their own
	song, even the deepest at a higher pitch than the Ogier's. Yet, the songs
	braided together, and Someshta took those threads and wove them into his
	dance....The song caught him up, and he almost felt that it was he himself, not
	the sounds he made, that Someshta wove into the soil and around the seeds." -- <CITE>TSR: 26, 432, The Dedicated, 303</CITE>
<P>
The Song is not to be confused with the Ogier Tree-Songs. The Ogier songs may
be the Ogier part of the growing ceremony described above, or they may be
something similar, but different in purpose.
<P>
For the Tinkers, "The Song" has become more than just the human part
of the AoL growing ceremony. The Tinkers' legendary song is something
that will bring back the peaceful lifestyle known by the Dashain Aiel
during the Age of Legends.
<P>
<CITE>TSR: 26, ?, ?, 296 REF?</CITE>:<BR>
"The Tuatha'an began
their search looking for a safe haven where they could return to a way
of life in which Aiel singing together worked wonders. That eventually
got distorted into a life of perpetual travel searching for "The
Song", as if there were just one, and it was something a single
traveler could know." -- <CITE>Contributed by: Tari Petit</CITE>
<P>
So, when we say "Will the Tinkers find the Song?" we really mean,
"Will the Tinkers rediscover the AoL growing ceremony, plus the talent
of the Voice, and be able to recreate the peaceful existence of their
ancestors, the Da'shain Aiel?"
<P>
<H2>Survey Says:</H2>
<H3>Will the Aiel and the Tinkers reunite?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes: 42% (94)
<LI>No: 44% (99)
<LI>Undecided: 14% (31)
</UL>
<H2>Will the Song by found, and if so, by whom?</H2>

The primary contenders are Aram, Perrin, and Rand.  Aram's stated life goal had
been to find the Song, until he took up the sword in defense of Emond's Field,
and became &#96;lost&#39; to his people. To find the song would reinstate him and
justify his choice of giving up the peaceful &#96;Way of the Leaf&#39;.  Perrin, on
the other hand, keeps getting faced with the choice of ax or hammer: that is,
the choice of creation or destruction, war or peace, way of the warrior or
Way of the Leaf. Furthermore, Perrin is a contender to find the Song because
of Min's viewing of Perrin standing among the flowering trees. Rand,
and probably some of the Aiel clan chiefs, have actually <em>heard</em> the
Song in the glass columns of Rhuidean.
<P>
Further Evidence that Rand will find the song (<CITE>TEotW: prologue, xv, Dragonmount, xv</CITE>)):
"...ages past and will be in ages to come.  <EM>Let the Prince of the Morning
sing to the land that green things will grow</EM> and the valleys give
forth lambs."                               
<P>
It is entirely possible that the Song is lost forever (or at least
until the Age of Legends comes around again).
<P>
Aaron Bergman explains:
<P>
"In the Breaking that followed the sealing of the Bore, the Da'Shain
were scattered. Some ended up at Rhuidean with the caravans; some
broke off, eventually becoming the Tinkers. Anyways, during those
times when mountains moved around when they were bored and food and
water were scarce, the memory of the singing survived. This grew to
become linked with the memory of the peace of the Age of Legends. This
easily progressed to the idea that if they could discover this
ephemeral "Song," the Age of Legends would come anew.
<P>
"I think one of the themes buried in these novels is that the past is
dead.  You can't hope to regain the past. Rand can't go back to the
Two Rivers and become a shepherd. The Age of Legends is dead; it will
not return for a very long time, certainly not in the next (Fourth)
Age. The Tuatha'an are seeking to regain the past. The "Song" is a
remnant of the past. Thus, the Song will not be found." There is no
Song that will recreate the Age of Legends, for it is past. 
<P>
<H2>Survey Says:</H2>
<H3>Will the Song be found?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes: 74% (166)
<LI>No: 18% (41)
<LI>Undecided: 8% (17)
</UL>
<H3>Who will discover the Song?</H3>

<LI>Rand:   6% (14)
<LI>Loial:   12%  (27)
<LI>LTT:    1%  (3)
<LI>No one:  11%  (24)
<LI>Mat:    1%  (3)
<LI>Aram:     8%  (19)
<LI>Elyas: 1%  (2)
</UL>
<H3>Will Perrin pick the axe or the hammer (whatever that means)?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The axe, then discard it for the hammer: 57% (127)
<LI>The hammer:                              19% (43)
<LI>The axe:                                  7% (16)
</UL>

<H2>Who were the Aiel?</H2>
The Aiel (formerly the Da'shain Aiel) were the &#96;Dedicated&#39; who worked
for the Ancient Aes Sedai.  The group was hereditary, and had features of light
skin, grey or blue eyes, and mostly reddish or blond hair.  All Aiel could be
identified by their particular hair style, which was cut short with a tail
hanging in the back.  They were dedicated to a life of non-violence, following
the &#96;Way of the Leaf&#39;.  The male Aiel worked with the Ogier and the Nym in
planting as they had the gift of the &#96;Voice&#39;, the seed singing.  Although the
Ogier continue to have &#96;tree singers&#39;, the voice of the Aiel seems to be
a talent that has disappeared.  When the Aiel did their work in the fields,
they wore light grey and brown &#96;working clothes&#39; (cadin'sor). The clothes,
hair style, and avoidance of the use of weaponry that cannot be
used for other purposes remains today, but the talent of the Voice is
currently unknown.
<H2>Survey Says:</H2>
<H3>Are there any Jenn Aiel left?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes:  29% (65)
<LI>No: 59% (133)
<LI>Undecided: 11% (25)
