<H1>The Severed Hand</H1>
<HR>
<P>
The "severed hand" controversy centers around several of Min's visions. For
Elayne, she has seen:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A severed hand, not hers (<CITE>TGH: 24, 362, New Friends and Old Enemies, 305</CITE>)
<LI>A red-hot iron and an axe (<CITE>TGH: 43, 605, A Plan, 511</CITE>)
</UL>
For Rand, we have:
<UL>
<LI>A bloody hand and a white-hot iron (<CITE>TEotW: 15, 216, Strangers and Friends, 181</CITE>)
</UL>
<P>
Here are the theories:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>(<CITE>TFoH: 16, 316, An Unexpected Offer, 224</CITE>):<BR> The
punishment for stealing in Amadicia is: First offense -- branding (with
a red-hot iron?)  Second offense -- right hand chopped off. Scenario:
Somebody Elayne knows gets accused of stealing in Amadicia
(Morgase? Galad? Lini?) and is branded. Gets into more trouble, and has
a hand chopped off. Rand has nothing to do with it.  His bloody
hand is something else. (<CITE>Pam Korda</CITE>)
<LI>Elayne gets captured and leashed by the Seanchan. Rand, or somebody else,
is somehow forced to wear the bracelet (recall that little Seanchan game?
(<CITE>TGH: 40, 573, Damane, 484</CITE>)).  Somebody then chops of Rand's hand (with an
axe) to save the two of them. The wound is then cauterized with a hot iron
that happens to be lying around. (<CITE>Contributed by: Judy G, Arthur Bernard Byrne, John Novak</CITE>)
<LI>Joe Shaw suggests: During Rand's battle with Ba'alzamon at the
end of <CITE>TGH</CITE>, we have "Rand screamed as he felt [Ba'alzamon's staff]
pierce his side, burning like a white-hot poker." (<CITE>TGH: 47, 666, The Grave Is No Bar To My Call,
564</CITE>) At the same time, he gets a second heron branded onto his hand.  I still think this was the
fulfillment of Min's viewing about Rand, and that Elayne's similar viewing is completely unrelated.
<LI>Galad's hand gets chopped for having stolen the boat in Samara
from the loony Prophet (according to the Prophet's new law, thieves
get their hands chopped).  Problem: I see this having more to do
with Ny than with El, since she was the one who told both Galad
and the Prophet to get a boat for them. (<CITE>Judy G., again</CITE>)
</UL>
<P>
RJ said, at a signing, that he deliberately made Rand like Tew/Chew, the Norse god of strife, who lost a hand.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Survey Says</H2>
<H3>Will Rand lose a hand?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes: 51% (114)
<LI>No: 35% (78)
<LI>Undecided: 14% (31)
</UL>
