<h1 align="center">1.2.3: What is the deal with Halima and Egwene's
headaches?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
In ACOS, Egwene came down with a spate of nasty headaches. The only
way she can manage to get rid of them is for the lovely Halima to give
her a massage. Halima just happens to be one of the DO's recycled
agents, Aran'gar. Coincidence? I think not.
<P>
It's one of the oldest tricks in the book-- cause problems so you can win
somebody's confidence by fixing them.
<P>
The evidence: Eg's headaches started the day after Logain escaped, and the
day Eg and Halima had their first conversation [ACOS: 12, A Morning of
Victory, 249]. Aran'gar had been trying very hard to get rid of Logain,
either to gentle him again, or to kill him. In [LOC: 52, Weaves of the
Power, 651]. Egwene says, "They will gentle him, Siuan... That, or
someone really will do what Delana has been hinting at. I won't allow
murder!" Delana is by now only a pawn, voicing Halima's wishes. To Halima
Logain is dangerous, being the only one around who can sense her ability to
channel saidin, or rather, her actual channelling. As soon as Logain is
gone, Halima's free to make her move on Egwene.
<P>
It's entirely possible that something more sinister than a Forsaken
gaining Eg's confidence is going on. As Halima rubs Eg, Eg answers
questions in her mind. Halima says, "Just put yourself in my hands."
Eg's sleepy response to this is, "That will be nice." Granted, the
first interpretation of this is Halima's offer of a full-body massage,
and Eg thinking of "bringing Sheriam to heel." Even so, it's a rather
ominous exchange, considering who the parties are. Could Halima be
poking poor Eg with a bit of Compulsion?
<P>
If she is, it doesn't seem to involve much. In TPOD, Egwene certainly
seemed to be in full control of her faculties. If Halima isn't doing any
mind-control stuff on Egwene, then what <em>is</em> she up to? Elizabeth
Cornwall points out, "given Halima's access to Egwene, I can't imagine that
she wants Egwene to fail in her current plans. The proof of this being a
negative one: that if Halima wanted to bring Egwene down, she certainly
could have already done so in any number of ways. (Two possibilities:
direct compulsion during the headache sessions to brainwash Egwene into
seeing some other plan as better; having had Delana "reveal" to the SAS
Hall that Egwene was Siuan's dupe and that the attack on Elaida was being
pursued because of Siuan's influence)." John Novak adds, "Just killing her
outright would have sufficed, too. I'm sure Halima could manage something
that would leave no trace of foul play."
<P>
Since no serious ill has befallen Egwene since she's been open to Halima's
influence, we must conclude that either Halima is woefully incompetent, or
that (at least some of) Egwene's goals coincide with Halima's, at the
moment. One such goal is the AS civil war. Continued conflict between the
TAS and the SAS is definitely in the DO's best interest-- the two groups
of AS are tied up fighting each other, instead of fighting the Shadow, or
aiding the Dragon Reborn. So long as the conflict between the two factions
continues, the DO's interest is served. Halima's methods may change if it
starts to look like Egwene's plans for reuniting the Tower are coming to
fruition. To that end, Halima may be content to simply increase her
access to and influence over Egwene so that when she has to act, it will
be easier.
