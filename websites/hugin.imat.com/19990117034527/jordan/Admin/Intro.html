<H2>Copyright notice:</H2>
<P>
The Wheel of Time FAQ contains writing by many authors.  The individual authors hold copyright to their
respective contributions, as cited in the text.  The Wheel of Time books, and all quotations therefrom, are
&copy; 1990-1996 by Robert Jordan.  Unattributed material is &copy; 1996 by Pamela Korda and Erica Sadun. This
version of the FAQ as a document is &copy; 1996 by Pamela Korda, 1996.  The HTML conversion and formatting of
this document are &copy; 1996 by Matthew Hunter.  Images are &copy; 1989-1996 by Tor Books.  Permission is
granted to freely copy this document, in full or in part, in electronic form, or to print for personal use,
provided that all citations, attributions, and copyright notices are kept.
</P>
<P>
This is the Wheel of Time Wondrous Masterpiece of Assembled Knowledge (aka Frequently-Asked Questions list).
&#39;Tis edited, and maintained, by myself, Pamela Korda, based upon discussion of the Wheel of Time series, on
the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan.  This version of the FAQ contains lots of SPOILERS for
all books of <CITE>The Wheel of Time</CITE>, up to and including book 7, <CITE>A Crown Of Swords</CITE>, so if
you haven&#39;t read, don&#39;t read. There are versions of the FAQ from before <CITE>ACoS</CITE> (i.e. no spoilers, but some
out-dated theories) in the ftp archive and the WWW page.
</P>
<P>
Please note that this document makes no claims as to the actual truth of any of the speculations in it.
(Individual authors, on the other hand, do.) It exists to chronicle, in an organized fashion, the discussions
on popular topics in the newsgroup. You should read it because it will give you an idea of what has been said
before by many people. Chances are, if you want to know what people think about a given theory, it&#39;s in here.
So, read before you post; it will help you make your post more interesting and persuasive. (If you simply ask
a question in the FAQ, chances are that people will just refer you to this document, anyway, instead of
discussing the same ol&#39; stuff again.)
</P>
<P>
This version of the WOT FAQ (v. 4.0) has been updated to include information and theories from <CITE>A Crown of
Swords</CITE>. Please note that this is NOT a final <CITE>ACOS</CITE> version; there is much fine-tuning to be done. In
addition, there is some stuff on "old" topics that I haven&#39;t gotten around to including or updating. I hope to
do this in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make space for new stuff, I have removed several old sections. The timeline is permanently out: An
excellent timeline, created and maintained by Emma Pease, can be found at 
<a HREF="http://kanpai.stanford.edu/users/emma/jordan-timeline.html">http://kanpai.stanford.edu/users/emma/jordan-timeline.html</a>.
</P>
<P>
I have also moved the cover art commentary to a separate document; it can be found at 
<a HREF="http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/kor2/WOT/cover_art.html">http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/kor2/WOT/cover_art.html</a>.
</P>
<P>
The "Loose Plot Threads" section has gotten to be too much for me to handle, so I ditched it. If anybody
wishes to take over its maintenance, mail me, and I&#39;ll send you the last version of it.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these removals, I have NOT renumbered the sections, since I am considering breaking up the
super-sections 1 and 2.
