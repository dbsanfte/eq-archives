<H1>Who will draw Callandor from the Stone?  Will it be Logain?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="DrawCallandor.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The "Into the heart" prophecy (see <a HREF="">section 7.3</a>), suggests that maybe
somebody besides Rand is going to remove the Callandor from the Stone:<BR>
"Who draws it out shall follow after".
</P>
<P>
Maybe Logain (his future glory)? Now that he is un-gentled and at large,
he might end up with the Sword That Ain't. Even though somebody
(Moiraine?) said that Logain would be burnt to a crisp trying to control
the sa'angreal, we know by now that AS don't know everything.  Eg's dream
of a dark young man holding something glowing (<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes,
203</CITE>) <EM>could</EM> refer to Logain and Callandor.
</P>
<P>
Another idea is that somebody using Mat's medallion could get the sword,
because the Power traps would not affect them. Along these lines,
somebody may be able to reproduce the effects of the medallion somehow,
and thereby get the Sword. Yet another idea is that somebody could
physically dig Callandor out, although I dunno how easy it would be to
dig a hole into the Stone of Tear. Maybe use fireworks &#224; la Mat in <CITE>The Dragon Reborn</CITE>?
</P>
<P>
Finally, Callandor might just sit there until the Fourth Age incarnation
of the Dragon comes along.
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>LoC: 32, Summoned in Haste, 453</CITE>):<BR> Rand thinks about how he modified
his traps after learning to invert weaves, and makes reference to
somebody besides himself drawing the sword and "following after."
