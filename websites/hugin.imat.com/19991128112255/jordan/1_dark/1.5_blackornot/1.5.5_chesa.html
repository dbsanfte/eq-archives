<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">1.5.5: Is Chesa a Darkfriend?</h1>
<hr>
Why would anybody think Egwene's maid, Chesa, was a servant of the Shadow?
<P>
First, it is very suspicious that Halima killed Meri and Selame, but not
Chesa. The result of this is that Chesa now waits on Egwene 'round the
clock. Meri and Selame were appointed by Romanda and Lelaine [ACOS: 8, The
Figurehead, 160], and they were most likely spying on Eg for those Sitters.
The conclusion that immediately springs to mind is that Chesa is also a
spy, and that Halima killed the other two maids so that Chesa's spying
could be more effective. This implies that Halima (a.k.a. Aran'gar,
a.k.a. Balthamel) has an interest in Chesa's spying, or works for somebody
who does (Moridin or Shaidar Haran).
<P>
Furthermore, Chesa was apparently appointed to be Egwene's maid by Sheriam:
"Sheriam might have chosen [Chesa], but she was the Amyrlin Seat's maid."
[LOC: 36, The Amyrlin is Raised, 479], and "Chesa was a gift from Sheriam."
[ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 186]. As we know from [TPOD, 16, Unexpected
Absences, 345], Sheriam (who may be Black herself) is being controlled by
somebody (probably) of the Dark persuasion. So, it is certainly
conceivable that either 1) Sheriam was ordered to choose Chesa by her
controller, and Chesa reports to that mysterious person, or 2) Sheriam
chose Chesa to be her own spy, and pass Chesa's info on to her controller.
Either way, it fits together well.
<P>
However, there are other, less obvious ways to interpret these data. With
respect to the murders, it's possible that Meri and Selame were removed to
eliminate whatever (poor) information they were giving to Romanda and
Lelaine. If Chesa is just a maid and not a spy, there would be no reason
to kill her. As for the connection with Sheriam, there may be some
confusion about that. While Egwene thinks <em>twice</em>, in different
books, that Sheriam assigned Chesa to her, Anaiya may have had something to
do with it, too: 'Anaiya said, "We need to let her sleep. Tomorrow is
almost as important as tonight was, child." Abruptly she laughed to
herself softly. "Mother....We will send Chesa to help you get ready for
bed."' [LOC: 36, The Amyrlin is Raised, 478] This is right after Eg arrives
in Salidar. It <em>sounds</em> as if Anaiya is the one choosing Chesa to
be Eg's maid. This can be resolved in two different ways: 1) Anaiya sent
Chesa to Eg on the first night as a temporary measure, and Sheriam decided
to make it a permanent appointment, or 2) Sheriam chose Chesa before Eg got
to Salidar, and Anaiya was just suggesting that the pre-appointed servant
go take care of Eg. Finally, there is one piece of evidence which
contradicts the idea that Chesa is a spy for Sheriam. In [ACOS: 8, The
Figurehead, 159], Egwene thinks, "[Sheriam] did not understand why Egwene
let her maid be present at these meetings, much less let her chatter away
freely." This indicates that Sheriam has expressed disapproval of Eg's
habit of letting Chesa be present at meetings where secret stuff is being
discussed. If Chesa was spying for Sheriam, Sheriam would not discourage
this practice. However, this consideration doesn't rule out the
possibility that Sheriam is being forced to work against Eg, and is trying
to protect Egwene by discouraging her from having Chesa around all the
time.
<P>
Another reason to be suspicious of Chesa is the way she is presented. As
she <em>appears</em>, Chesa is pretty dim-witted. Always chattering
inanely about not eating too fast, dressing warmly, and washing behind
one's ears, she's a caricature of a stupid servant. It's hard to believe
that the woman is as simple-minded as she acts around Egwene. In fact,
Egwene is always thinking about how great Chesa is, how "simple" and
"refreshing." Would RJ be pushing this so strongly if she was
<em>actually</em> a simple-minded serving woman?
