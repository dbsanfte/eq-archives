<H1>Why isn't Moiraine dead?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="MoirAlive.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Well, we don't know what happened after Moiraine and Lanfear fell
through the twisted doorway into the land of the Foxes.  Lacking such
information, the only evidence we have is:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The breaking of Lan's bond, suggesting that she is no longer among the living
<LI>Egwene's vision of Thom pulling Moiraine's blue jewel out of a fire.  (<CITE>TFoH: 15, 300-1, What Can Be
Learned in Dreams, 214</CITE>)
<LI>Min's comment in (<CITE>ACOS 35, Into the Woods, 543</CITE>) that Rand would fail without "a woman
who was dead and gone", which almost certainly refers to Moir.
<LI>Min's comment on the next page (<CITE>ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 546</CITE>) that "Moiraine was the only
viewing of hers that had ever failed."
</UL>
<P>
She must have had one or more viewings about Moir. that were not fulfilled, and,
since <em>we</em> know that Min is never wrong, then Moir. will almost
certainly return at some point. The breaking of Lan's bond was
probably caused by the shutting off of the Red Door into
*finnland. Another suggestion is that Moir. was stilled during her
fight, and that is what caused the bond to break.
</P>
<P>
Ruchira Datta says: "One of you would have been bad enough, but two
<EM>ta'veren</EM> at once - you might have torn the connection entirely and
been trapped there." (<CITE>TSR: 15, 255, Into the Doorway, 178-9</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
This quotation is the basis for one of the currently held versions of the possible fate of Moiraine and Lanfear;
just substitute "channeling combatants" for "ta'veren".
</P>
<P>
More interpretation on Eg's "blue stone" vision:<BR>
<P>
Michael Steeves suggests that it could possibly mean that Thom will do something to preserve her dream of
Rand facing the DO alive and well at Tarmon Gai'don.
</P>
<P>
"She vanished into a ter'angreal in Cairhien while battling Lanfear, apparently killing both herself and the
Forsaken." (<CITE>LoC: Glossary, entry "Moiraine", 710</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
That "apparently" definitely leaves the question open.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, she has a "small shred of hope" before attacking Lanfear, so there <em>is</em> hope for her future.
</P>
