<H1>What is the difference between skimming and traveling?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: P. Korda, John Novak</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Skimming requires knowledge of destination and Traveling requires origin (<CITE>TFoH: 6, 169, Gateways,
121</CITE>).  For example, Aviendha Travels to Seanchan which she obviously doesn't know a thing about, but
she knew the bathroom real well.
</P>
<P>
Skimming is what Rand does in <CITE>TSR, 58, The Traps of Rhuidean, pp670-671</CITE> to chase Asmodean to
Rhuidean, and in <CITE>TFoH, 54, To Caemlyn, pp645-646 </CITE> to bring the Aiel strike force to Caemlyn. It
apparently works by creating a tunnel through some other space from the point you are at to the point where
you want to go. Going through this tunnel takes a finite amount of time, and one person can chase another
through it, as Rand chased Asmodean.  Asmodean later tells Rand that Skimming requires a good knowledge of the
destination point (<CITE>ACoS,9, A Pair of Silverpike, p175</CITE>).
</P>
<P>
The above "chasing" thing contradicts something Egwene says about it in <CITE>ACOS: 12, A Morning of Victory,
241</CITE>: "If two sisters wove gateways on the same spot only moments apart, aiming to Skim to the same
place, they would not see one another, not unless it was _exactly_ the same spot, with the weaves _exactly_
identical." So, either this is a difference between men's skimming and women's, or RJ messed up. The Skimming
place has some similarity to TAR, and may be a part of TAR. (<CITE>ACOS: 12, A Morning of Victory,
240</CITE>).

Travelling is a far simpler, far more direct, far quicker means of transport.  Travelling opens a "gate" from
one physical point to another.  Men do this by boring a hole in the Pattern, so to speak, while women do this
by making the Pattern in both locations identical (<CITE>LoC, 37, When Battle Begins, p491</CITE>).  Moghedien
and Rand are of the opinion that using the wrong method would be catastrophically bad. Stepping through the
gate, one instantly changes location.  Asmodean tells Rand that, unlike Skimming, Gating requires only a
knowledge of the starting point (<CITE>TFoH, 6, Gateways, p121</CITE>).
</P>
<P>
Now, it's been suggested that what the 3rd Age Randlanders call "Travelling" is not the same thing as the
old-time, AOL Travelling. The only evidence to support this theory is the manner in which Ish manifests
himself in the TEOTW prologue. He kind of shimmerred and appeared -- no mention of a "gate" or a doorway.
We've not seen anybody else do this, though; all of the other Forsaken use the standard Gate method.  This
"other" way of Travelling may involve the TP; we know that Ishy used it extensively. It is possible to do a
Travelling-like thing with the TP, by "stepping outside the Pattern," as the Watcher does (<CITE>ACOS: 20,
Patterns Within Patterns, 358</CITE>).
