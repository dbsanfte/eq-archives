<H1>Jain Farstrider: Where is he now?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="JainFarstrider.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>

<P>
Jain seems to have a cult following among the Jordanites.
"Jain lives!" they proclaim.  So, as promised, here is a list of all
the suspects in "who is Jain in disguise" contest.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Elyas Machera. Both Borderlanders; Elyas is pretty old.
<LI>Tam al'Thor. (It is very unlikely that Tam=Jain. Malkier fell a little less than 50 years before <CITE>TEotW</CITE> (say 45-50 years),
according to Lord Agelmar (<CITE>TEotW: 47, 708, More Tales of the Wheel, 595</CITE>). At the time, Jain was a
young man, say between 17 and 20. Thus,at the start of <CITE>TEotW</CITE>, Jain would be 62-70 years old. I would put Tam
at 50, tops, probably younger. definitely not older than 60.) Plus, RJ has said that Tam spent his time away
from the Two Rivers in Illian, which precludes his running around the Borderlands and the Blight.  At a signing
in Atlanta, RJ said that Tam and Rand were originally the same character -- a soldier come home to a small town.
This pretty much precludes his being Farstrider, no?
<LI>Graendal's old man in wrinkled coat. (This is more likely the Domani king she displaced, or that famous
general she has working for her.)
<LI>Bayle Domon, because he seems to be very well traveled and likes to collect old things, and his talk to
Mat about it being "the strangeness you see that pulls you to the next horizon." (<CITE>TEotW: 24, 356-7,
Flight Down the Arinelle, 300</CITE>).
<LI>The befuddled old guy we see spying on Carridin in <CITE>ACoS: 18, The Triumph of Logic, 318</CITE>. (See
<a HREF="Geezer.html">section 1.24</a>)
</UL>
<P>
I cannot think of any more, offhand, although I know there are many more.
