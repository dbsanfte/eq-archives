<h2>From <CITE>The Eye of the World</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TEOTW: 13, Choices, 158-159]
<P>
Thom in conversation:
<blockquote>
One of the Prophecies says that the Stone of Tear will never fall
until the People of the Dragon come to the Stone. Another says the
Stone will never fall till the Sword that Cannot Be Touched is wielded
by the Dragon's hand.
</blockquote>
This has been fulfilled. The People of the Dragon are the Aiel, who
attacked the Stone of Tear the night Rand broke in and took Callandor.

<h2>From <CITE>The Great Hunt</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TGH Header Prophecy]
<blockquote>
And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered,
and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the DO shall
once more lay his hand upon the world of man. Women shall weep and men
quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth. Neither
shall anything stand nor abide...<P>
Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow...and there shall be
wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth. In sackcloth and ashes
shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again by his
coming, tearing apart all ties that bind. Like the unfettered
dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn
confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall
give us the Light. Let tears flow, O ye people of the world. Weep
for your salvation.
</blockquote>
This is pretty general stuff. Great upheavals will come to the world when
the time for the Last Battle nears, yadda yadda. This is all obviously
happening right now; Rand is "breaking the world" figuratively, by
causing all sorts of social unrest. "His blood shall give us the Light (at
the Last Battle)" is reminiscent of Min's viewing of "black rocks, red with
blood," and of the "Twice dawns the day" prophecy, below.

[TGH: 22, Watchers, 275]
<P>
Vandene talking to Moiraine:
<blockquote>
Five ride forth, and four return. Above the watchers shall he
proclaim himself, bannered cross the sky in fire...
</blockquote>
This has been fulfilled; it refers to the events at Falme at the end of
TGH. The five who rode forth were Ingtar, Hurin, Rand, Mat, and Perrin. Rand
proclaimed himself the DR after the battle at Falme, where he and Ish
fought in the sky.

[TGH: 26, Discord, 325-6], [TSR: 9, Decisions, 126]
<P>
Thom to Rand:
<blockquote>
Twice and twice shall he be marked, twice to live, and twice to die,
<BR>
Once the heron to set his path. Twice the heron, to name him true.
<BR>
Once the Dragon for remembrance lost. Twice the Dragon for the
price he must pay.
</blockquote>
The Dragon will be marked in four ways, with two herons and two dragons.
He got the first heron in the Portal Stone world. The second heron was
received at Falme, when he named himself the Dragon Reborn. The two
dragons were received at Rhuidean; the "remembrance lost" refers to the
lost history of the Aiel. The significance of the second Dragon, wrt
"the price he must pay" has not been revealed.

[TGH: 26, Discord, 326]
<P>
Thom to Rand:
<blockquote>
Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.<BR>
Once for mourning, once for birth. <BR>
Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rock of Shayol Ghul.<BR>
In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow. <BR>
</blockquote>
"Twice dawns the day" may indicate that there will be an eclipse when
Rand's blood is shed. Compare this to the Greeting from the the Amyrlin
ceremony when Siuan Sanche arrives in Fal Dara in [TGH: 2, The Welcome,17]:
"Against what do we guard?" "The shadow at noon." The second line may
indicate that Rand will die and be resurrected, or maybe just that he will
die, and the world will be reborn. The fragment ends with yet another
reference to Rand's blood being necessary to defeat the DO.

<h2>From <CITE>The Dragon Reborn</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TDR: Header Prophecy]
<blockquote>
And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his name, for he shall
be born among us many times, in many guises, as he has been and ever
will be, time without end. His coming shall be like the sharp edge of
the plow, turning our lives in furrows from out of the places where we
lie in our silence. The breaker of bonds; the forger of chains. The
maker of futures; the unshaper of destiny.
</blockquote>
Again, pretty general stuff. Rand is breaking bonds, etc.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TDR: 6, The Hunt Begins, 57]
<P>
Moiraine in conversation, listing bits of the Karaethon Cycle:
<blockquote>
He has yet to break the nations, or shatter the world.... What does
it mean that he shall 'slay his people people with the sword of peace,
and destroy them with the leaf'? What does it mean that he shall bind
the nine moons to serve him? There are others. What 'wound of
madness and cutting of hope' has he healed? What chains has he
broken, and who put into chains?
</blockquote>
The breaking of nations is well underway. The bit about slaying his
people with the sword of peace, etc, refers to the Aiel--by revealing the
peaceful past of the Aiel, he changed them forever, and set them on the
road to the destruction from which only a 'remnant of a remnant' will
survive. "Nine Moons" is a reference to the Seanchan, and so this
indicates that the Seanchan will eventually come under Rand's control. I
don't know what the "wound of madness" is, although it may refer to the
Taint. The breaking of chains could refer to many things, e.g. the
chains binding people to the Shadow (Ingtar, Asmo, Tear, Andor). It's
also been suggested that this refers to the possibility of Rand freeing
the Seanchan damane and other slaves. Rand has put people in figurative
chains, as well--Asmodean, the Dragonsworn AS, all the nations he is
conquering.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TDR: 41, Threads in the Pattern, 373]
<blockquote>
On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born of a maiden
wedded to no man.
</blockquote>
Shaiel, a.k.a. Tigraine, a.k.a. Rand's birth mum, was a Maiden of the
spear, who do not wed. (Technically, maybe she was wedded to
Taringail, but I guess running off into the Aiel Waste counted as a
divorce.)
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<a name="tsr"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>The Shadow Rising</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TSR: 3, Reflection, 71]
<blockquote>
His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, washing away
the Shadow, sacrifice for man's salvation.
</blockquote>
Yet another reference to blood on the rocks.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TSR: 6, Doorways, 93]
<blockquote>
Power of the Shadow made human flesh,<BR>
wakened to turmoil, strife and ruin. <BR>
The Reborn One, marked and bleeding,<BR>
dances the sword in dreams and mist,<BR>
chains the Shadowsworn to his will,<BR>
from the city, lost and forsaken, <BR>
leads the spears to war once more,<BR>
breaks the spears and makes them see, <BR>
truth long hidden in the ancient dream.<BR>
</blockquote>
The "Power of the Shadow made human flesh" could refer to any number of
things--the Forsaken, Fain, Slayer, or the Bubble of Evil at the start of
TSR. "Dances the sword in dreams and mist" could be a reference to the
mirror incident in the Stone in TSR. Rand has chained the Shadowsworn, in
the person of Asmodean. He leads the Aiel spears to war, and has also
revealed the truth of Aiel history, which has resulted in many Aiel
breaking their spears and running off bonkers.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TSR: 21, Into the Heart, 244]
<blockquote>
Into the heart he thrusts his sword,<BR>
into the heart, to hold their hearts.<BR>
Who draws it out shall follow after, <BR>
What hand can grasp that fearful blade?<BR>
</blockquote>
Rand stuck the Sword Which is Not (Callandor) into the floor of the Heart
of the Stone, partly as a reminder to the lords of Tear that he was the
ruler of their country. The last two lines seem to indicate that somebody
other than Rand will remove Callandor from the Stone. Indeed, this
happened; Narishma fetched it for Rand in TPOD.

<h2>From <CITE>The Fires of Heaven</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TFOH: Header Prophecy]
<blockquote>
With his coming are the dread fires born again. The hills burn, and
the land turns sere. The tides of men run out, and the hours dwindle.
The wall is pierced, and the veil of parting raised. Storms rumble
beyond the horizon, and the fires of heaven purge the earth. There is
no salvation without destruction, no hope this side of death.
</blockquote>
The drying and burning are surely a reference to the drought and hot
weather which was going on in Randland until the Bowl of the Winds was
used. The piercing of the wall, and the raising of the veil may refer to
the DO breaking loose. That phrase calls to mind a phrase from the Bible.
This is discussed more thoroughly in Section 3.
</P>

<h2>From <CITE>Lord of Chaos</CITE></h2>
<P>
[LoC: Trailer Prophecy]
<blockquote>
The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign. The
seas rage, and stormclouds gather unseen. Beyond the horizon, hidden
fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom. What was exalted is
cast down; what was cast down is raised up. Order burns to clear his
path.
</blockquote>
The first sentence is fulfilled: the Tower is broken, and some AS have
knelt and sworn fealty to Rand (whose sign is the "forgotten" ancient AS
symbol). The second sentence indicates that all is not well. Something
is rotten in Randland. People are not what they seem. The serpents in
the bosom could be Taim and Halima, among others. The last sentence
indicates the uncertain nature of the world. It could be referring to
the AS and male channellers specifically, but there is more casting down
and raising up than that going on.

<h2>From <CITE>A Crown of Swords</CITE></h2>
<P>
[ACOS: Header Prophecy]
<blockquote>
There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow, for the land is
one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land. Soul of fire,
heart of stone, in pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield. He
calls upon the mountains to kneel, and the seas to give way, and the
very skies to bow. Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears, and
the soul of fire, love. (From a much-disputed translation of <CITE>The
Prophecies of the Dragon</CITE> by the poet Kyera Termendal, of Shiota,
believed to have been published between FY700 and FY800)
</blockquote>
This is a clear reference to Rand's increasing self-isolation, hubris, etc.
Also note the 'Dragon is one with the land' stuff matches the Fisher King
legend/reference (see section 3.8).
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS 34, Ta'veren, p533]
<P>
Rand's thoughts:
<blockquote>
The Prophecies said he would bind together the people of every
land--"The north shall he tie to the east, and the west shall be bound
to the south."
</blockquote>
Rand's interpretation: all the world will follow him. Alternative
interpretation: Rand will hold the north and east; the Seanchan will hold
the west and south. This seems more likely, at least for the present.
It also agrees with Nicola's Foretelling ("the land divided by the
return").
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: Trailer Prophecy]
<blockquote>
Master of the lightnings, rider on the storm, wearer of a crown of
swords, spinner-out of fate. Who thinks he turns the Wheel of Time,
may learn the truth too late. (From a fragmentary translation of _The
Prophecies of the Dragon_, attributed to Lord Mangore Kiramin,
Sword-bard of Aramaelle and Warder to Caraighan Maconar, into what was
then called the vulgar tongue (circa 300 AB))
</blockquote>
Similar in tone and meaning to the ACOS header prophecy, indicating that
Rand's pride may cause some big trouble.
