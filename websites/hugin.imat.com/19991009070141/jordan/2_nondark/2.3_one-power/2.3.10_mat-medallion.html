<HR>
<P>
When Elayne tries to use the Power on Mat in [LoC: 38, A Sudden Chill,
504], she describes the effect as "The flows just...vanished." It seems
that the medallion works by dissolving or destroying Power Flows. At
Balticon 30 (April 1996), RJ said that the medallion only works on direct
weavings of the Power (both saidin and saidar) flows against the wearer.
Evidence that the medallion protects against saidin comes from [LOC: 44,
The Color of Trust, 554]: Halima/Aran'gar channels at Mat and the medallion
activates. Halima, being a male soul recycled into a woman's body,
channels saidin.
<P>
Indirect effects of the Power, such as picking up a rock with Air and
throwing it, or lightning (lightning was mentioned by RJ as a specific
example), are not blocked. Thus, failure of the medallion to protect
against the lightning strike at the end of TFOH can be explained. Rand's
belief that the medallion didn't protect Mat from a man's channelling was
in error.
