<P align="center">[Written by P.Korda. Contributors: Bill

<hr>
<P>
So, is the Mazrim Taim who appears in LoC the real Mazrim Taim, the
Saldaean False Dragon, or is he the Forsaken Demandred in disguise?
<P>
Here, MT=the character who appears in LoC, general of the Asha'man.
Taim=the False Dragon we heard about first in TGH, captured after Falme.
Demandred=the Forsaken.
<P>
<H2>How could MT be Demandred?</H2>
The idea is that the BA, or a Forsaken, or some Trollocs, broke Taim free
from where he was being held in Saldaea. They took him to Semirhage, or
someone else who could extract every bit of information from his skull (a
la the AS Cabriana who Semirhage tortures) and drained him dry. Then they
killed him. Demandred either 1) Looks kind of like Taim in the first
place, or 2) Looks very different from Taim and is using an illusion (or
maybe some kind of partial illusion) to look like the real Taim. This is
why Bashere isn't sure that MT is Taim, and why MT says that he shaved his
beard. This also explains why it is MT who brings up the things only he
and Bashere know--to convince everybody that he <em>is</em> Taim.
<P>
Then again, MT may really be the original Mazrim Taim. The reason
we think of Demandred when we see him is not because he <em>is</em>
Demandred, but because he is similar to Demandred in personality--he
wanted to be the Dragon, he doesn't like being second-best, etc. Taim
could have the ultimate plan of supporting Rand as much as he can,
helping him to win the Last Battle. Since Rand is expected to die in
the Last Battle, Taim plans to bide his time and take control in the
aftermath. After that, well, as MT says, the winners write the
histories.
<P>
Finally, there is the possibility that there never was a "real" Taim;
only Demandred. The first mention of Taim is at the beginning of TGH
[TGH: 5, The Shadow in Shienar, 55], and "trouble in Saldaea" is
mentioned in TEOTW. At that point, at least some of the other Forsaken
are loose, so it is possible that Demandred was, too. We don't know
enough about the timing of events to decide for sure.
<P>
<h2>Arguments in favor of MT being Demandred</h2>
Now, we will present the arguments for the "Taimandred" theory, and
counterarguments.
<P>
<strong>1) MT knows too much</STRONG>: knowing how to test for channelling
ability, how quickly he "learns" gateways, how well he teaches the
Asha'man, etc. It's a little hard to believe that he figured all this out
on his very own. Look at how much trouble Rand had learning before he got
Asm as a proper teacher.
<P>
Counter-argument: He's supposedly been channelling for 15 years. He had to
have learned <em>something</em> in that time. Plus, MT mentions to Bashere
that he used Compulsion on two people [LoC: 2, A New Arrival, 76]. Since
the real Taim did that, the real Taim DID know stuff. (Note that this does
not apply if Demandred was always MT.) As for Gateways, maybe Taim is just
a fast learner, like Rand, or Nynaeve. In fact, one's ease of learning
seems to be a direct function of how strong one is in the Power.
(examples: Rand, Ny, El, Eg are all fast learners, and even SS and
Moiraine, who are stronger than your average bear, spent a relatively short
time as Novices (3 years?).) This probably has to do with the fact that,
the stronger you are, the easier it is for you to see the flows required
for a particular action, and thus can more readily duplicate it. (Note
that that doesn't explain Taim's learning curve; he wouldn't have had
anybody to observe and learn FROM.)
<P>
<strong>2) The Seal</strong>. The story about finding it in a Saldaean
farmer's house is pretty fishy. Could it be that Demandred (posing as
Taim) gave it to Rand in order to try to gain his trust?
<P>
Counter-argument: If MT is Demandred, why would he, and the DO, give a seal
to Rand? If the minions of the Shadow had a seal, wouldn't they break it?
Maybe the DO could predict that Rand/LTT would try to break the seal, but
Demandred couldn't have. MT was certainly shocked when it looked like Rand
was going to smash it [LoC: 2, A New Arrival, 80-1]. As mentioned, it
could be that Demandred would want to give it to Rand to get him to trust
him, but that failed utterly. MT's seal story is somewhat backed by
Bashere's story to Perrin about a farmer in Saldaea who claimed to be the
descendant of the kings of an ancient Kingdom. If MT Farmer == Bashere Farmer
it would be plausible that the seal was the last item of inheritance. And
who better for the farmer to give it to than the Dragon Reborn (MT's claim
before Rand declared himself)?
<P>
Rebuttal: It could be that Taim was shocked when Rand looked like he was
going to break the Seal because he was worried that Rand was already
totally gone. It's clear that the DO has plans for Rand, and that the DO
told Demandred something about a plan for Rand (not necessarily the REAL
plan) in the "Let the Lord of Chaos rule" speech, and that Demandred liked
it. If Rand was too loony to perform his role, Demandred would be worried.
As for why he gave the Seal to Rand in the first place, why not? The seals
have been steadily weakening, and will break on their own in time. Why not
give the seal to Rand in an attempt to gain his trust?
<P>
<STRONG>3) MT claims to not be affected by the Taint</STRONG>, after (Rand
estimates) 15 years of channelling [LoC: 2, A New Arrival, 76]. This seems
pretty unlikely. Consider Owyn, who was going mad after only 3 years of
hardly ever channelling at all. Many of the Asha'man have a few screws
loose after only a few months of intensive channeling. The only Taint
protection we know of is linking to the DO. Plus, the Red Ajah seems pretty
adept at tracking down male channellers. In 15 years, one would have
thought that the AS would have heard of him long before they did.
<P>
Counter-argument: Unless Taim was a raving lunatic when he was leading his
armies as a False Dragon, he must have still been somewhat sane, even after
15 years. (Again, note that if MT was always Dem, this does not apply.)
Same argument applies for him not getting caught by the Reds. Plus,
Logain, who is not a Forsaken, has been channelling for about six years
(minus about a year or so of being gentled), and isn't going mad. It seems
likely that the ease with which one succumbs to the Taint varies widely
with the person. Owyn went under in 3 years, MT mentions some other guys
who lasted for 2 years [LoC: 2, A New Arrival, 79], and Logain has lasted
for 6 [LOC: 51, The Taking, 647].
<P>
<STRONG>3.5) More on Taim's age</STRONG>: Rand estimates Taim's age as 35,
or a few years older [LoC: 2, A New Arrival, 76]. However, Rand doesn't
know about the "slowing" effect of using the OP. According to RJ, a man
with the spark doesn't slow until 25, usually closer to thirty. He says
one can go past thirty, but that probably depends on how early they start
channelling and how much they channel [Post-TPOD Signing, New York, 20
October, 1998, report by Ryan R.]. Thus, the only way Taim could be the
age he looks is if he started channelling at an unusually late age, and
didn't channel much for the first few years. Since, if he's legit, he'd
have to be a wilder, he must have started channelling young, at around
Rand's age. The depth of his knowledge of channelling, and his career as a
False Dragon demonstrate that he must have channelled a great deal prior to
his arrival in Caemlyn. Therefore, Taim must be even older than 35. Let's
postulate that men slow at a rate similar to women. We know that Garenia
ran away from the Tower 70 years ago, and presumably she slowed before
then, or soon afterwards (in her early 20s, as is usual for women).
Garenia looks like she is Nynaeve's age, around 26. That corresponds to
about five years of physical aging in 70 years. Now, if Taim started
slowing at 30, then his actual age should be around 100 or so. Thus, the
problem of Taim's age is even more extreme than it first appears.
<P>
Counter-argument: The same type of arguments apply as discussed above.
Maybe Taim is miraculously immune to the Taint. Also, maybe Rand
overestimated Taim's age; maybe he's only thirty or so, in which case he
needn't have begun slowing noticeably yet.
<P>
<STRONG>4) MT's reaction to Rand's badges and awards:</STRONG> he's not
pleased to be seen as subservient to Rand [LoC: 42, The Black Tower, 543],
just like Demandred [LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 56-7].
<P>
Counter-argument: It is entirely possible that Taim is just plain arrogant.
Nothing says the Forsaken have a monopoly on excessive pride.
<P>
<STRONG>5) LTT</STRONG> often raves about Demandred, and killing him, every
time MT is around. Is there a method in his madness? LTT raves, "Sammael,
oh, yes, but Demandred first. First of all I rid myself of him, then
Sammael." [LoC: 51, The Taking, 635] LTT and Rand know where Sammael
is. But why does LTT insist on killing Demandred if he doesn't
know where he is? Therefore, they <EM>do</EM> know where Demandred is;
i.e., he's MT. [Dash W.]
<P>
Counter-argument: Again, it could just be that Taim is similar to Demandred
in many ways, and LTT thinks he will betray him like Demandred did in the
AoL. Anyway, LTT is loony and wants to kill <em>all</em> male channellers
[ACOS: 7, Pitfalls and Tripwires, 139]. Furthermore, one shouldn't take
anything LTT says too seriously. He's a total loon. He wants to die
forever and end his suffering [LoC: 18, A Taste of Solitude, 299], but he
doesn't want to die [LoC: 46, Beyond the Gate, 560]. He says "trust no
one" and "the man who doesn't trust is dead" or words to that effect. LTT
could be confusing Taim and Demandred.
<P>
<STRONG>6) The epilogue</STRONG>: "Have I not done well, Great Lord?" The
DO's orders were to "Let the Lord of Chaos Rule," which seems to refer to
"sowing chaos" in general, and to promoting divisiveness among the enemies
of the Shadow. Demandred and Mesaana (and Semirhage) were working together
on a plot in LOC to "let the Lord of Chaos rule." One of the main plot
threads in LOC was the interactions of Rand with the SAS and TAS embassies.
Rand ended up getting kidnapped by the TAS, and was rescued with the
assistance of the Asha'man. The events of the battle to free Rand led to a
great deal of mistrust and enmity among the SAS embassy, the TAS, the Aiel
who follow Rand, the Shaido, and the Asha'man. The current state of
affairs among Rand's allies (his Aiel, the Asha'man) and potential allies
(the TAS and SAS) can only be good for the Shadow. We know that Mesaana
was central to setting up this situation, from her place in the WT.
Assuming Demandred had a hand in it as well (as is implied by his visit to
SG at the end of the book), the most logical place for Demandred to be,
among those factions, is the AM.
<P>
Counter-argument: From Sammael's speech with Graendal [LoC: 6, Threads
Woven of Shadow, 135], we know that Demandred may be involved in the
Seanchan invasion in Tarabon. Maybe this has something to do with it.
Furthermore, if Demandred is MT and is also involved with the Seanchan,
wouldn't it be necessary for him to "disappear" from the farm in order to
manage his other project? Nobody's mentioned anything about MT vanishing.
Finally, if the final mess in LOC was set up by Dem, Sem, and Mesaana,
what was Semirhage's role?
<P>
<STRONG>7) MT kills the Gray Man.</STRONG> If he hadn't, Rand might have
gotten information out of it. Alternatively, it could've been a set-up:
Taimandred ordered the Gray Man, and killed him to "prove" his loyalty to
Rand.
<P>
Counter-argument: It's doubtful Rand could get much information from a Gray
Man. The Gray Men have no souls--they're basically walking killing
machines. They probably have some sort of self-destruct mechanism, too.
Jared Samet remarks: "If I were designing a perfect assassin, I'd set him
up so that he could never point the finger at me. Remember, the Gray Man
who comes after Nynaeve in the Tower has a knife in him the moment they
find him. Besides, the Gray Man could only tell Rand anything damaging to
MT if Demandred had sent him (possible I suppose, but why can't Demandred
do it himself if thats what the DO wants?) A Gray Man with a story
implicating Sammael or some other Forsaken (easy enough for a channeller to
set up) could help MT more than a dead one." As for how conveniently MT
showed up, recall that strange and oddly convenient things happen around
Rand all the time.
<P>
<STRONG>8) MT's remark on "These so-called Aiel".</STRONG> If he hadn't
been around in the AoL, why are they "so-called"? [LoC: 11, Lessons and
Teachers, 215] The only other person to use this (exact same)
phrase is Moridin (who used to be Ishamael) in [ACOS: 20, Patterns Within
Patterns, 356]. Only somebody from the AOL would have cause to call the
modern Aiel "so-called."
<P>
Counter-argument: This is the hardest piece of evidence to explain away.
People have suggested rationalizations, though. For example, if Taim knew
the old tongue, he might be simply saying that he doubts the Aiel are truly
"dedicated" to Rand. Another possible explanation is that, if Taim is
about 35, which seems reasonable, then he was alive for the Aiel War,
although possibly too young to go east to fight. He probably heard tales
about Aiel--10 feet tall, breathing fire, etc. Here he sees some in Caemlyn
peacefully patrolling the streets. Not what an average wetlander would
expect of Savages From the Waste.
<P>
Rebuttal: As to the first suggestion, it hardly seems in character to for
Taim to be making puns in the Old Tongue. As for the second, even if the
Aiel Taim meets aren't the monsters he's heard about, they are undeniably
Aiel. Nobody else in Randland regards them as "so-called."
<P>
<strong>8.5) Another Aiel reference.</strong> There is second suspicious
Taim quote about the Aiel. During the fight at Dumai's Wells, Taim has the
Asha'man raise a defensive barrier of Air around Rand's position. Many of
the people Perrin led from Caemlyn (Aiel fighters and WOs, Mayeners,
Cairhienin, and Two Rivers folk) are trapped outside, among the Shaido.
Rand asks Taim to lower the barrier, presumably so that the fighters could
be informed of Rand's safety, and an orderly retreat could begin. [LOC:
55, Dumai's Wells, 692-693] Taim argues against this, saying, "There are
casualties in battle. I lost several soldiers today, nine men who will be
harder to replace than any number of renegade Aiel." He is clearly talking
about Rand&sup1;s Aiel, not the Shaido. So why are they "renegade"? The only
convincing explanation that I see is that they are renegades against the
Way of the Leaf, the code of the Da&sup1;shain Aiel. [Fred Van Keuls]
<P>
This makes not one, but two instances in which Taim expresses doubts about
the legitimacy of the modern Aiel. In this case, in the middle of a heated
battle, there is no reason for Taim to doubt the "dedication" of the Aiel
to Rand's cause.
<P>
Counter-argument: Taim may be referring to the vast numbers of Shaido. As
far as each side's battle strength is concerned, it will be easier for the
Shaido to replace a few dozen or hundred spears than it will for Taim to
recruit and train nine men. [Matthew Heslin]
<P>
Rebuttal: The context of the above quote is that Taim is arguing against
raising the 'Dome of Air' to save Rand's Aiel, Mayeners and True Rivers
folk from the Shaido. He is saying that Rand's Aiel (outside the Dome) are
expendable compared to the Asha'man (inside the Dome). Given the
discussion before the quote, it seems highly unlikely to me that Taim could
be referring to the Shaido as the 'renegade Aiel'. I suppose one could
argue that Taim is confused about what is going on. However, Taim has
never given me that impression. [Fred Van Keuls]
<P>
<STRONG>9) Strength:</STRONG> MT is very strong in the Power.
Forsaken-class, even (almost as strong as Rand himself). [LoC: 3, A
Woman's Eyes, 92]
<P>
Counter-argument: The real Taim was thought to be very strong. [TSR: 5,
Questioners, 85] Just because he's strong doesn't mean he's evil. (And
just because he's evil, doesn't mean he's Forsaken.) Nynaeve is
Forsaken-class, but she's on the Good Guys' side.
<P>
<STRONG>10) Smile</STRONG>: In the prologue, it is said that Demandred
never smiles [LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 15], [LoC: Prologue, The
First Message, 58]. MT doesn't either-- at the end of LoC, before "Kneel,
or you will be knelt", Rand says something like "His expression was as
close to a smile as he had ever seen it." [LoC: 55, Dumai's Wells, 695]
<P>
Counter-argument: Once again, it could just be that Taim and Demandred have
similar personalities.
<P>
<STRONG>11) Min's viewing</strong>: of an invisible man holding a knife to
Rand's throat. This could indicate that Demandred is the "serpent in the
bosom," masquerading as Taim.
<P>
Counter-argument: The vision could be the Gray Man, as Rand thinks. Or, it
could be MT, who is not to be trusted, even if he isn't Demandred.
<P>
Rebuttal: Since when has Rand ever interpreted Min's visions correctly?
<P>
<STRONG>12) Location, Location, Location:</STRONG> Demandred takes a gateway
directly out of TAR while in the Royal palace in Caemlyn. Unless Demandred
knows some sort of combination traveling/leaving TAR gateway, then he must
be somebody, or pretending to be somebody who comes to Caemlyn
regularly, and somebody who can channel his way into the palace without
inviting immediate destruction upon himself. We know that MT has been
visiting Rand in Caemlyn because Rand's thoughts comment on how MT has
taught him to block out heat, and a few chapters later Rand tells MT that
his visits to the city would have to stop because Alanna and Verin have
shown up.
<P>
Counter-argument: Maybe he went out of TAR to someplace that was not
Caemlyn. Also, maybe Demandred is gutsy enough to enter into Rand's turf.
<P>
Rebuttal: We've never seen anybody enter/leave TAR in the flesh via any
means except gating to the spot in the real world corresponding to the spot
one is in in TAR. As for Dem blatantly entering into Rand's turf, it's not
likely that he'd do that unless he had a cover story-- too dangerous,
especially with Rand becoming more and more paranoid.
<P>
<STRONG>13) MT's behavior: </strong> Bill Garrett says: Something that
should maybe be added as a separate point is MT's whole challenge/submit
behavior. He'll argue with Rand about something, telling him it has to be
done another way, then suddenly he'll agree and say "As my Lord Dragon
commands." I think it's Demandred trying to do things <em>his</em> way,
but suddenly remembering the Dark One's orders to do what Rand says (or at
least to not go directly against him). And MT sometimes disobeys Rand and
frequently does things Rand doesn't expect, as with the Asha'man.
<P>
Counter-argument: How is this different from the way the Tairen lords
behaved? Or the Andoran nobility? Or Davram Bashere? Hell, even the Aiel
tend to do this. Everybody tries to convince Rand to do things their way,
but when you get right down to it, he's going to do as he damn well
pleases, and all you can say is "As my Lord Dragon commands."
<P>
<STRONG>14) Another slip of the tongue:</strong> When Rand shows MT how to
make a gateway, he calls it a "gateway." A little further in the same
chapter, MT says, "You can Travel, but you don't know how to test for the
talent." How does MT know that a Gateway = Traveling? AFAIK, Rand didn't
mention anything about "traveling," only "gateways."
<P>
Counter-argument: Maybe MT heard the term described during his 15 years as
channeller, and added 2 and 2 to make 4.
<P>
Rebuttal: Once more, this raises the question of <em>how</em> Taim got to
know so much about channelling, with (supposedly) nobody to teach him.
<P>
<STRONG>15) Sammael and Graendal in conversation</STRONG>: In [ACOS: 20,
Patterns Within Patterns, 355], Sammael and Graendal are discussing their
comrades. Sammael says, "I didn't arrange [Rand's] kidnapping....Mesaana
had a hand in it, though. Maybe Demandred and Semirhage as well, despite
how it ended...." Note the despite-- there is a strong implication here
that Sem and Dem somehow had a hand in the conclusion of the
Rand-kidnapping episode, i.e. in his rescue. Who was instrumental in the
rescue? Taim and the Asha'man, Perrin and the Two Riversians, the Wolves,
the Mayeners, and the Aiel. We all know that the most likely place for
Demandred is with the Asha'man, as their leader, in fact. Note that this
interpretation implies that Sam knows where Dem and Sem are situated. We
do not know that he knows this, in fact, as of [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of
Shadow, 138], Graendal doesn't know where they are. Of course, Sam could
have known, without telling Graendal, or they could always have discovered
it in the intervening time.
<P>
Counter-argument: A totally different spin can be put on the passage. As
Mark Loy explains, "To paraphrase...'I didn't arrange Rand's kidnapping...
Mesaana had a hand in <EM>arranging</EM> Rand's kidnapping... Maybe Dem and Sem
had a hand in <em>arranging</em> Rand's kidnapping as well, despite how the
<em>kidnapping</em> ended. This interpretation means that they might have
had a hand in arranging the kidnapping...in the planning..." despite the
fact that it ended all messed up.
<P>
<STRONG>16) Yet another slip of the tongue:</STRONG> MT has taken to
calling himself "The M'Hael," which means "leader" in the Old Tongue, and
giving OT designations to his lieutenants. MT knows an awful lot about
the Old Tongue for a modern-day Randlander.
<P>
Counter-argument: Well, maybe he does know the Old Tongue. Maybe he was a
scholar or something before he became a False Dragon. Of course, that is
pure speculation.
<P>
<STRONG>17) Black Tower:</STRONG> MT has pretty much built the Black
Tower on his own. Rand has made little effort to be involved in it, and
has left the recruiting, training, and testing of Asha'man to MT. MT, in
turn, has done a fine job-- in just a few months (between LOC and POD) he's
created an unconventional military force which can take on anybody in
Randland, including Aes Sedai and Seanchan. Just a handful of Asha'man have
proven to be the decisive factor in many battles, some of them against
opponents with channelling capability. So, we must ask ourselves, if MT is
so efficient at turning out combat channellers, why didn't he do it when
HE was claiming to be the Dragon Reborn? He claims to have tried training
other men to channel [LOC: 2, A New Arrival, 79], so the thought must have occurred to him.
Granted, since he lacked Rand's ta'veren-power to attract recruits, he
would have had a much smaller force than the 400 or so at the BT. However,
given that two or three percent of people can learn to channel [Guide:
2, The One Power and the True Source, 18], and that Taim's army of
followers was of a "normal" Randland size (on the order of a couple
thousand), he should have been able to get at least 10-20 men who could
have been useful. Even ten male channellers is nothing to sneeze at, and
yet Taim the False Dragon had no channelling followers. This can be
explained easily if one supposes that Taim did not have the knowledge to
identify and train channellers. MT is not Taim, but Demandred, who
certainly has all that knowledge. He told Rand the story about identifying
male channellers in an attempt to allay Rand's suspicions about MT knowing
how to do the test.
<P>
Counter-argument: There are other possible reasons Taim didn't train any
other channellers. Perhaps he didn't have time. Perhaps he was worried
that they'd turn against him. Perhaps when he saw his first experiments in
training go mad in two years or so [LOC: 2, A New Arrival, 79], he gave the
idea up.
<P>
Rebuttal: As for time, he supposedly spent 15 years or so as a channeller
before declaring himself the Dragon. He didn't seem to be in any big
hurry. Taim isn't the sort of guy to worry about most of his
subordinate channellers betraying him-- he's shown himself to be a master
at inspiring admiration and loyalty in his troops; he's got a regular cult
of personality among the Asha'man. As for the ones he didn't feel he could
trust, he's not the sort of guy to be shy about killing them outright. As
for the madness, he is known to be a totally ruthless fellow. He'd have no
problem using his followers for the year or two they had of sanity and then
killing them. Of course, this argument doesn't apply if Taim has
always been Dem.
<P>
<h2>Arguments against MT being Demandred</h2>
There doesn't seem to be anything about MT which is inconsistent with him
being Demandred, only ways to explain away the evidence in favor of it.
One point that has often been mentioned is that Rand sees MT channelling,
but he does not see the black cord connecting him to the DO and filtering
out the Taint. However, this is NOT A VALID ARGUMENT! The black cords are
only seen/sensed under very special circumstances. Rand has only seen them
in two places-- T'A'R and the in-between space used for Skimming. Rand has
never seen MT in either of those places. Note that Rand has seen male
Forsaken without seeing the cords: Aginor and Balthamel at the Eye and
Be'lal in the Heart of the Stone. Thus, the fact that Rand hasn't seen the
black threads on MT shows nothing one way or the other. (<A HREF="../1.3_how-work-dark/1.3.1_threads.html">See section 1.3.1</a>.)
<P>
<h2>MT's behavior in TPOD</h2>
RJ doesn't seem to be ready to reveal whether MT is Demandred or not.
While it is clear that MT was up to something in TPOD, everything he did or
is suspected of having done in that book could be consistent with either
scenario.
<P>
What was MT up to in TPOD? Through his lieutenants Torval, Gedwyn, Kisman,
and Rochaid (or some subset thereof), he set up the Illianer rebels to
attempt to assassinate Rand, supposedly at the instigation of Aes Sedai.
Through Torval, he tried to make Rand suspicious of Egwene's army which
was, at the time, marching towards Caemlyn and the BT. Possibly, Gedwyn
tried to subvert or cause problems with High Lord Weiramon. At the end,
Taim possibly set up his lieutenants as "deserters" who tried to kill Rand,
thus producing a coterie of male channellers who were clearly loyal to MT,
and whose actions he could disavow. He was angry when he learned that
Dashiva, NOT one of his favorites, had gotten in on the attack.
<P>
None of this points one way or the other. Both Demandred and a real Taim
would be interested in exacerbating the tensions between Rand and the Aes
Sedai. Taim would do so because he'd fear that if Rand allied with AS, the
BT could be threatened or at least become less important. Not to mention,
since Taim was captured by AS, he'd have no love for them. Demandred would
also want to increase Rand's dependence on the BT (and thus on Taimandred)
for all his channelling needs. He'd want to widen the chasm between Rand
and the AS, so that Rand would have less support, and to sow general chaos.
<P>
Similarly, both the real Taim and Taimandred would benefit from having a
force of channellers who worked independently of the BT, and whose loyalty
he could count upon, and whose actions he wouldn't have to justify to Rand.
Dashiva was obviously not in on the Plan, and thus received MT's ire
(whoever he really is) when he joined in. He represents an element of
which MT doesn't have control.
<P>
In conclusion, nothing in POD lent strength to either side of the
Taimandred question.
<P>
<h2>Any other possibilities?</h2>
One more thing that has been discussed is that Osan'gar is MT.
Osan'gar could have been substituted for the original Taim shortly
before he turned up in LOC. However, MT's personality is much more
consistent with what we know of Demandred's than that of Aginor/Osan'gar.
