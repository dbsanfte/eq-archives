<H1>What's up with Mat's new ring?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>ACoS: 14, White Plumes, 280</CITE> Mat acquires a signet ring, by pure "luck." The ring is gold with
a dark oval carved stone, and is in the "long style"; the stone is as long as the joint of Mat's finger
(<CITE>ACoS: 14, White Plumes, 279</CITE>). Here is a description of the carving: "Inside a border of large
crescents, a running fox seemed to have startled two birds into flight." (<CITE>ACoS: 16, A Touch on the
Cheek, 300</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
The fact that Mat was "forced" into buying the ring by his luck makes one suspect that the ring will play some
important role in his future. Perhaps it will only be that the ring (only nobles have signet rings, commoners
don't generally have coats of arms), along with Mat's new fancy clothes, will lead whoever finds him under
that wall to believe he is a noble.
</P>
<P>
One theory is that the birds are ravens, which have special significance to the Seanchan. He will be dug up by
some Seanchan workers, who will see the ring, and Mat will suffer a similar fate to the two Seanchan nobles
who got themselves tatooed with ravens while drunk (<CITE>TSR, 38, Hidden Faces, 441-442</CITE>).
</P>
<P>
There is one problem here, in that the stone can only be slightly larger than 1"x 0.5" (the size of Mat's first
finger-joint). Squished onto this small area are a bunch of moons, a fox, and two birds. The birds can't be
very large, and it is doubtful that they are distinguishable as a particular type of bird. However, this
doesn't prevent some Seanchan toady from <EM>seeing</EM> some indistinct bird-shape as a raven, if his fancy takes
him. Plus, note that if the images are heraldic and stylized, it could be easier to make a raven appear in
that area.
