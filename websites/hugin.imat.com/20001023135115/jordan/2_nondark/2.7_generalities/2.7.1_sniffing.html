Erica explains to us about sniffing:
<blockquote>
In Jordan's Wheel of Time universe, women sniff and men (and Siuan Sanche)
snort. While a sniff, read "inhale", can express disdain, the outward
snuff/hmph is more popular an expression. For correct sniffing posture,
turn your head towards the left shoulder, but not quite. A sixty degree
angle is ideal. The posture indicates that one is removing ones nose from
an offensive area. A single sniff will suffice and may be augmented with a
very modest synchronized shrugging motion. Follow up with a look at the
offender and an optional lift of both eyebrows. These steps comprise the
"sniff". The snuff or hmph is produced by a small vocalization at the back
of the throat, enunciated through the nose and usually is modified by a
slight raising of the chin. This is distinct from the "snort" which is a
guttural, pig-like sound caused by inhalation through the nose. The mouth
must be opened slightly to enable this effect unlike the sniff and the
snuff. (Go ahead. Try it with your mouth closed). The [snort] when
written, should occupy its own line, be followed by a blank line and then
the text following it should be limited to sixty character lines.
</blockquote>

Novak gives us a manly perspective on snorting:
<blockquote>
[Sniffing] is distinct from the *snort* sound, characteristic of
male derision. The *snort* is a sharp inhalation of air through the
nose, so powerful that it causes the back of the throat to constrict
and produce a rough, audible sound. It is not unlike the sound
produced before prodigious expectoration. The mouth should not open
during this gesture, but a one-sided sneer is a recommended option.
The *snort* when written should occupy its own line, be
followed by one line of whitespace, and followed by text formatted to
sixty characters or less. (Really, if you open your mouth during a
*snort* you just look stoopid.)
