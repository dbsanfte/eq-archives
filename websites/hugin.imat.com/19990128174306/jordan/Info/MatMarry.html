<H1>Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="MatMarry.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Mat's fate: "To marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons!"
</P>
(<CITE>TGH: 34, 497, The Wheel Weaves, 420</CITE>):<BR>
Daughter of the Nine Moons indicates the heir to the throne of the Seanchan.
This is most likely Tuon, the second daughter of the Seanchan Empress, who is
mentioned by High Lord Turak in Falme.
</P>
<P>
An outside runner is Berelain, who is descended from Hawkwing and
thus "of the Blood," literally. Part of that theory is that "half the
light of the world" refers to Mayene being a great supplier of lamp
oil.
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>LoC: 52, Weaves of the Power, 641</CITE>):<BR>
In Ebou Dar, Mat runs into a Seanchan guy who recognizes the name "Daughter of the Nine Moons."  This makes it
pretty clear that the Daughter of the Nine Moons refers to somebody Seanchan.
</P>
<P>
The episode offers further clarification (<CITE>LoC: Epilogue, The Answer, 697</CITE>):<BR>
"Perhaps the Return would come soon, and the Daughter of the Nine Moons
with it."  Maybe, the Daughter is a leader of the Return. It has been
suggested that the Seanchan themselves don't know who the DotNM is,
and that the Return will reveal her identity to them.
</P>
<P>
(I gather this theory is that the DotNM is some sort of messiah figure for the
Seanchan, or something like that.)
</P>
<P>
Chances are that Mat is going to meet her, RSN, since he's trapped in a town that has just been invaded by the
Seanchan.
