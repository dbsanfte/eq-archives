<h1 align="center">1.5.6: Who is not a Darkfriend?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
There are several characters who we know cannot be Darkfriends. We know
because Jordan has shown us their thoughts when they are thinking about
their motivations, their opinions towards the Shadow and the DO, or
something similarly indicative. These people are: Rand, Mat, Perrin,
Egwene, Nynaeve, Min, Elayne, Elaida [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 16-17],
Moiraine, Morgase, Thom [TSR: 17, Deceptions, 191-196], Egeanin, Bayle
Domon [TGH: 9, Leavetakings, 134-138], Pedron Niall [ACOS: Prologue,
Lightnings, 47], Dain [TSR: 1, Seeds of Shadow, 32] and Geofram Bornhald,
Siuan Sanche, Gawyn [TSR: Prologue, Lightnings, 50-54], Lan [Just about all
of "New Spring"], Queen Ethenielle [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive Appearances,
17], Aviendha [TPOD: 1, To Keep the Bargain, 58-59] and Toveine Gazal
[TPOD: 26, The Extra Bit, 513].
<P>
There is a second group of characters who we know are not Black. This is
the group of Aes Sedai who swore on the Oath Rod to not lie, and then said
"I am not Black Ajah/a Darkfriend." This group is: Seaine, Pevara, Zerah
(one of the Salidar agents), Saerin, Yukiri, and Doesine (Tower Sitters).
[TPOD: 26, The Extra Bit, 504-513]
<P>
A third group who we know are not DFs is the group of AS Elaida sent to
attack the Black Tower. Alviarin believed the plan was foolish, and made
sure no BA went on the mission. This includes Toveine Gazal and two
other AS named Jenare and Lemai [TPOD: 26, The Extra Bit, 512-514]. <HR>
