<H1>The 'Aiel' attack upon Demira Sedai</H1>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>Lord of Chaos</CITE>, Demira Sedai of the Brown Ajah, a member of the Salidar
Embassy to Rand Al'Thor is attacked by a group of Aiel, and is
severely injured, but not killed. This incident has wide-reaching
results: The Salidar Aes Sedai believe that it was Rand who arranged
the attack, and retaliate. The retaliation drives Rand into leaving
Caemlyn for Cairhien, and sets his mind against the group of Aes Sedai
most likely to help him. He turns towards the Tower Aes Sedai, who
trick him, capture him, and abscond with him locked up in a box, to be
rescued by Perrin, the Aiel, and Taim. 
</P>
<P>
The whole incident is somewhat perplexing. The Aiel who attacked
Demira did not seem particularly Aiel-ish. We don't know who ordered
the attack, or why, or even if the effects of the attack were what the
organizer intended.
</P>
<H2>Karl-Johan:</H2>
<P>
First, it seems to be a very well organized and planned attack.  It is
done after Demira is shadowed and possibly lured into small, empty
alleys. The attack is done by people <em>meeting</em> her. Simultaneously, a
man appears bringing the message to her Warder at the Crown and Roses.
The interception may mean that other people directed the "Aiel" to
their position and cleared the alleys, giving 10-20 people
participating, of which at least a few must know Caemlyn very well.
</P>
<P>
The attack team must be well trained and disciplined, appearing to
<EM>almost</EM> kill Demira, but not actually risking it. I think the AS who
healed Demira mentioned several spears, just missing vital organs.
This, the message to her Warder, and the warning, show that the
attackers intended for her to live.
</P>
<P>
Also, the attack is done after, IIRC, the embassy has been in
Caemlyn three or four days. It is mentioned that there have been
three audiences with Rand before, and no audience at the day of
the attack. The attack must thus have been done with only three
days of preparation (discounting the day of the attack).
</P>
<P>
The message, "Tell the other witches to stay away from the Dragon
Reborn" gives little clue. Whitecloaks call AS witches, but they refer
to Rand as Rand or as a False Dragon, and Padan Fain only thinks on
Rand as Rand. A Forsaken is the primary indication from the quote, but
I think that it is very carefully chosen. This is also a clue that the
"Aiel" were not really Aiel -- the Aiel do not refer to the AS as
"witches," nor do they refer to Rand as "the Dragon Reborn" -- that is a
wetlander prophecy.

If <a HREF="WhoTaim.html">Demandred (or Osan'gar) = Taim</a>, he fulfills these criteria.  It
would be strange if the Asha'man not included people knowing Caemlyn
among the Asha'man DF, and they are being trained in the use of
weapons. (But not spears.) Taim also knows early of the embassy b/c
Rand tells him of it. Emmet O'Brien suggests that the Aiel were Shaido
gated in by Demandred/Taim, and that the whole purpose was to engineer
Rand's capture and handing over to the Shaido, where Sevanna could use
the cube thing, a *'angreal of some sort, which she was given by
Demandred [this is assumption not fact] to do something suitably
horrible to Rand, a la the meeting between the Aiel and the AS in the
<CITE>LoC</CITE> Prologue, and the Mesaana-Demandred connection.
</P>
<P>
Fain does have access to DF's from Caemlyn, and the former
Whitecloaks. But, as he thinks when he is reached by the report of the
Gray Man attack on Rand, I guess his resources are rather limited.
Fain could have some motive to drive Rand towards dealing with the
Mashadar-tainted Tower instead of the untainted Salidar AS.
</P>
<P>
I guess the Whitecloaks can be ruled out. They have withdrawn their
organization from Caemlyn, and their lower ranks would be more
interested in killing AS than political maneuvering. Niall might try
something like this, but the Niall POV scenes we get in <CITE>LoC</CITE> show him
concentrating on schemes involving Morgase, the fake Dragonsworn in
Altara, and later, the mysterious situation in Tarabon -- nothing
involving Rand and his connections with the Tower.
</P>
<P>
The White Tower AS can also be ruled out, because they would
be hard pressed to simply reach a decision so fast. Pigeon to
Elaida, Elaida decides, Pigeon back, plan and do attack. Done
in three days? No. Also, the White Tower lacks people and
organization in Caemlyn, apart from all political (Daes Dae'mar)
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
An attack from Forsaken != Taim is likely, though it would
have the same or worse logistical problems as Padan Fain.
