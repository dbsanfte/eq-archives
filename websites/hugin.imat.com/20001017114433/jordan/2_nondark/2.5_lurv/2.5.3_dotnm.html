<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.5.3: Who is the Daughter of the Nine Moons? How will
Mat meet her?</h1>
<HR>
<h2>Who is the DotNM?</h2>
<P>
Mat's fate: "To marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons!"
<P>
Daughter of the Nine Moons probably indicates the heir to the throne of the
Seanchan. This is most likely Tuon, the second daughter of the Seanchan
Empress who is mentioned by High Lord Turak in Falme. [TGH: 34, The Wheel
Weaves, 420]. It has been pointed out that (at least as of TGH) there is
no set heir, and so the DotNM may be the Empress herself, or one of her
daughters (besides Tuon). An outside runner is Berelain, who is supposedly
descended from Hawkwing and thus "of the Blood," literally. Part of that
theory is that "half the light of the world" refers to Mayene being a great
supplier of lamp oil.
<P>
In Ebou Dar in [LoC: 52, Weaves of the Power, 641], Mat runs into a
Seanchan guy who recognizes the name "Daughter of the Nine Moons."
This makes it pretty clear that the Daughter of the Nine Moons refers
to somebody Seanchan. The epilogue makes further clarification [LoC:
Epilogue, The Answer, 697]: "Perhaps the Return would come soon, and
the Daughter of the Nine Moons with it." The Daughter is maybe a
leader of the Return. It has been suggested that the Seanchan
themselves don't know who the DotNM is, and that the Return will
reveal her identity to them. (I gather this theory is that the DotNM
is some sort of messiah figure for the Seanchan, or something like
that.) Chances are that Mat is going to meet her RSN, since he's
trapped in a town that has just been invaded by the Seanchan.
<h2>How will Mat meet the DotNM?</h2>
<P>
There's been a lot of speculation about how Mat will fall into the
Daughter's clutches, er, arms. A lot of it has centered around Mat's
signet ring (<a href="../2.1_taveren/2.1.1_mat-ring.html">see
section 2.1.1</a>), which has birds (maybe ravens?) and moons (maybe
nine?) on it, and his spear, which has ravens on it. However, these links
are kind of tenuous, and anyway, Mat left his spear behind in the Tarasin
Palace. However, Mat has more than the ring to point him out to the
Seanchan as somebody to pay attention to.
<P>
Donald Crankshaw explains:
<P>
Has anyone else noticed that Mat still had Tylin's note when the building
fell on him? I didn't notice until a couple of days ago when re-reading a
few of my favorite scenes from ACOS. At the beginning of the chapter "A
Note from the Palace" (there's even a chapter named after the note), Mat's
wearing a green coat. After reading the note: "'The Queen thinks I need
new clothes,' Mat said, stuffing the note into his coat pocket." [ACOS:
37, A Note from the Palace, 583]. We know Mat's still wearing the coat
later; we're practically hit over the head with it. At the FCA (Female
Channelers Anonymous) meeting in [ACOS: 39, Promises to Keep, 605]: "He
himself was still in his muck, with his dusty green coat hanging open and
the silver foxhead caught in the neck of his half-undone shirt." And
finally, just before the building fell on him, "[He was] hoping none of the
Seanchan would think he was one of Tylin's soldiers. He should never have
worn a green coat." [ACOS: 39, Promises to Keep, 622]
<P>
Now I knew that Mat was wearing the Ring o' the Nine Moons when he was
buried under the rubble, but I hadn't really figured out how the Seanchan,
whom I'm certain will be the ones to find him, would connect him with the
palace. I was pretty sure he had to go back, that's where he left his
<EM>ashanderei</EM>, but I didn't know how. I wonder what the Seanchan
will make of that note.
<P>
Here's a copy of it, just because I have nothing better to do:
<blockquote>
Mat, my sweet,<P>
I am having your things moved to my apartments. So much more
convenient. By the time you return, Riselle will be in your old rooms to
look after young Olver. He seems to enjoy her company.<P>
I have seamstresses coming to measure you. I will enjoy watching that.
You must wear shorter coats. And new breeches, of course. You have a
delightful bottom. Duckling, who is this Daughter of the Nine Moons I
made you think of? I have thought of several delicious ways to make you
tell me.<P>
Tylin
</blockquote>
<P>
Let's see, it mentions Olver, Riselle (I don't think she's really
important), Tylin (this would not have been enough to indicate that it's
the Queen rather than some other Tylin-- except that the letter has her
seal), Mat's name, enough details to give a pretty good idea what Tylin
and Mat's relationship is, and, oh yeah, the Daughter of the Nine
Moons. You know, suddenly this note seems pretty significant.<HR>
