<h1 align="center">0.2: RJ says the FAQ is only 1/3 right. Why should
I bother reading it?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
RJ's standard comment on the FAQ is that it's "about one-third correct,
one-third close but not quite, and one-third dead wrong." [e.g. post-ACOS
signing in Charleston, South Carolina, 21 June 1996, report by Brian
Ritchie] If it's so incorrect, why bother reading it? Bill Garrett
explains:
<P>
1) The FAQ isn't intended as a benchmark of absolute truth. It's a
collection of frequently asked questions and our best answers to them,
right or wrong. It's there so people with questions can find out what our
answers and ideas are, all organized in one convenient place.
<P>
2) Of <EM>course</EM> the FAQ isn't 100% correct. Much of it is devoted
to describing opposing viewpoints on key questions. For example,
consider the "Who killed Asmodean?" entry. Numerous theories are
presented, but at most one of them is correct and the rest are
wrong -- unless Asmodean was killed by a posse consisting of various
Forsaken, Myrdraal, darkfriend Aiel, Padan Fain, and Bela.
<P>
You should read the FAQ because it will give you an idea of what has
been said before by many people. Chances are, if you want to know what
people think about a given theory, it's in here. Familiarizing yourself
with other people's arguments will help you make your own more interesting
and persuasive.
