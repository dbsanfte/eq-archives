<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.3.12: What caused the One Power weirdness in Ebou Dar?</h1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">[John Novak]</P>
<HR>
<P>
At various points through TPOD, we are hit in the face with the fact
that something other than the taint on Saidin is wrong with the One
Power in general. It is described by both male and female channellers
in roughly the same terms, and is widespread enough to cover a radius
of hundreds, if not thousands, of miles. When mentioned, the effect
of this weirdness is to make the One Power difficult and dangerous,
unpredictable, and very hard to control.
<P>
This effect began showing up during and after the flight of Elayne,
Nynaeve, and their band from the Kin's farm. Two momentous events
involving the One Power occurred at the farm. First, the Bowl of the Winds
was used to return the weather to its normal patterns. Second, Elayne
attempted a dangerous unraveling of her Gateway with disastrous and
incendiary results.
<P>
It was the first of these events (the weather weave) which caused the
weirdness, not the disastrous unraveling. Reasons are as follows:
<P>
1) Timing. Even though the two events occur very close together in both
time and narrative, the weirdness of the One Power is clearly evident
<em>immediately after</em> the weather weave, but before the unraveling.
In fact, the weirdness shows up while Elayne is weaving the Gateway, which
is clearly prior to her later unweaving [TPOD: 6, Threads, 139].
<P>
2) The weirdness affects not only Saidar, but Saidin as well. In
[TPOD: 24, A Time for Iron, 469], Dashiva describes a similar
weirdness. It is important to note that he uses almost the exact same
words as Elayne does-- a weave that does not want to form, then forms
quickly and violently. It is the <em>same</em> effect.
<P>
By definition, Elayne's weaving and unweaving of the Gateway
does not involve Saidin, and it is difficult to see how a Saidar-only
weave could affect Saidin so profoundly. However, the Bowl of the Winds
incorporated Saidin into its weaves as well. Elayne notes this in
[TPOD: 5, The Breaking Storm, 127]. Perrin's Asha'man see a weave
of Saidin flashing across the sky as well, in [TPOD: 7, A Goatpen, 160].
This same phenomenon was witnessed by the WOs with Perrin as a weave of
Saidar.
<P>
3) It is known that the Windfinders have a very different style of weaving
Saidar than anyone else, a style that involves thick, rope-like strands of
Power. This style of weaving, and their unprecedented personal control
over the weather, was unknown in the Age of Legends, when the Bowl of the
Winds was created. Furthermore, the Bowl of the Winds was
designed to control only a small region's weather, not the
weather of an entire continent or an entire world [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 83].
It seems plausible that such a massive over-stressing and over-use of a
ter'angreal, which may create permanent standing weaves over an entire
continent, might foul things up on a global scale.
<P>
4) Jordan said so. At a post-POD signing in northern Virginia [21
November, 1998], Jordan confirmed outright in plain language that the Bowl,
not the unweaving, was the cause of the One Power weirdness, and that it
was a case of overstressing a ter'angreal. From John Novak's report from
a post-POD signing in Virginia:
<blockquote>
He went into a relatively detailed explanation to the effect that the Bowl
was stressed far, far beyond its original design parameters because of the
advanced knowledge of the Windfinders. It was affecting a global pattern,
when it was designed for only a small region. Men helping would not have
changed anything, and the effects linger most strongly near Ebou Dar, but
also along the "spokes" which radiated from that place. [TPOD book signing,
Northern Virginia, 21 November, 1998, report by John Novak]
