<h1 align="center">2.4.11: What was the "Vileness" after the Aiel War?</h1>
<P align="center">[Richard Boye]</P>
<hr>
<P>
Well, there were several scandalous affairs involving Aes Sedai which
occurred during the years after the Aiel War:
<OL>
<LI>The Amyrlin, Tamra Ospenya, died mysteriously.
<LI>Several prominent sisters died, also mysteriously.
<LI>The Red Sitters in the Hall were exiled, and the reasons were sealed
to the Flame. (Sealed to the Flame = Officially, "only the Amyrlin need
know," but often the Amyrlin will swear a sister into her confidence
(e.g. Elaida sealing Seaine to the Flame about Alviarin and the BA))
<LI>A campaign of murder was instituted against "lucky men."
<LI>Thom's nephew and quite a few other men were gentled illegally.
</OL>
<P>
Most of the links between the events were given out in various places
throughout the series, but NS finally nailed down some of the events.
<P>
This is now what seems to be the sequence of events:
<P>
Tamra Ospenya, the Amyrlin during the Aiel War, was murdered by Jarna
Malari in an effort to learn what she knew about the Second Coming [ACOS:
Prologue, Lightnings, 42]. Jarna was the leader of the BA at this point.
Tamra was also the Amyrlin who was present when Gitara Moroso had her
Foretelling about the Rebirth.
<P>
Tamra was canny enough to know that there was some Black Ajah activity
afoot and swore Siuan and Moiraine to secrecy. From NS, we learn that
Tamra really wasn't stupid enough to just send two jumped up Accepted
(Moiraine and Siuan) out to find the Dragon Reborn. She had very carefully
and surreptitiously called in and sent out a group of Searchers, most of
whom were later killed by the BA. It is still unclear whether Cadsuane was
among the Searchers, but it's quite possible she was. The ones that Siuan
and Moiraine were aware of were: Aisha, Kerene Nagashi, Valera, Ludice and
Meilyn Arganya [L:NS, 668]. (Side note: Cadsuane gave Kerene and
Meilyn as examples of the strongest in the Tower.)
<P>
From her interrogation of Tamra before killing her, Jarna learned
<em>something</em> about the Second Coming, but misinterpreted it, and
didn't realize that he had just been <em>born</em>. Possibly she construed
what she had learned as the Dragon Reborn was ready to announce himself, or
maybe she just learned that he was alive, but had no idea of his age. It's
unlikely that any of the Searchers chosen by Tamra was BA, because then the
BA would have known the same details Moiraine did (i.e. the Dragon was a
baby, born during the final battle of the Aiel War, on Dragonmount).
<P>
In any event, the race to find the Dragon had begun, and the Black
Ajah unleashed a campaign of murder to get to him first, killing
anyone, man or boy, rumored to be "lucky," on the assumption that any
man who seemed lucky might be channeling, since luckiness is one of the
symptoms of unconscious channeling [L:NS, 712].
<P>
However, while that was going on, and for a while afterwards, the Red Ajah
was running a second front of the campaign. Later on, after Jarna herself
was Keeper to Sierin Vayu (the Gray with more than a touch of Red in her),
she implemented a program of search and destroy. Working through Galina
Casban, she directed her to use her Red minions to seek out any man that
could channel and gentle him on the spot. It might have been the work of a
selected cadre of Red Sisters who wouldn't balk at this flagrant violation
of Tower law. We know it is illegal to gentle a man "extra-judiciously,"
away from Tower [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 22]. By doing this, Jarna
began a process that would circumvent the Tower's "Dragon-finding Process,"
which was to bring all channeling men to the Tower, where they put him to
some sort of inquest to determine if he was the Dragon Reborn, and then
gentled him. One assumes that they <em>would not</em> have gentled the
Dragon Reborn. One of the victims of this 'search and destroy' mission was
Thom's nephew Owyn. Presumably, Owyn is one the gentled men whose names do
not appear in the Tower records. (One supposes that the fact that these
men are not in the records is why it is dangerous to know about them.)
Elaida's comments seem to insinuate that she participated in at least one
of those missions [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 22].
<P>
Meanwhile, all hell breaks loose. Ishamael puts Jarna Malari to death in a
pain amplifier for messing with the program. We know that Ishy had notions
of finding the nascent Dragon Reborn intact so that he could turn him to
the Dark Side of the Force. What Jarna had done was severely reduce the
odds of that happening, so it seems that he killed her for acting as a
loose cannon. It is likely that this is what ended the campaign of murder
by the Black Ajah, but the Reds' illegal search and destroy mission
continued [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 42].
<P>
Two years later Sierin Vayu died. Ishamael clamped down on the Great
Council of the Black Ajah to determine that none of them had anything
to do with Sierin's death (one assumes that Ishamael had some plans
for her). It is possible that she gave some sort of tacit approval
toward the 'search and destroy sorties' (she was pro-Red) and the Red
Ajah had a hand in killing her to silence her. Alviarin seems to think
that the Reds did have a hand in her death, and disavowed any Black
participation [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 42].
<P>
Whoever was responsible, it was to no avail. The secret came out,
and the Red Sitters in the Hall were exiled. Undoubtedly, the rest of
the Hall assumed that they had also exiled the Red Generalissima,
because pretty much all the other leaders of Ajahs were also
Sitters. They exiled Toveine, Tsutama and Lirene, but left
Galina untouched.
<P>
There is a slight quibble with that last part. We see from Toveine's POV
in TPOD that she recalls her exile on a farm as lasting "twenty years,"
[TPOD: 26, The Extra Bit, 513] but that doesn't wash with the rest of the
continuity, since we know that Owyn at least was gentled only fifteen years
ago [TSR: 17, Deceptions, 195]. If Toveine and her fellow Sitters were
exiled twenty years ago, that places their exile immediately after the War
and probably even before Moiraine and Siuan learn of the BA murder
campaign. This doesn't make sense, because if the murder campaign was the
reason for their exile, it seems difficult to believe that they would have
gotten off with mere exile. Furthermore, in ACOS, Elaida mentions that all
three Sitters went into exile 15 years ago, which fits more squarely into
the timeline [ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 21]. It's likely that Toveine
was just exaggerating or rounding off to the nearest decade (or RJ slipped
up).
<P>
In L:NS, we see that the Aes Sedai are out in force, and so all this search
and counter-searching certainly makes it public knowledge that the Aes
Sedai are up to something, but it is possible that the Tower put out the
story that the reason for this unusually high level of Aes Sedai activity
is the "Grand Coalition," the treaty organization that was formed to fight
the Aiel. In L:NS, we also hear that there is a rumor of a channeling man
in the Borderlands [L:NS, 642]. This story was probably fabricated by the
AS searchers, so that the increased AS activity wouldn't be considered
particularly odd. Another related tidbit is that the Aes Sedai seemed to
have influenced fashion in the Borderlands by introducing veils, to better
conceal their Ageless faces.
