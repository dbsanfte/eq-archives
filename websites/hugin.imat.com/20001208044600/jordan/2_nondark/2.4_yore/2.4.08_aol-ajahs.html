<HR>
<P>
In short, no. The Ajahs as we know them did not exist during the AOL.
The Guide tells us [Guide: 9, Formation of the White Tower, 90] that "the
organization of AS in the AOL, or perhaps their manner of functioning,
[was as] 'a vast sea of ajah...all constantly shrinking, growing, dividing,
combining, melting away only to be reborn in some new guise and begin the
process once more.'" We are also told that the term "ajah" meant "an
informal and temporary group of people gathered together for a common
purpose of goal, or by a common set of beliefs." In other words, the AOL
Aes Sedai did not consist of fixed groups, each dedicated to a different
purpose, but rather formed factions based on the issues at hand. In fact,
many of the AOL Aes Sedai were not "dedicated" Aes Sedai, i.e. people
whose career was to <em>be</em> Aes Sedai, but "followed vocations which
had little or nothing to do with the OP or being Aes Sedai. When it was
necessary to form a circle to perform some task, these AS could be
summoned... by the Hall of the Servants." [Guide: 3, The Age of Legends,
30]
<P>
The Ajahs of the present-day AS have their roots in the founding of the
White Tower. In short, during and after the Breaking, there were many
autonomous groups of channellers. Eventually, some of these groups joined
together to form the modern Aes Sedai. The Ajah setup derives from the
goals and principles of the various autonomous groups who founded the
Tower [Guide: 9, Formation of the White Tower, 91-92].
<P>
However, one can speculate that the colors of the Ajahs were probably
representative of something in the AoL or a previous Age, because the Ajah
colors are the colors surrounding the Portal Stones.
