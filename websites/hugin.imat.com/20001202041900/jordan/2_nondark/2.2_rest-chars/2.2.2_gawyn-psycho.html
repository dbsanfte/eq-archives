<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.2.2: What was up with Gawyn during the Tower Coup?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
It's been suggested that he was involuntarily bonded to a Black or to
a Forsaken. His eyes were glazed and he was not necessarily in control
of himself [TSR: 47, The Truth of a Viewing, 539-41].
Alviarin says with some confidence that "Gawyn will be brought under
control". [TFOH: Prologue, The First Sparks Fall, 17]
<P>
OTOH, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that he was in full
control of his faculties during the coup. By that time, he had
developed a good and solid hatred for SS, due to Elayne and Egwene's
mysterious disappearance. Furthermore, in his POV scenes in LOC and
ACOS, he never thinks anything that would give the idea that he's
bonded to anything. Plus, he agrees to be Eg's warder; he couldn't do
that if he was already bonded. (Since he'd trained with the Warders, it's
not reasonable to think that he wouldn't know a Warder bond when he felt
one.)
<P>
From his behavior in LoC, it seems pretty apparent that he acted under
his own will during the coup, motivated by grief and anxiety over
Elayne and Egwene. He develops a similar fierce hatred for Rand due
to the rumors that Rand killed Morgase.
