<HR>
<P>
"When anything is destroyed with balefire, it ceases to exist
<em>before</em> the moment of its destruction, like a thread that burns
away from where the flame touched it. The greater the power of the
balefire, the further back in time it ceases to exist. The strongest
[Moiraine] can manage will remove only a few seconds from the Pattern...For
as far back as you destroy [something], whatever it did during that time
<em>no longer happened</em>. Only the memories remain, for those who saw or
experienced it." [TFOH: 6, Gateways, 119]
<P>
That pretty much explains it. Something that is BFed is erased
backwards in time; the amount of erasing depends on the amount of
Power put into the BF. Rand, at full power, with an angreal, managed
to erase Rahvin back about half an hour. Note that Balefire does NOT
erase every single action the victim performed in his life. When
Rahvin was BFed, Morgase did not become un-compelled, sitting back in
the Caemlyn palace. If Lanfear were balefired, the Bore would not
cease to exist, since it was created over 3000 years ago, and I doubt
that the capacity for creating that strong a beam of BF exists. (Plus,
if it WAS done, the poor Pattern would probably unravel completely. See
below.)
<P>
<h2>When a person is balefired, can he be reborn?</h2>
The description of balefire leaves us one important question: does "burning
one's thread from the pattern" mean that one's soul is destroyed forever,
and one can never be reborn? John Novak finally got an answer for this from
RJ at a post-POD book-signing [Northern Virginia-- 21 November, 1998]:
<blockquote>
Balefire: I'm right. (This was my question) What this means is, if
someone is Balefired, the Dark One can't reincarnate them. But they
CAN be spun back out into the wheel as normal. Balefire is NOT the
eternal death of the soul. He also made a comment to the effect that
even in the absence of balefire, there may be circumstances where the
Dark One cannot bring someone back.
</blockquote>
If this is the case, then why is BF so bad? It must be a question of
scale. If lots of BF is used on many targets, as it was during the War of
Power, the Pattern will become quite ragged and begin to unravel, like an
old pair of jeans. If large quantities of BF are used, then there will be
obvious problems with causality, as there were in the aftermath of Rahvin's
death. Thus, it's not a good idea to use strong BF, and it's not wise for
many people to use it regularly.
<P>
John Walter Biles explains: The pattern unravels permanently because in a
war of mass destruction with balefire, you can yank threads out of the
pattern faster than they can be replaced. Yeah, they can EVENTUALLY be
reborn, but unless the total population of all of creation is static, then
they won't be reborn instantly. More importantly, it screws up causality.
That's why the Pattern can unravel; it's not that you run out of threads,
it is that if you nuke an entire city, every consequence of every action by
everyone in the entire city is suddenly undone back to point X. Given the
amount of balefire nuking a city takes, you can make quite a mess.
Do enough damage to the Pattern faster than it can repair itself, and it
still comes apart.
<h2>Why doesn't somebody just balefire the Dark One back to before where
the taint was created?</h2>
Read the previous paragraphs about what BF does, and why it is
dangerous to use. Now, supposing that 1) the DO has a corporeal body
which could BE balefired, and 2) enough BF could be produced to zap
the DO back 3500 years (neither of which is at all certain), consider
what would happen to the poor Pattern of All Creation if one of the
prime movers in its weaving was BFed. The end of the world would
probably happen for sure, then.
<P>
Remember that the DO is the source of the whole history of the 3rd
Age. Everything everybody has done for the past 3500 or so years has
been affected in some way by the DO. Why is Joe Al'Schmoe of the 2
Rivers a farmer in a forgotten province of Andor, and not a citizen of
one of the most powerful, strongest nations in Randland? It's because
Manetheren was destroyed in the Trolloc wars, which were initiated by
Ishamael, who was the DO's right-hand-man throughout the 3rd
age.
<P>
Another point (via G.G. Kay) is that maybe the DO doesn't even <EM>have</EM>
a thread to balefire. After all, the DO's prison exists "outside the
Pattern." Perhaps the DO itself does, too. (NB: the no-body/no-thread
argument applies to "Why doesn't somebody BF the DO," no matter if you
try to BF him back 3500 years or 3 seconds. The "Pattern" argument
does, as well--if there is no DO, what happens the next time the Wheel
comes around to the AOL/3rd Age again?)
