<H1>Who was Beidomon?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="Beidomon.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>One of the male Forsaken
<LI>Somebody who is dead
<LI>Bayle Domon -- no reason, except the names sound the same
<LI>Lews Therin Telamon
</UL>
<P>
Why he is LTT:<BR>
From "He who brought the shadow...they named Dragon." (<CITE>TEotW: Prologue, xv, Dragonmount, xv</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
He was the lover of Mierin/Lanfear at some point, maybe when the Bore was created. And, "I will tell you of
the end of the Age of Legends, of the Dragon, and of his attempt to free the Dark One into the world of men."
(<CITE>TEotW: 4, 51, The Gleeman, 44</CITE>).  But, then again, why would LTT have another name?
</P>
<P>
Why he isn't LTT:<BR>
It would have adversely affected him, after the war broke out.  Secondly, he had likely left Lanfear long
before, and married Ilyena by that time. At Cairhien (<CITE>TFoH: 52, 889, Choices, 629</CITE>), he does say that he was
never Lanfear's.  He also says that he had long before lost whatever interest in her he had had. (<CITE>TFoH: 6,
172, Gateways, 123</CITE>)
