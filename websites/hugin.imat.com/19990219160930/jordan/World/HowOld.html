<H1>How old is everyone?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Courtenay Footman, Sean Hillyard, Pam Korda, Katrina Werpetinski</H2>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Aviendha is about the same age as Rand, 20-21ish.
<LI>Egwene is about the same age as Elayne, 18.  <CITE>LOC: 36, ?, The Amyrlin is Raised, 478</CITE>
<LI>Elaida has about 5 years (was one of the Accepted who watched over her when she was a Novice) on Moiraine,
late forties-early fifties.
<LI>Elayne is 18. <CITE>LOC 602</CITE>
<LI>Faile is a couple of years older than Win Finngar, so she's 17-18 now.
<LI>Galad:  Tigraine disappeared in 972 when he was an infant. Puts him at 27.
<LI>Gawyn is the same age as Rand (21).
<LI>Isam was a child when Malkier fell, so he is a few years older than Lan, say about 50.
<LI>Lan was born in 953, according to LOC glossary. This fits with him being an infant when Malkier fell.
<LI>Liandrin is referred to as young, not just young seeming as are all Aes Sedai, about 27.
<LI>Mat: the far end of 20 years <CITE>LOC REF?</CITE>
<LI>Min is older than Rand, younger than Nynaeve, say 23, starting at 21.
<LI>Moiraine was born in 956, according to LOC glossary. This fits with her being Accepted at the end of
the Aiel War.
<LI>Nynaeve was just old enough to recall Tam bringing baby Rand back to Emond's field--say about 5. That puts
her at 26 now, 24 at the beginning. This agrees with <CITE>LOC p.602 REF?</CITE>.
<LI>Rand: In TFoH, Moiraine notes that it has been almost 21 years since the search began for the Dragon
Reborn. <CITE>TFoH: 15, 301, What Can Be Learned In Dreams, 214</CITE> That puts Rand's age at about 21, and
so he started at about 19.
<LI>Perrin: about same age as Rand and Mat.
<LI>Siuan Sanche is about the same age as Moiraine -- mid-forties, although she looks very young due to
stilling. She was raised Amyrlin at age 30, so we should be able to get an exact age. (<CITE>LOC: 35, In the
Hall of the Sitters, 471</CITE>)
<LI>Taim is at least 15 years older than Rand, so thus is about 35.  (<CITE>LOC: 2, A New Arrival, 76</CITE>)
