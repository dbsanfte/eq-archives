<h1 align="center">1.2.5: Who is Cyndane, and where did she come from?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
Cyndane is a "new" character in TPOD. She appears in [TPOD: 12, New
Alliances, 262-268], when she and Moghedien visit Graendal to bring her
into the fold. Of course, we must immediately ask, "who is she really?"
First, let's look at the facts we have about her:
<P>
<h2>What do we know about Cyndane?</h2>
Her name means "last chance" in the OT. She is "a short young woman with
long silver hair and vivid blue eyes" and has an "impressive bosom," of
which, in Graendal's opinion, she doesn't make very effective use.
Although she is short, she appears to be "striving for every inch of
height."
<P>
Cyndane works with Moghedien in Moridin's service. She appears
wearing the same red-and-black dress sported by Moggy, which we know from
[ACOS: 30, The First Cup, 483] is Moridin's "livery." Between Moggy and
herself, Cyndane is the leader, although her "place in [Moridin's] eyes is
not far better than [Moggy's]." Cyndane and Mog's identical reactions to
some unknown stimulus (gasping and shuddering) also parallel Mog's
description of her feelings when Moridin plays with her mindtrap [ACOS: 30,
The First Cup, 484]. Cyndane and Moghedien hate each other with a passion.
We also know that Cyndane was already mindtrapped when Moggy met Moridin;
Mog glimpsed a second mindtrap when Moridin pulled hers out in [ACOS: 25,
Mindtrap, 419].
<P>
Personality-wise, she has a haughty attitude: "By her demeanor, she might
have been a Prime Counselor forced to endure the company of common laborers
and intent on ignoring their existence." Outwardly, she's cool and
collected, but inside, she has a temper; Graendal describes her as "a
beautiful doll carved from ice, with hidden fires." Cyndane is not the
least bit cowed by the Forsaken; Graendal's analysis is: "The girl knew she
spoke to one of the Chosen, and yet her tone remained frost. Even given
her strength, this was no simple Friend of the Dark. Unless she was
insane." She disapproves of Graendal's use of strong Compulsion on her
"servants," and has no compunction about expressing her scorn of this
practice to Graendal's face.
<P>
Finally, Graendal can sense her strength in the OP, which means that Cyndane
channels Saidar, and she is stronger then Graendal.
<P>
<h2>What can we conclude about Cyndane</h2>
What conclusions can we draw from all this? Quite a few, actually. For
one thing, she's almost certainly not a random DF from the Third Age; it is
likely that she is a Forsaken. This conclusion can be reached by
considering her situation. The fact that she is mindtrapped indicates that
she is somebody who, like Moggy, is very valuable and useful to the
DO/Moridin, but whose past actions have shown that she cannot be relied
upon to do the "right" thing without direct supervision and control. She's
also powerful and valuable enough that the usual methods of control--
simple intimidation, torture, Compulsion, etc.-- would not produce the
desired result of her being in control of her abilities, but totally under
the thumb of an overseer. No Third Ager we've seen thus far has been given
such consideration. Furthermore, trained channellers of Forsaken-level
strength are almost unheard of in the Third Age. Finally, given Moridin's
utter contempt for the Third Age, it is unlikely that he'd place a Third
Ager over an AOLer, even if that AOLer <em>was</em> Moghedien. Add to this
her complete lack of fear, or even caution, when confronting and insulting
Graendal, and it seems that Cyndane (or at least the mind controlling her
body) must be from the Age of Legends.
<P>
Since we have such slim knowledge about the conditions under which the DO
can recycle a person, we can't absolutely rule out the possibility that
Cyndane is some AOL dreadlord who we've never heard of before. There are
some arguments against this, though. First, we have no other evidence of
the DO bringing back anybody else who died in the AOL or after the Bore was
sealed. The only other resurrectees we've seen have died in the Third Age,
and were recycled within a few years of their deaths (Aginor/Osan'gar,
Balthamel/Aran'gar, Ishamael/Moridin, Isam/Slayer (possibly)). Secondly,
according to the Guide [Guide: 5, The DO and the Male Forsaken, 49-50], the
thirteen Forsaken were the strongest of the AS who turned to the Shadow;
during the AOL, they managed to finish off anybody who "equaled or
approached [them] in strength." Apparently, the DO did not deem those who
failed to survive the winnowing process to be worthy of resurrection during
the War of Power, why would he deem them worthy now? Finally, one must
consider the fact that it has been over 3000 years since these Dreadlords
died; they could have been reborn during the interval, possibly multiple
times. If that were the case, it is far from certain that the DO could
resurrect them with their old AOL personalities.
<P>
If she is an unknown AOL resurrectee, there is no point in discussing the
question any further. So, henceforth, we will assume that she is, in fact,
somebody we've seen before.
<P>
<h2>Who is she, then?</h2>
The only Forsaken who are unaccounted for when we first meet Cyndane are
Lanfear, Sammael, and Asmodean. Cyndane cannot be Sammael, because Sammael
was still alive and in his own body when Moggy was mindtrapped. As
mentioned above, at that time, Cyndane was also mindtrapped (and Sammael
definitely was not). As for Asmodean, he's probably permanently dead; in
[LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 15], the DO associates Asmo with Rahvin,
who has "DIED THE FINAL DEATH." Furthermore, Asmo is a worse traitor than
Moggy-- there was more free will in his decision to help Rand than in Mog's
a'dam-compelled teaching of El and Ny. It is unlikely that he'd be set
above Mog. This leaves us with only one option: Lanfear.
<P>
Further evidence that Cyndane = Lanfear, rather than Asmodean, is that she
channels Saidar, not Saidin. Granted, we only have one example of a man
recycled into a woman's body (Aran'gar), so we can't really say if
Aran'gar's channelling of Saidin is the rule, or an exception. However, it
is the only thing we have to go on, and that example indicates that a
recycled Asmodean would channel Saidin, regardless of the sex of the body
he was put into. Furthermore, a man, remembering everything about his life
as a Saidin-channeller, would not be immediately be able to channel Saidar,
if he was put into a Saidar-channelling body. We've been told time and
time again about the vast differences between how the Power works for men
and women. It follows that a man would have to go through lots of training
before he could channel Saidar with any skill. Thus, Cyndane's soul ought
to be female, as well as her body.
<P>
Even more evidence arises from Cyndane's personality and behavior. The
juxtaposition of a cool demeanor and a fiery temper match Lanfear very
well. She "strives for every inch of height," implying that she's used to
being taller. We know that Lanfear was tall from [TSR: 9, Decisions, 127].
<P>
So, the best guess for Cyndane's former identity is Lanfear.
<P>
<h2>If she is Lanfear, how did she come to this state?</h2>
The last we saw of Lanfear, she was knocked through the doorway to
Foxland by Moiraine, and the doorway melted. The big question is what
happened to her that she ended up with a new body (and a mindtrap)? There
are two basic ideas. One is that she died "off-screen" and was recycled by
the DO in the same way as the Gars and Moridin. The other idea is that the
new body is a consequence, possibly unintentional, of one the wishes she
made in Foxland. Since we have absolutely no idea what happened to Moir
and Lanfear after they fell through the door, it is difficult to choose one
of the many options. We'll just look at the various possibilities, and
point out any points in favor of or against them.
<P>
<h3>Lanfear died, and was recycled by the DO</h3>
If she was killed at some point, and recycled by the DO in the usual
fashion, we must ask, "when did she die?" The possibilities are:
<UL>
<LI>She died when she went through the doorway.
<LI>She was killed in Finnland, by Moiraine or by the Foxes.
<LI>She escaped from Finnland, but died when she got back to Randland.
</UL>
<P>
How could Lanfear have died when she went through the door? One option
is that the destruction of the doorway itself killed her. However, if
that was the case, then one would expect that Moiraine would have been
killed as well. Since we know Moiraine is not dead (<A HREF="../../2_nondark/2.2_rest-chars/2.2.6_moir-no-dead.html">see section
2.2.6</a>), this scenario is unlikely.
<P>
Another possibility is that she was killed by drawing too much Power.
"Koby Kobia" explains: "If we recall the incident in TFOH, Lanfear was
drawing deeply on the bracelet angreal when Moiraine struck. She was
probably drawing every particle of the OP she could stand through the
angreal, and it must have been a humongous amount because she was winning
against Rand and <em>his</em> angreal, when Moiraine cannoned into her
<em>and clawed away the angreal</em> as the two of them fell through the
doorway. Now, an angreal allows a person to channel a lot more of the OP
than the person can channel unaided. What happens if the angreal is
suddenly stripped away while is person is straining to draw as much OP as
he/she can?" If she wasn't able to release the Source quickly enough, she
would have been stilled at the very least, and it's quite possible that
she'd have been "burnt to a crisp" like Aginor at the end of TEOTW.
<P>
If Lanfear didn't die from the Power, there are other ways she could have
perished. Moiraine could have got a lucky strike in, and finished her off
on the other side of the doorway. This is improbable because
Lanfear was much more powerful and skilled than Moiraine. The Forsaken
would have had every advantage in a fight between the two of them.
Moiraine has only been able to take Forsaken down by surprise (Be'lal,
tackling Lanfear), and if she didn't kill or incapacitate Lanfear right
off, it's unlikely she'd have any defenses in the long run. The exception,
of course, would be if Lanfear was stilled, and Moiraine wasn't. On yet
another hand, Moiraine might have been stilled in the doorway's
destruction, as well.
<P>
If Moiraine didn't kill her, Lanfear might have been killed by the Foxes,
if she didn't deal with them wisely. Mat's experience with them certainly
would have been lethal if Rand hadn't known CPR. When Moiraine told El,
Eg, and Ny about the Snake doorway in Tear, where one can get three
questions answered, she said, "Questions touching the Shadow have dire
consequences. If you asked about the Black Ajah, you might be returned
dead, or come out a gibbering madwoman, if you came out at all." [TSR: 7,
Doorways,95] It has been suggested that the Foxes might have a similar
reaction to wishes "touching the Shadow." Given who Lanfear is, it's
possible that anything she wished for would be connected to the Shadow.
This idea that Lanfear was killed by the Foxes presupposes that she was
stilled by drawing too much Power or by the doorway explosion. If she still
had channelling ability, she could have defended herself from the Foxes
like Rand defended himself from the Snakes in TSR.
<P>
On the other hand, there are reasons to believe that the Foxes wouldn't
have immediately killed Lanfear for being Forsaken. Firstly, we don't know
that the Foxes have the same problem with the Shadow which the Snakes have.
Secondly, Lanfear could have asked for personal things which didn't
directly involve the Shadow, for example, having channelling ability
restored if she was stilled, or having Lews Therin love her, or having
Moiraine detained, or getting back to Randland. One might want to consider
that Lanfear might have known as much about the doorways as Moiraine, and
possibly more. The doors, like (almost) all ter'angreal, date from before
the Breaking, and Lanfear was a OP-scientist during the AOL. It's not that
unlikely that she'd be aware of the doorways and at least some of their
properties, and know enough to avoid getting killed. Another question
which has a bearing on this issue is whether the DO can retrieve the souls
of dead Forsaken from other dimensions.
<P>
A final possibility for Lanfear's death is that she survived and escaped
from Finnland, and died at some later point. This idea is sketchy in that
it begs the questions of how did she manage to die, and why did it happen
"off-screen." None of the primary Good Guys killed her; they'd have
noticed. This leaves either assassination by somebody on the Dark Side, or
an accidental death. Most of the "loose" Forsaken (i.e. those not tied to
Shaidar Haran and/or Moridin) have expressed ignorance of Lanfear's
whereabouts. This leaves a direct order from Moridin/SH/the DO, and if that
was the case, why bother killing her just to get her in a mindtrap? Surely
it would have been just as easy to send her to SG for the same treatment
as Moggy. One could always suppose that she tripped, fell down some
stairs, and broke her neck, all off-screen, but that would just be
incredibly lame.
<P>
<h3>Lanfear did not die; the new body is the result of a wish</h3>
Just because Lanfear has a new look, we shouldn't immediately assume that
she got it in the same way (from the DO) that the other "new" Forsaken got
theirs. The TPOD Glossary entry on "Forsaken" has something a bit weird to
say on the matter: "Moridin... may be yet another of the dead Forsaken
brought back from the grave by the Dark One. The same possibility may
exist regarding the woman calling herself Cyndane, but... speculation as to
the identities of Moridin and Cyndane may prove futile until more is
learned." [TPOD: Glossary, entry "Forsaken," 598]. Clearly, this is RJ
making fun of us, but it could also be a signal that Cyndane might not be
wholly what she seems: Lanfear resurrected by the DO. (Moridin is
obviously Ishamael.
(<A HREF="1.2.4_moridin.html">See section 1.2.4</A>)).
<P>
So, what alternative is there? If she is Lanfear, and wasn't resurrected
by the DO, she had to have gotten the body someplace else. The most likely
source is the Foxes. We know that they grant wishes in ways which are
often not quite what the wisher expected or desired (witness the
restoration of Mat's memory). We also know that they demand a "price" for
the granting of wishes, and will exact one of their choosing if the wisher
does not negotiate one. In Mat's case, the "price" was for him to be hung
from the Tree of Life when he was returned to Rhuidean. Now, while Lanfear
would never voluntarily change her legendary looks, might have wished
something which unexpectedly resulted in a change of body. For example, if
she was stilled after falling through the door, she certainly would have
asked for her channelling ability to be restored. This could have been
granted, in a twisted way, by putting her mind into a new body which could
channel. Another idea is that she asked for Rand/LTT to love her, and she
was put into a body which was reminiscent of the long-dead Ilyena. Of
course, this idea depends on Cyndane looking like Ilyena. The only thing
we know about Ilyena's looks is that she was blonde. Cyndane is also
blonde, although she is described as silver-blonde, while Ilyena was
golden-blonde. An objection to that idea is that Ilyena was the wife of a
very famous, prominent Aes Sedai, and as such, her appearance would have
been widely known (like, say, Hillary Clinton's is today). Surely Graendal
would have commented upon Cyndane's resemblance to Ilyena, if such a
resemblance did indeed exist.
<P>
<h2>If Cyndane is Lanfear, why was she mindtrapped?</h2>
Moghedien was mindtrapped for betraying the DO by teaching those who would
oppose the Shadow. What did Lanfear do to merit the same treatment? It's
simple: like Moghedien, she demonstrated that she could not be relied upon
to put the DO's interests over her own personal desires and needs, if a
conflict arose. She offered to ally with Rand to supplant the Creator and
the DO both. While this may have been just talk, she did enable, even
cause, Asmodean's defection. Essentially, she committed the same
transgression as Moghedien, albeit in a less direct fashion-- she helped
somebody opposing the Shadow learn skills which would make him more likely
to succeed. The conversion of Rand to the DO is a Shadow priority. If Rand
had remained ignorant of channelling, his lack of control could have
served as a powerful motivation to turn to the Dark Side. Providing a
non-Shadow-controlled tutor for Rand removed that motivation. Finally, her
psychotic episode at the Cairhien docks, where she tried to kill Rand, and
made a general hash of things, was a clear indication that she could not be
relied upon to act in the Shadow's best interests, without strong
supervision.
<h2>What about the body?</h2>
<P>
[John Hamby, Steven Cooper]
<P>
It has been proposed that the origninal owner of Cyndane's body was
Cabriana Mecandes. This is the AS who was tortured by Semirhage in LOC, to
get information for Halima's infiltration of the SAS. The evidence is
scant, but suggestive:
<P>
From [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 188-190]:
<UL>
<LI>"A pale-haired silk-clad woman..."
<LI>"The woman's blue eyes bulged."
<LI>"...her head flung from side to side, flailing her hair..."
</UL>
Cyndane is described as having "long silver hair and vivid blue eyes" [TPOD
12, New Alliances, 262]. The blue eyes and long hair match, and silver
hair and pale hair could be considered as matching also.
<P>
On the other hand, there are missing pieces in the description of Mecandes.
Cyndane is unusually short, and apparently has "huge tracts of land." (If
you don't understand that last bit, proceed to your local video store and
rent <CODE>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</CODE>.) Neither of these
distinguishing features is noted by Semirhage.
