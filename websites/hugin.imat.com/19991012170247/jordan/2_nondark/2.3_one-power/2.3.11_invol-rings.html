<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.3.11: What are "involuntary rings"?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 82], Moridin is waxing wroth on things which the
Third Agers can do which were not known in the AOL:
<blockquote>
"A way to Heal being severed.... Involuntary rings. Those Warders and the
bond they shared with their Aes Sedai.... whenever he thought he had the
measure of them, these <em>primitives</em> revealed some new skill, did
something that no one in his own Age had dreamed of."
</blockquote>
Quite a few people have expressed confusion over what "involuntary rings"
are; here is an explanation. A "ring" is a way of referring to a group of
linked channellers (such a group has been more commonly called a
"circle."). In [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 83], Moridin wonders about the
repercussions of Ny's group using the weather ter'angreal in "a ring"; the
implication being that he's wondering what would happen if they used it in
a circle. Thus, an "involuntary ring" refers to channellers being linked
against their will. We've seen this done, and know the device which makes
it possible--the a'dam. The mention of involuntary rings is a reference to
the damane, who are linked to the sul'dam involuntarily.
