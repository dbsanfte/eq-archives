<H1>Is Mat still linked to the Horn of Valere?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="AviPreg.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
There are two points in the story where Mat could be considered to have
died: when he was hung from the tree in Rhuidean, and when he got hit
by lightning in the raid on Caemlyn in <CITE>TFoH</CITE>. So, is he still linked
to the Horn?
</P>

Firstly, in Tear (<CITE>TSR: 15, 253, Into the Doorway, 177</CITE>):<BR>
[Snakey Answers to "What fate?"] &#96;To die, and live again, and live once more a part of what was!'

<H2>The first time Mat Died and Lived Again (Rhuidean)</H2>
<P>
"Letting sword and Power go, he ripped the rope away from Mat's
neck and pressed an ear to his friend's chest.  Nothing.
Desperately, he tore open Mat's coat and shirt, breaking the
leather cord that held a silver medallion on Mat's chest.  He
tossed the medallion aside, listened again.  Nothing.  No
heartbeat.  Dead.  No!  He'd be all right if I hadn't let him
follow me here.  I can't let him be dead!
</P>
<P>
"As hard as he could he pounded his fist against Mat's chest,
listened.  Nothing.  Again he hammered, listened.  Yes.  There.
A faint heartbeat.  It was.  So faint, so slow.  And slowing.
But Mat was still alive despite the heavy purple welt around his
neck.  He might yet be kept alive.
</P>
<P>
"Filling his lungs, Rand scrambled around to breathe into Mat's
mouth as strongly as he could.  Again.  Again..." (<CITE>TSR: 26, 437-8, The Dedicated, 306-7</CITE>)
</P>
<H2>The Second time Mat Died and Lived Again</H2>
<P>
Mat gets blasted by Rahvin's lightening in Rand's attack on
Caemlyn. He is "brought back to life" when Rand BFs Rahvin. However,
this is treading the knife edge of paradox, as does anything involving
BF. The way BF works is that it "rewinds" time, so that the actions
performed by a BF'd person never happened. Thus, Rahvin never shot
lightning at Mat. Thus, Mat did not die. Thus, he certainly did not
"die and live again." Or did he?
</P>
<H2>So, is he still tied to the Horn?</H2>
<H3>Contributed by John Novak</H3>
"We can agree that Mat actually died.  I do grant that we can disagree
and quibble over the binding of the Horn, but that's a different
matter.  On that note, Judy is correct: The phrasing that the
Amyrlin used at any rate was "So long as you live." (<CITE>TDR: 20, 233,
Visitations, 182</CITE>) I just wonder if anyone ever actually linked
themselves to the Horn before, then died and then came back to life.
In other words, is their knowledge absolute in this matter, or is
this just a turn of phrase?"
</P>
<P>
If the Caemlyn incident is the only time Mat Died and Lived Again,
then he is probably still linked to the Horn, due to the way BF works:
Mat gets toasted, the link to the Horn breaks. Rand BFs Rahvin, making
Mat not-having-died, and thereby unmaking the destruction of the link
to the Horn. (Non-linear time is a bitch, no?) If the Rhuidean
incident counts as Mat having died and lived again, then the question
of his being linked to the Horn is still up in the air: Does restoring
him to life restore the link?
