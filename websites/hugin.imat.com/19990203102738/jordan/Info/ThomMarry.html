<H1>Why do we think Thom will marry Moiraine?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="ThomMarry.html">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
(<CITE>TSR: 6, 126, Doorways, 90-1</CITE>):<BR>
Moiraine says she knows the face of the man she will marry better than El/Eg/Ny know their future husbands.
</P>
<P>
This could mean that she will never marry, but it could mean that she
really does know who she will end up marrying. Support for the latter case
is that, according to Elayne, Moiraine had some passion in her voice
when she mentioned husband, despite her attempts to then brush it off.
After going through the Tear twisted doorway, she immediately tells
Thom that he will live through the next set of adventures. This is
not the only case of such a thing; after the incident in Whitebridge
in <CITE>The Eye of the World</CITE>, Moiraine implies that Min saw something about Thom that
makes her think Thom wasn't killed by the Fade. She certainly
seems to have some sort of knowledge of Thom's future. Thom keeps
referring to Moiraine as a good-looking woman, with more and more
sincerity as time progresses, and discovers he no longer loves Morgase.
</P>
<P>
Possible scenario: How would she know who it was?  Being Aes Sedai, she'd
likely have a lot of chances, but here's a guess:  When Min describes
how her viewings work, her standard example is this: I see two people
who have never met and know they will marry -- and of course we had both
Thom and Moiraine in front of her in Baerlon.  So, this would also be
the reason why:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Moiraine was so sure Thom hadn't been killed by a Fade, despite Rand's and Mat's protestations
<LI>She tells Thom "I will see you again.  You will survive Tarabon." (<CITE>TSR: 17, 278, Deceptions, 195</CITE>)
</UL>
<P>
At this point, she is absolutely certain that she will see Thom again.
This is before she goes to Rhuidean and goes through the rings that show
possible futures. When she did that, she saw nothing beyond the
point where she tackled Lanfear through the Twisted Doorway. She thus
decided that Min (or whatever oracle led her to think she would see
Thom again) had been wrong. (<CITE>Sean Hillyard</CITE>)
</P>
<HR>
<H2><a NAME="Survey">Survey Says</a></H2>
<H3>Will Thom marry Moiraine, if she is alive?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Yes: 67% (151)
<LI>No: 25% (55)
<LI>Undecided:  8% (17)
