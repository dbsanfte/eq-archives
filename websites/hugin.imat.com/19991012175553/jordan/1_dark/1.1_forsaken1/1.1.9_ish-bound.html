<h1 align="center">1.1.9: Was Ishamael really bound?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
The widespread belief in Randland is that all thirteen Forsaken were
imprisoned with the DO when the Bore was sealed by LTT and the Hundred
Companions. However, this doesn't seem to be entirely true. Ishamael
appears bodily to LTT in the prologue to TEOTW. We know that he must really
be there, because he cures LTT's insanity so that he will realize what he
has done. From what we know of how channelling works, he could not have
done this if he was only some kind of astral projection. That scene takes
place shortly after the sealing of the Bore. So, Ishy was not bound right
when the DO and the other Forsaken were sealed away.
<P>
Furthermore, many events throughout the Third Age bear Ishy's
fingerprints-- the Trolloc Wars (the Trollocs invading Manetheren carried
the banner of Ba'alzamon), the creation and continued existence of the
Black Ajah, the War of the Hundred Years. Ishy claimed to have influenced
Hawkwing [TEOTW: 14, The Stag and Lion, 172].) The Third Age shows a
pattern of humanity being kept in a state of disarray. Whenever the people
showed signs of becoming unified (Compact of Ten Nations, Hawkwing's
empire), some cataclysmic event occurred to split things up again. This
worked out too well for the Shadow to be mere coincidence. Clearly, Ishy
was active and in control of the Shadow's forces for quite a bit of, if not
all of, the Third Age.
<P>
Furthermore, we have the research of the post-breaking historian Aran son of
Malan son of Senar (presumably an Ogier), as described in [Guide, 5, The
Dark One and the Male Forsaken, 52]. This person claims that "there were
sightings of, even encounters with, Ishamael after the Bore was sealed, in
fact perhaps as much as forty years after." The proposed theory is that "it
may have taken some years for Ishamael to be drawn fully into the trap
with the other Forsaken.... Ishamael might well be thrown out of the prison
holding the others and drawn back again on some regular cycle."
<P>
Finally, there is the bit in [Guide: 12, The Reign of the High King, 114-5]
about Hawkwing's advisor Jalwin Moerad. Moerad was a mysterious, shady
character who insinuated himself into Hawkwing's court in FY 973. Moerad
exhibited, "frequent long absences, a volatile temper, and a temperament
that more than one observer recorded as 'more than half insane.'" Shortly
after Moerad became a counselor (late summer FY 974), Hawkwing abruptly
turned against the AS (who had previously had a very close relationship
with Hawkwing). Moerad was contemptuous of AS. After Hawkwing's death,
Moerad advised the three nobles who "came the closest to seizing the whole
of Hawkwing's empire," and all three of them met untimely deaths. Finally,
"Moerad never aged from the day he first appeared to the day he vanished,
abruptly, some forty years later." The personality, the lack of aging, and
the forty years business, along with Ishy's claim that he influenced
Hawkwing make it clear that Moerad was Ishamael.
<P>
So, it seems like Ishy was somehow "partially bound." That is, he was not
completely locked away in the Dungeon Dimension with the rest of the
Forsaken and the DO. He was definitely free right after the sealing of the
Bore, and was most likely free at various points during the Third Age.
Obviously, he was also the first of the Forsaken to be completely freed of
the seals, by a long shot.
