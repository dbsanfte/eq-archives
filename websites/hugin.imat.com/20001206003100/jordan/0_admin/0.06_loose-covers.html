No, you are not alone in having the cover fall off of your PB copy of
TDR. What can you do about it? Patrick Nielsen Hayden says that you can
send the book to Tor, and they will send you a new copy. You can also
write a (snail- mail) letter of complaint to Tor. The address is on the
inside of the books. DO NOT SEND MEAN E-MAIL TO THE NICE TOR BOOKS
MAN!!!! IT IS NOT HIS FAULT!!! If you want to have a go at repairing
them yourself, Eric Ebinger provides instructions:
<P>
Materials needed:
<UL>
<LI> dry sandpaper 220 grit
<LI> Walthers Goo (available at finer model train stores everywhere)
<LI> one or more Wheel of Time books, Tor edition with loose or detached covers
</UL>
<P>
Instructions:
<OL>
<LI> If cover(s) are not yet completely detached, GENTLY and carefully detach
them. A small, sharp knife may be helpful.
<LI> Take sandpaper and briskly sand the back of spine of the book (on the
glue that failed to hold). Continue until the surface is slightly
rough (don't over-sand). This should only take 10-20 seconds of
sanding.
<LI> Lay the cover down on a flat surface with the outside DOWN. Gently sand
the inside of the binding (where the spine of the book would be,
if the book was still in its cover) until the wax coating is
removed. Do not over-sand! The objective is to remove the wax
coating so that the glue can get a grip.
<LI> Following directions on the package of Goo, spread glue on the binding
area of the cover. Orient the book so that it's orientation
matches that of the cover. Press the book binding down on the cover,
lift, wait two minutes,press the book binding back down on the cover,
and hold for two minutes.
<LI> Let dry overnight. The book should be better than new.
</OL>
<P>
I've also heard that applying heat, to re-melt the glue, works.
