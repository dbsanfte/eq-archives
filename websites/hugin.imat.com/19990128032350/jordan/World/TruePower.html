<H1>The "True Power"</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Khangure and Korda</H2>
<H3>So, what do we know about the "True Power"?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>It is the power of the Dark One. (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 412</CITE>)

<LI>The ability to use it is granted specifically by the DO (<CITE>ACOS: 25,
  Mindtrap, 419</CITE>). It may be that one must get permission each time one
  uses it ("The True Power was denied her [Moggy], of course--that
  could be drawn only with the Great Lord's blessing... (<CITE>ACOS: 25,
  Mindtrap, 416</CITE>)). This seems like a somewhat awkward way to run
  things, so maybe Moggy just means that she can't use it while she's
  on the DO's shit list.

<LI>"What can be done with the True Power is very similar to what can be
	done with the One Power." (<CITE>RJ, Amer. Online chat, 27 June, 1996</CITE>)

<LI>One sign of extensive TP use is the black dots in the eyes, which
  Moggy calls "saa." The dots are visible from both the outside (<CITE>ACOS:
  25, Mindtrap, 418</CITE>) and from the inside (<CITE>ACOS: 20, Patterns Within
  Patterns, 356</CITE>). We do not know whether the frequency at which an
  outside observer sees them is the same as that at which the user
  sees them. It seems likely that they come more frequently when one
  is actually using the TP, since the Watcher's dots come faster just
  before he uses it to "Travel": "The black flecks filled his eyes, a
  horizontal blizzard....To his ears, the world screamed as he used
  the TP to rip a small hole and step outside the Pattern."  (<CITE>ACOS:
  20, Patterns Within Patterns, 358</CITE>)

<LI>The TP is much more addictive than the OP. "In the
  long run, the TP was far more addictive than the OP; a strong will
  could hold down the desire to draw more saidar or saidin, but she
  [Moggy] did not believe the will existed strong enough to resist the
  TP, once the saa appear." (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 418</CITE>)

<LI>The TP is very dangerous, and has a high price. "The final price
  [for using the TP] was different, but no less terrible."  (<CITE>ACOS: 25,
  Mindtrap, 419</CITE>) "There was a price, to be sure, one that grew with
  each use, but he [the Watcher] had always been willing to pay the
  price when it was necessary."  (<CITE>ACOS: 20, Patterns Within Patterns,
  356</CITE>)

<LI>As far as Moggy knows, only 30 or 31 people have ever been granted
  the use of the TP. ("Only twenty-nine others have ever been
  granted..." (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 419</CITE>) I dunno if Moggy is counting
  herself in the 29 (i.e. only 29 others besides Moridin), or not
  (only 29 others besides the people in the room).

<LI>The Forsaken have the ability to use the TP. "Among the living, only
  the Chosen knew how to tap the TP..." (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 412</CITE>)

<LI>Even among the Forsaken, "few are foolish enough to [use the TP]
  except in case of dire need (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 412</CITE>)"

<LI>The TP can "neither be detected except by who wielded it." (<CITE>ACOS:
  20, Patterns Within Patterns, 356</CITE>) This is worded vaguely, but RJ
  has clarified it: "No one can tell if you're using the True Power
  except the Dark One, of course." (<CITE>RJ, Amer. Online chat, 27-6-96</CITE>)

<LI>If Moggy's knowledge of the TP is reliable, than only people who can channel the OP can use the TP. We
know this from the fact that as soon as Moggy realizes Moridin is a user of the TP, she immediately assumes
that he can channel: "This Moridin had tapped into the TP, and more than once. Much more. She knew that some
men who could channel survived in this time aside from al'Thor...but she had not expected the Great Lord to
allow one that particular honor." (<CITE>ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 418</CITE>)
</UL>
<P>
The TP is not new in ACOS. We've seen it and heard of it before:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In (<CITE>TEOTW, Prologue, Dragonmount, xi</CITE>) Ish uses it to "heal" LTT of his madness. '"I was never
very skilled at Healing, and I follow a different power now....I fear Shai'tan's healing is different from the
sort you know...." He extended his hands and the light dimmed as if a shadow had been laid across the sun.'

<LI>In Rand's fight with Ish in (<CITE>TDR: 55, What is Written in Prophecy, 570</CITE>), Ishy does something at
the end which, in retrospect, is almost certainly TP: '"I cannot be defeated! Aid me!" Some of the darkness
shrouding him drifted into his hands, formed into a ball so black it seemed to soak up even the light of
Callandor. Sudden triumph blazed in the flames of his eyes.'

<LI>In general, a lot of the weird stuff Ishy did can probably be attributed to the TP. Whenever he was seen,
he always had a "seething blackness" surrounding him, which "boiled up" when he was about to do something
nasty to Rand (example: the fight at the end of TGH when Ish gives Rand his first unhealable wound. Ish was
certainly one of the "fools" who used the TP in cases other than dire need. His lack of humanity is probably
part of the "price" one pays for using the TP. His glowing eyes and mouth might be some advanced version of
the saa. 

<LI>In (<CITE>TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 306</CITE>), it is mentioned that Lanfear/Mierin had said she "had found a
new source for the One Power," usable by both men and women. Considering that her "new source" turned out to
be the DO, it is very possible that this is a reference to the TP. Whether Lanfear knew that this was the DO
or not is a different argument...
</UL>
<H3>Wild Speculation:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The taint on saidin is due to the TP being mixed into saidin by the DO.
<LI>The black cords seen on some of the male Forsaken is not taint-protection, but a connection to the TP. The
problems with this idea are: 1) The female Forsaken have the ability to use the TP, but nobody has ever seen
the cords on a woman, and 2) Asmodean is one of the people the cords _were_ seen on (<CITE>TSR, 58, The Traps
of Rhuidean, p671</CITE>) and of all the Forsaken, Asm is, IMO, the least likely to use the TP, given its
dangers, especially for something (skimming) that could be accomplished via the much-less-dangerous OP.
