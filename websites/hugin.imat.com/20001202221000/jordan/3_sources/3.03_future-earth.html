<blockquote>
<CITE>The characters in the books are the source of many of our myths and
legends and we are the source of many of theirs. You can look two ways
along a wheel.</CITE> [RJ, America Online chat, 28 June, 1996]
<P>
<CITE>Time is a wheel. If you look in one direction, you are looking at
the past. If you just turn around and look in the other direction,
you are looking at the future. The books are set in our future
and in our past, depending on which way you look...</CITE> [RJ,
America Online conference, 20 October, 1994]

<P>
Here are some possible references to our world:
<P>
[TEotW: 4, The Gleeman, 43]:
<UL>
<LI><strong>John Glenn:</strong> "Tell us about Lenn," Egwene called. "How he
flew to the moon in the belly of an eagle made of fire. Tell about his
daughter Salya walking among the stars." (Eagle has landed.../Lenn may be
a merger of LEM (lunar module) and Glenn)
<LI>Salya: <strong>Sally Ride</strong>?
<LI><strong>Moscow, ICBMs</strong>: Mosk the Giant, with his Lance of Fire that
could reach around the world.
<LI><strong>America</strong>: Merk the other giant.
<LI><strong>Queen Elizabeth</strong>: Alsbet, queen of all. (Remains of
British Empire/Commonwealth?)
<LI><strong>Mother Theresa</strong>: Materese the Healer, Mother of the
Wondrous Ind
<LI><strong>Anne Landers</strong>: Anla, the wise counselor?
</UL>
<P>
[TEotW: 24, Flight Down the Arinelle, 300]: Bayle Domon mentions a
"mountain hollowed into a bowl, and in its center, a silver spike a hundred
spans high, and any who comes within a mile of it, dies." This could
possibly be a big radio telescope, or maybe the Age of Legends equivalent.
<P>
[TGH: 47, The Grave Is No Bar to My Call, 559]: "Michael instead of Mikel.
Patrick instead of Paedrig. Oscar instead of Otarin." St. Michael and
St. Patrick? I don't know of a St. Oscar.
<P>
[TGH: 49, What Was Meant To Be, 574]: Loial is reading 'To Sail Beyond the
Sunset'-- reference to Tennyson's poem <strong>"Ulysses"</strong>
<P>
[TSR: 11, What Lies Hidden, 146-7]<br>
In Tanchico Museum at the Panarch's Palace:
<UL>
<LI>Stylized Three-Pointed Triangle (reeking of greed and pride)--
<strong>Mercedes Benz logo</strong>
<LI>Skeletons of Giraffe and Elephant
</ul>
<P>
[TSR: 24, Rhuidean, 277]: <STRONG>Gautama Buddha</strong>-- Ghoetam under
the tree of life
