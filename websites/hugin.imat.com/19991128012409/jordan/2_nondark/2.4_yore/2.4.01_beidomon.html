<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.4.1: Who was Beidomon?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
Beidomon was a male channeller in the AOL who worked with Mierin (aka
Lanfear) to create the Bore. The question is, was he somebody important to
the story, or was he just some poor grad student?
<P>
We know that he wasn't one of the male Forsaken. In the Guide, we learn
all of their original names, and what they did before turning to the Dark
Side. None of them were named "Beidomon," and none of them did the kind of
research into the One Power which Lanfear did (<A HREF="../../1_dark/1.1_forsaken1/1.1.1_forsaken.html">See section 1.1.1</A>).
<P>
It has been suggested that LTT was Beidomon, based on the fact that he and
Mierin were lovers at one point, and upon a few scanty quotes. One of
these is from [TEOTW: Prologue, Dragonmount, xv]: "he who brought the
shadow...they named Dragon." The other is [TEotW: 4, The Gleeman, 44]: "I
will tell you of the end of the Age of Legends, of the Dragon, and of his
attempt to free the Dark One into the world of men." However, this idea
does not hold water. For one thing, LTT was named "Lews Therin Telamon,"
not "Beidomon." Secondly, we know from [Guide: 6, The Female Forsaken and
the Darkfriends, 62] that LTT dumped Mierin "some years before the drilling
of the Bore." Thirdly, LTT was a politician/bureaucrat, the leader of the
Hall of Servants, not a researcher [Guide: 3, The Age of Legends, 31].
Furthermore, the bits about him that brought the Shadow being named Dragon
are from the late Third Age and the Fourth Ages, long after true details
were confused and forgotten.
<P>
The best guess we can make, based on the scanty evidence we have, is that
Beidomon was just some guy who was part of Mierin's research group, who
assisted her in the actual drilling. The Guide [Guide: 6, The Female
Forsaken and the Darkfriends, 63] tells us that Mierin was "fortunate to be
one of the few to survive the backlash that destroyed the Sharom and most of
the Collam Daan." In other words, there were few survivors from that
catastrophe, and it is likely that Beidomon, whoever he was, died then and
there.
