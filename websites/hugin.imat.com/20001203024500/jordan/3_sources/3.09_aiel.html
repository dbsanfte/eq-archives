In reviewing the theories on the Aiel and who they
represent, I have not found any references to any other cultures
other than the thirteen tribes of Israel. At first glance I would
also have agreed with this theory if I had not been initiated into
Native American culture, and in particular the philosophies and
history of the plains Indian tribes.
<P>
In reviewing their histories I have come across many
similar tales in various tribes where the people were either
forced to move to a new home or, for some unknown reason, chose
to make the move of their own accord. The most notable would be
the forced move of the Cherokee. This tribe could very easily pass
for the peaceful Aiel who were forced to move to the hot dry lands
of the Aiel waste, a very fitting analogy for Oklahoma. However,
due to the fact that they never became a serious threat in later
years I have to discount them unless the Aiel are considered a
blend of various tribes.
<P>
The two most notable tribes which I have encountered
to date would be the Cheyenne and the Kiowa. Both tribes have
tales which tell of their people moving from their ancestral home
in search of a new home. There is a line in the Cheyenne tale
which specifically says ' where every hand was raised against us'.
This line I also believe was used by the Aiel in describing their
migration. The Cheyenne were also made up of thirteen clans
according to the original histories I have encountered about
them. Having been an integral part of the Algonquin society of the
northeastern tribes they were also a peaceful people until after
their move to the northern plains. Their encroachment into other
tribes' territories and the resulting wars is the most probable
reason they became an extremely efficient warrior society.
The Kiowa also have a tale of their movement from somewhere in the
northwest area of the United States where they had to fight all
the way to their current home, which I believe is in the Oklahoma
territory, ending up with fewer than 300 people in the tribe.
They also became an efficient warrior society due to their move
and the expansion of the European colonists in later years.
<P>
The rituals of the Aiel are also distinctly Native
American. The sweat baths taken by the wise ones and other Aiel
are a definitive ritual of Plains Indian culture. (It may also
be a part of other native American cultures but I have only been
involved with the plains Indians and the Crow tribe to be specific.)
The sweat lodge was described rather well by RJ, so I will not go
into detail, but I know of no Israelite tales of sweat ceremonies
or baths. The other ritual most notably used is the vision quest.
This entails the seeker of the vision going out into the
wilderness, stripping down to the bare flesh, and fasting for
three to four days until a vision (hallucination from lack of
food) is seen. In some tribes a 'sponsor' goes along as well to
let the rest of the tribe know what is happening. This, of course,
sounds just like Rand and Mat's trip into Rhuidean where they
journey into the unknown without food or water, Rand has his
'vision' of his ancestors (another typical Indian philosophy),
and they return three days later. I am not surprised if no one
else had caught this, having been on a vision quest I did not catch
this until I read it a second time and I was still unsure of
it being one.
<P>
The thing that surprised me the most is the fact that no
one has, to my knowledge, mentioned the fact that the Aiel
warrior societies all sound distinctly Native American. I can
understand about the clan names, two of which sound Japanese to
me, but with names like Thunder Walkers, Brothers of the Eagle,
Mountain Dancers, and Stone Dogs, I was surprised the connection
had not been brought up before (to my knowledge). Being a Crazy
Dog of the Crow Indian Nation I was pleased to note the connection
between Stone Dogs and my own warrior society. Of course, Crazy Dogs
drive a stake into the ground and tie their left leg to it in order
to show they have no fear while protecting the tribe. I have yet to
see an Aiel do that.
<P>
There were also tribe in the Northeast where each clan had a
central meeting house. They also had a female as the leader of the
clan. In order to gain entrance to the house permission was granted
by her, like the Aiel House Mistress.
<P>
One last note, The more observant will have realized that
the plains Indians were masters of the horse. But, if you could
run as fast as one too, why bother?
<P>
It seems RJ patterned a great deal of the Aiel society after
the Native American Indians
<P>
Tony Z. adds, "The thing with spear/shield, and then the Aiel battle
tactics that Lan describes to Rand, for instance, are pretty much
lifted from the Zulus."
