Soldier, Aiel)</h1>

<h2>Who is the Green Man?</h2>
<P>
He is Someshta, the last of the Nym, a type of creature which was made of
vegetable matter. He is described first in [TEotW: 49, The Dark One Stirs,
621]. However we find out exactly who he is in the fourth book. [TSR: 26,
The Dedicated, 303]:
<blockquote>
A stir at the end of the field told him one of the Nym was
approaching. The great form, head and shoulders and chest
taller than any Ogier, stepped out onto the seeded ground, and
Coumin did not have to see to know he left footprints filled with
sprouting things. It was Someshta, surrounded by clouds of
butterflies, white and yellow and blue...Each field would have
its Nym, now...the Nym were older than anyone. Some said the
Nym never died, not so long as plants grew...
</blockquote>
Many years later, during the Breaking, we see him again, this time with the
characteristic fissure in his face. He is being set to the task of
guarding the Eye of the World, the Horn, the dragon banner and one of the
seals [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 300-1].
<h2>Who were the Aiel?</h2>
<P>
The Aiel (formerly the Da'shain Aiel) were the 'Dedicated' who worked for
the Ancient Aes Sedai. The group was hereditary and had features of light
skin, gray or blue eyes and mostly reddish or blond hair. All Aiel could
be identified by their particular hair style which was cut short with a
tail hanging in the back. They were dedicated to a life of non-violence,
following the 'way of the leaf'. Some male Aiel worked with the Ogier and
the Nym in planting as they had the gift of the 'Voice', the seed singing
(this may not be limited to Aiel; in the TEOTW prologue, LTT asks Elan
Morin if he has the Voice). Although the Ogier continue to have 'tree
singers', the Voice seems to be a talent that has disappeared. When the
Aiel did their work in the fields, they wore light gray and brown 'working
clothes' (cadin'sor). The clothes, the hair style and the avoidance of the
use of weaponry which cannot be used for other purposes than killing people
remains today, but the talent of the Voice is currently unknown.
<h2>What is the Song?</h2>
<P>
The Tinkers, an early offshoot of the Aiel, decided to give up their duty
of hiding *'angreal and instead dedicate their lives to re-finding the
safety and peace of their past [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 296]. They
believe this will come about through finding the "growing song," described
in [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 303]:
<blockquote>
The Ogier began it, as was fitting, standing to sing, great bass
rumbles like the earth singing. The Aiel rose, men's voices lifting in
their own song, even the deepest at a higher pitch than the Ogier's.
Yet the songs braided together, and Someshta took those threads and
wove them into his dance... The song caught him up, and he almost felt
that it was himself, not the sounds he made that Someshta wove into the
soil and around the seeds.
</blockquote>
<P>
The Song is not to be confused with the Ogier Tree-Songs. The Ogier songs
may be the Ogier part of the growing ceremony described above, or they may
be something similar, but different in purpose.
<P>
For the Tinkers, "The Song" has become more than just the human part
of the AOL growing ceremony. The Tinkers' legendary song is something
that will bring back the peaceful lifestyle known by the Dashain Aiel
during the Age of Legends. Teri Petit explains, "The Tuatha'an began
their search looking for a safe haven where they could return to a way
of life in which Aiel singing together worked wonders. That eventually
got distorted into a life of perpetual travel searching for "The
Song", as if there were just one, and it was something a single
traveler could know." [TSR: 26, The Dedicated, 296]
<P>
So, when we say "Will the Tinkers find the Song?" we really mean,
"Will the Tinkers rediscover the AoL growing ceremony, plus the talent
of the Voice, and be able to recreate the peaceful existence of their
ancestors, the Da'shain Aiel?"
<h2>If the Song will be found, who will find it?</h2>
<P>
The primary contenders are Aram, Perrin and Rand. Aram's stated life goal
had been to find the Song until he took up the sword in defense of Emond's
Field and became 'Lost' to his people. To find the Song would reinstate
him and justify his choice of giving up the peaceful Way of the Leaf.
Perrin on the other hand keeps getting faced with the choice of axe or
hammer: that is, the choice of creation or destruction, war or peace,
way-of-the-warrior or way-of-the-leaf. Furthermore, Perrin is a contender
to find the Song because of Min's viewing of Perrin standing among the
flowering trees. Rand, and probably some of the Aiel clan chiefs, have
actually <EM>heard</EM> the Song in the glass columns of Rhuidean.
<P>
Further Evidence that Rand will find the Song:
<blockquote>
...ages past and will be in ages to come. <em>Let the Prince of the
Morning sing to the land that green things will grow</em> and the
valleys give forth lambs." [TEotW: Prologue, Dragonmount, xv]
(Emphasis mine)
</blockquote>
<P>
It is entirely possible that the Song is lost forever (or at least until
the Age of Legends comes around again). Aaron Bergman explains: "In the
breaking that followed the sealing of the bore, the Da'Shain were
scattered. Some ended up at Rhuidean with the caravans. Some broke off,
eventually becoming the Tinkers. Anyways, during those times when
mountains moved around when they were bored and food and water were scarce,
the memory of the singing survived. This grew to become linked with the
memory of the peace of the Age of Legends. This easily progressed to the
idea that if they could discover this ephemeral "Song," the Age of Legends
would come anew. I think one of the themes buried in these novels is that
the past is dead. You can't hope to regain the past. Rand can't go back
to the Two Rivers and become a shepherd. The Age of Legends is dead, it
will not return for a very long time; certainly not in the next (Fourth)
Age. The Tuatha'an are seeking to regain the past. The "Song" is a
remnant of the past. Thus, the Song will not be found." There is no Song
that will recreate the Age of Legends, for it is past.
