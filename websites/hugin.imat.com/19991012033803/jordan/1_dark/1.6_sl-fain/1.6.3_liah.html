<h1 align="center">1.6.3: What was up with Liah in Shadar Logoth?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
How did Liah manage to stay alive in Shadar Logoth from the time she
got lost in LOC to the end of ACOS?
<P>
RJ says:
<blockquote>
"She became absorbed into the city. She was left there and she is,
after all, a Aiel, one of the people better at surviving under harsh
circumstances than anyone else in the world. And also her corruption
by Shadar Logoth gave her *some* protection." [America Online chat session,
27 June, 1996]
</blockquote>
<P>
What happened to Liah was probably akin to what happened to Mat when he
carried the Shadar Mandarb in TEOTW. Her behavior (attacking all comers)
supports this belief. I guess that being bonded to Shadar Logoth must give
one some protection from Mashadar, although obviously not enough, since it
got her in the end.
