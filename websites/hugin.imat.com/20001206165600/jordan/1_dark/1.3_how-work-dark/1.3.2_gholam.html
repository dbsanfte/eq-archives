<h1 align="center">1.3.2: Fifty Ways to Kill a Gholam</h1>
<hr>
<P>
The Gholam seems to be the hardest-to-kill monster RJ has introduced thus
far. What, exactly, is it? We have information on it from Birgitte, who
has some memories of the War of Power, [ACOS: 40, Promises to Keep,
606-607], from Elayne, Mat, etc's encounter with one in [ACOS: 39, Six
Stories, 598-600], and from the short gholam POV scene in [TPOD: 2,
Unweaving, 84-85].
<P>
Gholam were created by Aginor [LOC, 23, To Understand a Message, 347] for
the express purpose of killing channellers, although they're pretty handy
at killing non-channellers, as well. The OP can't touch them; the effect
of channelling at a gholam is exactly the same as channelling at a person
wearing Mat's foxy medallion (i.e. the flows break apart on contact).
Furthermore, they are immune to conventional weapons, too: nobody is able
to harm the one who Mat fights with swords, etc, and the gholam itself
thinks "it had never encountered anything that could harm it. Until that
man with the medallion" [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 84]. They can sense the
ability to channel at a distance of about 50 paces, and they can detect use
of the OP at greater distances (it felt the channelling at the Kin's
farm). They look like normal human beings on the outside. Inside is
another matter. They have no bones, and can squeeze under a door, and are
very strong, and very quick. (Think the T-1000 from <CITE>Terminator 2:
Judgment Day</CITE>.) Only six were ever made; three have a masculine
outward appearance, three feminine. They have at least a rudimentary
intelligence (Mat chats with the one he fights in Ebou Dar), and they are
living things, not some sort of machine. (Mat surmises (actually, Birgitte
surmises) that the one they met was "kept alive" since the Breaking in a
stasis box.) They feed on blood. There is some way to control a gholam,
and force it to do one's bidding. The Ebou Dar gholam thinks: "The one who
commanded it wanted [Mat] dead.... for the time being, it was constrained.
For its entire existence it had been compelled to obey one or another
human, but its mind held the concept of not being constrained [TPOD: 2,
Unweaving, 84-85].
<P>
We can draw some further conclusions, namely, that unlike the T1000,
they don't have the ability to assume any form, only liquid form and
their humanoid form. (If not, why specify that 3 are male-shaped, and
3 are female-shaped?)
<P>
Where have we seen gholam? We've seen two for certain, namely the one
in Ebou Dar, and the one that killed poor Herid Fel in Cairhien at the
end of LOC. There is one previous possible gholam encounter, which
took place "off-screen." This is the killing of Lord Barthanes in
TGH. Barthanes was clearly killed at Ishy's instigation because he
helped the renegade DF, Padan Fain, get away with the Horn of
Valere. Barthanes died in a very similar fashion to Fel, i.e. he was
ripped limb-from-limb. Furthermore, this took place in the <em>same</em>
building as Fel's demise. Again, this may or may not be a
gholam-induced death, but it is worth mentioning as a possibility.
<h2>How can you hurt/kill/dispose of a Gholam?</h2>
The only thing we know for certain that can injure a gholam is Mat's foxy
medallion. When Mat smacks the Ebou Dar gholam with it in [ACOS: 38, Six
Stories, 598], the gholam was burned-- "The medallion fell across the man's
cheek. The man screamed. Smoke rose around the edges of the foxhead, and
a sizzle like bacon frying....A raw red brand marked where the foxhead had
fallen." What we do not know is <em>why</em> the medallion hurt the
gholam. There are two possibilities:
<P>
<h3>It's the magic, stupid</h3>
Both the medallion and the gholam have the unusual property that they
somehow neutralize flows of the OP. (Note that the actual mechanism
employed by each may be different.) It is possible that some kind of
adverse reaction occurred when the medallion came into contact with
the gholam's body. While the medallion didn't get characteristically
cold, it did seemingly get hot.
<P>
It is difficult to be more precise, because we don't know how either
the medallion or the gholam actually work. Perhaps it is because the
gholam are made with/are held together with/have some connection with
the OP, and the medallion negates the OP. Or, perhaps it's a "like
charges repel" sort of deal. Or, maybe the gholam is a kind of "living
ter'angreal," and the effect is due to an adverse reaction between
similar ter'angreal, as described in [TDR: 23, Sealed, 217]. If it is the
case that the magic is the key, then a gholam could probably be killed
by prolonged contact with some weapon/ter'angreal made to copy the
medallion's effect. This is problematic, bc the medallion is currently
buried under a wall, along with its wearer.
<P>
An argument against the theory that the medallion's ability to negate flows
is the key, is that then the gholam probably would have been hurt by
contact w/ Mat himself, and not just the foxhead. [James Huckaby] Then
again, maybe not. As stated above, we don't <EM>really</EM> know how the
medallion works. It was pointed out that when Mat was wrestling the
gholam, the foxhead fell out of Mat's "open" shirt: "Struggling for air, he
[Mat] pushed himself up, foxhead dangling from his open shirt." [ACOS: 38,
Six Stories, 597] So, if the medallion works only when it is in contact
with the wearer, then Mat may not have been in contact w/ it when <EM>he</EM>
touched the gholam. [Jason Wilson] Of course, this objection does not
apply to the idea that the reaction was due to the "similar ter'angreal
interference" effect.
<P>
<h3>You've got the silver</h3>
The medallion is made out of silver [TSR, 26, The Dedicated, 306-307],
and this is the key to its anti-Gholam capabilities. The argument for
silver is more of an argument against the medallion's magical properties,
combined with some cross-pollination from werewolf and vampire legends. It
is not likely that the foxhead works because it is destroying flows,
because the foxhead doesn't get cold after damaging the gholam, it just has
"the cool of silver." [ACOS: 38, Six Stories, 598] Loony idea: When the
gholamstuff and silver come into contact, there is a chemical reaction.
This reaction is exothermic--the heat is produced by the reaction, not by
the medallion.
<P>
An argument against this theory is that it seems kind of silly. Why
would the Forsaken make such specific, deadly anti-AS assassins if they have
such a common, easily exploitable Achilles' heel? Why would the
Forsaken be so wary of them that they limited their number to six?
[Tim Yoon]--"Oh No! A gholam's chasing us!" "How much money do you
have on you?" [Aaron Bergman] The former question can be rationalized
by saying that the Forsaken counted on the fact that people wouldn't
think to use silver on something the OP can't stop. This idea does NOT
explain the objection that if it was so easily defeated if you knew
the key, the Forsaken wouldn't have been so wary of it that they only
made six. Furthermore, the Gholam thinks to itself [TPOD: 2, Unweaving,
84] that "it had never encountered anything that could harm it" until it
met the medallion. In all of its existence it never encountered a common
metal like silver? Unlikely.
<P>
<h2>Got any more bright ideas?</h2>
Many. Here are some of the more popular ideas for how to get rid of a Gholam:
<P>
1) Indirect effects of the OP: The gholam's material breaks up OP
flows just like Mat's medallion, making it immune to the OP. Like the
wearer of the foxhead, it is likely that this immunity doesn't extend
to <em>indirect</em> effects. One could try dropping something heavy on it,
or zapping it with lightning, or something like that. Doubtless, it is
immune to some of these (considering its oozey nature, I doubt
dropping a safe on it would have much permanent effect), but something
might work. Balefire probably won't work; it is very likely a
<em>direct</em> effect.
<P>
2) The T-1000 Effect: Melt it. If one channelled enough heat into it,
or dropped it into a volcano, it might lose all molecular
cohesion. Furthermore, we know it is vulnerable to heat: the heat
generated when the medallion touches it cooks its "flesh" (I use the
term loosely.).
<P>
3) One of These Days, I'm Going to Cut You Into Little Pieces: while
stabbing a gholam doesn't hurt it, it may be that if you dismember it,
and separate its pieces far enough (perhaps by the judicious use of
Gateways), it won't be able to reassemble itself. Then again, maybe it
would. Using a Gateway to cut it (like Graendal's poor servant in
[LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 137]) probably wouldn't work-- the
edges of the Gateway are made of Power, and so the Gate would dissolve
upon touching the gholam.
<P>
4) Out of This World: Open a Gateway to the Skimming Place. Knock the
gholam through (throw a big rock at it, or something), and close the
Gateway. According to Egwene, the chances of ever opening into that
bit of Skimming Space are very low, so chances are the gholam will be
permanently Lost in Space.
