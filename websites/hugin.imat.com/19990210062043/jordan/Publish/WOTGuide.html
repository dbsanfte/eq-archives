"Also, Jody Lynn Nye, Todd Cameron Hamilton, et. al., are hard at work
on a compendium, "Guide to the Wheel of Time."  They have already
produced similar books for Anne McCaffrey's Pern &amp; Piers Anthony's
Xanth. The Guide to the Wheel of Time is scheduled to be released
with the paperback of Lord of Chaos sometime next fall." (<CITE>Roxanne

Well, this obviously didn't happen. The last we heard from PNH, the
Guide is still being written, and won't be out until sometime in 1997.

Here's a bit of what RJ has to say about the Guide:<BR>
"There is an illustrated guide to the world of the Wheel of Time in the
works.  It is planned to have 64 color illustrations and 80,000 words
or so of text and it will include a good bit of information that I did
not intend to put in the books. There will be a map of the entire
world in the illustrated guide." (<CITE>Amer. Online chat, 27-6-96</CITE>)
