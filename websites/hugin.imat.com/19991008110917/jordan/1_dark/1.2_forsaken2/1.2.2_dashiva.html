<P>
Corlan Dashiva is, to all appearances, a nasty, Taint-maddened psychopath
of an Asha'man. However, many people think this is simply a cover for a
Halima-type infiltration of the Black Tower by the DO's other Gar. In the
case of Taim and Demandred
(<A HREF="../1.1_forsaken1/1.1.6_taimandred.html">see Section 1.1.6</A>),
there are many
arguments for why the character under suspicion could be a Forsaken, and
little, if any, evidence which appears to be inconsistent with that idea.
This is not the case with Dashiva. There are many good arguments in favor
of him being Osan'gar. There are also many good arguments against that
proposition. There are even some pieces of "evidence" which can be argued
either way. Here, we present the arguments in favor of Dashiva=Osan'gar,
and rebuttals, then we present the evidence which, depending on one's
interpretation, can support or undermine the proposition. We end with
arguments against Dashiva=Osan'gar, and rebuttals.
<h2>Evidence that Dashiva is Osan'gar</h2>
<P>
After LoC, I was certain that Osan'gar was an Asha'man. Now I believe
that it must be Corlan Dashiva. I base this idea on the following
circumstantial evidence, each piece of which alone proves nothing, but
the totality of which, I believe, is best explained by Dashiva being
Osan'gar. [Michael Gonzalez]
<P>
<strong>1) Similarity of appearance</strong>: Dashiva is a middle-aged man
from the Black Hills [ACoS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 84], parts of which are
near, if not in, the Borderlands. Osan'gar has the body of a middle-aged
Borderlander. Osan'gar has an "ordinary" face while Dashiva has a "plain"
face [ACoS: 36, Blades, 571].
<P>
<strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Looking at the map, the Black Hills region is
bigger than some countries. It starts SE of Saldaea, and extends SE to
just SW of Tar Valon. Granted, the Black Hills region is sparsely
populated, and given that people live there at all, it is reasonable to
suppose that the most populous parts are those near established nations, or
trade routes. One would expect people to live in the NW part, near Saldaea
and Kandor, the SE part, near Tar Valon, and along the River Luan, which
stretches down the southeastern two-thirds of the hills, and along the
Maradon-Tar Valon road, which stretches along the whole length of the
hills. This leaves a great deal of leeway for Dashiva's origins. There is
no evidence that Dashiva is a Borderlander, only that he MIGHT be.
Furthermore, the physical descriptions we have for both men are rather
sketchy, and the validity of noting similarities between such minimal
descriptions is questionable.
<P>
<strong>2) Swordsmanship</strong>: Dashiva seems to Rand to be
physically awkward (getting used to a new body?) and unfamiliar with
wearing a sword; to Rand, he "did not seem to know one end from the other."
One wonders how many Borderlanders growing up on isolated farms have never
learned to use a sword, given that the Trollocs have been more of less
constantly raiding Borderland farms for the last couple thousand years or
so.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG> One would expect very few <em>Black Hills
farmers</em> to know how to use a <em>sword</em>. For one thing, even the
northern portions of the Black Hills have the Borderland countries of Kandor
and Saldaea between them and the Blight. It's doubtful that many Trolloc
raids come so far south, through the armed opposition of the Borderlanders.
Even if our Black Hills farmer <em>did</em> worry about being attacked,
it's doubtful that he'd use a <em>sword</em> for home defense. As we know
from many references, such as people's reaction to Rand's sword in TEOTW
and Mat's fight with Galad and Gawyn in Tar Valon, swords are not farmers'
weapons. For one thing, they are expensive and require training. The
Black Hills is an impoverished, sparsely-populated area. Where would a
Black Hills farmer get the money for a sword, let alone training?
Secondly, as the Aiel are so fond of pointing out, swords aren't useful for
any other purpose. A farmer who fights is more likely to use a
quarterstaff, a bow, or, at most, some sort of pike or spear.
<P>
<STRONG>3) Horsemanship</STRONG>: Dashiva is a lousy rider: "Dashiva,
slumped in his gray's saddle like a man who had never seen a horse
before..." [TPOD: 13, Floating Like Snow, 287]. If Dashiva really was a
farmer, wouldn't he know how to ride a horse? He'd have to use horses to
get his crops to market, plough his fields, etc. Note that none of the Two
Riversians have problems with riding. Poverty can't be used as an excuse,
because Dashiva claims that he was a great buyer of books (see below).
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Maybe Dashiva used all his money for books, and
thus couldn't afford a horse? Seriously, though, assuming that he had
enough money to afford books <em>and</em> animals, he needn't be very
practiced at riding. For one thing, Dashiva could have used oxen instead
of horses for ploughing, etc. In addition, there is a difference between using a horse for
pulling a cart or a plow and actually riding one-- the skills are
definitely different. Also, there's a difference between sitting bareback
on your plowhorse as it ambles down the path and riding an animal that's
trained for war, or at least to be active.
<p>
<strong>4) The Great Outdoors</strong>: Dashiva doesn't like the outdoors:
"Despite being a farmer, Dashiva disliked being out-of-doors unless the
skies were clear." [TPOD: 13, Floating Like Snow, 287] This isn't exactly
consistent with his story.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Maybe, maybe not. A farmer may be used to
being outside in bad weather, but that doesn't mean he has to like it.
Doing farm chores in the rain and snow is hardly a pleasant pastime.
<P>
<Strong>5) Old Tongue</strong>: Dashiva is fluent in the Old Tongue, and
talks to himself in it all the time. "Dashiva... muttered angrily under
his breath. In the Old Tongue, which he spoke and read as fluently as a
scholar. Rand knew a little, though not enough to understand what the
fellow was mumbling." [TPOD: 13, Floating Like Snow 287] Dashiva claims
that this ability is self-taught: "I read a great deal on the farm. Every
book the peddlers brought by." [ACOS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 89]. The Old
Tongue is not very common. Not to mention, you can't <em>speak</em> a
language fluently if you've only learned it by reading. Even weirder is
that Dashiva <em>talks to himself</em> in the Old Tongue-- how many people
do you know who carry on a continual monologue in Latin? This is one of
the strongest indications that there is Something Up With Dashiva, if not
<em>the</em> strongest.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Dashiva's story could conceivably be true,
although it's really a stretch. However, if Dashiva was a Forsaken, why
would he do something which is such a giveaway?
<P>
<STRONG>6) Strength in the OP</STRONG>: When Rand awakens after being
stabbed by Fain, Dashiva is holding almost as much saidin as Rand himself
could have [ACoS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 639]. In TEoTW, Aginor (who is
now Osan'gar) is described as supposedly being not much less powerful than
Lews Therin or Ishamael. Furthermore, remember how in the beginning
of LOC Rand orders Taim to report any man who learns too quickly? And how
in the middle of LOC Taim appears and reports Narishma? As of TPOD Narishma
is still significantly weaker than Flinn and Rand. But Dashiva never gets
reported. Strange, wouldn't you say?
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Dashiva could just be a strong channeller. Many
of the Asha'man are very strong. Other possible explanations are: 1)
Dashiva is the one who took Rand's fat-man angreal which he couldn't find
after the battle at Dumai's Wells. Thus, Dashiva + angreal = Rand, but
Dashiva by himself is weaker than Rand. Recall that a man can only sense
how much power another man is holding at the moment, not what his natural
potential is. 2) Rand was in a weakened state then, and was not able to
draw as much Saidin as he normally could. When RJ says "Dashiva held
almost as much as Rand could have," he means he held as much as Rand, at
the moment, could have. Tired channellers cannot hold as much of the OP,
so that would make the amount Dashiva held seem less spectacular. As for
Taim not reporting Dashivan'gar as a fast learner, if this is to be counted
as evidence, then one must suppose that Taim (be he Demandred or not)
<em>knows</em> that Dashiva is Osan'gar. If Taim=Dem, then this implies
that the two of them are cooperating, something which doesn't fit with
Taim's general disapproval of Dashiva, or his anger at Dashiva joining the
staged "defection" at the end of TPOD. It also doesn't fit with the idea
that Dashivan'gar was placed in the Black Tower to keep an eye on Demandred
(See below).
<P>
<strong>7) Speech Patterns</strong>: Dashiva talking to Rand about the
danger of riding up to the palace in Cairhien in [ACOS:4, Into Cairhien,
108]: "All it needs is one man with a... a bow or a knife, and you don't
see him in time." Did he need to think a moment for the word "bow?" Was
he thinking "shocklance" or some other AoL weapon? When asked by Rand if
he believes Rand's enemies have been asleep while he was away, Dashiva
says, "I...grew up on a farm" ... "I don't know much about having
enemies." Someone having to pause a sec to remember his cover story?
<P>
<strong>Rebuttal</strong>: This, and Dashiva's other incidents of
mindwandering, are easily explained by Dashiva being "a daydreamer, and
maybe the taint on saidin is touching his brain already." [ACOS: 2,
The Butcher's Yard, 84]
<P>
<strong>8) More Dashiva talking</strong>: Talking about healing: [ACOS: 36,
Blades, 573] "Flinn knows what he is about. Already he can do things you
<em>Aes Sedai</em> never dreamed of." (emphasis in original) Standard Forsaken
derogatory emphasis on "Aes Sedai"; When Sammael mentions Aes Sedai to
Carridin in [ACOS: 15, Insects, 289] the emphasis is presented identically.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: That could be arrogant contempt for Aes Sedai in
general, which seems to be a common trait among the whole Black Tower
crowd. Not to mention, consider who the Asha'man have been learning from.
Taim certainly has no love for AS, he has undoubtedly instilled his dislike
in his students.
<P>
<STRONG>9) Still More Dashiva Talking:</STRONG> While Flinn Heals Rand in
[ACOS: 36, Blades, 573]: '"Get on with it, Flinn," Dashiva muttered.
"If he dies...." Nose wrinkled as though at a bad smell, he seemed
unable to look away from Rand. His lips moved as he talked to
himself, and once he made a sound, half sob, half bitter laugh,
without his face changing one line.' Sounds like someone who doesn't
like Rand and wouldn't mind seeing him die, but is charged by someone
fear-inspiring with making sure Rand doesn't die too soon.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Or someone who is about three minutes from
stripping naked and howling at the moon, confronted with the thought of the
one man powerful enough to protect him and the other channelling men from
dying a wretched death at Aes Sedai hands, not to mention keeping the Dark
One from taking over the world. Furthermore, the concern for Rand's life
which this argument ascribes to Dashivan'gar is utterly at odds with the
fact that he tried to turn Rand into a crispy critter at the end of TPOD.
<P>
<STRONG>10) Reaction to Saidin-cleansing</STRONG>: When Rand speaks of
cleansing Saidin everyone looks hopeful, EXCEPT Dashiva, he looks
"poleaxed". The exact quote is, "Rand had not realized he had spoken any
of his thoughts [about cleansing saidin] aloud. Narishma's eyes, and
Morr's, and Hopwil's, belonged in one face, shining with sudden hope.
Dashiva looked poleaxed." [TPOD: 14, Message from the M'Hael, 306]
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Note that it doesn't say, "Dashiva looked
horrified." "Dashiva looked poleaxed" doesn't necessarily mean that he's
upset by the prospect, only that he's shocked and amazed that such a thing
could be possible. Note that Torval, who quite possibly is a Darkfriend,
has a decidedly positive reaction: "'That would be wondrous,' Torval said
in a near whisper."
<P>
<strong>11) Reaction to killing of Forsaken</strong>: In [TPOD: 24, A Time
for Iron, 483], Rand is boasting, '"Nobody stands nose-to-nose with the Dragon
Reborn.... The Forsaken could tell him [The Seanchan commander] that,
whoever he is. Right, Flinn? Dashiva?" Flinn nodded uncertainly. Dashiva
flinched.' Dashiva could be flinching because he <em>has</em> faced Rand
"nose-to-nose," and lost badly.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: He could just as well be flinching at Rand's
unbridled arrogance.
<P>
<strong>12) Sudden Lucidity?</strong> In [TPOD: 24, A Time for Iron,
467-469], Dashiva "breaks character":
<blockquote>
More often, [Dashiva] hardly seemed aware of anything past his own nose...
It was something of a shock when Dashiva awkwardly booted his slab-sided
mount ahead of the rest.... It was <em>more</em> than something of a shock
when he seized saidin as soon as he reached Rand and wove a barrier around
them against eavesdropping.... "There's something askew with saidin here,
something amiss," Dashiva said, sounding not at all vague. In fact, he
sounded...precise. And testy. A teacher lecturing a particularly dense
pupil.
</blockquote>
Rand then thinks that Dashiva is pretty loony, but usually has a better grip
on himself. He says, "I've been channeling longer than you, Dashiva. You're
just feeling the taint more." Dashiva's response:
<blockquote>
Instead, he [Dashiva] opened his mouth angrily, then snapped it shut... "I
am well aware how long you have channeled," he said in an icy,
almost contemptuous voice, "but surely even you can feel it... I don't want
to die or... or be burned out because you're blind! Look at my ward! Look
at it!" Rand stared. Dashiva pushing himself forward was peculiar enough,
but Dashiva in a temper?
</blockquote>
Even Rand notes that this degree of lucid behavior is very uncharacteristic
for Dashiva. If he was really as loony as he usually acts, it's doubtful
he'd be capable of such clarity of thought. It seems more like the extreme
circumstances forced him to stop his "insane" act, and take Rand to task
for his foolishness, even though it meant risking discovery.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</strong>: After the Old Tongue, this piece of
Dashiva=Osan'gar evidence is the hardest to explain. Perhaps the extreme
circumstances forced Dashiva to pull himself together, and assert himself,
taking Rand to task for his foolishness. If Dashiva's looniness is all an
act, why spoil it with the OT mutterings?
<P>
<strong>13) Aesthetic meta-reason</strong>: Since Halima/Aran'gar, the
right-handed dagger, is with the female Aes Sedai (Salidar faction),
there's a certain attractive symmetry to Osan'gar, the left-handed dagger,
being with the male Asha'man.
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: It would be just as, if not more, symmetrical
for Osan'gar to be with the Tower Faction. After all, the Tower AS have
actually engaged in a confrontation with the BT, unlike the SAS. Or, the
"symmetry" may not exist at all.
<h2>Evidence which Goes Both Ways</h2>
<P>
<STRONG>1) Perrin's Nose</STRONG>: Perrin gets a whiff of Dashiva after
Rand rejects Dashiva's idea of gating into the palace at Cairhien: '"As my
Lord Dragon commands." The fellow inclined his head, but he sounded sour,
and he smelled... Perrin rubbed his nose. The smell... skittered,
dodging wildly through fear and hate and anger and a dozen more emotions
almost too quickly to make out. He no longer doubted the man was mad,
however good a face the fellow put on.' [ACOS: 4, Into Cairhien, 108]
<P>
<STRONG>How this fits with Dashiva=Osangar</STRONG>: Perrin attributes it
to straightforward saidin madness, but that particular sequence of emotions
looks like the sequence that the women felt through Moggy's a'dam whenever
they made her do something she considered demeaning or below her rightful
station. The emotional instability also fits with Osan'gar/Aginor being a
little loony himself [LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 59]. In other
words, we have no evidence that Perrin can smell the special insanity odor,
but rather insanity is a conclusion Perrin draws from what he does smell.
<P>
<STRONG>How this fits with Dashiva not being Osan'gar</STRONG>:
Dashiva's behaviour is also easily explained by Perrin's analysis, i.e.
that Dashiva is crazy. The description of quickly-changing emotions is
very similar to the description of how Perrin perceives <em>Rand's</em>
quickly-changing emotions when LTT is acting up. In fact, just a few pages
before the quote in question, we have:
<blockquote>
His [Rand's] scent made Perrin's ears try to lie back. Razor-sharp rage
abruptly vanished in curiosity and caution, the one thin and probing, the
other foglike; then slashing, murderous fury consumed both.... Nobody's
scent changed that fast. Nobody's. [ACOS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 83]
</blockquote>
<P>
Furthermore, Aginor isn't any crazier than many of the other Forsaken
(unstable, but not utterly mad). We are privy to Osan'gar's thoughts in
[LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 59-61]; Osan'gar seems reasonably sane,
and quite alert and observant. It's one thing to act a bit scatterbrained,
but can a channeller fake smells, and why would he even think to do so? If
Dashiva's craziness is all an act, then Perrin shouldn't have smelt
madness. Perrin hasn't ever been mistaken about what the smells he smells
mean: confused, yes, but not incorrect. The nose knows.
<P>
<STRONG>2) Healing</STRONG>: Dashiva suggested to Flinn that he learn
Healing: "I have no Talent for Healing," Dashiva said, twisting his mouth
wryly. "You are the one who took my suggestion and learned." [ACOS: 36,
Blades, 572] "Then one day, Dashiva here - pardon; Asha'man Dashiva - says
he wonders why it's all the same, no matter if the man's got a broke leg or
a cold, and we got to talking, and...Well, he's got no feel for it,
himself, but me, seems I got the knack you might say. The Talent." [ACOS:
36, Blades, 573]
<P>
<STRONG>Is Osan'gar</STRONG>: Dashiva knows that he himself doesn't have the
Talent for Healing, yet it seems that Dashiva was able to recognize that
Talent latent in Flinn well enough to suggest that Flinn in particular try
it. This is knowledge Dashiva shouldn't have.
<P>
<STRONG>Is not Osan'gar</STRONG>: i) It is not true that the Asha'man had
no Healing abilities before Flinn. They had a less-sophisticated method
used for field medicine. Apparently, Flinn had a talent for it, and
Dashiva didn't: this was known from experience, not some sort of a priori
evaluation on Dashiva's part. When the question of trying to improve
Healing methods arose in conversation, it's only reasonable that Dashiva
would recommend that Flinn experiment, rather than trying himself.
<P>
ii) This actually provides more of an argument AGAINST Dashiva being a
Forsaken than the other way around. Thus far, none of the Forsaken have
been wont to share knowledge with anybody, unless it could benefit them.
For example, while Alviarin has been in contact with many Forsaken, none of
them offered to teach her anything before Mesaana did, and Mesaana only
offered after Alviarin swore to be her particular flunky. Furthermore,
Mesaana forbade Alviarin to share the knowledge she gained [ACOS: Prologue,
Lightnings, 43]. Graendal straight out refused to teach any of the Shaido
WOs [ACOS: 20, Patterns Within Patterns, 355]. Moggy and Asmo only taught
Our Heroes under extreme duress. Assuming Taim = Dem, he provides more
evidence; he only wants the Asha'man to learn what <em>he</em> dictates; he
doesn't want them going outside his curriculum. It is thus not reasonable
to suppose that a Forsaken would teach some random guy how to Heal, or even
lead him in teaching himself, out of the goodness of his heart. What would
Osan'gar gain by teaching Flinn?
<P>
iii) Furthermore, Osan'gar is Aginor, who was a top biological researcher
during the AOL. 'He understood "the most basic structures of living things"
better than anyone else in the Age.' [Guide, 5, The Dark One and the Male
Forsaken, 53] He created the various Shadowspawn. This shows that he was
skilled at manipulating biological material with the OP. That's what
Healing is all about. Why would he pretend to be so bad at it? Since
Aginor died <em>right before Rand's eyes</em>, and since Osan'gar has a
completely new body, he'd hardly have to pretend to be totally incompetent
at it to avoid suspicion. Why not just pretend to be as good as, say,
Flinn is?
<h2>Arguments against Dashiva being Osan'gar</h2>
<P>
<STRONG>1) He tried to kill Rand</STRONG>: During the attack on the
Cairhien palace by the rogue Asha'man, the only one who takes a direct
shot at Rand is Dashiva:
<blockquote>
The only warning he had was the sudden snarl that contorted Dashiva's
face. Dashiva channeled, and with no time to think Rand wove... Air and
Fire and Earth woven around himself just so. The fire that leaped from
Dashiva erupted, shattering marble, flinging Rand back down the hallway,
bounding and rolling in his cocoon. [TPOD: 29, A Cup of Sleep, 568]
</blockquote>
Dashiva's weave, had it hit Rand, would have certainly been lethal. The
parts of it which bounced off the shield "shattered marble," and knocked
the protected Rand far down the hallway. The shield was something dredged
up from LTT's memories, and Dashiva could not have expected that Rand would
know it, or that he'd use it in time (especially considering the scorn
Dashiva showed toward's Rand's mental acumen during the Ebou Dar campaign).
Because of this, it is extremely doubtful that Dashiva was "faking" trying
to kill Rand. Furthermore, the "sudden snarl" on Dashiva's face right
before he attacked shows that there was real emotion behind the attack. If
he was faking it, such an extreme grimace would imply a degree of dramatic
ability which is not consistent with the rest of Dashiva's behavior (Old
Tongue muttering, a cover story which doesn't seem to hold up, and so
forth). Now, the Dark One has given out the order that Rand must not be
killed. One might expect one of the original, uncontrolled Forsaken (like
Sammael) to disregard that order if a good opportunity presented itself.
However, Osan'gar is one of the "reined in" Forsaken. He's already gotten
his second chance, so disobeying a direct order like that should be the
farthest thing from his mind. Right after he was resurrected, and is
forced to submit to the will of Shaidar Haran, Osan'gar thinks, "It
abraded, humbling himself before something that could be said to be as much
his creation as the Trollocs, but he remembered death too clearly. He would
grovel before a worm to avoid that again." [LOC: Prologue, The First
Message, 60-61] In a few months, he's forgotten all about it?
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: While it's not very likely, Dashiva
<em>could</em> have been faking trying to kill Rand, or he could have
assumed Rand would be able to block it. Alternatively, he could have
gotten "caught up in the moment." Perhaps he fell victim to either
momentary panic or momentary hatred overcoming instructions.
<P>
<STRONG>2) Whatever his mission, he's utterly failed</STRONG>: If Dashiva
is Osan'gar, then he must have been sent to the Black Tower for a reason.
If Taim is not Demandred, then Dashiva must have been sent to infiltrate
the Black Tower, and gain some measure of control over it, as Aran'gar has
done in Salidar. Getting chosen for Rand's personal guard essentially made
that mission impossible. Before Rand chose him, Dashiva wasn't doing a
very good job of infiltration. Dashivan'gar's first job would have been to
get in good with somebody in power in the BT, but Taim doesn't think much
of Dashiva [ACOS: 2, The Butcher's Yard, 84], and he isn't well-connected with the rank-and-file
Asha'man, either.
<P>
If Taim <em>is</em> Demandred, then it gets more complicated. Dashivan'gar
must have been sent to the Black Tower to keep tabs on Taimandred. If it
was to just spy on Taimandred, then the same problems arise as we described
in the previous paragraph. It's a lot easier to spy on people if they like
you and trust you. We could suppose that Dashivan'gar's mission was to get
into Rand's confidence, rather than Taimandred's. However, this doesn't
make sense, either. Under normal circumstances, the way an Asha'man would
have gotten into Rand's entourage would be by being assigned by Taim, or by
impressing Rand in some way. Either way would have necessitated Dashiva to
act like a normal guy, not an unreliable lunatic. Rand used his ta'veren
luck to pick Dashiva for his entourage. There is no way that could have
been planned upon. If Dashiva is Osan'gar, why didn't he find a more
predictable way to get close to Rand?
<P>
Perhaps the mission which makes the most sense is if Dashivan'gar was
assigned to go deep undercover in the BT, with the goal of making sure Rand
didn't get killed in case Taimandred decided to "pull a Sammy." However,
this just brings us back to the question of why did Dashivan'gar a) try to
kill Rand, and b) abandon his post by running away with Gedwyn et al?
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</strong>: See explanation for 1, since that's what we've
come back around to.
<P>
<STRONG>3) Comparison with Aran'gar</STRONG>: One of the major arguments in
favor of Dashiva being Osan'gar is that the background he claims to have
(humble farmer) doesn't agree very well with his actions. This, in and of
itself, casts doubt on the theory. Osan'gar's counterpart,
Aran'gar/Halima, was set up with an impeccable cover, founded upon
the information wrung from Cabriana Mecandes by Semirhage, and backed up by
the Black Sitter Delana. Are we to believe that so much effort was put into
placing Aran'gar, but Osan'gar was given a flimsy cover story which he
couldn't live up to? This isn't consistent.
<P>
<strong>Rebuttal</strong>: Perhaps the body that Aginor/Osan'gar was
"stuffed" into actually was a humble farmer from the Black Hills and for
the sake of simplicity, authenticity, and/or against the remote possibility
that someone from the area, perhaps another recruit of Taim's, would
recognize the shell, they--Shadar Haran, Moridin, the DO...those in charge
of the plan to place Aginor in the enemy camp--decided it was just best to
tell the truth as to where the Dashiva flesh was from. Perhaps those in
charge figured that the taint would be enough cover for any strange, but
benign, behavior on Dashivan'gar's part. Taim even mentions that he thinks
that Dashiva has already been touched by taint when we are first introduced
to Dashiva. Another argument is that somebody infiltrating the Asha'man
wouldn't need as much of a good alibi as somebody infiltrating the AS. The
AM are a motley crew of boys, mercenaries, fanatics, criminals, etc.
hastily snatched from all over the continent in the last few months.
They probably have many secrets and tell each other untruthful or no
personal histories, with no way of checking the facts. The tight
organization of ancient suspicious women of the White Tower is a much more
difficult group to infiltrate.
<P>
<STRONG>4) The "Limper" argument</STRONG>: If we assume that Dashiva
<em>is</em> Osan'gar, then we must conclude that Osan'gar/Aginor is a Big
Fat Loser. He's the Limper of the Forsaken. (This will only make sense if
you've read Glen Cook's Black Company books. If you haven't just accept
Limper = Big Fat Loser.) Dashivan'gar couldn't maintain a simple cover
story. He constantly spoke to himself in the Old Tongue. He made no effort
to make himself liked by anybody he could be hoping to influence. He
slipped up by revealing his superior skills and knowledge during the Ebou
Dar campaign. Finally, he screwed over his second chance at life by
trying to kill Rand, in front of witnesses who are probably Demandred's
agents. This shambles is one of "those chosen to rule the world forever"?
<P>
<STRONG>Rebuttal</STRONG>: Maybe he cracked due to the strain of being
raised from the dead?
