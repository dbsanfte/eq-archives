<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.2.1: Can Thom channel?</h1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Arthur Bernard Byrne, P. Korda]</P>
<HR>
<P>
Here are the reasons why some people think Thom can channel: 1) The
mysterious blue flash in Whitebridge/random burns after the Fade fight in
TEOTW. 2) The White Ajah hypothesis that channelling has a genetic link,
and that Thom has at least one relative who can channel (Owyn). 3) His
comment that he "could have done <EM>something</EM>" for Owyn. 4) In
[TFoH: 9, A Signal, 145] Nynaeve says "she could not channel any more than
Thom". This is taken to be "ironic foreshadowing."
<P>
Objections: 1) The blue flash is something that occurs when Fadeblade meets
OP-forged blade
(<A HREF="../2.3_one-power/2.3.04_op-blades.html">see section 2.3.4</A>).
Why Thom had OP-made daggers, we
don't know. As for the fires, it seems likely that there was some sort of riot
after the fight, which is why people didn't want to talk about it. 2) The
genetic basis for channelling is not a simple matter at all; in the whole
series, we've only heard of one channeller who is closely related to
another--Elayne (if she's Taringail's kid, she's related to Moiraine, if
she's Thom's, she is related to Owyn). 3) The "something" comment is
just wishful thinking. 4) If Thom was a channeller, he would have
to have the "spark inborn," since until recently, nobody was teaching men to
channel. Thus, he'd have started channelling at about 20, a la Rand. Even
if he had a block, like Ny, he would have channelled quite a bit in the 30
or so years since then, more than enough for him to be showing signs of
madness and the rotting disease. 5) Nothing that we have seen of Thom's
thoughts or actions gives any indication of him being able to channel.
<P>
From a signing in Seattle, Edward "potato" Liu tells us:
<blockquote>
Now, regarding Thom, RJ said a man will not go mad or get sick if he
never channelled. Thus, he agreed that a male channeller who could be
taught to channel (as opposed to having the inborn ability) and has
never channelled would not die from the taint. BUT, when I asked him
if he ever intended to make people think that Thom could channel, he
said no. I brought up the hereditary point (i.e. Owyn) but he said
just because your parents have a particular gene doesn't mean you'll
receive that particular gene. Also he made a point that Owyn was his
nephew so therefore not necessarily very similar gene-wise. When I
pressed him again on it, he said (I'm quoting) "There is no way in
hell Thom can channel." All he offered for explanations is that Thom
is a "mysterious man." Enough said.
