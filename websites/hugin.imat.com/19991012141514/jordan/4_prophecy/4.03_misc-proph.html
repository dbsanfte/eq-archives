The prophecy of the Horn of Valere:
<blockquote>
In the last, lorn fight <BR>
'gainst the fall of long night,<BR>
the mountains stand guard, <BR>
and the dead shall be ward, <BR>
for the grave is no bar to my call.<BR>
</blockquote>
Translation: The Heroes of the Horn will fight against the Shadow at the
Last Battle.

Foretelling by Elaida:
<blockquote>
This I Foretell...and swear under the Light that I can say no
clearer. From this day Andor marches toward pain and division. The
Shadow has yet to darken to its blackest, and I cannot see if the
Light will come after. Where the world has wept one tear, it will
weep thousands....This, too, I Foretell. Pain and division come to
the whole world, and this man [Rand] stands at the heart of it.
</blockquote>
It's all pretty much occurred as she said.

[TEOTW: Glossary, Dragon Reborn, 662]
<blockquote>
...the prophecies say the Dragon Reborn will bring a new Breaking to
the world...

Fulfillment in progress. He hasn't broken it much literally, but he is
doing so in a figurative sense.

[TEOTW: Glossary, Far Dareis Mai, 663]
<blockquote>
...it is prophesied that a child born of a Maiden
will unite the clans and return to the Aiel to [sic.] the
greatness they knew during the Age of Legends.
</blockquote>
Rand was born of a Maiden, has united the clans (besides the Shaido), and
the "greatness of the AOL" is coming to pass--the Aiel are very famous in
the lands Rand holds.

<h2>From <CITE>The Shadow Rising</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TSR: 1, Seeds of Shadow, 29]
<P>
Elaida's first Foretelling:
<blockquote>
The very first thing Elaida had ever Foretold, while still an
Accepted -- and had known enough even then to keep to herself -- was
that the Royal line of Andor would be the key to defeating the Dark
One in the Last Battle. She had attached herself to Morgase as soon as
it was clear Morgase would succeed to the throne...
</blockquote>
Elaida interpreted this Foretelling as meaning that somebody from
Morgase's line would be crucial to defeating the DO. However, since the
timing of the Foretelling is not certain, it may refer to the previous
Royal line of Andor, Mondrellein's line. Rand, of course, is
Mondrellein's grandson, through Tigraine, and Rand is certainly key to
defeating the DO. If Elaida's interpretation is correct, the Foretelling
could refer to Elayne and/or Gawyn.

Snakey dudes' answers to Mat's Question (What is the fate which he
must go to Rhuidean to meet?):
<blockquote>
To marry the Daughter of the Nine moons. <BR>
To die and live again, and live once more a part of what was.<BR>
To give up half the light of the world to save the world.<BR>
</blockquote>
Well, he's about to meet the Daughter. He's died and lived again on two
occasions, and the memories he got from the Foxes count as "living once
more a part of what was. In light of other prophecies, "give up half the
light of the world" probably refers to sacrificing an eyeball.

Jendai Prophecy (Coramoor)
<blockquote>
He can wield the One Power ... and he holds the Sword That Cannot
Be Touched. The Aiel have come over the Dragonwall to his call.
... The Stone of Tear has fallen, and war breaks over the nations
of the land. Those who once ruled have returned, and been driven
back for the first time. ... The White Tower shall be broken by
his name, and Aes Sedai shall kneel to wash his feet and dry
them with their hair.
</blockquote>
All of this has happened except for the icky foot-washing bit. Perhaps
that's just a figurative way of saying "Aes Sedai will serve him"? Note
that foot-washing occurs during the Amyrlin-raising ceremony.

Wise One Dream (Moiraine, Melaine, and Seana in conversation on
Chaendaer):
<blockquote>
We did not see Egwene or Mat Cauthon at all. It was no more than an
even chance that the young man who calls himself Rand al'Thor would
come. If he did not, it was certain that he would die, and the Aiel
too. Yet he has come, and if he survives Rhuidean, some of the Aiel
at least will survive. This we know. If you (Moiraine) had not come,
he would have died. If Aan'allein had not come, you would have died. If
you did not go through the rings...
</blockquote>
Translation: If Rand hadn't gone to Rhuidean, and gained the Aiel Instant
Army, he would have died, and the Aiel would have died out, too. Since
Rand survived Rhuidean, some portion of the Aiel will survive. If
Moiraine hadn't gone, then Rand would have been killed by Lanfear at the
Cairhien docks. There was no on-screen moment where Lan saved Moiraine,
but maybe it happened during one of the Shadowspawn attacks. What would
have happened if Moiraine hadn't gone through the rings?

[TSR: 25, The Road to the Spear, 285-6]
<blockquote>
Prophecy of Rhuidean:
<P>
The stone that never falls will fall to announce his coming. Of the
blood, but not raised by the blood, he will come from Rhuidean at
dawn, and tie you together with bonds you cannot break. He will take
you back and he will destroy you.
</blockquote>
Rand is of Aiel blood, but not raised by the Aiel. He came from Rhuidean
at dawn. I'm uncertain what the "bonds you cannot break" are, maybe the
bonds of history. He "took them back," revealing their history, and he
is in the process of destroying them. There has already been a split
between the Aiel who follow Rand and those that don't, and the latter are
fraying apart. There are also those who succumb to the "bleakness."
Finally, there are all the Aiel who are getting killed in battle.

He got all three, although not exactly in the way he expected.

<h2>From <CITE>The Fires of Heaven</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TFOH: Prologue, The First Sparks Fall: 20]
<blockquote>
ELAIDA IN CONVERSATION: "Or do any of you believe he [Rand] will go
willingly to his prophesized death to save the world?"
</blockquote>
Prophecy at least appears to say that Rand will die.

<h2>From <CITE>Lord of Chaos</CITE></h2>
<P>
[LoC: 14, Dreams and Nightmares, 255]
<blockquote>
Nicola's Foretelling:
<P>
"The lion sword, the dedicated spear, she who sees beyond. Three on
the boat, and he who is dead yet lives." The great battle done, but
the world not done with battle. The land divided by the return and
the guardians balance out the servants. The future teeters on the
edge of a blade.
</blockquote>
The sword, spear, and seeress are clearly Elayne, Aviendha, and Min. Are
they the "three on the boat"? Probably. I've yet to see a satisfactory
explanation of the "he who is dead" bit, although it ties in with the
King-Arthur funeral imagery of one of Min's visions, and the WOs' boat
dream. The "great battle" line could refer to the Last Battle, perhaps
saying that even after TG, the struggle between the Light and Shadow
continues, or that there will be more fighting afterwards, or maybe
there'll be a big battle BEFORE TG. The land divided by the return refers
to the Seanchan invasion (Randland is rapidly becoming divided into
Rand-controlled aread and Seanchan-controlled areas). The guardians and
the servants are the Asha'man and the Aes Sedai. The last line is just
metaphorical melodramatics--this war is crucial, duh.

[LOC: 19, Matters of Toh, 312]
<blockquote>
Wise Ones Dreams:
<P>
"Melaine and Bair dreamed of you [Rand] on a boat with three women
whose faces they could not see and a scale tilting first one way and
then the other. Melaine and Amys dreamed of a man standing by your
side with a dagger to your throat, but you did not see him. Bair and
Amys dreamed of you cutting the wetlands in two with a sword. All
three had this dream, which makes it especially significant. Rain,
coming from a bowl. There are snares and pitfalls around the bowl. If
the right hands pick it up, they will find a treasure perhaps as great
as the bowl. If the wrong hands, the world is doomed. The key to
finding the bowl is to find the one who is no longer."
</blockquote>
The women in the boat echo the boat imagery from Nicola's foretelling, and
are probably El, Min, and Avi. The scale indicates that everything seems
up in the air now. Rand might win, the Shadow might, who knows? The
unseen man with a dagger clearly means that there is a big threat to Rand
right under his nose, which he is not seeing. This could be Taim. Some
people have suggested that it should be taken more literally, and that the
unseen guy is a Gray Man. Furthermore, it could be Dashiva, who Rand
trusted more than Taim and who tried to kill Rand at the end of TPOD. The
cutting of the wetlands could indicate how Randland is polarizing into pro-
and anti-Dragon factions, or it could refer to Rand's semi-successful
campaign against the Seanchan in Ebou Dar. He halted their advance into
his territory, but he failed to remove them from most of the territory they
already controlled. This would tie in with Nicola's Foretelling of "the
land divided by the return." The rest concerns the Bowl of the Winds. It
has the power to bring some rain to parched Randland. The "treasure" is
the stockpile of OP objects of which the Bowl was part. Note that while
the good guys got a lot of those things, Sammael's raiding party may have
gotten away with quite a few things as well, such as the Oath Rod he gave
to Sevanna. Does "the wrong hands" refer to Sammael, or does it refer to
Moridin (who sent Moggy to find the stash), or even the Seanchan? The key
to finding the one who is no longer is to find the bowl. The single person
most instrumental in finding the bowl was Setalle Anan--she led El and Ny
to the Kin, who eventually led them and Mat to the bowl. So, the question
remains, "No longer what?"

[LoC: 26, Connecting Lines, 373]
<blockquote>
Rand's visit Behind the Red Door (in Tear):
<P>
"He [Rand] knew he had a chance to live, if a seemingly impossible
one. If you would live, you must die."
<P>
We also know that he asked something about cleansing Saidin.
</blockquote>
This has a number of possible meanings. Maybe it means "if you would
live future lives, you must die (physically) in this one. (cf LTT's
wanting to die for good, never be spun out again.[LoC: 18, A Taste of
Solitude, 299].) Or, Rand will die, but will get resurrected. Or, one
of Rand and LTT will die and one will not. Or, Rand will seemingly die,
but won't really.

<h2>From <CITE>A Crown of Swords</CITE></h2>
<P>
[ACOS: Prologue, Lightnings, 26]
<blockquote>
Elaida's Foretelling #2:
<P>
The White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and
scorned, whole and stronger than ever. Rand al'Thor will face the
Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood
and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds."
</blockquote>
One of the AS factions will be triumphant, eventually. Either Elaida or
Egwene is going to get pissed at Rand. (That's not surprising, the way
he's treated the AS.) It's probably Egwene, since Elaida has a definite
air of doom about her. This "know her anger" could tie in with Eg's
dream about confronting Rand. The Asha'man will either undergo a split
(followers of Taim and followers of Rand?), or will be destroyed
(depending on how one defines "rend"). There are currently Sisters walking
the grounds of the Black Tower--the members of Elaida's task force who
have been captured and bonded.

[ACOS: 34, Ta'veren, 538]
<blockquote>
Jendai Prophecy, pt 2:
<P>
Rand: "That is what the Jendai Prophecy says. The Sea Folk will serve
the Coramoor."<BR>
Harine: "The Jendai prophecy says you will bring us to glory, and all
the sea of the world will be ours. As we give to you, you must
give to us."
</blockquote>
Self-explanatory.
