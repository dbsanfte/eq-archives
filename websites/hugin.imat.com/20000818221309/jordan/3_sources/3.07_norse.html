This is just a quick overview. For a more Thor-ough discussion of Norse
parallels in TWOT, see Karl-Johan's page on the subject. There is a link
to it from the Wheel of Time Index (<a HREF="../0_admin/0.08_wot-index.html">See Section 0.08</A>).
<P>
<STRONG>Mat and Odin</STRONG>: Mat has many of the attributes of Odin--
wide brimmed hat, a spear with ravens drawn on it which refers to "Thought"
and "Memory" (the names of Odin's ravens) and will in the future almost
certainly lose an eye. Also, Odin agreed to be hung from Yggdrasill in
order to gain wisdom and power-- a definite parallel to Mat being hung from
the Tree o' Life in Rhuidean.
<P>
<STRONG>Heimdall's Horn</STRONG>: Heimdall's job was to guard the Rainbow
bridge into Asgard against the Giants. During the Last Battle (Ragnarok),
he was to blow the horn Gjall to signal the arrayed gods and <em>dead
heroes</em> that it was time to fight. cf. Horn of Valere. Granted,
there are differences - the Heroes are bound to the Horn and not to a
specific cause, and they live in T'A'R rather than the afterlife as such
(where they'd fight all day, cutting each other to pieces, then get healed
at day's end. Always got a kick out of that-- sounds like a real heavenly
afterlife to me), but the concept of dead heroes waiting around for the
final battle stays the same.
<P>
<STRONG>Rand and Tyr</STRONG>: Tyr was a Norse god of war and of justice.
This is a parallel with Rand bringing strife to Randland, and with his
concurrent attempts to rule justly and by the rule of law. (Note: Tyr is
not connected to legality as a maker of peace or a bringer to justice, but
more as the embodiment of laws as power, of the fight that is fought in
court instead on the battlefield. The god of justice in the Norse pantheon
is Forsete, of which next-to-nothing is known. [Karl-Johan Noren]) Tyr's
arm was snarfled off by the monstrous wolf Fenrir (Perrin?) when the gods
chained him. (The gods thus defeated one of their greatest enemies, at the
loss of one of their greatest assets, Tyr's right (fighting) hand.) If
this parallel is valid, then this could be evidence that Rand will lose his
hand-- RJ said at a signing in Atlanta that he deliberately made Mat like
Odin and Rand like Tyr. Furthermore, Tyr offered to put his hand in
Fenrir's mouth as an assurance that the chains would be removed. Hence, it
was a willing sacrifice. This may be analogous to Rand sacrificing his
life or body parts at Tarmon Gai'don (or before).
<P>
<STRONG>Perrin and Thor</STRONG>: Karl-Johan Noren notes: "Even though
Perrin does not share any attribute with Tor other than his strength, his
beard and the hammer, their roles and personalities are remarkably similar.
Both are mostly connected to the common men, both have a good head but are
slow to use it, and both are terrible in their anger, though Tor has much
closer to it than Perrin. Perrin's hammer is a symbol for peace and
building, but this trait is also present in Tor and Mjolnir, even though it
is not readily present in the myths."
