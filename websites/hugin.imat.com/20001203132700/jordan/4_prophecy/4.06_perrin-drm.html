<h2>From <CITE>The Dragon Reborn</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TDR: 43, Shadowbrothers, 426]
<blockquote>
Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne stood looking at a huge metal cage,
with a raised door held on a heavy spring. They stepped in and
reached up together to loose the catch. The barred door snapped
down behind them. A woman with her hair all in braids laughed
at them, and another woman all in white laughed at her.
</blockquote>
This refers to El, Eg, and Ny's Tairen adventures in TDR. Braid-woman is
Liandrin, White-clad-woman is Lanfear.

[TDR: 43, Shadowbrothers, 425]
<blockquote>
Mat, rattling a dice cup. His opponent stared at Mat with eyes
of fire. Mat did not seem to see the man, but Perrin knew him.
"Mat!" he shouted. "It's Ba'alzamon. Light, Mat, you're dicing
with Ba'alzamon!"
</blockquote>
This is likely referring to Mat's "bet" with Rhavin/Gaebril in TDR.

<h2>From <CITE>The Shadow Rising</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TSR: 28, To the Tower of Ghenjei, 320-1]
<blockquote>
Rand stood amid swirling stormwinds, laughing wildly, even madly,
arms upraised, and on the winds rode [dragons].
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled, unless this is some sort of reference to Rhuidean. The
Seanchan Raken and To'Raken are both Dragonesque animals.
<blockquote>
hidden eyes watched Rand, and there was no way of telling whether
he knew it
</blockquote>
This is possibly general--all the people watching Rand, e.g. Forsaken,
Wise Ones, AS, etc. or it may be something more specific that we do not know
about.
<blockquote>
Nynaeve and Elayne stalking cautiously through a demented landscape
of twisted, shadowed buildings, hunting some dangerous beast
</blockquote>
This refers to El and Ny going to Tanchico to hunt down the BA. Compare
this description to the way Tanchico looks to Eg in TAR.
<blockquote>
Mat, standing where a road forked ahead of him. He flipped a
coin, started down one branch, and suddenly was wearing a wide-brimmed
hat and walking with a staff bearing a short sword blade.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled--Mat flipped a coin at the Portal Stone, to get to Rhuidean,
which led to him getting the hat and glaive.
<blockquote>
Egwene and a woman with long white hair
were staring at him in surprise while behind them the
White Tower crumbled stone by stone.
</blockquote>
The woman is Amys. This bit is probably not prophetic, but a chance
meeting in TAR (thus the surprised look). The crumbling of the Tower has
been fulfilled, at least partly--it is broken, but will it be destroyed
even further?

[TSR: 53, The Price of a Departure, 612]
<blockquote>
Egwene stood among a crowd of women, fear in her eyes; slowly the
women knelt around her, Nynaeve was one of them, and he believed
he saw Elayne's red-gold hair.
</blockquote>
This has been fulfilled; Eg has become Amyrlin of the Salidar AS.
<blockquote>
That window faded and was replaced. Mat stood naked and bound,
snarling; an odd spear with a black shaft had been thrust across
his back behind his elbows, and a silver medallion, a foxhead,
hung on his chest.
</blockquote>
Unknown. This may be the incident in Finnland that got him hung, or
maybe something yet to come.
<blockquote>
Mat vanished, and it was Rand. Perrin thought it was Rand.
He wore rags and a rough cloak, and a bandage covered his eyes.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. Note that this resonates with Min's viewing of a beggar's
staff around Rand. The bandaged eyes are reminiscent of the bandaged
eyes of the "Fisher" figure in Moridin's sha'rah game.
