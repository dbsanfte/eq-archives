... she saw Rand sleeping on the ground, wrapped in a cloak. A woman
had been standing over him, looking down. Her face was in shadow,
but her eyes seemed to shine like the moon, and Egwene had known
she was evil. Then there was a flash of light, and they were gone.
Both of them. And behind it all, almost like another thing
altogether, was the feel of danger, as if a trap was just beginning
to snap shut on an unsuspecting lamb, a trap with many jaws."
</Blockquote>
This has been fulfilled. It is where Lanfear takes Rand and co. into the
Portal Stone world in an attempt to bring Rand under her control.

<Blockquote>
She had dreamed of Seanchan, too, of women in dresses with
lightning bolts woven on their breasts, collaring a long line
of women who wore Great Serpent rings, forcing them to call
lightning against the White Tower. That had started her
awake in a cold sweat, but that had to be just a nightmare, too.
And the dream about Whitecloaks binding her father's hands.
</blockquote>
The first part seems to indicate that the Seanchan will capture a number
of AS and/or Accepted and use them to attack the Tower. It's possible
that the "Tower" symbolizes AS in general, and thus perhaps it is the
Salidar AS who will be attacked by the Seanchan. In any case, this has
not yet been fulfilled. The second part, with the WCs, has been
fulfilled: Master Al'Vere was powerless to act against the WCs in the 2R
until Perrin came along.

<blockquote>
There had been a dream of Rand, reaching for a sword that
seemed to be made of crystal, never seeing the fine net
dropping over him.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. The sword is Callandor, and the net is the trap Be'lal set.
<blockquote>
And one of him kneeling in a chamber where a parched wind blew dust
across the floor, and creatures like the one on the Dragon banner,
but much smaller, floated on the wind, and settled into his skin.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. This is Rand being marked the Car'a'carn in Rhuidean.
<blockquote>
There had been a dream of him walking down into
a great hole in a black mountain, a hole filled with a reddish
glare as from vast fires below,
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. By the description, the mountain is SG.
<blockquote>
and even a dream of him confronting Seanchan.
</blockquote>
Possibly fulfilled. He confronted some Seanchan in TFOH after he and Avi
MPS'd, and waged a campaign against them in TPOD, but there is surely
more to come.

<blockquote>
Perrin with a falcon on his shoulder, and Perrin with a hawk.
Only the hawk held a leash in her talons--Egwene was somehow
convinced both the hawk and falcon were female--and the hawk
was trying to fasten it around Perrin's neck.
</blockquote>
The hawk and the falcon are Berelain and Faile, respectively. It's
interesting that the <EM>hawk</EM> is the one with the leash, one would think
that Faile is the one who has "leashed" Perrin. In any case, the
conflict is not over yet.
<blockquote>
... And that dream of Perrin--with a beard!--leading a huge pack
of wolves that stretched as far as the eye could see.
</blockquote>
At least partially fulfilled. Perrin has a beard, and he led wolves at
Dumai's wells, but that was probably not the last time.
<blockquote>
Mat, placing his own left eye on a balance scale.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. The most likely interpretation is that Mat will sacrifice
his eye. This meshes with some of Min's visions, and the "half the
light of the world" prophecy.
<blockquote>
Mat, hanging by his neck from a tree limb.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. This happened at Rhuidean.
<blockquote>
There had been a dream of Mat and Seanchan, too, but she was willing
to dismiss that as a nightmare.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled yet, but now Mat is in a situation to interact with the Seanchan,
since he is in Ebou Dar.
<blockquote>
...Just like the one about Mat speaking the Old Tongue.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled many times over. Mat talks Old Tongue all the time.

<blockquote>
She had dreamed of Perrin with a wolf, and with a falcon, and a
hawk -- and the hawk and falcon fighting
</blockquote>
This is the Faile and Berelain thing again. Perrin and the wolf could be
the general "Wolfbrother" thing, or maybe Eg actually caught a glimpse of
Perrin running with Hopper in TAR.
<blockquote>
...of Perrin running from someone deadly,
</blockquote>
This is very vague; it could be referring to Slayer.
<blockquote>
and Perrin stepping willingly over the edge of a towering cliff while
saying, "It must be done. I must learn to fly before I reach the bottom."
</blockquote>
This is very vague, and could refer to any number of issues Perrin is
facing, from him mastering his wolf-brotherhood, to being a leader, or
taking part in the Last Battle. It could be related to the dream Eg
had about him and Aram hacking their way towards an unseen cliff.
<blockquote>
There had been one dream of an Aiel, and she thought that had to do
with Perrin, too, but she was not sure.
</blockquote>
Probably refers to Perrin's freeing of Gaul from the cage in TDR.
<blockquote>
And a dream of Min, springing a steel trap but somehow walking through
it without so much as seeing it.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. This refers to the Tower Coup: her return to the Tower
started Elaida getting suspicious of what SS was up to, which led to the
coup. Min never realized what was coming. Yet, she got out of the Tower
unscathed.
<blockquote>
... Mat with dice spinning 'round him...
</blockquote>
Refers to Mat's general luck and ta'verenhood.
<blockquote>
Mat being followed by a man who was not there ... or maybe
more than one, but in some way there was no one there
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. Mat was stalked by Gray Men in Tar Valon
<blockquote>
Mat riding desperately toward something unseen in the distance
that he had to reach
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. Refers to Mat racing to save El/Eg/Ny in Tear.
<blockquote>
and Mat with a woman who seemed to be tossing fireworks about.
An Illuminator, she assumed, but that made no more sense than
anything else.
</blockquote>
Maybe fulfilled. In TDR, Mat met with the rogue Illuminator Aludra,
whence he gets the fireworks with which he busts into the Stone of Tear.
However, later visions indicate that Mat is not done with fireworks.
<blockquote>
Men and women breaking out of a cage, then putting on crowns.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. The Forsaken have broken out of SG and have taken up places of
power in the world.
<blockquote>
A woman playing with puppets, and another dream where the strings
on puppets led to the hands of larger puppets, and their strings
led to still greater puppets, on and on until the last strings
vanished into unimaginable heights.
</blockquote>
This is probably just symbolic of the various degrees of manipulation and
plotting going on.
<blockquote>
Whitecloaks ravaging the Two Rivers.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled and dealt with.

<blockquote>
Why should Perrin have a falcon on his shoulder, and what was
important about him choosing between that axe he wore now and
a blacksmith's hammer?
</blockquote>
The falcon is Faile. As for the hammer and axe, Perrin's axe vs hammer
choice seems to be a choice between war and peace, the life of a leader
and that of a simple blacksmith. He seems to have currently chosen the
axe, but he may change his mind before all is said and done.
<blockquote>
... A Whitecloak putting Master Luhhan in the middle of a
huge, toothed trap for bait
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. The WCs used the Luhhans and Cauthons as bait to catch Perrin.
<blockquote>
What did it mean that Mat was dicing with the Dark One, and
why did he keep shouting "I am coming!" and why did she think in the
dream that he was shouting at her?
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. This refers to Mat's "bet" with Gaebril/Rahvin that he'd save
El, Eg, and Ny from the assassin.
<blockquote>
And Rand. He had been sneaking through utter darkness toward
Callandor, while all around him six men and five women
walked, some hunting him and some ignoring him, some trying
to guide him toward the shining crystal sword and some trying
to stop him from reaching it, appearing not to know where he
was, or only to see him in flashes. One of the men had eyes
of flame, and he wanted Rand dead with a desperation she
could nearly taste;
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. The men and women are the Forsaken who weren't dead at the
time. Fire-eyes is Ishy, and it is interesting that he wants Rand dead
in this dream. Maybe this is a combination between the state of the game
as it is when Eg has the dream (Rand looking for Callandor) and a
prophecy of later in TDR, when Ishamael for once actually decides that Rand
needs to be killed?
<blockquote>
Rand in that dry, dusty chamber again, with those small creatures
settling into his skin.

Again, Rhuidean.

<blockquote>
Rand confronting a horde of Seanchan.
</blockquote>
Has occurred, in TFOH and TPOD, but there's probably more to come.
<blockquote>
Rand confronting her, and the women with her, and one of
<em>them</em> was a Seanchan.
</blockquote>
Hasn't occurred yet. This will probably come when Rand wants the Salidar
AS to kneel to him. Note that it seems as if at least one Seanchan will
be joining Eg before she meets with Rand again.

[TSR: 11, What Lies Hidden, 145]
<blockquote>
Rand as tall as a mountain, walking through cities, crushing
buildings beneath his feet, with screaming people like ants fleeing
from him.
</blockquote>
This has not been literally fulfilled (Rand hasn't done much
city-crushing), but if the dream is symbolic, it is in progress, and
refers to the strife Rand leaves in his wake.
<blockquote>
Rand in chains, and it was he who was screaming.
</blockquote>
Possibly fulfilled; this could refer to his capture and torture by the
Tower AS.
<blockquote>
Rand building a wall with him on one side and her on the other,
her and Elayne and others she could not make out. "It has to be done,"
he was saying as he piled up stones. "I'll not let you stop me now."
</blockquote>
This is in the process of being fulfilled. Rand is deliberately
isolating himself from his friends and allies, and becoming increasingly
paranoid about not trusting anybody.
<blockquote>
Aiel fighting each other, killing each other, even throwing away their
weapons and running as if they had gone mad
</blockquote>
Fulfilled. This is the aftermath of Rand's revelation of the Aiel's history.
<blockquote>
Mat wrestling with a Seanchan woman who tied an invisible leash to him
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. This is probably the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Poor Mat.
<blockquote>
A wolf-- she was sure it was Perrin, though-- fighting a man
whose face kept changing.
</blockquote>
Fulfilled; refers to Perrin fighting Slayer.
<blockquote>
Galad wrapping himself in white as though putting on his own shroud
</blockquote>
At least partially fulfilled. The white clearly refers to Galad's
joining the WCs. If the shroud bit is prophecy, and not just metaphor,
it seems as if Galad will die as a result of his joining up.
<blockquote>
and Gawyn with eyes full of pain and hatred.
</blockquote>
Certainly fulfilled in one respect or another. Possibly refers to the
Tower Coup, or thinking Rand killed Morgase, or just his generally
psychotic state.
<blockquote>
Her mother weeping.
</blockquote>
This could be anything, really. The Two Rivers residents have had lots
of reasons to weep of late, and doubtless will have more in the future.

[TFoH: 15, What Can Be Learned in Dreams, 214]
<blockquote>
Rand sitting down in a chair, and somehow she knew that the
chair's owner would be murderously angry at having her chair
taken
</blockquote>
The chair is probably the Lion Throne of Andor.
<blockquote>
...Perrin, lounging with Faile on his lap, kissing her while
she played with the short-cut beard that he wore in the dream.
Behind them two banners waved, a red wolf's head and a crimson
eagle. A man in a bright yellow coat stood near to Perrin's
shoulder, a sword strapped to his back; in some way she knew
that he was a Tinker, though no Tinker would ever touch a sword.
And every bit of it except the beard seemed important. The banners,
Faile kissing Perrin, even the Tinker. Every time he moved closer
to Perrin it was if a chill of doom shot through everything.
</blockquote>
Partially fulfilled. Perrin is set up with Faile, has Aram as a
bodyguard, has the wolf banner, and the Manetheren banner, but we haven't
seen any doom related to Aram.
<blockquote>
...Mat throwing dice with blood streaming down his face,
the wide brim of his hat pulled down low so she could not
see his wound
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. The blood could be another reference to Mat losing an eye.
<blockquote>
while Thom Merrilin put his hand into a fire to draw out the
small blue stone that now dangled on Moiraine's forehead.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. This is evidence that Thom will rescue Moiraine from durance
vile in Finnland.
<blockquote>
Or a dream of a storm, great dark clouds rolling
without wind or rain while forked lightning bolts, every one
identical, rent the earth.
</blockquote>
This is kind of vague. It sounds like a general OP battle, perhaps the
Battle of Cairhien, or Rand's psychotic episode with Callandor on the
Seanchan campaign in TPOD. It is also similar to Fain's description of
Shayol Ghul.

<blockquote>
Twice, right on top of each other, she dreamed of taking [Gawyn] by the
shoulders and trying to turn him to face the other way against his will.
Once he brushed her hands away roughly; the other time she was somehow
stronger than he. The two blended together hazily.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. Will Eg convince Gawyn to join her on Rand's side, or
will he continue to hate Rand because of the chaos he's brought to his
life? Related to Min's viewing of Gawyn kneeling to Eg or breaking her
neck.
<blockquote>
In another, [Gawyn] began swinging a door closed on her, and she
knew if that narrowing gap of light vanished, she was dead.
</blockquote>
Not fulfilled. Again, this must be related to Min's viewing of Gawyn
kneeling to Eg or killing her-- Gawyn has the power to destroy Eg, if he
chooses not to join her.

<blockquote>
Perrin came and stood before her, a wolf lying at his feet, a hawk and a
falcon perched on his shoulders glaring at each other over his head.
Seemingly unaware of them, he kept trying to throw away that
axe of his until finally he ran, the axe floating through the air chasing
him.
</blockquote>
Well, the wolf is obvious, and the birds are Berelain and Faile. As for
the axe bit, Perrin wants to give up the axe, but he cannot. We have yet
to decide for sure what the axe symbolizes in general. Maybe it's the
Lordly life Faile has planned for him, and the fighting inherent therein.
On a broader scale, the hammer symbolizes creation, the axe destruction.
Perrin doesn't like it, but it is currently his duty to destroy and
<EM>then</EM> rebuild. The axe following him could mean that,
since he is ta'veren, he can't run away from his duty.
<blockquote>
Again Perrin; he turned away from a Tinker and ran, faster and
faster though she called for him to come back.
</blockquote>
The Tinker could be Aram, in light of the "doom" vision from TFOH. Perrin
and Aram's relationship doesn't seem to have degenerated so far, so
likely this hasn't been fulfilled. It's been suggested that Aram
represents the exact opposite of what Perrin wants. Perin wants to give
up fighting for a peaceful life. Aram gave up the Way of the Leaf to
become a soldier.

<blockquote>
Mat spoke words she almost understood - the Old Tongue, she thought -
and two ravens alighted on his shoulders, claws sinking through his
coat into the flesh beneath
</blockquote>
In light of other visions, this probably has to do with the Daughter of the
9 Moons and the Seanchan. Raven tattoos on the shoulders mean "Property
of the Seanchan Empress." It's also been suggested that these ravens
could also represent Mat's raven-engraved glaive.
<blockquote>
He seemed no more aware of them that Perrin had been on the hawk and
the falcon, yet the defiance passed across his face, and then grim
acceptance.
</blockquote>
Maybe the ravens refer to his spear, which he got on his trip to
A/Eelfland, where he also became a battle-master, which he first fought,
and has now accepted? Or maybe he will resist his situation vis a vis
the DotNM, then accept it.
<blockquote>
In another, a woman, face shrouded in shadow, beckoned him toward
great danger; Egwene did not know what, only that it was monstrous.

Not fulfilled, I think. Who is this woman? Lanfear? (cf [TGH: 12,

Suroth? Maybe it is the DotNM?

as a Warder.
<blockquote>
Elayne and Min and Aviendha, sitting in a silent circle around him,
each in turn reaching out to lay a hand on him.
</blockquote>
This has probably been fulfilled to some degree, although this plotline
is certainly not resolved yet. They've all had their turns to "lay
their hands on him." Elayne in Tear, Aviendha in the Seanchan igloo,
Min in Caemlyn and Cairhien. Of course, Min and Avi have done more laying
than Elayne...
<blockquote>
Him walking toward a burning mountain, something crunching beneath his
boots. She stirred and whimpered; the crunching things were the seals

Not fulfilled. The mountain must be Shayol Ghul. The breaking of the
Seals--does it have something to do with LTT wanting to break them, and
Fel's note? It seems likely that Rand will deliberately break the
seals at some point.

the road in front of him, and he reined in. Not because he saw
her...but the road that had been straight now forked right where she
stood, running over tall hills so no one could see what lay
beyond. She knew, though. Down one fork was his violent death, down
the other, a long life and a death in bed. On one path, he would marry
her, on the other, not. She knew what lay ahead, but not which way led
to which. Suddenly he did see her, or seemed to, and smiled, and
turned his horse along one of the forks...
</blockquote>
This is pretty self-explanatory--Gawyn's possible futures. Pick one of
each: quick, violent death or long life, marriage or not. Which
combination is the necessary one for Eg to live and win him over to her

She stood before an immense wall, clawing at it, trying to tear it

countless thousands of discs, each half white and half black, the
ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai, like the seven seals that had once
held the DO's prison shut...the wall stood strong however she beat at
it. She could not tear it down. Maybe it was the symbol that was
important. Maybe it was the AS she was trying to tear down, the White
Tower. Maybe....

building a wall between himself and all his friends and loved ones.

</blockquote>
This is possibly related to Min's vision of Logain's future glory.
Another dead Rand (cf Min's vision in TEOTW), but maybe a fake. It has
been suggested that the stone is the Black Tower "speaking stone," the
rock that Taim and Rand stand on when addressing the Asha'man. It's

The golden hawk is the symbol of Mayene. The female hawk has symbolised
Berelain in many other Egwene-dreams. This indicates that Berelain and

[TPOD: 15, Stronger than Written Law, 308]
<blockquote>
Rand, wearing different masks, until suddenly one of those false faces
was no longer a mask, but him.
</blockquote>
Refers to how Rand acts in wildly different ways, plays different roles,
with different people. This could be Rand trying to be the
ever-hardening Dragon Reborn/dictator on one hand and the man who can
maintain calm in the middle of combat, off three Forsaken with political
skill, and then return home in time to be a loving husband. Apparently,
one of his roles will become the "real" him. Alternatively, it's been
suggested that it refers to Rand wavering between the Dragon Reborn and
Rand himself, and maybe the various gradations in between. "Masks"
implies more variations than LTT.
<blockquote>
Perrin and a Tinker, frenziedly hacking their way through brambles
with axe and sword, unaware of the cliff that lay just ahead. And the
brambles screamed with human voices they did not hear.
</blockquote>
The Tinker is Aram. The frenzied hacking could refer to an upcoming rush
to rescue Faile. The various signs of impending doom could imply that
they'll be so focussed on saving her that they'll be oblivious to other
factors or situations which will cause them and/or somebody else big
trouble and/or pain. Possibly, Perrin will, perhaps at the urging of
Aram, make a huge sacrifice of life, maybe his group of soldiers, and
that it will turn out to be a bad decision. This vision could be
connected to the vision of Aram and doom, and to the one of Perrin
jumping off a cliff and saying he has to learn to fly before hitting
bottom.
<blockquote>
Mat, weighing two Aes Sedai on a huge set of balance scales, and on
his decision depended....She could not say what; something vast; the
world, perhaps.
</blockquote>
This sounds like it could be related the eye on a balance scale, and
giving up half the light of the world to save the world. What losing an
eye has to do with choosing between two AS is beyond me. It's been
suggested that maybe the two AS represent the two Towers, but Mat really
doesn't seem likely to be in any situation where he'd choose Elaida's
group over Egwene's. This one is very puzzling.
<blockquote>
Recently, all of her dreams about Mat were pale and full of pain, like
shadows cast by nightmares, almost as though Mat himself were not
quite real.
