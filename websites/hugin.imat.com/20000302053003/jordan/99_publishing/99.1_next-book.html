<h1 align="center">99.1: When is the next book going to be out?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<strong>When will Book 9 be published?</strong>
<P>

<P>

On 14 December, 1999, Teresa Nielsen Hayden of Tor Books (RJ's
U.S. publisher) posted to <TT>r.a.sf.w.r-j</TT>: "This just in: the
title of No.9 is WINTER'S HEART. (Does this mean we have a manuscript?
No. Not yet. But we have a title.)"
<P>

As of February 2000, Tor has not officially announced a publication
date for WH. However, <CITE>Publisher's Weekly</CITE> recently listed
November 2000 as a possible release month. Regarding this article,
Patrick Nielsen Hayden (Senior Editor, Tor Books) posted: "Yes, it's
pencilled into the Fall 2000 schedule as a November book.  No, the
Fall 2000 schedule isn't finalized yet.  No, we don't have a
manuscript yet. So yes, Rob [the author of the PW article] was
speaking with some knowledge, but no, nobody should take "November
2000" as written in stone."

<strong>What's the title mean?</strong>

<P>

Considering how relevant the titles of the last few books have been to
their plots, probably not much. However, the phrase "cold as winter's
heart," or something similar "is often used in the books to describe
something very cold, either literally or figuratively. For example, in
[TPOD: 23, Fog of War, Storm of Battle, 449], we have: "Rand let
himself really feel saidin. Life and corruption commingled, ice to
make winter's heart seem warm, and fire to make a forge's flames cold;
death waiting for him to slip."
