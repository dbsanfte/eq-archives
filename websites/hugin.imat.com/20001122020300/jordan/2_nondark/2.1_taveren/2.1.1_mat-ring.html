<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.1.1: What's up with Mat's new ring?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In [ACOS: 14, White Plumes, 280] Mat acquires a signet ring, by pure
"luck." The ring is gold with a dark oval carved stone, and is in the
"long style"; the stone is as long as the joint of Mat's
finger [ACOS: 14, White Plumes, 279]. Here is a description of the
carving: "Inside a border of large crescents, a running fox seemed to
have startled two birds into flight." [ACOS: 16, A Touch on the Cheek,
300]
<P>
The fact that Mat was "forced" into buying the ring by his luck makes one
suspect that the ring will play some important role in his future. Perhaps
it will only be that the ring, along with Mat's new fancy clothes, will
lead whoever finds him under that wall to believe he is a noble. (Only
nobles have signet rings; commoners don't generally have coats of arms)
<P>
One theory is that the birds are ravens, which have special
significance to the Seanchan. He will be dug up by some Seanchan
workers, who will see the ring, and Mat will suffer a similar fate to
the two Seanchan nobles who got themselves tattooed with ravens while
drunk [TSR, 38, Hidden Faces, 441-442].
<P>
There is one problem here, in that the stone can only be slightly larger
than 1"x0.5" (the size of Mat's first finger-joint). Squished onto this
small area are a bunch of moons (nine, maybe?), a fox, and two birds. The
birds can't be very large, and it is doubtful that they are distinguishable
as a particular type of bird. However, this doesn't prevent some Seanchan
toady from <em>seeing</em> some indistinct bird-shape as a raven, if his
fancy takes him. Plus, note that if the images are heraldic and stylized,
it could be easier to make a raven appear in that small area.
<P>
Another idea is that there are nine moons on the ring, and that this will
be significant vis a vis the Daughter of the Nine Moons.
