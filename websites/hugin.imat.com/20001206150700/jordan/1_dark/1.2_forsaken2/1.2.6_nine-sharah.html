<h1 align="center">1.2.6: Moridin's Nine Sha'rah Players</h1>
<hr>
<P>
In [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive Appearances, 42-43], Moridin is playing his
favorite AOL strategy game (against himself):
<blockquote>
"A complex game, sha'rah, ancient long before the War of Power. Sha'rah,
tcheran, and no'ri ... each had adherents ... but Moridin had always
favored sha'rah. Only nine people living even remembered the game. He had
been a master of it."
</blockquote>
This section, in particular the "nine people living" bit, could be very
important, or it could mean nothing. People have interpreted that bit in
two ways: 1) "Only nine people living even remembered the game [existed]."
2) "Only nine people living even remembered [how to play] the game." The
former interpretation means that we can, conceivably, count off which of
the Forsaken are alive, to Moridin's knowledge. The latter interpretation
does not give us so much knowledge, although it still tells us a little.
So, who could these "nine" be?
<P>
Since the game is unknown in the Third Age, the nine must be from the AOL.
The only people around from the AOL are the Forsaken. The ones who are
around who we know that Moridin knows about are: Moridin, Moghedien,
Mesaana, Graendal, Semirhage, and Demandred. That's six. We also have the
Gars, possibly Sammael, and possibly Lanfear, who is probably Cyndane-- the
occupant of Moridin's second mindtrap. (Rahvin, Be'lal, and most likely
Asmodean are permanently dead, so they are not in the counting.) Including
all of the viable possibilities, the total reaches ten, which is one more
than the nine enumerated by Moridin. If we cannot eliminate one of those
last four, then we must conclude that Moridin was referring to nine people
who could play the game, and that one of the Forsaken simply wasn't into
board games. So, let us examine the possibilities:
<P>
<strong>Sammael:</strong> Sammael apparently died at the end of ACOS. This
makes him a good candidate for not being counted among the nine, or does
it? Note that Moridin's second scene in TPOD is in [TPOD: 2, Unweaving,
81-84], where he watches Elayne and Nynaeve's party depart the Tarasin
Palace via gateway. This scene occurs <em>the same day</em> that they use
the Bowl of Winds. From [TPOD: 7, A Goatpen, 160], Perrin thinks that
"more than half a week" (over five days in Randland) has passed since "a
lace of OP streaking high across the sky had created quite a stir among the
AS and WOs. And with Grady and Neald.... Neald said it made him think of
wind." This description matches with that of the Bowl's action. The next
day, Perrin meets Queen Alliandre, and she mentions that "four days ago
Illian fell to the Dragon Reborn." [TPOD: 10, Changes, 228] This matches
with the timing as figured from data in ACOS: The using/finding of the Bowl
occurs the day after the Festival of Birds, when Nynaeve meets and marries
Lan. The Festival of Birds is six nights before the half-moon [ACOS, 29,
The Festival of Birds, 454]. Rand's attack on Sammael takes place two days
after his injury at the hands of Fain [ACOS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 617],
and the injury took place on the day Min assures Rand that their
"comforting" was mutually voluntary. This is four days before the
half-moon. Thus, we can conclude that the Moridin scene in Chapter 2 to
TPOD takes place two days before Sammael "dies" in Shadar Logoth.
<P>
There is no indication that Moridin's timeline flows backwards in TPOD
between the scene in the Prologue and the scene in Chapter 2. The
reasonable conclusion is that the Chapter 2 scene occurs after the
Prologue scene, and thus, both occur before the fight between Rand and
Sammael. This implies that Sammael was definitely alive when Moridin
pondered about the nine players.
<P>
<strong>Aran'gar and Osan'gar:</strong> The Gars are definitely Balthamel
and Aginor, respectively, and thus they both must be aware of the game's
existence. The only way for only one of them to be eliminated from Moridin's
count is for Moridin to be ignorant of one of the Gars' existence,
or at least of his/her identity. However, if he knew that
Balthamel had been resurrected as a person named "Aran'gar," he'd
<em>suspect</em> that there was an "Osan'gar" out there, and that it was
Balthamel's old pal Aginor. The only other alternative is that Moridin is
ignorant of <em>both</em> the Gars, and that there is yet another AOLer
wandering around who we don't know about, but who Moridin does. This
could, conceivably, be Asmodean, but the probability of him having been
resurrected <em>and</em> not mindtrapped is so vanishingly small that it
isn't worth considering seriously. Note that this argument implies that
Moridin knows about the Gars, no matter how the "nine" remark is
interpreted.
<P>
<strong>Cyndane/Lanfear:</strong> Cyndane was mindtrapped even before
Moghedien, so she is definitely alive when Moridin makes the "nine" count.
If she is indeed Lanfear in a new body
(<A HREF="1.2.5_cyndane.html">see section 1.2.5</A>), then she must
be included in the number of people who know of the game's existence. The
only way for her to not be counted as a person who knows of sha'rah is if
she is a totally new character, from the Third Age.
<P>
So, if Moridin meant "only nine people living even remembered the game
existed," then we must conclude one of the following:
<OL>
<LI>RJ did some extremely poor writing, and the scene with Moridin in the
Prologue of TPOD occurs <em>after</em> the scene with Moridin in Chapter 2
of TPOD, even though there is absolutely no indication that this is the
case.
<LI>Moridin does not know of Aran'gar and Osan'gar, and there is an unknown
AOL person wandering around in Randland. It has been suggested that this
could be LTT (which would have interesting implications about the LTT
situation), or Birgitte.
<LI>Cyndane is not Lanfear, or any other AOL person, just an
unprecedentedly powerful female channeller from the Third
Age who ran so afoul of Ishy/Moridin that she was mindtrapped, and yet
we've never heard of her.
</OL>
Most of those options imply that RJ can't plot his way out of a paper
bag, but they are within the realm of conceivability.
<P>
One other option is that Moridin is not including himself in the nine
people who remember the game, but if that were the case, it would have made
more sense to say "Only nine <em>other</em> people even remembered the
game."
<P>
On the other hand, if Moridin meant "Only nine people living even
remembered how to play the game," then the sentence doesn't mean much. It
does imply that Moridin knows about Aran'gar and Osan'gar, since without
them, the total number of potential players doesn't even reach nine.
