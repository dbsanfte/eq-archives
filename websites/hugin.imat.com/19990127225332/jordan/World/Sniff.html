<H1>How does one sniff?</H1>

<P>
In Jordan's Wheel of Time universe, women sniff and men snort. While
a sniff, read "inhale", can express disdain, the outward snuff/hmph is
more popular an expression.  For correct sniffing posture, turn your
head towards the left shoulder, but not quite.  A sixty degree angle
is ideal.  The posture indicates that one is removing ones nose from
an offensive area. A single sniff will suffice and may be augmented with
a very modest synchronized shrugging motion.  Follow up with a look
at the offender and an optional lift of both eyebrows.  These steps
comprise the "sniff". The snuff or hmph is produced by a small
vocalization at the back of the throat, enunciated through the nose
and usually is modified by a slight raising of the chin.  This is
distinct from the snort which is a gutteral, pig-like sound caused
by inhalation through the nose. The mouth must be opened slightly to
enable this effect unlike the sniff and the snuff. (Go ahead. Try it
with your mouth closed). The snort when written, should occupy
its own line, be followed by a blank line and then the text following
it should be limited to sixty character lines.
