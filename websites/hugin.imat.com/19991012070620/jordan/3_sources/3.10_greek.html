1) Birgitte in Conversation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[TFOH: 47, The Price of a Ship, 540]<BR>
Mathena: Athena/Artemis<BR>
Zheres: Tiresias? Orion?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually, it was the goddess Artemis who turned the hunter into a stag so he
would be killed by his dogs, after he saw her bathing. Athena was also
surprised by Tiresias while bathing, but she blinded him and gave him the
gift of second sight in return.
<P>
2) Birgitte's silver bow seems to have come straight out of Greek
Mythology. Artemis had a silver bow, to match her brother Apollo's golden
one.
<P>
3) Oedipus: Doomed king of Thebes who killed his father and married his
mother. When he discovered what he had done, he blinded himself and
exiled himself from his city. He led the life of a blind beggar until he
died near Athens. [<cite>Oedipus Rex</cite>, <cite>Oedipus at
Colonus</cite>, by Sophocles]. Possible connection to the vision of Rand
as a blind beggar.
<P>
4)Orpheus: A great musician whose wife, Eurydice, was killed on their
wedding night by a snake. Orpheus traveled to the kingdom of Hades to
try to get her back, and his music so moved the King/Queen(?) of the
underworld that he was allowed to take her back, provided that he
leave, and not look back at her until he had reached the surface. He
couldn't control himself, so he looked, and she went back to Hades.
Orpheus ended up getting ripped to shreds by the Maenads, a tribe
of ferocious women, during a Bacchanale. Possibly a connection to Thom
rescuing Moiraine from the Finn. [D. Sohl] (Hopefully, Thom will fare
better then Orpheus!)
