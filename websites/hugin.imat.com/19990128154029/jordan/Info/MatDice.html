<H1>Is there a connection between Mat and the stolen dice ter'angreal?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Erica Sadun, Pam Korda</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Could Mat's phenomenal luck come from the dice ter'angreal described
in <CITE>TDR: 25, 294, Questions, 237-8</CITE>?  Not bloody likely.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The dice ter'angreal was stolen by the black Sisters.
<LI>It is made up of <EM>six</EM>, not five, dice stuck together.
<LI>You must be able to <EM>channel</EM> to use it.
<LI>Mat says he has <EM>always</EM> been lucky.  This was referred to even before he got the dagger.  The
dagger may have influenced this, or forced him into his ta'veren-hood.
<LI>Mat can win at dice with you using <EM>your</EM> dice.
</UL>
<P>
Note, though, that the dice ter'angreal could possibly be used to
counteract the probability-twisting effect of ta'veren, e.g., Mat's luck.
Could the dice ter'angreal have something to do with the way that Mat
felt the luck in his head go bye-bye in that inn in Ebou Dar?
</P>
<P>
Alternate explanation: The "dice stopped rolling" because he had made
a decision that would fix his fate for n number of days.  I believe
one of Liandrin's BA is in Ebou Dar. Could this have some relation?
