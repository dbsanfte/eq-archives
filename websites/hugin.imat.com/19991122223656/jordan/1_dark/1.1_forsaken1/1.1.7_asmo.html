<h1 align="center">1.1.7: The Death of Asmodean (Who killed JoaR?)</h1>
<P align=center>[Karl-Johan Noren, Kevin Bartlett, P. Korda]</p>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>
[Asmodean] pulled open a small door, intending to find his way to the
pantry. There should be some decent wine. One step, and he stopped, the
blood draining from his face. "You? No!" The word still hung in the air
when death took him. [TFOH: 56, Glowing Embers, 682]
</blockquote>
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Tons of thanks to Karl-Johan Noren and Kevin
Bartlett, whose comprehensive analyses of Asmodean's death I plundered in
order to give this section the thoroughness it deserves. Their original
pages are linked from the Wheel of Time Index (<A HREF="../../0_admin/0.08_wot-index.html">See section 0.8</A>).
<h2>Did Asmodean really die at the end of TFOH? Did Moridin ("death") take
him?</h2>
<P>
Yes, he's dead. No, Moridin did not kidnap him. First of all, RJ clearly
takes this series too seriously to use such a dastardly pun. Secondly, RJ
told Yancy Davis at a post-POD signing in Northern Virginia that Asmodean
is "road kill." "He also used the line, 'He's a cat that tried to cross
the tracks and didn't quite make it.' Also, when I said, 'so he won't be
back' he responded, 'No, he will not be coming back.'" [Yancy Davis] Third,
Aaron Bergman asked this question at a post-POD book-signing in New York:
"In particular, I asked whether "death" was just a pun on "Moridin". He
said "oh, god no" quite disgustedly." Thankfully, that's the end of that
theory.
<P>
<h2>General Considerations</h2>
Now that that's out of the way, let's get on to serious discussion.
First, we will consider what the general requirements are for Asmodean's
murderer. Second, we will round up all the usual suspects (and some
unusual ones). Then, we will examine all the general requirements in
detail, and see if we can draw any conclusions from them. Next, we will
eliminate suspects who couldn't possibly have done it, and those who
theoretically could have done it, but who probably didn't. Finally, we
will examine the cases for and against the remaining suspects.

<P>
Now, on to discussion of particular requirements. We'll start off with the
classic three requirements for solving any murder mystery: means, motive,
and opportunity. Then, we'll consider other requirements for the
particular "case" at hand.
<P>
<a name="mean"></a>
<H2>Means: How was he killed?</H2>
Any good murder investigation begins with determining how the victim died.
We are at a slight disadvantage, because there is no body to examine. The
possible murder weapons are: channelling, a gholam (which, from another POV,
can also be considered a suspect), the Shadar Logoth dagger, and some
purely physical means, such as a knife or sword.
<P>
What we do have is a (very short) description of his death: "the word still
hung in the air when death took him." This indicates that he died very
quickly. He did not get a chance to even <em>try</em> to run away or
defend himself, even with the OP. Remember, channelling is <em>fast</em>:
Rand plucks daggers and spears out of thin air. We know that a Warder vs a
Fade is usually an even fight, but the Fade is dead meat against even the
weakest channeller (except possibly Sorilea). Because of this, it seems
unlikely that he was killed by purely physical means. The Shadar Logoth
dagger poses the same difficulty, to some degree, although unlike a normal
dagger, a victim doesn't have a chance to get away once he's been touched
by it. Since gholam are super-duper fast and OP-resistant, this
constraint doesn't necessarily apply if one of them was the assailant.
<P>
The Shadar Logoth dagger has another problem. Once a person's been cut by
it, they don't die instantaneously. There is enough time for the stabbed
one to gasp, fall to the ground, writhe around a bit, and finally die once
the Mashadar-taint spreads through his body. See the scene in TFOH
where Fain kills the Accepted [TFoH: 19, Memories, 259], and the part in
TGH where Mat kills the Seanchan guy [TGH: 45, Blademaster, 538]. While the
latter seems to die much faster than the Accepted, he still does some
writhing in agony which is not consistent with the quickness of Asmodean's
death.
<P>
Since, as discussed below, it is unlikely that he was killed by a gholam,
the most probable murder weapon is channelling. The absence of a body
lends more credence to the idea that the killer was a channeller, and that
channelling was used in the murder (see below). The personalities of the
Forsaken (the channelling suspects) lead us to believe that they wouldn't
use conventional means to kill a person; they'd channel. Furthermore,
since, of the channelling suspects, only Ishy/Moridin prefers the TP over
the OP, the most likely murder weapon is the One Power.
<P>
<h3>Was Asmodean balefired?</h3>
This is definitely a possibility. Certainly, any channeller (read
Forsaken) who could have killed Asmo could have wanted to ensure that his
thread was burned out of the Pattern.
<P>
When Demandred visits the DO in [LOC: Prologue, The First Message, 13-16],
the DO lumps Asmodean in with Rahvin as having "died the final death." In
Rahvin's case, this means he was balefired, and the DO cannot "step outside
of time" to recycle him. Of course, there are other ways in which Asmo
could have died with no possibility of recycling. For one thing, the DO
may have the power to recycle Asmo, but chooses not to, because he was a
traitor. Also, remember that Rand severed Asmo's link to the DO, and thus
the DO might not have had the power to save Asmo's soul even if he'd wanted
to.
<P>
Another point in favor of the balefire idea is the similarity between RJ's
description of Asmo's death and that of Be'lal in [TDR: 55, What is Written
in Prophecy, 557]:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Moiraine had not stopped or slowed while he spoke. She was no more than
thirty paces from him when he moved his hand, and she raised both of hers
as well.
<P>
There was an instant of surprise on the Forsaken's face, and he had time to
scream `No!' Then a bar of white fire hotter than the sun shot from the
Aes Sedai's hands, a glaring rod that banished all shadows. Before it,
Be'lal became a shape of shimmering motes, specks dancing in the light for
less than a heartbeat, flecks consumed before his cry faded.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In particular, note the similarity between "flecks consumed before his cry
faded" with "the word still hung in the air when death took him." This is
certainly suggestive.
<P>
<h3>If Asmodean was killed by channelling, why didn't anybody sense it?</h3>
A common argument against the idea that Asmo was killed by channelling is
that, if it was a man, Rand would have sensed the channelling, and if it
was a woman, Rand or Aviendha would have sensed it. This isn't really a
valid objection.
<P>
The range at which channelling can be sensed seems to depend on many
different things: proximity, amount of OP being channelled, how much
attention the senser is paying, the strength and experience of the senser,
and any number of other variables.
(<A HREF="../../2_nondark/2.3_one-power/2.3.05_op-range.html">See
section 2.3.5</A> for further analysis.) In the case of Asmodean's death,
we have many
unknowns. We don't know how far he was from Rand and Avi when he died.
He'd been walking through the palace, thinking about his situation, and
there is no indication of how far he walked before opening that fateful
door. It is entirely possible that he was too far away for the channelling
to be detected by Rand and/or Aviendha, who were both distracted by other
business. We don't know what form of channelling was used to kill him (if
channelling it was)-- balefire, fireballs, inverse healing, or something we
don't know about, or how easy any of those things are to sense at a
distance. There are too many unknowns and uncertainties to eliminate
either half of the OP as the murder weapon. Furthermore, while most of the
Forsaken don't choose to use the TP as a matter of course, any of them
could have received the DO's permission to use it for this assassination,
especially if the deed was done at the DO's direct order. As we know, the
TP cannot be sensed by anybody.
<P>
<a name="motv"></A>
<H2>Motive: "When I know why, I'll know who."</H2>
The question of <em>why</em> Asmo was killed is perhaps the most
complicated issue related to his death. Indeed, as the saying goes, if we
knew why he was murdered, we could very likely figure out who did it. Here
are the possible motives:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Ordered assassination from the DO, as punishment for treachery.
All the Forsaken, Slayer, and the different random minions could be
acting under this scenario.
<LI> Enterprising person, deciding to kill Asmodean on their own
accord, in accordance with some unknown (by us) plan. This requires
that the murderer has gained knowledge that Jasin Natael really is
Asmodean, in effect leaving only the Forsaken as possible killers.
<LI> Asmodean stumbled upon his murderer by chance, i.e. the murderer was in
Caemlyn and the Palace for an entirely different reason and
eliminated Asmo because he discovered him/her.
<LI> Ordered assassination, in order to allow Demandred to appear as Taim.
This, of course, only works if the Taimandred theory is true. (<A
HREF="1.1.6_taimandred.html">See Section 1.1.6</A>.)
<LI> Plot to cause confusion for Rand by killing his minions.
</OL>
<P>
Note that 1, 4 and 5 can all be classified under "ordered by the DO," and 5
could also be a special case of "personal enterprise." Generally, 1, 2, 4,
and 5 all involve premeditation, while 3 is just a crime of opportunity.
<P>
Any of the Forsaken could have acted under any of these motives. A random
minion or Slayer would have been acting under orders, either from a
Forsaken, or the DO. Fain could only have been acting under 3 or 5. We
will now discuss the various motives:
<P>
<h3>Ordered assassination, as punishment for treachery</h3>
Now, it makes perfect sense that the DO and the various Forsaken would want
to punish Asmodean for going over to Rand's side. However, if this was the
motive for the murder, several things don't add up. In general, people who
betray the cause of the Shadow are killed in very visible, painful, messy
ways, in order to send a message to others who might consider giving up the
Dark Side. Examples of this are Amico and Joiya in TSR, and Ispan in TPOD.
Asmodean's remains were not left behind as a lesson. Furthermore, he was
killed quickly, with none of the gruesome torture experienced by other
failures. The only way the method of the murder makes sense for it as a
punishment is if it was done with balefire-- more than just dying, his
thread would have been burned out of the pattern totally. This still
doesn't make perfect sense, because if it was punishment why wasn't the
fact that he was balefired shared with the other Forsaken, as a warning?
<P>
<h4>Timing</h4>
With this motive, we must also address the issue of timing. Why was
Asmodean killed when he was? Given that Asmodean had been "on Rand's side"
for at least two months when he was killed, the question of timing must be
considered, at least if the murderer is one of the Forsaken. Couldn't he
have been killed far earlier? It could be argued that because Asmodean
hadn't spent much time in Caemlyn (less than one day) before he was
murdered, the murderer wasn't working under a carefully rehearsed plan, but
acting more on a sudden opportunity. However, any Forsaken who had set out
to kill Asmo would have gone to Cairhien, found out about Rand's raid, and
Traveled to Caemlyn.
<P>
If Asmodean was killed as punishment, why did the DO (or somebody speaking
for it) wait so long to give the order? It possible that changing
circumstances forced the DO or a Forsaken to act.
<P>
From the DO's or the Forsaken's point of view, the two big events were
Lanfear's disappearance and Rahvin's death. The killing of Asmodean is
likely connected with one or both of these events. Another possibility is
that Asmodean was killed in order to facilitate putting up Demandred as
Taim in LoC, something that would have been hard or impossible to do with
Asmodean still alive. (This is discussed separately, below.) Yet another
possibility is that Asmo's death heralds Moridin's resurrection.
<P>
<h3>Personal Enterprise</h3>
Perhaps Asmodean was killed by somebody who had been planning it for a
while, and had held off because he was a pet project of Lanfear's. When
Lanfear died/vanished, whoever it was took the opportunity to remove him.
(Problem with this: Lanfear claimed to her fellow Chosen that Asmo had gone
over to Rand entirely of his own free will, not due to any scheme of
hers.) Alternatively, the killer could have had some plan which required
Asmodean's removal, and done so. This raises the question of why did they
kill him when they did, rather than earlier? (See the discussion of
timing, above.)
<h3>Accidental Discovery</h3>
One possibility is that Asm was <EM>not</EM> the specific target of the
killer; he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Perhaps the
killer was/is spying/plotting/etc from within the court of the Dragon
Reborn. Asmodean bumped into him on his way to the wine closet,
recognized him, and got killed to protect his secret. Quoting from the
relevant passage: "He pulled open a small door, intending to find his
way to the pantry. There should be some decent wine." Then we have,
"You? No!" He was going to <em>look</em> for wine. He probably opened a door
to an empty storeroom or hallway. It was <em>not</em> a wine pantry. He
hadn't found it yet. If you reread the passage yourself, it seems that
it may have even been an accident he ran into his killer (i.e. the
killer wasn't planning on it, but since Asmodean saw him...). This
motive fits well with the body being removed/destroyed. If the killing
was for punishment, it would have made more sense for the body to be
left, and the death widely publicized, to set an example.
<P>
So how could the body being discovered disclose something about the killer
(to the other characters)? There are 3 possibilities. 1) the killer
is part of Rand's entourage, and a dead Asmo could make people suspicious
that there was a traitor in the ranks. 2) there is a hole in Rand's
security, and a dead Asm would inspire people to find it and patch it up.
3) the killer is hiding (not necessarily only from Rand-- could also be from
the Forsaken) and a dead body could start folks thinking the killer was
active.
<P>
<h3>Tie-in to Taimandred</h3>
If Taim is Demandred, there is a very good, concrete motive for Asmodean
to be killed. Namely, Asmodean could have recognised Demandred--by looks,
or personality, or strength in the Power--and betrayed him to Rand. In
order for Taim to work his way into Rand's organization, Asmodean had to be
eliminated.
<P>
One might object that Demandred was not informed of the supposed plan to
kill Asmodean on his behalf. However, this is not a problem. Demandred
wasn't even <em>told</em> about the plans the DO had for him until
<em>after</em> Asmodean was killed. And if the plan was to play Taim, he
had one month between being informed of the plan and his appearance on
Rand's doorstep.
<P>
<h3>Simple plot to cause confusion</h3>
The killer may have killed Asmo as part of a plot to annoy or confuse Rand.
The problem with this is that there are many better targets for a person
with that motive. Why not go after somebody Rand actually cares about,
like Mat, Avi, or Egwene? The only way this motive makes sense at all is
if the killer knew Asmo's value to Rand as a teacher. In other words, the
killer knew "Jasin Natal" was really Asmodean. The only suspects who would
know that would be the Forsaken, and they all have much better motives than
causing confusion.
<P>
<a name="opp"></A>
<h2>Opportunity</H2>
Needless to say, the murderer either was already in Caemlyn when Rand made
his surprise raid, or had a way to get there at will. Furthermore, the
killer must have been able to get into the Palace (and out again, with the
body-- see below). Now, any of the Forsaken could have done that easily,
by Traveling. Shaidar Haran could have used the shadow-travel trick to get
there. Neither Fain nor Slayer were known to be in Caemlyn at the time.
In Fain's case, it is known that he was in Tar Valon (some long way from
Caemlyn) about 25 days before Asm's death. It's not that likely that he
could have made it in that time by conventional travel, although he could
have used the Ways; there are known Waygates in both TV and Caemlyn. Since
Slayer's been unaccounted for for some time, he too could have been in
Caemlyn, although there is no real reason to think he was. There is a
further problem with Fain and Slayer: if they'd had any actual plan to kill
Asmo, they wouldn't have been in Caemlyn; they'd have been in Cairhien.
The Caemlyn attack was a snap decision on Rand's part, and could not have
been expected by ANY of the suspects. Thus, if the murderer went to the
Caemlyn palace with the purpose of killing Asmodean, he/she must have some
method of speedy traveling, such as Traveling.
<P>
<a name="you"></A>
<h2>"Then I saw her face..." The Recognition Factor</h2>
Recognised by and terrified Asm: again, any FS would be recognised. The
extreme reaction implies it was somebody he never expected to see, like
somebody he thought was dead. However, since Asmo was a weaselly coward,
it's conceivable that any FS would terrify him, especially if he/she was
about to kill him. However, point is raised why a FS would be walking
around Rand's stronghold w/o a disguise. If the killer dropped disguise to
show Asm who was killing him, why bother? Dramatic effect?
<P>
<a name="body"></a>
<h2>"Oh, I ain't got no bodeeee."--Where is it?</h2>
No body was left behind at the murder scene. This is evidenced by the fact
that nobody (except the killer, duh) seems to know he's dead. Rand
certainly doesn't. He thinks Asmo ran away: "If they discovered that he
had held one of the Forsaken prisoner and allowed him to escape... He would
deal with Asmodean himself if the man ever turned up again." [LOC: 3, A
Woman's Eyes, 92] In TPOD, Rand <EM>still</EM> thinks Asmo's alive; he
initially thinks that the attack at the end is Asmodean and/or Demandred
[TPOD, 29, A Cup of Sleep, 565]. From this, we can conclude that he was
either killed in such a way that no remains were left, or that the body was
removed in order to hide the murder.
<P>
Either way, this points to a channeller being the killer. Channelling is
the only way we know of to kill a person while leaving no remains at all.
Even the Shadar Logoth dagger leaves something. If there were remains, a
channeller would have had no problem removing them, via a gateway. A
nonchanneller would have had more than a little difficulty walking out of
the Royal Palace carrying the corpse of the Lord Dragon's gleeman.
<P>
In fact, we should ask why the body (if there was one) was removed at all.
The only possible reason for the corpse to be removed would be to hide the
fact that the killer was around. For many of the killers, the supposed
motives would have been better served by leaving a recognizable body
behind. We've seen that those who betray the Dark are generally killed in
ways that serve as examples to others (e.g. Joiya and Amico in TSR, Ispan
in POD). If the goal was simply to terrify Rand, leaving the body behind
would have done a better job than removing it. The "cover-for-Taimandred"
motive does give a possible reason for removing the body-- a dead Asmo
might make Rand suspicious.
<P>
<a name="fate"></a>
<h2>Knowledge of Asmo's fate</h2>
Needless to say, the person who killed him must know that he's dead. This
condition can be used to eliminate quite a few suspects. Any character
whose thoughts indicate that he/she thinks Asmo may still be alive can't be
the killer. Likewise for any character who expresses ignorance of his fate
in a situation where she/he wouldn't lie.
<P>
<a name="sec"></a>
<h2>Secrecy: Why?</h2>
Despite RJ's comments to the contrary, it is not at all obvious who did the
dirty deed. One question to ask ourselves is, "WHY is RJ keeping it a
secret?" The lack of action on this front in LOC, ACOS, and TPOD pretty
much demonstrates that the murder in and of itself is NOT a major plot
thread, so there is no point in keeping it secret for the sake of keeping
the reader in suspense. So, why <em>is</em> RJ keeping it secret?
<P>
One answer is that Asmo's killing is itself a clue to something else that
is going on, which we don't know about yet. This could be the return
of Lanfear, or the Taimandred idea.
<P>
We are not the only ones ignorant of the culprit. All of the characters
(except one, obviously) are also ignorant of whodunnit (if they're
Forsaken), or of what actually happened (if they're Good Guys or
rank-and-file DFs). So, whoever killed Asm must have a reason for hiding
it. After all, it's not like anybody would condemn them for punishing a
traitor. For any of the Forsaken, this could be as simple as keeping the
other Forsaken on their toes by causing uncertainty.
<a name="obv"></a>
<h2>Obvious to the most casual observer: Say what?</h2>
<P>
RJ has repeatedly said that we should be able to figure out who the killer
is. In fact, at a post-TPOD signing in NYC, he talked to Aaron Bergman about
this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I asked about Asmodean again. He said that yes, we should be able to
figure it out the instant he died. He said that he thinks it's obvious now
and we should definitely be able to figure it out by the end of [TPOD].-- A.
Bergman, report from NYC book signing, 20 October 1998.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, RJ is obviously using the same definition of "obvious" that physics
professors are wont to use. That is, it's obvious if you know the answer,
and know which information is useful and which is irrelevant. It isn't
"obvious" in the usual meaning of the word. Note that RJ "also claims that
very, very few of the fan letters he gets are correct about [who killed
Asmo]." [Post-TPOD signing, Northern Virginia, 21 November, 1998, report by
John Novak.] This clearly shows that RJ's idea of "obvious" and his
readers' idea of "obvious" don't really mix, do they?
<P>
However, this statement by RJ is useful in eliminating possibilities. Not
even RJ could stretch "being able to figure it out the instant he died" to
encompass people or things we didn't know a thing about before the killing,
such as Shaidar Haran, Mesaana, or gholam.
<P>
Note that RJ's comment also implies that something in POD should clarify
the issue. The only thing which is applicable to any of the suspects is
the appearance of Cyndane, which does nothing but throw more fuel on the
fire in the Lanfear vs. Graendal debate (see below). It DOES let us argue
even more strongly against some of the less-likely suspects like Slayer or
Fain, who were largely irrelevant to events in POD. (Fain is mentioned in
passing, but nothing which connects him to Asmodean.)
<P>
<h2>Elimination of suspects: </h2>
<h3>Which suspects can be eliminated beyond any loony shadow of a
doubt?</h3>
<P>
<a name="dem"></a>
<h4>Demandred</h4>
From [LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 15-16], we see that Demandred
doesn't know what happened to Asmodean: "Lanfear has vanished without a
trace, just as Asmodean did." Hence, Demandred didn't kill him. (Dem.
would have no reason to lie about such a thing, and it is doubtful whether
he _could_ lie outright to the DO, under those circumstances (bathing in
the DO's presence at SG.)
<P>
<a name="semi"></A>
<h4>Semirhage</h4>
In [LOC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 141], Semirhage thinks to
herself, "Asmodean. A traitor, and so doomed but he really had
vanished..." and later, "If the Great Lord moved her here secretly,
might he not be moving Moghedien or Lanfear, or even Asmodean?" This
seems to imply that Semirhage doesn't know that Asmodean is dead, and thus,
she couldn't have killed him.
<P>
<a name="mog"></a>
<h4>Moghedien</h4>
She was Nynaeve's prisoner in Salidar-- either forkroot-drugged, or bound by
the a'dam, when Asmo was killed. Hence, she couldn't have been in Caemlyn.
<P>
<a name="gars"></a>
<h4>Aran'gar, Osan'gar</h4>
They weren't recycled until the beginning of LOC, and thus were busy being
dead when Asmo was killed.
<P>
<h3>Which suspects can be eliminated beyond reasonable doubt?</h3>
<a name="mes"></a>
<h4>Mesaana</h4>
Mesaana visited the Pit of Doom twice in the period between Asmodean's
death and her appearance in LoC, but with the DO never appearing. If she
had killed Asmodean, wouldn't she have made some sort of report to the DO,
especially since the DO approved of the murder? Also, in conversation
with Semirhage, she has expressed doubts about whether Asmodean is really dead
[LoC: 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 143]: "More troubling were the Chosen who had
vanished. Demandred insisted they must be dead, but she [Semirhage] and
Mesaana were not so sure". She doesn't mention Asmo specifically, and so
it is <em>possible</em> that she's only referring to Lanfear and Moggy.
However, while it's not conclusive, it is circumstantial evidence against
Mesaana being the murderer.
<P>
Furthermore, prior to LOC, we had not heard or seen a single thing about
Mesaana. Thus, she fails the "obviosity" test--there is no way we could
even suspect her from the instant he died.
<P>
<a name="slay"></A>
<h4>Slayer</h4>
Conceivably, he could have reached Caemlyn from the Two Rivers in time, but
his motive would have had to be a direct order from a DO or a Forsaken, and
how would he have known to go to Caemlyn? Not to mention, one would think
that the Royal Palace in Caemlyn would be the last place on earth "Lord
Luc" would show his face. Furthermore, why would the DO send him towards a
possible confrontation with a former Forsaken and Rand? As discussed
above, any non-channeller would have great trouble harming a channeller if
he or she was discovered first. (Slayer cannot channel-- <A HREF="../1.4_whats-up-dark/1.4.3_slayer-channel.html">See Section 1.4.3</A>.)
Plus, he'd have had to sneak the body away with no OP help. He was badly
hurt in TSR, and it's not certain that he would be in any condition to
sneak into the Royal Palace, kill a guy, and sneak back out with the body.
<P>
Slayer also fails the "obvious" test. He doesn't appear in TFOH at all
(before Asmo's death, at least), nor does he appear in LOC, ACOS, or TPOD.
There is no particular reason to suspect him, and quite a few reasons not
to.
<P>
<a name="sh"></A>
<h4>Shaidar Haran</h4>
First, there is no reason to think that Asmo would recognize the Superfade.
It is a possibility that Shaidar Haran told Asmodean in his dreams that it
would come after him, but that would almost require that Ishamael was
resurrected as SH, which we know not to be the case (unless you want to get
really loony and say that Moridin is Shaidar Haran). We say this since
Myrddraal don't dream. Second, his motive would have had to have been a
directive from the DO, and the missing body is not consistent with that.
He <em>could</em> have gotten to the Palace quickly, using the Fade
Shadow-Travel trick, and destroyed the body using the "black fire" trick he
used to burn the spear in [ACOS: 40, Spears, 637] (although he'd have no
motive for destroying the body-- quite the opposite). However, it doesn't
seem likely that a Fade would be wandering around the Palace in broad
daylight. He'd hardly be inconspicuous. Again, this suspect fails the
"obvious" criterion, because we didn't even know he existed before LOC came
out.
<P>
<a name="sam"></A>
<h4>Sammael</h4>
We are given very few hints in Sammael's thoughts in LOC and ACOS, and the
issue is made even muddier by the game of deception he plays with Graendal.
But in [LoC, 6, Threads Woven of Shadow, 133] we have: "Rumors! Lanfear
has been aiding al'Thor since the beginning, if you [Graendal] ask me. I
would have had his head in the Stone of Tear except that someone sent
Myrddraal and Trollocs to save him! That was Lanfear; I am certain. I'm
done with her. The next time I see her, I'll kill her! And why would he
kill Asmodean? I would if I could find him, but he has gone over to
al'Thor. He's teaching him!" This is in a Sammael POV section. He is
also trembling with anger, which makes it quite unlikely he's feigning
ignorance of Asmo's fate. Thus, it's unlikely that Sammael did the deed.
<a name="gho"></a>
<h4>Gholam</h4>
The only point in favor of this idea is that Asmo probably would have
recognised a gholam, and been scared of it. However, there are more
problems with this idea than there are conveniences. Firstly, it would
have to have been sent by a Forsaken, which means we have to look among
them anyway. Secondly, we've seen how gholam kill (Herid Fel), and it is
way messier than the quick, clean way Asmo died. Since we didn't know
about gholam before LOC, the gholam-as-killer theory fails the "obviosity"
requirement. There's also the question of whether Asmo would call a gholam
"you."
<P>
<a name="fain"></a>
<h4>Padan Fain</h4>
The basic argument for Fain as the killer is this: He could have been in
Caemlyn at the time (via the Ways, if nothing else). He would want to kill
any Forsaken because they would interfere with his plans to be Rand's
personal hell. However, that presupposes that Fain knew Jasin Natal was a
Forsaken, which seems a very unlikely thing for Fain to know, given that
he'd never seen Asmo/Natal before supposedly killing him. An alternative
motive which has been proposed is that Fain killed Natal because he was
trying to cause confusion and stress for Rand by disappearing a member of
his retinue. However, this does not fit in with everything else we've seen
of Fain's MO, which has mainly involved ingratiating himself with
highly-placed people and planting the seeds of Mashadar in their minds.
Plus, killing Rand's gleeman and splitting doesn't really make for much of
a dastardly plot to undermine Rand's confidence. It would have been much
more effective for Fain to try to kill somebody closer to Rand--one of his
friends, or even one of his Maiden bodyguards. The "mistake" motive doesn't
work for Fain, because we'd have to have a reason for Fain to be in the
Palace, and there is zero evidence that he was doing anything in the
palace--no reference to anything of the sort in TFOH, LOC, ACOS, or TPOD.
<P>
Furthermore, as we discussed in the "means" section, Fain would have had
to have killed Asmo with the dagger, and that isn't consistent with the
way Asmo died, or the lack of a body.
<h2>Round up the usual suspects: the viable possibilities</h2>
Having eliminated most of the suspects, either by showing that they
couldn't possibly have done it, or by showing that there are many arguments
against their guilt and only slim evidence for it, we can settle down to
the three most likely suspects: Graendal, Lanfear, and Ishamael/Moridin.
(Note: most of the evidence discussed centers on Graendal and Lanfear. I've
included Moridin in the list of possible suspects mainly because we don't
know enough to really eliminate him. The two front-runners for Asmo-killer
are Lanfear and Graendal.)
<a name="mori"></a>
<h3>Ishamael/Moridin</h3>
TPOD makes it clear that Moridin is Ishamael recycled. At this point, we
don't know when he was created, and as far as we know, his first step in
regaining control over the Shadow forces was killing Asmodean. In any
case, there isn't really that much to discuss about him. He definitely
satisfies means, motive, and opportunity (provided he wasn't dead at the
time). He could have made himself recognised to Asmodean by using a OP
disguise, although why would he bother? Body disposal wouldn't be a
problem, and we have no way to know if he knows Asmo's fate (although even
if he didn't kill him, it's likely that Mr. Nae'blis knows exactly what
happened to the fellow). It would make sense for it to be a secret, since
Moridin's existence and identity have been unknown by us and by the other
Forsaken. Obviosity is not obvious, but it's within the realm of twisted
possibility (Moridin is Ishy, who has come back from the "dead" twice
before, so we might suspect he did so again).
<P>
On the other hand, there is absolutely no evidence in favor of him having
done it, either. Note that RJ's rejection of the "pun" theory could
encompass Moridin killing Asmo, as well as kidnapping him.
<P>
<a name="lanf"></a>
<h3>Lanfear</h3>
Up until the appearance of Cyndane in TPOD, Lanfear looked like a very good
suspect. The case against her is very strong. She's a channeller, so she
had the means to kill him, the ability to enter and leave the Palace
undetected, and a way to dispose of the body. Since Asmo had just seen her
"die" earlier in the day, he would certainly have been shocked and
terrified to see her strolling around the Palace.
<P>
<h4>Lanfear's Motive</h4>
Lanfear also had the strongest motive to kill Asmo. Lanfear gave Asmo to
Rand "to teach him," knowing that Asmo was about the worst (and
hence the safest) Forsaken you could pick as a teacher. But he was also
the one who she could be sure would react the way she wanted him to once
she shielded him. It would seem that she wasn't too interested in giving
Rand all the secrets of the AoL. More likely, she just didn't want him
gentling or killing himself because of his ignorance (see her reaction when
he draws saidin through the sa'angreal in TGH-- though that could simply be
fear for her own life). Here's Asmo's take on it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do you think Lanfear really intended me to teach you
everything? If she had wanted that, she would have
contrived to stay close so she could link us. She wants
you to live, Lews Therin, but this time she means to be
stronger than you." [TFOH: 3, Pale Shadows, 75].
</blockquote>
<P>
When she confronted Rand at the docks, it is unlikely that she knew he had
an angreal. Although she would certainly be hard pressed to shield him
alone, it should have been no problem with an angreal, especially since he
is untrained in her opinion, despite whatever he might have gleaned from
Asmo. After she picked up the angreal, she attacked Rand, and he resisted.
She increased her attempts to shield and hurt Rand, probably to her limit
even with the angreal. But Rand (with his own angreal) held his ground.
He even believed "He could end it, finish her. He could call down
lightning, or wrap her in the fire she herself had used to kill..." [TFOH,
52, Choices, 631]. If Lanfear did <EM>not</EM> know that he had an angreal (she
probably didn't), then she would have taken this as a very bad sign for
her. Knowing that Asmodean was still "teaching" him stuff, and
that she was the one who put him there, it is very likely that it would be
a <EM>high</EM> priority to remove him, if Rand can foil even her strongest
attempts to shield him.
<P>
Furthermore, she would have blamed Asmodean's teaching for her defeat and
humiliation, and thus she'd have wanted to get revenge. She's that type of
gal.
<P>
<h4>She SAID she was going to kill him</h4>
In TSR, in the Stone of Tear, Lanfear comes to Rand as Selene, and reveals
herself as a Forsaken . During that conversation, she proposes that Rand
allow a male Forsaken to become his teacher. She continues in her old tack
of seducing Rand with power (not The Power, just power), by describing how
she and he will rule the world once he has knelt to the DO. She
describes her entire plan in [TSR: 9, Decisions, 129]:
<blockquote>
"Kneel to the Great Lord, and he will set you above all
others. He will leave you free to reign as you will, so long as you
bend knee to him only once. To acknowledge him. No more than that.
He told me this. Asmodean will teach you to wield the Power without
it killing you, teach you what you can do with it. Let me help you.
We can destroy all the others. The Great Lord will not care. We can
destroy all of them, <em>even Asmodean, once he has taught you all
you need to know.</em> You and I can rule the world together under
the Great Lord, forever." (emphasis mine)
</blockquote>
The relevance of this quote to the matter at hand is obvious. All along,
Lanfear has been planning to kill Asmodean, after he was done teaching
Rand. Obviously, after the encounter at the docks, Lanfear has every
reason to believe that Asmodean has taught Rand more than enough, more than
she really wanted him to. In fact, if Lanfear did kill Asmodean, then this
quote means that it really IS obvious who killed him. His fate corresponds
exactly with Lanfear's plans for him.
<P>
<h4>The "You? No!" evidence, and how it points to Lanfear</h4>
It is obvious that Asmodean was indeed terrified of the person he saw.
There are many people that Asmo would be afraid of, but it is doubtful that
anyone but Lanfear would elicit quite this response from Asmo. Although
Asmo may have reason to be afraid of many people, we know that Lanfear is
the person he fears the most:
<blockquote>
"Even if he manages to convince the others that he has been a prisoner,
they would still tear him apart, and he knows it. The weakest dog in the
pack often suffers that fate. Besides, I watch his dreams on occasion. He
dreams of you triumphing over the Great Lord and putting him up beside you
on high. Sometimes he dreams of me." Her smile said those dreams were
pleasant for her, but not so for Asmodean. [TFOH, 6, Gateways, 124]
</blockquote>
Even though Asmo knows all the Forsaken would rip him to shreds given the
chance, the one he has nightmares about is Lanfear.
<P>
Furthermore, just before getting whacked, Asmo was just thinking to himself
about Lanfear being dead and how glad he was: "He was hardly sorry Lanfear
was dead. Rahvin either, but Lanfear especially, for what she had done to
him. He would laugh when each of the others died, too, and most for the
last." [TFOH, 56, Glowing Embers, 681] Not thirty seconds after these
thoughts pass through his mind, he opens the door and sees ... who? And
he is shocked/terrified (big surprise). The combination of these things
makes it seem likely that Lanfear was indeed the killer. (This scenario
also plays into the "obvious" argument.)
<P>
<h4>"Obviousity" and secrecy</h4>
As discussed above, if any suspect can be said to be obviously the killer,
from the moment he dies, it's Lanfear. She said she'd kill him, and he
was (ironically?) thinking of her right before he died. Furthermore, the
fact that his killer is still a secret, three books later, makes sense if
Lanfear did it. Knowing that she killed Asmo would be a dead giveaway that
she was active.
<P>
<h4>The big problem</h4>
Of course, there has to be a stumbling block. With all the great evidence
in favor of Lanfear, there is a correspondingly large problem with her.
Namely, as far as we know, she was extremely indisposed at the time of
Asmo's death. As in dead. The "new" character Cyndane, introduced in TPOD,
is almost certainly Lanfear in a new body
(<A HREF="../1.2_forsaken2/1.2.5_cyndane.html">see section 1.2.5</A>).
The only way
we know of for a person to get into a new body is to be killed and then
reincarnated by the Dark One. The most likely time for Lanfear to have died
is when she fell through the exploding doorway with Moiraine. If this
happened, there is no way she could have been alive to kill Asmodean.
<P>
However, there are ways (loony ways) to get around this. First, the new
body could have come from the Foxes as the (possibly unintentional) result
of some wish. Second, she could have gotten killed sometime after leaving
Foxland. <A HREF="../1.2_forsaken2/1.2.5_cyndane.html">See section
1.2.5</A> for more details.
<P>
Another point raised against Cyndane/Lanfear being the assassin is that
Asmodean would not have recognised "Cyndane," let alone have been terrified
of her. However, this objection can be applied to any of the channelling
suspects. Lanfear would certainly want Asmo to know who was killing him,
even if she wasn't her old self. Thus, she could have used a OP disguise
to make "Cyndane" look like the old Lanfear. Likewise, any of the other
Forsaken would have been wearing a disguise while walking around the
Palace. Remember, this was right after Rand balefired one of their number
with extreme prejudice. All of the Forsaken known to be alive at that time
(Graendal, Sammael, Demandred, Semirhage, Mesaana) are cautious enough to
not go trouncing through the Palace undisguised. Thus, in order for Asmo
to recognise one of them as the killer, the killer would have had to remove
her/his disguise. This is essentially the same as Lanfear/Cyndane donning
a disguise to freak him out. (Also note that Lanfear <em>is</em> crazy
enough to go walking around the Palace in a recognizable form.)
<P>
<a name="grn"></A>
<h3>Graendal</h3>
Finally, we are left with Graendal. Graendal has some evidence working for
her. For one thing, she has tried to assure Sammael that Asmodean is dead,
which makes her one of the only Forsaken to express a belief that Asmodean
was toasted.
<blockquote>
"`You [Sammael] know as much as I do,' Graendal said blithely, pausing for a
sip from her goblet. `Myself, I think Lews Therin killed them [Asmodean,
Lanfear, Moghedien]. [...] There are rumors out of Cairhien about Lanfear
dying at Lews Therin's hands the same day he killed Rahvin.'" [LoC, 6, Threads
Woven of Shadow, 133] (Sammael PoV)
<P>
Graendal says: "So many of us has died confronting him. [...] And Lanfear
and Asmodean, whatever you believe. Possibly Moghedien" [LoC, 6, Threads Woven
of Shadow, 134]
<P>
"`Asmodean and Lanfear are dead, and I [Graendal] am sure Moghedien must be,
too.' She was surprised to hear her own voice, hoarse and unsteady." [LoC,
23, To Understand a Message, 348] (Graendal PoV)
</blockquote>
On the other hand, it should be noted that Graendal expresses as much
certainty about Lanfear's demise as Asmodean's, and she sure didn't kill
Lanfear. Her statements that Asmo must be dead could either be simple
opinion, or she could have found out the same way that Demandred did--
from the DO.
<P>
In fact, we know that Graendal has visited the DO:
<blockquote>
"Only she [Graendal] herself knew that she had made her own journey to
Shayol Ghul and down to the lake of fire. Only she knew that the Great Lord
had all but promised to name her Nae'blis" [LoC, Threads Woven of Shadow,
138]
</blockquote>
This memory includes no mention of Shaidar Haran, and furthermore, when SH
appears to Graendal in [TPOD, 12, New Alliances, 266], she is not familiar
with him. Thus, we know that SH was not present when Graendal made this
trip to the Pit of Doom, and therefore, this trip <em>might</em> have
occurred before the Super-Fade appeared. We first saw SH at the start of
LOC, so Graendal's visit could have been before Asmodean's death. The idea
is that the DO may have used the reward of Nae'blis to motivate Graendal to
kill Asmo.
<P>
There are other points in favor of Graendal being the killer. She's
cautious and will thus probably plan well. She's also somewhat
expendable. Sammael's required to fix Rand's attention, Demandred is
needed to act as Taim. Mesaana is in too good a position (the White Tower)
to endanger, and there are indications that Semirhage is working directly on
the DO's order in another matter.
<P>
The strongest argument in favor of Graendal, though, is that she is the
only suspect without any major points against her. The only requirements
which she seems to fail are 7 and 8. Namely, there is no reason for RJ to
have kept it a secret for over five years, and there is no way Graendal is
obviously the killer-- the case in her favor is mostly a process of
elimination over the three books following TFOH.
<P>
One thing which doesn't quite fit in with Graendal as the murderer is the
bit in [TPOD, 12, New Alliances, 266] when SH talks to her. He tells her,
"The Great Lord thought you might not take [Moggy's and Cyndane's] word,
Graendal. The time when you could go your own way has passed." This
implies that Graendal HAS been going her own way, not rubbing out fellow
Forsaken at the DO's order. This leaves personal initiative and accidental
meeting as the only motives for her to kill Asmo. From what we've seen of
Graendal, she seems to be pretty happy to stay entrenched in Arad Doman.
(Note, however, that she has ventured onto Rand's turf at least once, when
she had sufficiently strong motivation. After Rand took Illion, she went
there to remove evidence which would tie her to Sammael's schemes. [TPOD:
12, New Alliances, 262])
