<P align="center">[John S. Hamby, Craig Moe, Andrea Leistra]</P>
<hr>
<P>
This is an attempt at looking at all the facts concerning the murders of
Ispan and Adeleas. Here, we present what is known and what can or
cannot be concluded from these facts.
<h2>General Considerations</h2>
From [TPOD, 28, Crimsonthorn, 545-547], we know that Adeleas had taken
Ispan to the small hut the night before. In the morning, Kirstian comes to
find Elayne. Lan has found the bodies. So, we have the time frame. It's
curious that Lan is the one who found the two. Certainly Vandene as sister
and fellow interrogator would have made more sense. Presumably, when
Adeleas is dealing with Garenia/Zarya and then Kirstian, Vandene is taking
care of Ispan.
<P>
Description of the crime scene: "Adeleas lay on her side beside an
overturned stool, a cup on the rough wooden floor not far from her
outstretched hand. Her eyes stared, and a pool of congealed blood spread
out from the deep slash across her throat. Ispan lay on a small cot,
staring at the ceiling. Lips drawn back in a rictus bared her teeth, and
her bulging eyes seemed full of horror. As well they might have, since a
wrist-thick wooden stake stood out from between her breasts. The hammer
that had plainly been used to drive it in lay beside the cot, on the edge
of a dark stain that ran back under the cot."
<P>
Then we get the description of the interior of the hut. "A second
three-legged stool, a rough table holding a flickering lamp, a green teapot
and a second cup, a rude stone fireplace with cold ash on the hearthstone."
<P>
From all this, it certainly seems that the tea was delivered the previous
evening. The fire is out; the flickering lamp suggests the oil is running
low. That a lamp is burning at all suggests that it was dark outside when
the murderer arrived. Though the fact that the two windows are described
as tiny might negate this, as a lamp might be needed anytime of the day.
However, it seems that the scene is viewed in the light of day and not by
the single lamp.
<P>
Vandene assumes or directs the line of thought to Ispan being the primary
victim. This assumption is presumed because more time was taken to kill
Ispan.
<P>
Nynaeve makes the assumption that whoever decided to use crimsonthorn did
so because they either wanted to make sure that no one came with an
antidote or that they wanted one or the other to know who was killing them.
<P>
The use of crimsonthorn does indicate two things. First, Adeleas was meant
to die. Whether the murder was a hit on Ispan or whether Adeleas' death
was the primary goal, a drug is used, in lethal amounts, that Adeleas with
her penchant for sweet tea is particularly prone to. This implies that the
murderer knew before hand who was guarding Ispan. In fact it might be
that the murderer was waiting when Adeleas was by herself with Ispan.
This means that the murder was not spontaneous. There was a bit of
planning involved.
<P>
The second thing that crimsonthorn indicates is that time was not really
of the essence. The murderer took her time. It seems possible she
knew no one would disturb her that night. (This is also indicated by the
method used in killing Ispan: pounding a stake through the heart is not
really the quickest way to kill a person.)
<P>
Speaking of the stake, the manner of Ispan's death (being staked through
the chest) raises some questions. Even if one or both women were
immobilized first, pounding a stake through someone is
difficult--there's bones and things in the way, not to mention how messy it
would be. If the killer did the job up close and personal, she would have
been covered in Ispan's blood. There are three possibilities: 1. The
killer could not channel, and used physical means (herbs and physical
violence) to kill the victims because that was the only way. 2. The
killer could channel, and used channeling to make it <EM>look like</EM>
someone who could not did the deed. 3. (Related to #2) The killer could
channel and needed to do so because he/she was physically too weak to carry
out the deed in the mundane manner. So, there is at least an even chance
that the killer was a channeller, and used the OP in Ispan's murder, at
least. Unfortunately, this doesn't help much, since most of the suspects
(all the Kin, AS, and Windfinders in the party) can channel. [Genevieve
Williams, Dave Rothgery]
<h2>Who drank the tea?</h2>
<P>
Adeleas has a cup near her hand. Her body position and the fact she has her
throat cut is a definite sign that she fell victim to the tea. But is there
anything that really points to Ispan having drank any of it?
<P>
We have two cups, yes. But one fell from Adeleas' hand as she presumably
fell to the floor. The second cup is on the table still. The reason this
sticks out is that the hammer used on Ispan is left by the cot. Yet
the cup is on the table by another stool. (Note that this can be explained
by positing that the the killer moved Ispan to the cot in order to stake
her more easily.)
<P>
The effect of the crimsonthorn, as described by Nynaeve, is "A little kills
pain. This much... This much kills, but slowly. Even a few sips would be
enough. They might have remained conscious for hours. Not able to move,
but aware."
<P>
This suggests that perhaps Ispan did not drink any tea. How is this
possible? Quite simple. Whoever killed the two could channel. The drug
was used to take out Adeleas. In fact, it was tailored to take her out.
With Adeleas out of the way, the shield around Ispan would disappear, no?
Well, not if the murderer was a channeller herself (we can all agree that the
murderer is most likely female). Ispan is always kept shielded.
<P>
So the only scenario that lets Ispan's murderer be a non-channeller is this:
A non-Aes Sedai that Adeleas would take tea from brings tea to the hut,
then leaves. Adeleas would not sit and drink tea while guarding Ispan with
someone who was not a sister hovering around the hut. The murderer waits
outside the hut for the tea to take effect on Adeleas. So in order for
Ispan to also be incapacitated a couple of things would have to have
happened.
<P>
One is that Adeleas gives tea to Ispan and then drinks some herself. Ispan
is now drugged and so is Adeleas. Murderer enters and does the deed.
<P>
Two, Adeleas can still channel while drugged. She maintains the shield
while the murderer enters and forces Ispan to drink the tea while still
shielded. Then the killer drives the stake through Ispan's heart and slits
Adeleas' throat. A variation on the above is that even if drugged, Adeleas
can channel the whole time, but is somehow locked into the shield and Ispan
is killed. Not until the stake is completely driven through does the
murderer turn to Adeleas.
<P>
All these scenarios seem a bit unlikely. Ispan is Black Ajah. I don't see
Adeleas sitting down and sharing a cup of tea with her. (Consider the
vehemence with which the other Aes Sedai in the series react to the idea of
the BA.) So how is Ispan kept helpless if Adeleas loses the ability to
channel when the drug takes hold? We're assuming that either the drug
incapacitates the ability to channel or Adeleas was so far gone under the
influence of the drug that it did not matter by the time the murders took
place.
<P>
Furthermore the differences in Adeleas and Ispan's bodies might go beyond
the way in which each was killed. Adeleas clearly was under the influence
of the drug. Yet Ispan's countenance clearly shows the ability to move her
face and feel pain. Her eyes bulge and her lips are drawn back. If
Adeleas is so far gone into the drug that all she can do is stare while her
throat is being cut, how come Ispan is able to show such reaction; not just
in terms of horror but to physically show it as well? (Especially since
crimsonthorn is a painkiller.)
<P>
So it is quite possible that if whoever killed the two could channel, that
Adeleas was the only one drugged. Shields can be woven-off and left in
place. They can also be passed from one person to another.
<P>
One thing we do know is that Vandene is either the killer or she was not
a part of the shield when Adeleas was killed. Otherwise she would have felt
something was wrong-- she certainly would have noticed when Adeleas died.
<P>
So assume for a moment that Vandene is not the murderer. That means that
Adeleas was capable of maintaining the shield by herself. So it might also
indicate that Adeleas was stronger than Ispan, or even that once in place
the shield could be maintained by anyone.
<P>
So the use of crimsonthorn does not prove that the killer was a
non-channeller and there is indication that <em>maybe</em> the drug was not
used on Ispan at all and thus increases the odds of a channeller's
involvement.
<P>
<h2>The Suspects</h2>
<h3>Non-Channellers</h3>
Considering only those from whom Adeleas might accept tea:
<UL>
<LI><strong>Jaem</strong> - Could he be the murderer and Vandene not be BA?
While it could be possible the two worked together, it's hard to see Jaem
acting on his own, not to mention Vandene would have noticed something.
<P>
<LI><strong>Pol</strong> - as a servant of Merilille's she is the most
likely suspect for the single-killer theory. Yet would Adeleas take
tea from even her? The problems of being a non-channeller of course
exist assuming Ispan did not drink the tea. Also from Ispan's facial
expression I don't think we can rule out the possibility of no sound
whatsoever. If Adeleas can no longer channel because she is either dead
or drugged, then regardless of the problems of Ispan (assuming the drug
was used on Ispan), there is the risk of detection. How much sound
does a stake being driven through the heart make? And if Ispan is able
to show expression might a whimper, a cry or even a scream be
completely out of the question? Also there is the time issue. Whoever
did this knew they had the time for the tea to take affect and then do
the actual killings. Would a maid know that she could remain
undisturbed or at least undetected? Would a non-channeller have the
courage to do this task among so many channellers without the ability
herself? Note that when Forkroot is introduced it is the first time
that the ability to channel is mentioned as being inhibited by a drug.
So Crimsonthorn is not definitely something that is shown to rob a
channeller of this ability. And even Forkroot which left Nynaeve and
Elayne paralyzed allowed them to make sounds.
</ul>
<P>
One argument says that even if the ability was there despite the
crimsonthorn, the common belief shared by most Aes Sedai concerning the
connections between channeling and gesturing would mean that once paralyzed
Adeleas could not channel to defend herself, since she could not move. But
this would mean a foreknowledge of this and I think once again points away
from any non-channeller as the killer.
<P>
So while possible I think that it is a bit more improbable that any
non-channeller could have done the deed.
<P>
<h3>Channelling Suspects</h3>
<strong>Non-Aes Sedai:</strong>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Any Windfinder</strong> - Given that the state of affairs
between the Aes Sedai and the Windfinders, the fact that Adeleas
trusted this person enough to take tea from her eliminates any of these
women.
<LI><strong>The Kin</strong> - As a general group, the fact
that the Aes Sedai consider the Kin to be so far beneath them, and the
general poor relations between the two groups indicate that they fit the
same category as the Windfinders.
<LI><strong>Asra</strong> - This is the Kinswoman who originally attracted El and Ny's attention in
Ebou Dar. In one of the showdowns between the Kin and the AS, Asra
seems almost intent on starting a riot. [TPOD: 28, Crimsonthorn, 544]
The murder needn't even have been BA-related; Asra might have been
fearful/upset over Adeleas' decree that Tower runaways among the Kin
should be disciplined and forced to become Novices again. [TPOD: 28,
Crimsonthorn, 542]. [Bill Brooks]. However, these reasons also show that
there is little likelihood that Adeleas would trust Asra enough to take
tea from her.
<LI><strong>Kirstian</strong> - now in novice white it is possible that she
would take the opportunity to do away with either Ispan or Adeleas.
She did volunteer herself. She also is quite strong so maintaining
the shield etc., would be no problem.
<LI><strong>Garenia</strong> - Same as above. As a novice in Adeleas'
eyes, it might be conceivable that Adeleas would send her for tea.
She is very strong in the One Power as well.
<LI><strong>Reanne</strong> - It is possible that as the head of the Kin
Adeleas would trust her but the idea of Reanne killing Adeleas is
rather implausible. Still, because of the tea thing, she is a more
likely suspect than say Chilares or Famelle or even most other Kin.
<LI><strong>Alise</strong> - Everyone seems to do what this woman wants.
So she too is a little more likely than most other Kin.
</ul>
<P>
However, it takes a bit of a leap to assume that any level of trust would
exist between Aes Sedai and any of the Kin, especially in the wake of the
"we are many and they are few" business. So like the Windfinders I
think the Kin are very low on the lists of suspects.
<P>
<strong>Aes Sedai:</strong>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Vandene</strong> - Certainly she looks the most guilty. She
knows what Ispan has said and she knows what Ispan <EM>has
not</EM> said. More importantly she has an idea of what her
sister may be thinking or be on the verge of figuring out.
Furthermore, Vandene was the other person in charge of Ispan,
yet it is Lan that discovers the two bodies. Exactly when was
Vandene going to check up on her sister? And what about the
way the shield is described when the two first question her in
[TPOD: 4, A Quiet Place, 105] Certainly Vandene could not be
innocent and a part of the shielding at the same time. Yet it
raises the question of the timing of the deaths if it was
Vandene. Why now? Certainly if Vandene is BA she would know
what if anything Ispan could reveal. More on Vandene as a
suspect later.
<LI><strong>Careane</strong> - The weakest of the Aes Sedai. This would
make the use of crimsonthorn to eliminate Adeleas pretty
important. In fact of the AS (excluding Elayne and Nynaeve),
Careane is also the only sister whose strength we know in
terms of comparison to the others. Problem is that Careane
has at least two Warders. True, both could be Darkfriends.
But I think this is a stumbling block that at this point is
rather hard to step over. One little note- Careane is the one
who does not hide her face enough and sets the Kin farm on its
ear. A bit odd since Aes Sedai seem to be quite adept at
keeping the one identifying trait under wraps. She could have
been trying to create a panic? Or was she trying to show her
face to a DF among the Kin? Of course it might be that she
was just stupid.
<LI><strong>Sareitha</strong> - Not much known about her. There are a
total of five Warders among the five sisters. Adeleas has
none. Vandene has one. Careane has more than one but the
number is not known, so Sareitha could have a Warder. If she
does not, which is quite likely since she was raised to the
shawl only three years ago, then Careane has at least three
warders. Besides sharing her Ajah, little seems to indicate
that Sareitha has any ties to Adeleas that would indicate her
as the murderer.
<LI><strong>Merilille</strong> - Perhaps most damning is the fact that it is
possible that she was picked by the Gray Ajah to lead the
Salidar delegation. And of course Delana as a Salidar Gray
Sitter who is also BA may have played a major role in picking
her. Of course that raises the question of why send a BA to
Ebou Dar? The Shadow does know of the possible cache of
angreal even if the Bowl of Winds is not yet a goal. Also
notice that Tylin is rather upset with the way Merilille has
handled matters until Nynaeve and Elayne show up and tell the
truth. So perhaps she is sent to keep the local ruler from
coming to an accomodation with the Salidar group. Certainly
add an unhappy ruler to an independent nobility plus the
constant threat of Whitecloaks and you would pretty much
hamper Salidar from any sort of effectiveness. On the
other hand, she could just be incompetent.
</UL>
<P>
Of the Aes Sedai, then, Careane and Merilille stand out as the most obvious of
the non-obvious killers-- Vandene, of course, being the obvious.
<P>
One problem with any of the Salidar Aes Sedai being the killer is that they
didn't try to prevent the finding and use of the Bowl and didn't steal it
and the rest of the goodies afterwards. However, since the AS are a very
hierarchical organization (and the BA follows that pattern), and since the
Shadow hierarchy was rather disorganised at the time the embassy was sent
(all the Forsaken scheming for themselves), some low-level BA in the
Salidar embassy to Ebou Dar might not have been informed of the importance
of the Bowl, and would have just followed orders to stick with the party
and spy/whatever.
<P>
<H2>The Prime Suspect: Vandene</H2>
[Andrea Leistra, Craig Moe]
<P>
<H3>Arguments in Favor of Vandene Being the Killer</H3>
<UL>
<LI>She isn't dead. She and Adeleas are nearly inseparable; it's asking a
bit much for her to be out just when her sister and their prisoner are
killed, and to stay gone for the entire time. If someone had been sent to
kill Adeleas and Vandene because they learned something they shouldn't,
she'd be dead now as well.
<P>
<LI>The interrogation of Ispan proceeded in a rather unorthodox fashion.
[TPOD: 4, A Quiet Place, 109]: "Then another use hit [Elayne], and
suddenly the silence from within was more ominous than any shrieks that
ward would contain." This other use may simply be, as Elayne supposes, to
prevent screams from being heard. However, it's also quite likely that
Vandene wants to prevent anyone from hearing what really goes on because
it's not what's supposed to be happening.
<P>
[TPOD: 6, Threads, 137]: "Adeleas and Vandene brought out Ispan between
them, firmly shielded and the leather sack back over her head. She walked
quite easily, and nothing visible said that anything at all had been done
to her, except....Ispan kept her hands folded at her waist, never so much
as trying to raise the sack for a peek, and when she was boosted into a
saddle, she held out her wrists to be corded to the pommel without being
told. If she was that amenable, perhaps they had learned something from
her. Elayne did not want to contemplate how the learning might have been
achieved."
<P>
<LI>She [Vandene] is unnaturally calm following Adeleas' death:
<P>
[TPOD: 28, Crimsonthorn, 546]: "Vandene's eyes remained on her sister,
calm in a face of Aes Sedai serenity."
<P>
(same page): "Her voice sounded serenity itself, but small wonder if that
was a mask."
<P>
"Elayne gasped at the brutality, but Vandene simply nodded."
<P>
[TPOD: 28, Crimsonthorn, 547]: "The calm of her made Elayne's skin crawl."
<P>
(after the funeral): "Vandene...appeared as serene as she had at Adeleas'
graveside."
<P>
Not only does she not mourn, except for one wail after the others have
left, but she isn't even <em>surprised</em> by the deaths.
<P>
<LI>She had access to Adeleas and Ispan without attracting comment or
notice, and could have had reason to kill them now -- perhaps her
identity as Black had been/was about to be revealed, or other important
Black secrets would be revealed by Ispan -- rather than at some other
time. Vandene's comment that Adeleas wouldn't take tea from somebody she
didn't trust makes sense, and anybody unusual wandering around the
interrogation site at night would surely attract suspicion from Adeleas,
so the killer must have been somebody she knew well. (OTOH, if Vandene
is the killer, why would she point this out?)
<P>
<LI>The difference in how Ispan and Adeleas died. Ispan was tortured
brutally, while Adeleas was killed quickly. This suggests that the
killer may have had some sympathy for Adeleas and not for Ispan, since
it's unlikely that a random Darkfriend murderer with time on her hands
would take the time to feed Adeleas the crimsonthorn tea and then
merely slit her throat.
<P>
<LI>Possible previous misdeeds: <em>Someone</em> warded that Draghkar that
attacked Moiraine in TGH, at Adeleas and Vandene's place.
</ul>
<P>
<h3>In defense of Vandene</h3>
Here are counter-arguments for the points against Vandene, and rebuttals:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Why were the inseparable sisters suddenly separated?</STRONG>
Remember that this is a procession towards Caemlyn, and traveling
across Andor takes up most of the day. Aes Sedai have to sleep as
well, and since the two obviously didn't trust anyone else with Ispan,
no matter how meek she had become, it makes sense that the pair would
alternate interrogation duties. Hence Vandene's absence when Adeleas
complains about runaways amongst the Kin.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How could Vandene remain so calm?</STRONG> RJ has quite a
few characters retain public composure only to grieve in private. Siuan
waited months to mourn the death of her warder, and Elayne never publicly
grieved for the death of her mother. Aes Sedai are famed for such
composure, and it is certainly in character for Vandene, who has taken a
Draghkar's attack, Elayne's usurping the Ebou Dari delegation, the Kin, a
gholam and the Seanchan all in stride, to react similarly when faced with
her sister's death. Furthermore, as Sandy Armstrong points out, one could take
Vandene's composure as a sign that she <em>didn't</em> kill Adeleas. If
she was covering something up she'd try to make it plain to everyone else
that she was extremely upset.
<P>
Rebuttal: Siuan's grieving was postponed due to her other problems: being
stilled, being tortured, being a refugee with Logain for company. Elayne
hasn't had confirmation that her mom is dead; she's slowly come to the
realization that her mom is most likely dead over an extended period of
time. Not to mention, this doesn't explain why Vandene didn't show any
sort of shock or surprise when her sister was found with her throat slit.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>But this explains who warded the Draghkar so simply.</STRONG>
Of course, before TPOD we already had a simple answer: Liandrin, a known
Black Ajah, who mysteriously disappeared soon after Moiraine. She's much
more likely to have been behind the attack than Vandene, who had left
Moiraine in the study moments earlier, with no idea she was about to go
outside. Not to mention, Vandene's Warder, Jaem, would have to be a DF,
too, and he helped Lan save Moiraine.
<P>
Rebuttal: That wouldn't matter much. The Draghkar could have been lying in
wait on the valid assumption that Moiraine would go outside eventually.
Warded, the Draghkar would not have had to fear being sensed. [Vic
Stallion] Furthermore, it's not very likely that Liandrin could manage to
trail Moiraine without Lan noticing. As for Jaem, he could still be a DF.
Note that Lan was conveniently off working the forms in the barn with Jaem
in TGH, rather than by Moiraine's side. When Lan rushed off to save
Moiraine, Jaem would have had to follow suit, or give the secret away.
<P>
</UL>
<h3>Further arguments against Vandene being the killer, and
counter-arguments</h3>
<UL>
<LI>How could she have avoided revealing her identity as Black to Adeleas
for all these years?
<P>
Counter-argument: This is exactly the sort of thing all Black sisters
have to do -- conceal their identity from close scrutiny for centuries.
It may not always be from a biological relative, but that doesn't make
it any different.
<P>
<LI>Her grief seemed genuine. (Her cry of anguish after Elayne left.)
<P>
Counter-argument: See above. If she's not damn good at faking this sort of
thing, she'd have been found out long ago. Besides, she could have been
issued orders to kill anyone who discovered particular information, or that
she was Black, so that she had to kill Adeleas even if she regretted doing
so.
<P>
<LI> Since the attack was directed at Ispan, why would Vandene kill
her sister in such an equally violent manner?
<P>
Counter-argument: Adeleas was not killed in an equally violent manner.
Both victims were drugged, but Adeleas's throat was cleanly cut. Ispan was
impaled with a wooden stake.
<P>
<LI>How could two people so close they could finish one another's sentences
end up on opposite sides of an ideological spectrum?
<P>
Counter-argument: The fact that Adeleas chose the Brown Ajah and Vandene
the Green shows that, although they thought alike in a lot of ways, they
didn't think alike in every way. [Vic Stallion]
</UL>
<P>
<h3>Other thoughts on Vandene as the killer</h3>
<UL>
<LI>There may have been something up between Ispan and <EM>both</EM> of the
Senior Twins. Clues are that both sisters participated in the
behind-closed-doors "interrogation" of Ispan, which proved fruitless, and
that Ispan seemed to become upset when she thought that Elayne and Nynaeve
might do the interrogation, rather than Adeleas and Vandene [TPOD: 4, A
Quiet Place, 107]. [Jonathan Vaught]
<P>
<LI>It is possible that Vandene did kill Adeleas and Ispan, but that she is
not BA. Perhaps <em>Adeleas</em> was BA, and Vandene discovered this
somehow through Ispan's questioning. She may have killed Adeleas and Ispan
to prevent Adeleas' good name from being ruined, and to spare her the
humiliation and pain of stilling and execution.
</UL>
<P>
<h2>Motive: Why kill one or both?</h2>
Ispan failed, was captured and that is what happens to BA who fail and
are captured.
<P>
This was a precedent set down with the killings of Amico and Joiya. But
there are some pretty major differences. Amico and Joiya both actually
gave out information. Amico told where Liandrin and crew went. And Joiya
told about the BA freeing Taim (although that may have been a lie).
Ispan has not revealed anything important, as far as we know.
<P>
Joiya's and Amico's deaths were also incidental. Someone took advantage of
the attack on Rand and the Stone to kill them. Chances are had Rand not
been attacked, the two would not have been killed when they were. There
really was no risk involved. Killing Ispan and Adeleas, though, reveals
that there is a DF/BA among them. The killer tipped their hand. So
something must have forced them to do this.
<P>
Joiya and Amico also were on their way to the Tower. Certainly the risk
of revealing anything of import ran much higher if those two actually
made it there. So removing them when the chance presented itself certainly
makes sense.
<P>
But if Ispan was the main target why now? Why not before if she is a
threat? Also consider that if the killer is BA herself, then she would
certainly know how much a threat Ispan is and how much a threat she is not.
There certainly has been time before this to kill Ispan.
<P>
Also look at Katerine and Falion. While Falion's death by wicked keg-bong
might be imminent, it is not definite. And Katerine is allowed to escape
and presumably live. So death is not the automatic sentence for BA who
screw up. Certainly Ispan's escape could have been managed as easily
as Katerine's. After all, Katerine's escape pretty much reveals her to be
BA, whereas Ispan is already known to be. Her escape certainly poses no risks
to the killer that killing her did not.
<P>
So was Ispan the prime victim? Perhaps not. Adeleas could have been the
one intended to die all along. Whoever did it wants Adeleas dead. Knows
she will be alone with Ispan so takes tea laced with a poison specifically
chosen for Adeleas' liking for sweet tea. Of course once Adeleas is down
Ispan is killed. Regardless of being a fellow BA, the Killer has revealed
her identity to another. So Ispan takes a stake through the heart. The
killer eliminates a witness, a possible rival and throws off the scent that
Adeleas was the intended victim. Note that this line of reasoning could be
applied the other way around: Adeleas could have been killed because she
was a witness.
<P>
So why kill Adeleas? Well, Adeleas discovered two former novices.
Garenia, who was in the Tower seventy years ago. She was a novice with
Careane. Also seventy years ago both Namelle sisters were present. From
Joline's comment about Merilille being an instructor, it is highly likely
that she too was in the Tower at the time. Kirstian, on the other hand,
left the Tower three hundred years ago. It seems a bit of a stretch that she
would possess any knowledge that could reveal one of the sisters to be a
liar and/or BA.
<P>
One thing that seems to indicate Adeleas as the intended victim is that even if
Vandene is not the killer, someone went a bit of trouble to get rid of
Adeleas. The poison was designed for her in a sense. It was her watch.
And if Ispan was a threat, then surely if Vandene was not the killer she
