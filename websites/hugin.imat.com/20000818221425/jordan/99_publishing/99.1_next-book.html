<h1 align="center">99.1: When is the next book going to be out?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<strong>When will Book 9 be published?</strong>
<P>

On 14 December, 1999, Teresa Nielsen Hayden of Tor Books (RJ's
U.S. publisher) posted to <TT>r.a.sf.w.r-j</TT>: "This just in: the
title of No.9 is WINTER'S HEART. (Does this mean we have a manuscript?
No. Not yet. But we have a title.)"
<P>

As of 17 August, 2000, Tor's fall publishing schedule includes
<CITE>Winter's Heart</CITE> as a November 2000 release. As far as we
know, RJ has not yet turned in a manuscript. There have been reports
that the book will go on sale on 7 November, 2000, but this has not,
as yet, been confirmed by a reputable source such as Tor Books or
<cite>Locus</cite>. (No, bookstores and amazon.com do not count as
reputable sources. Both have been known to give out incorrect
information too many times in the past.)

<P>

<strong>What's the title mean?</strong>

<P>

Considering how relevant the titles of the last few books have been to
their plots, probably not much. However, the phrase "cold as winter's
heart," or something similar "is often used in the books to describe
something very cold, either literally or figuratively. For example, in
[TPOD: 23, Fog of War, Storm of Battle, 449], we have: "Rand let
himself really feel saidin. Life and corruption commingled, ice to
make winter's heart seem warm, and fire to make a forge's flames cold;
death waiting for him to slip."
