<P>
<STRONG>Min's vision of Rand's funeral bier:</strong>
In the Arthurian legend (or at least the version I've read)
Arthur is severely wounded and on his deathbed. Bedivere
witnesses his being taken away on a funeral boat and ferried to
Avalon to await the time when he is needed again. The only
others on the ship are three women: 1) Arthur's half-sister Morgan
Le Fay (the sorceress) 2) The Queen of North Galys 3) The Queen of
the Waste Land. It is doubtful that RJ means for Rand's women to
mirror Arthur exactly. It is probable that the women will be
Elayne, Min, and Aviendha. Add to this the visions in LOC
involving 3 women and (probably) Rand on a boat.
<P>
<strong>The Green Man:</strong> Both in the Arthurian version, where Sir
Gawain encounters the Green Man, and the much earlier Irish myths where
Cuchulain encounters a nameless entity that by the description is obviously
the Green Man, the story follows the same pattern: hero makes deal with
Green Man to show how brave he is, hero cuts Green Man's head off, Green
Man reappears three nights later to finish the deal by cutting hero's head
off, hero goes honourably to his destiny, Green Man stays his hand at the
last conceivable instant and compliments hero on bravery. [Emmet O'Brien]
<P>
<strong>The Fisher King:</strong> a king in the legend of Perceval who had
an unhealable wound corresponding to the woes of his land. cf Rand's side
wound which is not Healable, the COS Header Prophecy, and the "Fisher"
figure in Moridin's favorite game. For a more thorough discussion of the
Fisher King, <A HREF="3.08_fisher-king.html">see section 3.08</A>.
