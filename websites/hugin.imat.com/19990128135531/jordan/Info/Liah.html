<H1>What's up with Liah in Shadar Logoth?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
How did Liah manage to stay alive in Shadar Logoth from the time she
got lost in <CITE>LoC</CITE> to the end of <CITE>ACoS</CITE>?
</P>
<P>
RJ says (<CITE>aol.com chat session, 27 June, 1996</CITE>):<BR>
"She became absorbed into the city. She was left there and she is,
after all, a Aiel, one of the people better at surviving under harsh
circumstances than anyone else in the world. And also her corruption
by Shadar Logoth gave her <em>some</em> protection."
</P>
<P>
What happenned to Liah was probably akin to what happenned to Mat when
he carried around the Shadar Mandarb in <CITE>TEotW</CITE>. Her behaviour
(attacking all comers) supports this belief. I guess that being bonded
to Shadar Logoth must give one some protection from Mashadar, although
obviously not enough, since it got her in the end.
