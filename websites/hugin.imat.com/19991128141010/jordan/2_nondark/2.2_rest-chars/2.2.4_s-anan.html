<h1 align="center">2.2.4: What's the deal with Setalle Anan? Is she "the one
who is no longer"?</h1>

"The key to finding the bowl is to find the one who is no longer."
[LOC: 19, Matters of Toh, 312]
<P>
Well, they found the bowl. "The one who is no longer" is still a mystery.
So we should be saying, "the key to finding the one who is no longer is to
find the bowl."
<P>
Considering the whole Bowl plotline in ACOS, if we look for one single
person who was key to finding the Bowl, a likely candidate is Setalle
Anan, the innkeeper of The Wandering Woman. El and Ny's meeting with
her set off the chain of events that led to finding the Bowl. (Anan
introduced them to the Kin, who they got Mat to spy on, and when Mat
followed one of them, she led him to the six-storied building where
the Kin's stash of *angreal was.)
<P>
<STRONG>Here is what the Kin say about Anan</STRONG>:
<P>
1. [ACOS 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 393]:
Reanne is apologizing to Anan: "The Anan woman and Reanne Corly
entered the sitting room, and Nynaeve blinked in surprise. From the
exchange, she had expected someone younger than Setalle Anan, but
Reanne had hair more gray....Why would the older woman humble herself
so to the younger, and why would the younger allow it, however
halfheartedly?"
<P>
From this, we see that Anan is no ordinary innkeeper. The Kin kiss up to
AS, but they're pretty arrogant to everybody else. Yet, they defer to
Anan. True, she has something on them (knowing they are non-Tower
channellers), but that's not enough to treat her as some sort of
superior. Note that Reanne has even less apparent reason to defer to Anan
than it first appears to Ny, since Reanne is actually around 400 years old,
and Anan is, to all appearances, 50 or 60ish, and the Kin defer to one
another on the basis of age [TPOD: 1, To Keep the Bargain, 58].
<P>
2. In [ACOS: 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 395] Setalle eyes the newly
arrived Garenia who looks to be in her early twenties and sees a strong
resemblance to Zarya Alkaese. Then Setalle says that when she last saw
Zarya, she was younger than Garenia is now. (Setalle clearly assumes
Garenia is as old as she looks; not as old as we later know Garenia to be.)
Garenia places herself seventy years in the past with: '"Setalle!" Garenia
exclaimed as soon as the innkeeper was gone. "That was Setalle Anan? How
did she-? Light of Heaven! Even after seventy years, the Tower would-"'
Garenia is upset. After all someone came awfully close to
identifying her as Zarya Alkaese.
<P>
3. [ACOS: 24, The Kin, 404]: Garenia is carrying on: '"What of this
Setalle Anan, then? Those girls know about the Circle. The Anan woman
must have told them, though how she knows....She's an innkeeper, and she
must be taught to guard her tongue!" Berowin gasped, wide-eyed with shock,
and dropped into a chair so hard she nearly bounced. "Remember who she is,
Garenia," Reanne said sharply. "If Setalle had betrayed us, we would be
crawling to Tar Valon, begging forgiveness the whole way....She has kept
the few secrets she knows from gratitude, and I doubt that has faded. She
would have died in her first childbirth if the Kin had not helped her.
What she knows comes from careless tongues...and the owners of those
tongues were punished more than twenty years ago." Still, she wished there
was some way she could bring herself to ask Setalle to be more
circumspect.'
<P>
So, at the same time, Anan is regarded as an innkeeper who must be taught
to guard her tongue, who knows few secrets, and also somebody who they
don't dare offend, even to ask to be more circumspect. From the "crawling
to Tar Valon" remark, we have evidence that Anan has the ability to betray
the Kin to Tar Valon, or at least the Kin perceive her as having that
ability. In this passage, it's possible that Reanne is reminding Garenia that
Setalle is a former Aes Sedai. Garenia no doubt has heard of the former
sister making a new life for herself, but only by her new name. Garenia
seems to want to know who Setalle was before she took the name Setalle.
<P>
<STRONG>Elayne believes Anan has some connection with the White Tower</STRONG>:
<P>
After Anan tells Ny and El that they can't be AS because Elayne is too
young-looking, Elayne thinks: "Slowed. Slowing. How did an innkeeper in
Ebou Dar know those words? Maybe Setalle Anan had gone to the Tower as a
girl, though she would not have remained long, since she clearly could not
channel. Elayne would have known even if her ability had been as small as
her own mother's." [ACOS: 22, Small Sacrifices, 383]
<P>
Elayne talking to Ny: "I think she went to the Tower once; she knows
things she couldn't, otherwise." [ACOS: 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 390]
<P>
<h2>Is Setalle Anan an ex-Aes Sedai?</h2>
<P>
This is very likely. What evidence is there?
<P>
1. A burned out or stilled AS would fit the "One who is no longer"
description-- "no longer Aes Sedai." If Anan is an ex-Aes Sedai, she's
probably burned out, because novices are required to learn the names of
officially stilled women, and Elayne doesn't recognize hers. Furthermore,
it is clear that the AS are not keeping tabs on Anan, and we know that AS
tend to avoid Sisters who are severed accidentally. AS who are stilled for
some crime, on the other hand, are often kept around the Tower to serve as
examples.
<P>
2. The Kin kiss up to her to an extent not seen except around real AS,
although not quite that bad.
<P>
3. Anan's attitude and behavior:
<UL>
<LI>She's not at all unsettled by being held by the Power [ACOS: 22,
Small Sacrifices, 383].
<LI>As Elayne thinks, Anan knows far too much about AS, and throws around
AS terms far too naturally for her to have had no contact with AS.
<LI>"Why would the older woman humble herself so to the younger, and why
would the younger allow it, however halfheartedly?" Especially since
Reanne, at 400 or so, is much older than Anan. This is true even if
Anan was AS, since the longest known lifespan of a modern AS is around
300 years. This deference would make sense if Reanne knew Anan had been
AS.
</ul>
<P>
4. Anan is not native to Ebou Dar. "Her hazel eyes had never been born in
Ebou Dar." Note that this is far from conclusive; after all, Ebou Dar is a
pretty cosmopolitan city. It's mentioned here because it is brought up quite a
bit.
<P>
5. We know that the AS are fond of forcibly matching up burned out women
with brand-new spouses, in the hopes that a husband and family will give
her something to live for beyond the OP.
<P>
6. The Garenia evidence: When Anan meets Garenia, she says, "Your name is
Garenia? You look very much like someone I met once. Zarya Alkaese."
[ACOS: 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 395]. Garenia puts her off by saying
that Zarya Alkaese was her great-aunt, but we find out in [TPOD: 28,
Crimsonthorn, 542] that Garenia is Zarya Alkaese herself, and ran away from
the Tower seventy years ago. Setalle Anan has only "a touch of gray in her
hair." [ACOS: 22, Small Sacrifices, 381], so if she were a normal person,
she couldn't possibly be ninety or more years old. Thus, we must conclude
that Anan must have channelled at some point in her past, because she
"slowed" at some point-- there is no way she looks the hundred years old or
so she that would be if she met Zarya when she was "younger than you [Garenia]
are now." [ACOS: 23, Next Door to a Weaver, 395]. (Garenia looks "no older
than Nynaeve." )
<P>
If we put together the fact that Anan met Garenia when she was still Zarya
(i.e. before she ran away from the Tower), Garenia's fears that Anan could
turn her in [ACOS: 23, Next door to a Weaver, 395], Elayne's analysis
that Anan must have studied at the Tower for at least a little time, and
the fact that Anan currently has zero channelling ability, we can put
together the following picture:
<P>
Anan was at the Tower seventy years ago when Garenia/Zarya was a novice.
If Anan was only a failed Novice or Accepted, as Elayne supposes, then
Garenia would not fear that she'd turn her in, and Reanne would not be so
deferential to her, so Anan must have been Aes Sedai. Something happened
to burn her out, and she completely lost the ability to channel. She moved
to Ebou Dar and got married. This must have been 20 years ago or more,
since Anan has grown children.
<P>
It has been suggested that Anan is Martine Janata, the AS Vandene mentions
when she warns Elayne about the dangers of fooling around with
ter'angreal.
<blockquote>
"She was the last sister to really make a business of
studying ter'angreal... She did it for forty years, almost from the time
she reached the shawl.... Then one day, Martine's maid found her
unconscious on the floor of her sitting room. Burned out.... That was more
than twenty-five years ago.... She vanished once she was well enough to
slip out of the Tower." [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 75-76]
</blockquote>
The timing makes this possible, as explained by John Hamby:
<UL>
<LI>[ACOS: 24, The Kin, 405] Setalle gave birth to her first child more than
twenty years ago.
<LI>Martine Janata was raised to the shawl over sixty-five years ago
<LI>She was burnt out over twenty-five years ago and left the Tower
<LI>Garenia aka Zarya Alkaese ran away from the Tower seventy years ago
[TPOD: 28, Crimsonthorn, 542]
</UL>
So Martine was made a sister well over sixty-five years ago. Garenia ran
away seventy years ago. Setalle recognized Garenia as Zarya though she
certainly never considered Garenia to <EM>be</EM> Zarya. Also it is a bit
too pat that we get the story of one such sister that provides us with a
chronology that fits the criteria to be Setalle Anan.
