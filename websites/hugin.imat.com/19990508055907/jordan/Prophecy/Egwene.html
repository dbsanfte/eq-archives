<H1>Egwene's Dreams</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="Egwene.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>(<CITE>TGH: 12, 213, Woven in the Pattern, 180</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
She saw Rand sleeping on the ground, wrapped in a cloak.  A woman
had been standing over him, looking down.  Her face was in shadow,
but her eyes seemed to shine like the moon, and Egwene had known
she was evil.  Then there was a flash of light, and they were gone.
Both of them.  And behind it all, almost like another thing
altogether, was the feel of danger, as if a trap was just beginning
to snap shut on an unsuspecting lamb, a trap with many jaws."
</P>
<P>
(YES, this is where Lanfear takes Rand and Co into the Portal stone world
in an attempt to bring Rand under her control)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 25, 290, Questions, 233-4</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
She had dreamed of Seanchan, too, of women in dresses with
lightning bolts woven on their breasts, collaring a long line
of women who wore Great Serpent rings, forcing them to call
lightning against the White Tower.(NO)  That had started her
awake in a cold sweat, but that had to be just a nightmare, too.
And the dream about Whitecloaks binding her father's hands.
(YES--Master Al'Vere was powerless to act against the WCs until
Perrin came along)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 25, 290, Questions, 234</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
There had been a dream of Rand, reaching for a sword that
seemed to be made of crystal, never seeing the fine net
dropping over him.(YES - Callandor and Be'lal's trap)  And one
of him kneeling in a chamber where a parched wind blew dust
across the floor, and creatures like the one on the Dragon banner,
but much smaller, floated on the wind, and settled into his skin.
(YES--Rhuidean)  There had been a dream of him walking down into
a great hole in a black mountain, a hole filled with a reddish
glare as from vast fires below,(NO) and even a dream of him confronting
Seanchan.  (YES/NO--he confronted the Seanchan in TFOH after he and Avi
MPS'd, but this is most likely not the last time)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 25, 290-1, Questions, 234</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Perrin with a falcon on his shoulder, and Perrin with a hawk.
Only the hawk held a leash in her talons--Egwene was somehow
convinced both the hawk and falcon were female--and the hawk
was trying to fasten it around Perrin's neck.(YES -- Faile and Berelain:
more to come)  That made her shiver even now; she did not like
dreams about leashes.  And that dream of Perrin--with a beard!
(YES)--leading a huge pack of wolves that stretched as far as
the eye could see.(YES--@Dumai's wells, but probably not for the
last time.)  Those about Mat had been even nastier.  Mat, placing
his own left eye on a balance scale.(NO--cf "give up half the light
of the world")  Mat, hanging by his neck from a tree limb.(YES--Rhuidean)
There had been a dream of Mat and Seanchan too but she was willing
to dismiss that as a nightmare.(NO)  It had to have been just
a nightmare.  Just like the one about Mat speaking the Old
Tongue.(YES--He does it all the time)  That had to come from what
she had heard during his Healing. (<a HREF="Egwene.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 37, 423, Fires in Cairhien, 352-3</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
She had dreamed of Perrin with a wolf, and with a falcon, and a
hawk -- and the hawk and falcon fighting(YES -- Faile and Berelain)
...of Perrin running from someone deadly,(SLAYER?) and Perrin
stepping willingly over the edge of a towering cliff while saying,
It must be done.  I must learn to fly before I reach the bottom.'
(Probably NO, but may refer to him mastering his wolf-brotherhood,
or being a leader, or doing part in the Last Battle)  There had
been one dream of an Aiel and she thought that had to do with Perrin
too, but she was not sure.(YES -- he freed Gaul from the cage in TDR)
And a dream of Min, springing a steel trap but somehow walking through
it without so much as seeing it.(YES -- the Tower Coup: her return to the
Tower started Elaida getting suspicious of what SS was up to, which led
to the coup. Min never realized what was coming. Yet, she got out of the
Tower unscathed.) ... Mat with dice spinning 'round him...(YES -- his
luck) Mat being followed by a man who was not there ... or maybe
more than one, but in some way there was no one there(YES - Grey Man)...
Mat riding desperately toward something unseen in the distance
that he had to reach(YES - Going to save El/Eg/Ny in Tear), and Mat
with a woman who seemed to be tossing fireworks about(YES - Aludra).
An Illuminator, she assumed, but that made no more sense than
anything else.  Men and women breaking out of a cage, then putting
on crowns.(YES - Forsaken)  A woman playing with puppets, and another
dream where the strings on puppets led to the hands of larger
puppets, and their strings led to still greater puppets, on and
on until the last strings vanished into unimaginable heights
(probably just symbolic of the various degrees of manipulation
and plotting going on).  Kings dying, queens weeping,
battles raging.  Whitecloaks ravaging the Two Rivers(YES).  She had
even dreamed of the Seanchan again.
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 48, 553, Following the Craft, 468-9</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Perrin with a falcon on his shoulder(YES), choosing between ax and
hammer(NO); A Whitecloak putting Master Luhhan in the middle of a
huge, toothed trap for bait (YES--The WCs used the Luhhans and Cauthons
as bait to catch Perrin.); Mat dicing with the Dark One (YES),
shouting "I am coming!" at her (YES); Rand sneaking through utter
darkness toward Callandor, while all around him six men and five
women walked, some hunting him and some ignoring him, some trying
to guide him toward the shining crystal sword and some trying to
stop him from reaching it, appearing not to know where he was, or
only to see him in flashes (YES). One of the men had eyes of flame,
and he wanted Rand dead with a desperation she could nearly taste;
Rand in that dry, dusty chamber again, with those small creatures
settling into his skin.(YES - Rhuidean)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 48, 553, Following the Craft, 468-9</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Rand confronting a horde of Seanchan.(YES--in TFOH, but probably more to
come)  Rand confronting her, and the women with her, and one of
*them* was a Seanchan.(NO, probably to come when Rand wants the
Salidar AS to kneel to him.)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 11, 207, What Lies Hidden, 145</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Rand as tall as a mountain, walking through cities, crushing
buildings beneath his feet, with screaming people like ants fleeing
from him.(Not fulfilled literally, if symbolic, then in progress)
Rand in chains, and it was he who was screaming.(Possibly
his capture and torture by the Tower AS)  Rand building a wall with
him on one side and her on the other, her and Elayne and others
she could not make out.  "It has to be done," he was saying as he
piled up stones.  "I'll not let you stop me now."(YES, Rand is becoming
increasingly isolated from his friends and allies. Will he do something
everybody else thinks is stupid, like break the seals?) Aiel
fighting each other, killing each other, even throwing away their
weapons and running as if they had gone mad (YES).  Mat wrestling
with a Seanchan woman who tied an invisible leash to him (NO--The Dot9M?).
A wolf - [Perrin] - fighting a man whose face kept changing (YES-Slayer).
Galad wrapping himself in white as though putting on his own shroud
(YES/No? White == Whitecloak. Shroud: will he die because of his decision
to join the WCs), and Gawyn with eyes full of pain and hatred.
(Possibly refers to the Tower Coup, or thinking Rand killed Morgase, or
just his generally psychotic state.) Her mother weeping.
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TFoH: 15, 300-1, What Can Be Learned in Dreams, 214</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Rand sitting down in a chair, and somehow she knew that the
chair's owner would be murderously angry at having her chair
taken (YES--the Lion Throne of Andor...Perrin, lounging with
Faile on his lap, kissing her while she played with the short-cut
beard that he wore in the dream.  Behind them two banners waved,
a red wolf's head and a crimson eagle.  A man in a bright yellow
coat stood near to Perrin's shoulder, a sword strapped to his back;
in some way she knew that he was a tinker, though no tinker would
ever touch a  sword.   And every bit of it except the beard
seemed important. The banners, Faile kissing Perrin, even the tinker.
Every time he moved closer to Perrin it was if a chill of doom shot
through everything. (YES/NO--Perrin is set up with Faile, has Aram as a
bodyguard, has the wolf banner, and the Manetheren banner, but we haven't
seen any doom related to Aram)...Mat throwing dice with blood
streaming down his face, the wide brim of his hat pulled down low so
she could not see his would(NO--Again, giving up 1/2 the light of the
world), while Thom Merrilin put his hand into a fire to draw out the
small blue stone that now dangled on Moiraine's forehead. (NO)
Or a dream of a storm, great dark clouds rolling
without wind or rain while forked lightning bolts, every one
identical, rent the earth. (This happened at the Battle of Cairhien)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>LoC: 15, A Pile of Sand, 258</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Twice, right on top of each other, she dreamed of taking [Gawyn] by the
shoulders and trying to turn him to face the other way against his will.
Once he brushed her hands away roughly; the other time she was somehow
stronger than he. The two blended together hazily. {NO. Will Eg convince
Gawyn to join her on Rand's side, or will he continue to hate Rand over
the chaos he's brought to his life? Related to Min's viewing of Gawyn
kneeling to Eg or breaking her neck.}  In another, [Gawyn] began swinging
a door closed on her, and she knew if that narrowing gap of light
vanished, she was dead.
</P>
<P>
{NO, again related to the above and Min's
viewing--Gawyn has the power to destroy Eg, if he chooses not to
join her.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>LoC: 15, A Pile of Sand, 258</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Perrin came and stood before her, a wolf lying at his feet, a hawk and a
falcon perched on his shoulders glaring at each other over his head. {YES,
ongoing.} Seemingly unaware of them, he kept trying to throw away that
axe of his until finally he ran, the axe floating through the air chasing
him. {??? Perrin wants to give up the axe, but he cannot. We have yet to
decide what the axe symbolizes in general. I think maybe the Lordly life
Faile has planned for him, and the fighting inherent therein?}  Again
Perrin; he turned away from a Tinker and ran, faster and faster though
she called for him to come back.
</P>
<P>
{NO. Perrin and Aram's relationship
doesn't seem to have degenerated so far. It's been suggested that Aram
 represents the exact opposite of what Perrin wants. P. wants to give up
fighting for a peaceful life. Aram gave up the Way of the Leaf to become
a soldier.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>LoC: 15, A Pile of Sand, 258</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Mat spoke words she almost understood - the Old Tongue, she thought{YES}
- and two ravens alighted on his shoulders, claws sinking through his coat
into the flesh beneath {NO?. probably has to do w/the Daughter of the 9
Moons and the Seanchan. Raven tattoos on the shoulders mean
"Property of the Seanchan Empress." These ravens could also represent
 Mat's raven-engraved glaive.} He seemed no more aware of them
that Perrin had been on the hawk and the falcon, yet the defiance passed
across his face, and the grim acceptance. {??? Maybe the ravens refer
to his spear, which he got on his trip to
A/Eelfland, where he also became a battle-master, which he first fought,
and has now accepted?}  In another a woman, face shrouded in shadow,
beckoned him toward great danger; Egwene did not know what, only that
it was monstrous."{NO, I think.  Who is this woman? Lanfear? (cf (<CITE>TGH:
12, 213, Woven in the Pattern, 180</CITE>), above). Another Forsaken? Maybe it
is the DotNM?}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>LoC: 15, A Pile of Sand, 258</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Several concerned Rand, not all bad, but all odd. Elayne, forcing him to
his knees with one hand."{NO. Possibly concerning the throne of Andor, or
being Bonded to her as a Warder?}  Elayne and Min and Aviendha, sitting
in a silent circle around him, each in turn reaching out to lay a hand
on him." {??? They've all had their turns to "lay their hands on him."
Elayne in Tear, Aviendha in Seanchan Igloo, Min in Caemlyn/Cairhien}
Him walking toward a burning mountain, something crunching beneath his
boots.  She stirred and whimpered; the crunching things were the seals
on the Dark One's prison, shattering with his every step."
</P>
<P>
{NO. The Mountain is Shayol Ghul. The breaking of the Seals--does it have
something to do with LTT wanting to break them, and Fel's note?}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 195</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
...that she [Egwene] would bond him [Gawyn], she knew from
interpreting her dreams... {NO}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 201</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
On bare feet, Gawyn walked [toward her] across a floor of broken glass, shards breaking at every slow
step....she could see the trail of blood left by his slashed feet.
</P>
<P>
{NO. Before Gawyn joins Egwene, he must go through a great deal of pain and difficulty.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 202</CITE>):<BR>
<P>...a man riding on a black stallion. Gawyn. Then she was standing in
the road in front of him, and he reined in. Not because he saw
her...but the road that had been stright now forked right where she
stood, running over tall hills so no one could see what lay
beyond. She knew, though. Down one fork was his violent death, down
the other, a long life and a death in bed. On one path, he would marry
her, on the other, not. She knew what lay ahead, but not which way led
to which. Suddenly he did see her, or seemed to, and smiled, and
turned his horse along one of the forks...
</P>
<P>
{Pretty self-explanitory--Gawyn's possible futures. Pick one of each:
  quick, violent death or long life, marriage or not.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 202</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
She stood before an immense wall, clawing at it, trying to tear it
down with her bare hands. It was not made of brick or stone, but
countless thousands of discs, each half white and half black, the
ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai, like the seven seals that had once
held the DO's prison shut...the wall stood strong however she beat at
it. She could not tear it down. Maybe it was the symbol that was
important. Maybe it was the AS she was trying to tear down, the White
Tower. Maybe....
</P>
<P>
{No idea what this means, unless it is related to Eg's dream of Rand
building a wall between himself and all his friends and loved ones.
Note that the wall is made of the emblem of Rand's forces.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 202</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Mat sat on a night-shrouded hilltop, watching a grand Illuminator's
display of fireworks, and suddenly his hand shot up, seized one of
those bursting lights in the sky. Arrows of fire flashed from his
clenched fist, and a sense of dread filled her. Men would die because
of this. The world would change.
</P>
<P>
{Mat will find a way to use gunpowder as a weapon. In ACOS, recall that
  he is looking for an Illuminator. Also recall his use of fireworks to
  blow a hole in the Stone of Tear}
<P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 202</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Straps at waist and shoulder held her tightly to the block, and the
headsman's axe descended, but she knew that somewhere someone was
running, and if they ran fast enough, the axe would stop.
</P>
<P>
{Egwene will get in some dire trouble (poss. through the influence of
  her new masseuse?), and will need the help of one or more other
  people to get out of it}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 202</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Logain, laughing, stepped across something on the ground and mounted a
black stone; when she looked down, she thought it was Rand's body he
had stepped over, laid out on a funeral bier with his hands crossed at
his breast, but when she touched his face, it broke apart like a paper
puppet.
</P>
<P>
{Poss. related to Min's vision of Logain's future glory. Another
dead Rand (cf Min's vision in EOW), but maybe a fake. It has been
suggested that the stone is the Black Tower "speaking stone," the
rock that Taim and Rand stand on when addressing the Asha'man.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 203</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
A golden hawk stretched out its wing and touched her, and she and the
hawk were tied together somehow; all she knew was that the hawk was
female. {Golden hawk = Mayene = Berelain.}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 203</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
A man lay dying in a narrow bed, and it was important that he not die,
yet outside a funeral pyre was being built, and voices raised songs of
joy and sadness. {???}
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>ACOS: 10, Unseen Eyes, 203</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
A dark young man held an object in his hand that shone so brightly
she could not see what it was. {The glowing thing could be a
*angreal, note that it is similar to some visions of Callandor.}
