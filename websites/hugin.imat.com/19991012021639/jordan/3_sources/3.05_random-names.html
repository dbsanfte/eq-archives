<strong>Aginor</strong>: "Recently, a friend of mine had to read the
<cite>Iliad</CITE>. In
book 21, a character named Agenor attacks Achilles,
and is defeated. Not much is said about him
(Agenor) other than that he is "blameless and
powerful", and knew that Hektor was stronger than
he was. He attacked anyway, figuring that while
Hektor was much more combat-capable, Agenor had the
gods on his side, not to mention the fact that even
the powerful make mistakes. In a few minutes,
Hektor defeats Agenor, and Apollo surrounds the
loser "in a thick mist", and transports him back to
Troy. Some interesting parallels between this and
TEOTW's final battle: Both Aginors knew that his
opponent was more powerful. Both were full of pride.
Both attacked anyway." [Mike O'Malley]
<P>
<strong>Asmodean</strong>: A demon described in the Old Testament book of Tobit,
which is included only in the Catholic canon of scriptures
(you won't find it in Jewish or Protestant Bibles; it's
considered apocrypha in those circles). In the book of
Tobit, Sara had been married seven times, but Asmodeus had
slain all of them before they could consummate their
marriage (Tobit 3:7-8). Sara eventually married Tobias,
the son of Tobit, who was able to banish Asmodeus by
burning the heart and liver of a special fish given to him
by the angel Raphael in their bedchamber (Tobit 6:16-17,
8:2-3). Asmodeus fled to Egypt, where Raphael caught up
with him and bound him up. [Rafael Sevilla]
<P>
<strong>Ba'alzamon</strong>: Ba'al, Baelzebub, or Ba'al Shamin (literally,
"the lord
of the heavens," an appellation of Ba'al.) Baelzebub,
Lord of the Flies, was an ancient Caananite fertility
deity that competed with worship of Yahweh in Old
Testament times. Later became a euphemism for the
devil from the time of Christ on (see Matthew 10:24,
12:24-27, Mark 3:22, and Luke 11:15-18) from its
similarity to Aramaic beeldebaba = enemy, and from the
fact that many ancient pagan gods were demonized in
Christian times anyway. [Rafeal Sevilla]
<P>
<strong>Be'lal</strong>: Belial, literally means "worthless" in Hebrew,
"sons of Belial" is used throughout the Bible to denote
evil men. Eventually becomes the name of a demon in
Medieval times. [Rafael Sevilla] Belial was often noted as
commanding legions. Be'lal was one of the noted generals of
the Shadow. [John Novak]
<P>
<strong>Bel Tine</strong>: Beltane, a Druidic holiday
<P>
<strong>Birgitte</strong>: Brigit/Brigid, Celtic goddess of fire, poetry,
smithery, and/or healing.
<P>
<STRONG>Cyndane</STRONG>: Cynthia(?), another name for Artemis, the Greek
Moon Goddess, who also was identifed with Selena.
[Rich Boye]
<P>
<strong>Graendal</strong>: Grendal from <CITE>Beowulf</CITE>
<P>
<strong>Illian</strong>: Ilion, aka Troy, as in the <cite>Iliad</cite>
<P>
<strong>Ishamael</strong>: Ishmael: In Genesis, Abraham's eldest son
(to an Egyptian
serving girl Hagar) was called Ishmael. Apparently
Abraham's wife took a disliking to young Ishmael and
pressured Big Abe into exiling Ish and Hagar into the
desert. The name literally means "God has Heard,"
because God is said to have heard of mother and son's
plight at Sarah's hand. Jordan seems to have a taste
for irony, methinks, as Ishamael is called the Betrayer
of Hope! The whole quote about "every hand raised
against him" is interesting, and in full:
<blockquote>
"You are now with child and you will have a son. You
shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your
misery. He will be a wild donkey of a man, his hand
will be against everyone and everyone's hand against
him, and he will live in hostility towards all of his
brothers." [Bible: Genesis 16:11-12]
</blockquote>
As a side note, Ishmael is said to be the ancestor of
the present-day Arabs and other peoples who now dwell in
the lands around Israel.
<P>
<STRONG>Jehennah</STRONG>: Gehennah, a place of fire and torment.
<P>
<strong>Lanfear</strong>: French "l'enfer," the word for Hell.
<P>
<strong>Lews Therin/Lord of the Morning</strong>: Lucifer--the morning star
<P>
<strong>Lothair Mantelar (Founder of Children of Light)</strong>: Martin Luther?
<P>
<STRONG>Masema</STRONG>: I actually came across a reference to a demon
named Mastema, which seems to have been an apcryphal name for
Satan-- Satan in the sense of Chief Accuser, rather than
corruptor. [John Novak]
<P>
<STRONG>Mayene</STRONG>: Mayenne (1573, D F): for Charles de
Lorraine-Guise, FP. Passed to Gonzaga 1621. Sold 1658 to La
Porte-Mazarin. The title of duke remained by special clause in the
letters patent, and became extinct in 1738. Essentially, Mayenne
was a small, royal land-grant from the French Crown, that was near
the Riviera. [Richard Boye']
<P>
<strong>Mesaana</strong>: Possibly from Messalina, the notorious
third wife of Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus,
Emperor of Rome
<P>
<STRONG>M'Hael</STRONG>: a possible reference to Michael the Archangel who was
Lucifer's chief opponent. (Technically, this
shouldn't be in the "Names" section, but I put it
here to provide easy comparison with the
Lews/Lucifer idea.
<P>
<strong>Paaren Disen</strong>: Paradise
<P>
<STRONG>Perun</STRONG>: Pre-Christian Slavonic (Balkan)
god of thunder. His sacred animal was the bull. A war
god, Perun's weapons were <em>the axe, the hammer</em>,
or "thunder arrows," all which symbolize thunder and
lightning. [Rich Boye]. Fred Van Keuls adds: "He was a
god of defensive warfare and was depicted with a big
blonde beard. Jean Dufresne adds: "Those are his
attributes as they had already drifted away from his
original role, following the norse influence on the
slavic peoples. Originally, he also had a strong
agricultural component mixed with the rest. Which makes
him even closer to Perrin than Thor is.
<P>
<strong>Rahvin</strong>: the raven--harbinger of evil. Or, Ravana/Ravan,
a demon in
Hindu mythology who abducts Sita, Rama's wife, in the
<CITE>Ramayana</CITE>. (cf Morgase and Sita: Both Queens,
both fall under the power of a demon/forsaken, in both cases
there are doubts by other characters about whether they were
willing or no) [Emma Pease].
<P>
<strong>"Rhiannon at the Tower"</strong>: Rhiannon from Welsh mythology.
The closest
connection between her and a tower that I could
find is the following from the story of Manawyddan:
Manawyddan, his wife Rhiannon, her son Pryderi, and
his wife Kicva were out hunting. They came upon a
mysterious castle. Their hounds ran into the castle,
and didn't come out. Pryderi went in after them,
and saw a large gold bowl. He touched the bowl, and
became frozen. After a while, Rhiannon went in to
look for him, got similarly stuck, and then the
castle disappeared. (They finally got released.)
<P>
<strong>Sammael</strong>: Either a member of Lucifer's host, or another name for
Lucifer himself (depending on one's source).
<P>
<strong>Selene</strong>: Selena, a Greek goddess of the moon, (Hence the icon)
merged in Artemis and Hecate. She loved a youth
named Endymion, and put him into a deep sleep so
that he would not be conscious of her caresses.
<P>
<strong>Semirhage</strong>: Legendary Assyrian queen mentioned by Herodotus,
wife and successor to Ninus, mythical founder of Nineveh.
Noted for being so excessively lustful and depraved she
even legalized incest within her realm. Dante Alighieri
puts her in the Second Circle of Hell with those who
committed the sin of lust.
<P>
<strong>Shai...</strong>: (well you KNOW who this is) : Satan [Will Baird notes:
Shai... is the Arabic name for Satan literally.]
<P>
<strong>Shayol Ghul</strong>: Sheol: Hebrew for hell; Ghul: Gol or Gul,
Arabic for Demon
<P>
<strong>Tarmon Gai'don</strong>: Armageddon
<P>
<strong>Telamon</strong>: another character in the <CITE>Iliad</CITE>
who we might recognize is
Aias, (Roman: Ajax) one of the most powerful and
respected warriors of the Greek army. Because
there was another, unrelated warrior with the same
name, Aias was also known by his father's name,
Telamon. [Peter Smalley]
<P>
<strong>Tuatha'an</strong>: Tuatha De Danann, "People of the Goddess Danu." A
magical race of beings who were supposed to have
inhabited Ireland at the time of the arrival of the
Milesians (i.e. humans).
<P>
<strong>Wild Hunt</strong>:Wild Hunt, of Celtic legend
<P>
Heroes of the Horn, from [ACOS: 21, Swovan Night, 362]:
<UL>
<LI><strong>Mikel of the Pure Heart</strong>: Archangel Michael?
<LI><strong>Shivan the Hunter, Calian</strong>: He was said to herald the end
of Ages, the destruction of what had been and the birth of
what was to be, he and his sister Calian, called the
Chooser, who rode red-masked at his side.": two
Hindu deities: Shiva the Destroyer and Kali,
goddess of death.
<LI><strong>Amaresu, with the Sword of the Sun</strong>: Amaterasu, ancient
Japanese goddess of the sun, from whom the Japanese royal
family claims descent.
