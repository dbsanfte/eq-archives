Taken from <CITE>Man, Myth and Magic</CITE> (volume 5, pages 693-4):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The most striking of these is that the dragon in China is not, as in
the West, a representative or symbol of the powers of evil. On the
contrary, according to the old Chinese Book of Rites, the dragon as
the chief of all scaly animals is one of the four benevolent spiritual
animals. This reflects the general principle stated by Jung that
'every psychological extreme secretly contains its own opposite,'
which is expressed in Chinese thought through the classical doctrine
of Yang and Yin. That this principle underlies the dragon's
transformation into a beneficent being is confirmed by Wang Fu's
statement that the dragon's scales number 117, of which 81 are imbued
with Yang and 36 with Yin, because the dragon is partly a preserver
and partly a destroyer. Yang is also the male element and, as its
representative, the dragon also became at an early period a symbol of
the Emperor, and appeared on the Chinese flag. During the Manchu
dynasty, the dragon was held in especial esteem, and everything used
by the Emperor was described in terms of it: there was the dragon
throne, dragon bed and so on.

"Although Chinese dragons appeared at favorable moments to presage
periods of prosperity, and had been known to emit foam which had
supernatural powers of fertilization, they could also, when offended
or disturbed, cause a drought by gathering up all the water of a
district in baskets, or they could eclipse the sun. To propitiate
them, the Chinese flew dragon kites, especially at the mumming parade
in the New Year."
