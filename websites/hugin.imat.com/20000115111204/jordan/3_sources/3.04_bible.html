<P>
<strong>Twelve Tribes</strong>: (Compare) the twelve tribes of Israel and
the twelve clans of the Aiel. In fact, there is a thirteenth "clan," the
Jenn. This "clan" is credited with building Rhuidean -- the holy place
(temple if you will) of the Aiel. The Israelites also had a people charged
with taking care of the Ark of the Covenant as well as the religious
ceremonies within the temple (especially within the Holy of Holies) and
those people were the Levites. A tribe not counted among the twelve, so in
effect a thirteenth tribe also.
<P>
Craig Levin points out that the Levites are counted in the 12
Tribes. It's just that Joseph's descendants split into 2 tribes later
on, and the Levites don't get land, it is their job (theoretically) to
care for the Lord's Temple and other altars across Israel. Which is
even better, since there was the Jenn/Aiel split, and the Jenn's
job was to take care of Rhuidean/the temple.
<P>
<strong>Rebirth/Reborn notion of the Savior</strong>: (Although this savior
is going to do major damage before defeating the DO.) The blood of
the lamb versus Rand's blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul. Wound in the
side a la the Cross. Sea Folk saying Aes Sedai would wash Dragon's feet
with their hair
<P>
<strong>Masema = Saul/Paul</strong>: Goes from being Anti-Rand to rabidly
pro-Rand. Also, Masema = John the Baptist--the "voice crying out in the
wilderness" proclaiming the coming of the savior and all that.
<P>
<strong>Seven Seals</strong> = Seven Seals (Revelations)
<P>
<strong>Virgin Birth</strong>: In LOC, some of the rumors about
Rand say that he was born of a woman touched by no man [LoC: 2, A New
Arrival, 78].
<P>
<STRONG>Stigmata</STRONG>: Rand's unhealing wound in the side is a clear
reference to the Fisher King. However, the Fisher King's wound is often
identified with that which Jesus Christ received while he was being
crucified (<A HREF="3.08_fisher-king.html">See Section 3.08</A>), so
Rand's wound can also be considered a reference to Jesus. This
identification is made stronger when one considers that Rand is also marked
by wounds on his hands (albeit healed wounds). Rand's feet have not been
wounded so far, but there are still many books to go.
<P>
<strong>Rituals and Phrases</strong>
<UL>
<LI>' "Peace be on you always," Elyas replied, "and on all the People." He
hesitated, then added, "I will find the song, or another will find
the song, but the song will be sung, this year or in a year to
come. As it once was so shall it be again, world without
end."..."Peace be on you," Elyas said. "And on you," Raen said
sadly.' [TEOTW: 27, Shelter from the Storm, 346] The former
reminds me of the Catholic (maybe Christian in general - I'm not
sure) prayer called the Glory Be. It goes: "Glory be to the
Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,as it was in the
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen."
The latter quotes are reminiscent of the closing of a Catholic
Mass,where the priest pronounces "Peace be with you" and the
people respond "And also with you." [J. Vessey]
<P>
<LI>At Easter mass this past spring, I saw an adult baptized for the first
time in the Catholic faith. They get the person to kneel, pour
water over their head, and say something like "Now you are
sealed". I don't recall the exact words, but "sealed" was in it
for sure and I recall thinking Jordan must be Catholic. Sounds a
lot like becoming Accepted to me. [Judy G.]
</UL>
<strong>Biblical quotes</strong>
<UL>
<LI>In [TGH: 26, Discord, 326] we have the prophecy: "Twice dawns the
day when his blood is shed. Once for mourning, once for birth."
This is very similar to the darkening of the sun when Christ is
crucified: from [Bible: Luke 23, verse 44-5]: "And it was about the
sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth
hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst." [Pam Korda]
<P>
<LI>"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the world. No I did
not come to bring peace, but a sword. I came to set sons against
their fathers, daughters against their mothers.... a man's worst
enemies will be the members of his own family." [Bible: Matthew
10:34-36]. cf: TFOH tailer prophecy: "And what was once did come
again--in fire and in storm splitting all in twain. For his
peace...was the peace...of the sword. [Zach Simpson]
