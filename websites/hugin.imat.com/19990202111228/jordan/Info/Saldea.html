<H1>What's with Saldea?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="Saldea.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
There could be some major plot development coming up, with regards to
Saldaea.  We have been getting hints for six books, now. In <CITE>TEotW</CITE>, in
Baerlon, there are rumors about trouble up in Saldaea, but they say,
oh -- that's the Borderlands -- there is always trouble in the
Borderlands. When we first meet Bayle Domon, he is running from
Trollocs and Saldaea (<CITE>TEotW: 20, 312, Dust on the Wind, 262-3</CITE>). Then,
again in <CITE>TGH</CITE> and <CITE>TDR</CITE>, Saldaea is mentioned as a place where something is going on.
Plus, that is where Mazrim Taim was operating.... Then, in
<CITE>TSR</CITE>, someone in a tavern in Tear says something like Taim was so
powerful when he fought Lord Bashere's army.  Then, SS thinks that,
with all the trouble there, Tenobia might be pushed off the
throne -- Tenobia is Faile's cousin. Finally, at the end of <CITE>TFoH</CITE>,
Bashere shows up in Caemlyn and makes an agreement for Saldaea's
support of the Dragon Reborn. In <CITE>LOC</CITE>, we learn that Queen Tenobia has
gone into seclusion at some country palace, and the leader of the army
and a good portion of said army are thousands of miles away, under the
command of the Dragon Reborn. There has been speculation that
Semirhage's "wilful charge" is none other than Queen Tenobia. (Others
say it simply refers to the captured Aes Sedai).
