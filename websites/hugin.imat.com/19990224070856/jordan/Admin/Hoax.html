<H1>The Great Jordan Hoax</H1>
<H2>Contributed by Pam Korda and Joe Shaw</H2>

<P>
In March, 1994, a bunch of net.jordanites met in a small restaurant in
Arlington, VA. Collectively, they hatched a scheme to spread chaos and
confusion throughout the Internet, and other nets. They were six of
the most powerful posters ever known, who went over to the Dark One.
Their names -- Bill "the Fain" Garrett, Chad "Ba&#39;alzamon" Orzel, Joe
"Sammael" Shaw, Mike "Rahvin" Macchione, Judy "Mesaana" Ghirardelli,
and Joe "Demandred" Morris -- should be used to frighten children.  As a
result of their crimes, much false evidence was generated.  Following
is a summary of their false claims as to what Jordan said.
