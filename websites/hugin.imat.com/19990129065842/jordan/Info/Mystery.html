<H1>The Mystery Men of ACoS: Moridin, the Watcher, and the Wanderer</H1>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>ACoS</CITE>, we encountered several mysterious characters of the Dark persuasion. First, we met the Watcher, i.e.
the guy watching Graendal and Sammael (<CITE>ACoS: 20, Patterns Within Patterns, 356</CITE>. Then, there was
Moggy's new master, Moridin, in <CITE>ACoS: 25, Mindtrap, 417</CITE>. Finally, there is the "wanderer" that
Rand met in Shadar Logoth during his fight with Sammael in <CITE>ACoS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 656</CITE>. So,
who are these strangers? Are they all the same person? Well, let us investigate:

<H3>Contributed by: Paul Khangure, Korda, Casner</H3>
<H3>Moridin (<CITE>ACoS, Mindtrap, pp417-419</CITE>)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>His name means 'Death' in the Old Tongue. (NB: 'moridin,' uncapitalized, means 'grave' in the OT.)
<LI>A description of Moridin: "The speaker was a tall, broad-shouldered young man in black boots and breeches,
and a flowing white shirt unlaced at the top, who watched her with startlingly blue eyes ..." He has a deep
voice. He has a strong chin, else he'd be worthy of Graendal's collection. He looks to be just a little older
than Rand, "Not many years past twenty." One could argue that this is a disguise, but there is no reason
Moridin would disguise himself in front of Moggy. He owns her soul. Why bother fooling her with a disguise,
when it would take less energy to say "describe me to anybody and I'll break your mindtrap."?
<LI>He spends a lot of time at Shayol Ghul, or visits frequently.
<LI>He is a heavy user of the TP. His eyes have the <em>saa</em>, which only come from extensive TP use.
<LI>He knows who Moghedien is, and has no concerns about facing one of the Forsaken.
<LI>He is familiar w/ AoL Power technology, including vacuoles, and the cour'souvra. He also knows some of the
old tongue (mia'cova &amp; moridin).
<LI>His livery is "black and red" according to Moggy (<CITE>ACoS, The First Cup, p483</CITE>), although she is
wearing "scarlet silk worked with thread-of-gold and black silk". Also, when Moggy first meets him, the room
is decorated with "rugs woven in red and gold arabesques."  So I'd say, his colours are black, red and gold.
<LI>He likes to sit with his leg over the arm of his chair.
</UL>
<H3>Watcher - (<CITE>ACos, Patterns within Patterns, pp356-358</CITE>)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Obviously a Forsaken from the AoL. He knows about AoL technology - callboxes, Mask of Mirrors and
fancloth, knows the Forsaken by name and appearance.  He definitely <em>knew</em> Sammael, as opposed to knowing of
him. Just a guy from the AoL is not enough; he has to be someone who interacted and got to know Sammael's
strengths and weaknesses. Notice there was no fear of interfering with not just two of the Forsaken, but with
a potential battle between them!
<LI>He has eyebrows and eyes. (I.e., he is not Shaidar Haran.)
<LI>Senses saidin being held by Sammael, skin prickles when Graendal channels. This indicates that he has the
ability to channel saidin.
<LI>He uses the TP. Note that he does so even though he can use the OP. This indicates that he's probably uses
it more than your average Forsaken -- he could have Travelled with the OP, but he used the TP instead. Note that
by the time he left, Sam had left the vicinity, so there was no chance of him being detected.
<LI>He uses the phrase "so-called Aiel" which we have no reason to expect anybody except a relic from the AoL
to use; the Forsaken are the only AoL relics in action, except Birgitte and "LTT."
<LI>He has "expertise in many areas Sammael scorned. In some he favored, too."
<LI>He doesn't seem to have the same attitude as the "normal" Forsaken towards Nae'blis-ness. In <CITE>ACoS: 20,
Patterns Within Patterns, 358</CITE>, Sammael mentions (lies) to Graendal that he "will be Nae'blis." Graendal
then stops arguing with Sam and follows him through his gateway. We then have: "The watcher smiled crookedly
behind his fancloth skulker's mask. Nae'blis. That explained what had brought Graendal to heel, what had
stayed her from killing Sammael. Even she would be blinded by that." It's almost as if the Watcher is <em>not</em>
blinded by the "Nae'blis" carrot, unlike the "normal" Forsaken.
</UL>
<H3>Shadar Logoth Wanderer (<CITE>ACoS, A Crown of Swords, pp656-659</CITE>)</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Description: Big fellow. Has a deep voice. Little older than Rand. Black coat, Black hair. Rand doesn't
recognise him.
<LI>Knows Sammael, including how Sammael thinks. He clearly knows Sam fairly well, and thus is probably from
the AoL.
<LI>Uses the TP (Balefire and disappears without Rand sensing Saidin or Saidar).
<LI>Even apart from his TP use, he is clearly a Minion of Darkness. He calls Rand a fool, he doesn't "care to
see [Rand] die today," he doesn't "intend to carry [Rand] on [his] shoulders, or kill Sammael." He's clearly
only helping Rand because it coincides with some plan of his, not because he particularly cares about Rand. He
certainly doesn't like Rand; when he falls down after the crossed-streams BF incident, Rand offers him a hand,
but the Wanderer refuses "with a grimace."
<LI>He has "never been afraid of Aes Sedai." Yet more evidence that he's not a Third Age person. Everybody in
Randland proper (i.e. not Seanchan, not Aiel, and not Sea Folk) grows up hearing stories of Aes Sedai like
those the Emond's Fielders did. Such stories engender some sort of awe in the listener, yet this guy acts like
AS are no problem, and has never thought otherwise. This comment is easily understandible if he's from the
AoL -- back then, he <em>was</em> an Aes Sedai, and modern AS are but "untrained children" to him.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><a NAME="Same">Are Moridin, the Watcher, and the Wanderer All the Same Guy?</a></H2>
<P>
These guys have quite a few traits in common. Let us examine them:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>All three use the TP, even when using the OP would accomplish the same ends with less risk. (The way the
Watcher leaves the area, the Wanderer's BF &amp; arrival/departure from SL, and Moridin &amp; the Watcher's
saa are all indicative of this.) (NB: Some people do not think the Wanderer channelled the TP; these theories
are dealt with below.) Moridin and Watcher both exhibit <em>saa</em>, a symptom of serious TP use. Ability to use the
TP is quite rare in general, it is even rarer to use it so much that you get <em>saa</em>. (According to Mog.)
<LI>Moridin and the Watcher have many of the same physical characteristics. (Moridin Point 2, and Watcher
Point 1.) Note that things described about Moridin were <em>not</em> described about the wanderer (pants and boots,
eyes), and the things described about the wanderer were not described about Moridin (coat, hair, etc.).  It's
almost like we get the first half of a description with Moridin, and the second half with the wanderer.
<LI>Watcher, Moridin, &amp; Wanderer both know one or more of the Forsaken reasonably well. (Watcher--Sammael
&amp; Graendal, Moridin--Moggy, Wanderer--Sammael)

<LI>Watcher &amp; Wanderer both seem concerned with Sammael's actions.

<LI>Moridin &amp; Watcher both know AoL technology and terminology.

<LI><CITE>From the RJ aol.com Q&amp;A chat, 27 June 1996</CITE>:<BR>
"Question: There is a mystery man who helps Rand in the last chapter of <CITE>ACoS</CITE>...is this a new character, or
have we seen him elsewhere?"<BR> RobtJordan: Well, we've certainly seen him earlier in CROWN OF SWORDS."<BR>
</UL>
<P>
The Moridin = Wanderer connection has a strong chance of being true, given the similarity of apperance, and
the TP use. (Recall that even those who have been granted the use of the TP tend to only use it in dire
situations, with a few exceptions. Thus, if we see two TP users who look alike, chances are they are the
same.)  He also fulfills the "seen previously in <CITE>ACoS</CITE>" requirement. Tying the Watcher in is a more tenuous
connection, but entirely possible, especially considering Watcher point 7. It works from a literary viewpoint
as well -- why would RJ introduce three separate Evil Dudes, when, from a functional POV, they could all be the
same person?  Why be so mysterious about the Watcher's identity if we've met &amp; interacted with him before
(e.g. Demandred)?
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Okay, now for specuation as to the specific identities of the Mystery Men:</H2>
<H3><a NAME="Watcher">Who is the Watcher?</a></H3>
<P>
Given that the Watcher is from the AoL (Watcher pt #1, 5, 6), there are really only three people he could be:
Demandred, Osan'gar, and Moridin. The outright evidence for and against any of these possibilities is slim,
since we don't really know much about any of these characters. The most likely is Moridin, but this is only
because he's the only one we know of who uses the TP an any other situation than dire emergencies, and if
Moridin = Wanderer, then his spying on Sammael is precedented. 
</P>
<P>
Next likely is Demandred, but only because if Demandred = Taim, then the phrase "so-called Aiel" is
precedented. However, this sentiment (that the Aiel have changed a great deal since the AoL) has been
expressed by other Forsaken, although not with those same words. (Plus, if Taim = Dem, there is no evidence of
him using the TP.) Furthermore, if the Watcher truly is not concerned with being Nae'blis (Watcher point 7),
then he is <em>definitely</em> not Demandred.
</P>
<P>
Osan'gar is a distant third. Osan'gar is probably Aginor, and Aginor/Osan'gar never showed the acumen for the
commando-style recon the Watcher is doing; in fact, RJ has said that the chap who made the trollocs (i.e.
Aginor, the DO's resident gengineer) had no combat experience.  
</P>
<HR>
<H2><a NAME="Wanderer">Who is the Wanderer?</a></H2>
<H3>Moridin:</H3>
<P>
Evidence for this is given above.
</P>
<H3>Sammael:</H3>
<P>
The scenario is as follows: Sammael set up the whole SL thing in order to fake his death. In order to do so
effectively, he would need to have Rand witness his "death." Since Rand was clearly not doing a great job of
this by himself (he was basically wandering aimlessly through the streets of SL), Sammael decided to give him
a hand. He disguised himself, and got Rand to work out that Sam would be waiting next to the Waygate. As
evidence for this, consider Sam's "Caddar" disguise: Dark coat, tall, black eyes, dark hair (<CITE>ACoS: 20,
Patterns Within Patterns, 352-353</CITE>). (Note that we do <em>not</em>
know the color of the Wanderer's eyes.)
</P>
<P>
Contrary argument:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Supposing Sammael <em>were</em> the Wanderer, why would he use the TP, and not the OP? From what we've seen of
Sammael, he prefers to use the OP, when he has a choice. In the encounter with Rand, there is no reason for
him to use the TP for "stealth" reasons; Rand expects a male channeller to use saidin.
<LI>If the Wanderer <em>was</em> Sammael in his "Caddar" disguise, then Wanderer Point 1. tells us that "Caddar" is
young. However, Sevanna makes no such notice of this, even though Caddar calls <em>her</em> a "child." If "Caddar" were
so young, one would expect her to carry on about the gall of somebody younger than her (how old is Sevanna,
anyway?) calling her a "child."
</UL>
<H3>Graendal disguised as a man:</H3>
<P>
The motivation here is similar to the Wanderer = Sammael idea. The only difference is that here we have
Greandal helping Sam out by telling Rand where to go, instead of Sam doing it himself.
</P>
<P>
Contrary argument: Rand didn't feel <em>saidar</em> goosebumps, so if it <em>was</em> Graendal, she was using the TP. As with
Sammael, we have no evidence that she uses the TP when she could use the OP. So, why would she disguise
herself as a man, and use the TP, when she could have 1) disguised herself as a woman and used saidar, or 2)
disguised herself as a man and used saidar -- feeling saidar from a man would have been just as weird as feeling
no channelling from a man.
</P>
<H3>Lanfear disguised/in a man's body:</H3>
<P>
Interfering in other Forsaken's plans is her MO. (This assumes, of course, that the Wanderer was not part of
Sam's plan.) Again, if it was here, she was using the TP, because Rand didn't get the <em>Saidar</em> goosebumps. It is
more likely that Lanfear would use the TP than Graendal (after all, she discovered it in the first place). On
the other hand, while she uses disguises a lot, dressing up as a man isn't really her style; she's always
chosen female disguises before. People have argued that she has "helped" Rand in the past, so giving him a
hand in SL is consistant with her past actions. However, this is not true. For one thing, the last time she
saw Rand, she was trying to terminate him with extreme prejudice. Secondly, the Wanderer's (probably truthful)
stated reason for helping Rand is that it would mess up a great many plans if Rand died, not out of any liking
for Rand himself. Lanfear, OTOH, has always claimed to be helping Rand out because she liked him, not (the
real reason) because helping him coincided with her own plans. A slightly different theory is that she's been
recycled a la Aran'gar into a male body. This is even less likely, since it has the "last time she saw Rand,
she tried to kill him" flaw, plus the fact that it relies upon an assumption that Lanfear died, which we have
absolutely no reason to believe. After all, the fall through the melting Twisted Door didn't kill Moiraine
(see section 1.4); why should it kill Lanfear, who's bigger, more experienced, and more powerful?
</P>
<H3>Lews Therin Telamon:</H3>
<P>
The arguments for the general idea are that Rand isn't hearing LTT in his head anymore, plus a perception of
the bit where the Wanderer pulls LTT out of a pit and they both shoot off some BF as a "mirror image." There
are two variations on this theory:
</P>
<P>
i) The Wanderer was never really there; Rand's insanity has gone a step further than "voices in the head";
he's now created his own imaginary Lews Therin friend, body and all. This explains why LTT's voice isn't in
Rand's head any more, and why Rand didn't feel the Wanderer channelling. Despite this, it is very unlikely
that this theory is true. First, the Wanderer doesn't act <em>anything</em> like the lovable, loony LTT we've come to
know. The Wanderer clearly dislikes Rand and holds him in some contempt. The Wanderer has a good grip on
what's going on around him and what he's doing; he doesn't break off and moan and groan about Ilyena, or
destroying the world, or anything like that. The Wanderer doesn't want to kill Sammael himself. LTT, when he
hasn't been moaning about Ilyena, spends his time ranting about killing his enemies, Sammael foremost among
them. The Wanderer doesn't even <em>look</em> like LTT. (LTT description: <CITE>TEotW: Prologue, Dragonmount, x</CITE>
-- tall, middle-aged, white &amp; brown hair, dark eyes. Wanderer is young with black hair.) (Rand has seen
LTT's appearance: in T'A'R at the end of <CITE>TFoH</CITE>.) Surely, Rand could do a better job of constructing an imaginary
LTT that was consistant with the LTT in his brain.
</P>
<P>
ii) It's really LTT in an actual physical body of his own. (I hate to even mention it, but it seems to have a
non-negligible group of supporters, so...) Somehow, LTT managed to manifest himself physically, which is why
he's no longer in Rand's head. Evidence against this theory includes (but is not limited to) all the "Watcher
doesn't behave like LTT at all" stuff put forth against the "hallucination" theory; I won't repeat it. A
further argument is that there is now no explanation for why Rand didn't feel the Wanderer channel. LTT, being
a man, couldn't use <em>saidar</em> (which Rand would have felt, anyway). He's not a Darkfriend, either, so he
couldn't be using the TP.
</P>
<P>
This, of course, doesn't even <em>touch</em> the question of how LTT would get himself physically manifested in the
first place. The only <em>attempt</em> I've seen to explain this is from Richard Edwards: "Now if I'm Jordan and I
want to separate Lews and Rand, how could I do this?  Well, how about create a neat little paradox that will
confuse the hell out of everybody.  Lews and Rand cross balefire streams, causing a really strange separation
of them backwards in time, allowing Lews to be separated from Rand so that they can cross balefire streams." A
noble attempt, but it doesn't agree with anything we know about how BF works. (For one thing, consider the
time scale -- LTT went out of Rand's head <em>days</em> before the Shadar Logoth thing. A time-warp of that scale would
require loads of BF. Nothing suggests that Rand OR the Watcher were using that level of BF. For another thing,
Rand should have a memory of things being differently -- if LTT left his head due to BF, Rand should STILL
remember having LTT in his head, even if reality's been changed so that LTT wasn't in there -- just like he
remembered Asm, Mat &amp; Avi getting toasted, even though he BFed Rahvin, and they really never were
toasted.) Maybe its just a bad idea to pit balefire against balefire. You know.  A "Don't cross the streams"
thing. Maybe it was the interaction between TP generated BF and OP generated BF. The two sources are opposing,
and mixing the two is probably a Bad Thing.
</P>
<HR>
<H2><a NAME="Moridin">Who is Moridin?</a></H2>
<P>
Before considering the specific candidates, let us first ask ourselves this: Is Moridin from the AoL (perhaps
recycled into a Third Age body like the *'gars), or is he a Third Ager? If Moridin is the Watcher, he
definitely is from the AoL; if he's the Wanderer only, he is almost certainly from the AoL (Watcher points 1,
5; Wanderer points 2, 6). If Moridin is not the Wanderer or Watcher, he may indeed be a Third Ager, although
his knowledge of the Old Tongue and of AoL Power technology (vacuoles &amp; mindtraps, among other things) is
rather extensive for a Third Ager. (He could have been taught by Ishy, or somebody else.)
</P>
<P>
Now for the suspects:
</P>
<H3>Ishamael</H3>
<P>
The Toxic Twins (Aginor &amp; Balthamel) were recycled (assuming Ag &amp; Bal are Osan'gar &amp; Aran'gar),
and all they did to merit it was getting killed at the Eye of the World. Ishy kept the faith alive for 3000+
years, <em>and</em> kept the other Forsaken somewhat in line before he died. Surely, that merits some consideration in
the "bring back from the dead" competition; Ishy is overdue for a reappearance. So, here we have this "new"
member of the Dark Elite; it's only natural to consider that he is Ishamael's soul recycled into a Third Age
body. So, what's the evidence?
</P>
<UL>
<LI>If Moridin is the Watcher and/or the Wanderer, he is an AoLer, and thus probably a Forsaken (see below,
however). Rahvin and Be'lal are dead by balefire.  They are gone from the pattern.  Demandred and Sammael are
alive at the time we see Moridin.  Aginor and Balthamel are Aran'gar and Osan'gar. This leaves only one male
forsaken that could have been brought back. Ishamael. (Dan Rouk)

<LI>According to Moggy, who's in a position to know, using the TP to the extent exhibited by Moridin is very
rare (<CITE>ACoS: 25, Mindtrap, 412</CITE>). In the whole series, the only people we have seen that use the TP
to any large extent are Moridin, the Watcher, the Wanderer (who all three are very possibly the same person),
and Ishamael. In fact, prior to <CITE>ACoS</CITE>, Ish is the only person we have actually seen using it.

<LI>Colors: Moridin's colors are black and red. There are two (tenuous) connections between Ish and this color
scheme: 1) Whenever we saw Ish in <CITE>TEotW</CITE>, <CITE>TGH</CITE>, or <CITE>TDR</CITE>, he was wearing either black or red. 2) The livery of at
least some of the Seanchan soldiers in Amador is red and black.  Since the Seanchan Return -- indeed, the whole
Seanchan existence -- is a result of Ishamael's long-term plotting, I wonder if those colors may reflect that
identity. (Michael Gonzalez)
<P>
OTOH, Ishy hardly had a monopoly on the colors red and black. Many of the Forsaken use one or both of those
colors. Rand uses those colors quite often himself.
</P>

<LI>Eyeball effects: Both Ish and Moridin exhibit strange optical phenomena -- Ishy's Flaming Eyes and Moridin's
<em>saa</em>. The flaming eyes may be a later stage of the eyeball dots, so that in each body, channeling the TP
produces first flecks and then flames, as usage continues. This is thin, since the <em>saa</em> are black, and Ishy's
eye condition involved glowing, not darkness.
</UL>
<H3>Arguments against Moridin = Ish:</H3>
<P>
Lara Beaton points out that Ishy failed to "get" Rand three times, and ended up dead. This is not a stunning
success; it's a downright failure. Why would the DO "reward" this failure with restoring Ish to a position of
power?
</P>
<P>
Counter-argument: Ishy was beaten by Rand when he confronted him directly. Ishy's behind-the-scenes work
throughout the entire Third Age, OTOH was quite successful. The Trolloc Wars and the Hundred Years War (both
instigated by Ish) caused such widespread devastation, that Randland never recovered the level of civilization
and technology it had before the Breaking, or even got close. So, the DO resurrected him and put him to work
behind the scenes, spying on Sam, controlling Moggy's mindtrap, etc. Furthermore, being dead is, according to
Osan'gar, quite unpleasant <CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 59</CITE> -- that might have been punishment
enough, as it was in the case of the *'gars. Finally, Moridin doesn't seem to be as powerful as Ishy was. Ish
was clearly on top of everything. Moridin has some advantage, but he's not the Man in Charge of all Shadow
Operations, as he seemed to be before he got killed.
</P>
<P>
Personality: From what little we see of Moridin, he doesn't seem much like what we've seen of Ishy. Here are
some comments:
</P>
<P>
"Ishy was full of pride, and would not fit well into the behind-the-scenes role Moridin plays, IMO." (Alex
Outhred)<BR>
"I would expect more Ishy domineering and less easy-going whimsy." (Dylan F. Alexander)<BR>
"I would expect Ishy to be exerting more overt control over the other forsaken." (Bryon Wasserman)<BR>
</P>
<P>
Counter-argument: Every sighting of Ishamael that we have had has been filtered through one of the "good
guys'" perceptions (except the DFS). Most of them are though the characters' own interactions with
Ishy/Ba'alzamon, in which Ish was overbearing and domineering as a matter of course. The same applies for the
lowly DFs at the DFS. The only times we saw him interacting with other Forsaken were brief glances in T'A'R,
through the eyes of Perrin or Egwene. So, we don't <em>know</em> if he'd be particularly overbearing when interacting
with one of his colleagues (i.e. Moggy). He certainly got amusement out of Mog's predicament. As for Ish not
fitting into a behind-the scenes role, that actually seems to be his forte. (See above comments.) Finally,
IMO, while Moridin doesn't display any overt Ishy-isms in <CITE>ACoS: Mindtrap</CITE>, the Watcher and the
Wanderer do show some Ish-like behavior. Compare (<CITE>ACoS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 656</CITE>): "'You are a
fool,' a man's deep voice [the Wanderer's] said. 'Count yourself lucky I don't care to see you die today.'"
and <CITE>TGH: 41, Disagreements, 497</CITE>: "'Fool!' Ba'alzamon roared. 'You will destroy yourself!'" Also
consider <CITE>ACoS: 20, Paterns Within Patterns, 358</CITE>: "Today's truth need not be tomorrow's. The
watcher had seen truth change a hundred times between a single sunrise and sunset. More than once he had
changed it himself. He considered...killing the seven women in the clearing..." That passage stikes me as
particularly Ishy-like. YMMV, of course.
</P>
<H3>Somebody we don't know from the AoL (poss. Beidomon)</H3>
<P>
If the DO can resurrect newly-dead Forsaken into new bodies, why should he stop there? Why not recycle some of
his servents from the AoL who were not shoved into the Bore with him? The basic motivation for this idea is
that Moridin (assuming he's also the Watcher and Wanderer) must be from the AoL, but he doesn't seem very much
like Ishy, personality-wise. (See above for discussion). A specific suggestion is that he's the fellow who
helped Lanfear open the Bore, Beidomon (see 1.1). Of course, this pre-supposes that Beidomon was not one of
the 13 Forsaken.
</P>
<P>
Here's the argument, courtesy of Alex Outhred and Jonathan Wright:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Beidomon and Mierin went looking for a new source, which could be used equally by men and women.  We have
never had Beidomon explained to us.  He was a researcher, and that does not seem to match the career paths of
any of the Forsaken that we know of. (NB: we still don't know about the pasts of several male Forsaken, e.g.,
Balthamel.) He worked with Lanfear, and he's never mentioned much.  In fact, he's only mentioned in that one
passage in <CITE>TSR</CITE> (I think...).  Why?  Did he actually die when the bore was made? Mierin did not.  Perhaps
Beidomon was killed during the War of Power, but not balefired.  A Forsaken-level channeller who, despite his
power, didn't get a chance to be sealed in the Bore.  There had to be a few of them.

<LI>Moghedien would not expect it to be him.  Yet we've seen that the DO can raise the dead, though with
different bodies.  Another reason he would not be recognized.  If he is the Wanderer, he speaks with uncanny
knowledge concerning Sammael's methods.  As if he'd witnessed Sammael's actions during the War of Power.

<LI>Beidomon could fit the "Avid True Power User" profile (Moridin point #4); after all, he had the will to go
and help Lanfear dig it up in the first place.
</UL>
<P>
The counter-argument is that this is all pure speculation. Sure it <em>could</em> be true, but we know next to
nothing about Beidomon, and little concrete about Moridin. This whole thing could be settled if RJ ever tells
us <em>who</em> Beidomon is. (i.e., if he turns out to be Rahvin, we'll know that Moridin isn't him.)
</P>
<H3>Osan'gar</H3>
<P>
The basic argument is that Moridin is probably a Forsaken, but he doesn't seem like Ishy. The only other
Forsaken that Moggy wouldn't recognise is Osan'gar. Points in favor are: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We haven't seen Osan'gar (in any obvious capacity) since the <CITE>LoC</CITE> prologue. He's got to be somewhere.

<LI>If Osan=Aginor, then he would almost certainly have had to be an adept of the True Power to taint the
Shadowspawn.

<LI><em>Contra:</em> However, there's no evidence that Osan'gar uses the TP as casually as Moridin does. His first
instinct upon being recycled is to reach for <em>saidin</em>, not the TP. Also, we don't know that the Shadowspawn
were created w/ the TP and not the OP.}

<LI>Osan'gar, we know (or strongly suspect, anyway), is Aginor who in turn we know was a researcher.  This
fits fairly well with this Moridin bugger being someone who can throw around fancy terms like 'vacuole' at
whim, as well as someone who could, say, build a mindtrap on demand if one couldn't be found.

<LI><em>Contra:</em> We know that Aginor was a researcher in the "life sciences," i.e. he was an expert at genetic
engineering and the like. It is doubtful that this has any bearing on expertise in soul-manipulation
techniques (mindtraps) or the structure of space-time (vacuoles). Besides, Moridin didn't necessarily make the
mindtrap, and he certainly didn't activate it; SH and the DO did that, and apparently most of the Forsaken
know what a vacuole is; Moggy certainly does.
</UL>
<H3>Evidence against Moridin being Osan'gar:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>They don't look alike. In <CITE>LoC, Prologue, The First Message, 58</CITE>, Osan'gar is described as "not young" and
having "an ordinary face." Moridin is young and attractive. Moridin is easily as tall as Rand. There is no
direct evidence, but Osan'gar is probably not that tall - that sort of height is apparently rare in Randland,
and Osan'gar describes his new body as "ordinary."

<LI>If Osan'gar is Aginor, and Moridin is the Watcher, then Osan'gar is probably not Moridin, since RJ has
said that the man who created the Trollocs had no clue about the realities of combat (which is why Trollocs
are so stupid). The Watcher is clearly adept at commando-style sneaking.
</UL>
<H3>Slayer/Isam</H3>
<P>
Here's the argument, such as it is (<CITE>"Pro" arguments provided by Keith Higginson</CITE>):
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Possible similarity of appearance. Isam bears a strong resemblance to Lan, who is tall, dark-haired, and
blue-eyed, just like Moridin.
<LI><em>Contra:</em> Slayer does not look like Moridin (a tall, dark, handsome young man). Slayer looks like a
middle-aged, red-headed Andoran noble with a vague resemblence to Rand -- he looks like Luc Mantear. He only
looks like Lan in Tel'aran'rhiod, where one's appearance is strongly influenced by one's self-image. Finally,
if Moridin is the Wanderer, and Moridin looked like Isam, Rand would have noted the resemblance to Lan --  he
didn't.
<LI>He meets Moggy in a place where Isam would prefer to look like himself. Examples, "She did not doubt that
it [the room] was somewhere close to SG, though; it did not have the feel of T'A'R, the only other possibility,"
"--this room must be close to SG--," "...no matter how close SG lay." (<CITE>ACoS: 25, Mindtrap,
pp418-419</CITE>) Reality is easily altered near Shayol Ghul.  It is logical that Isam would look like Isam
not Luc.
<LI><em>Contra:</em> This is unlikely; if one could do this, why did Ishy appear in his burned-up state at the DFS at
the beginning of <CITE>TGH</CITE>? Showing himself injured made him appear vulnerable in front of his minions -- if changing
one's appearance is so trivial near SG, why didn't Ishy do it?
<LI>Moghedien thinks he is a man from the third Age.  Despite knowing about vacuoles, about the Forsaken, and
mindtraps, Moggy assumes this.  Examples (<CITE>ACoS: 25, Mindtrap, 418-419</CITE>): "she knew that some men ... could
channel <EM>in this time</EM>," "...facing him with the knowledge of an age that made <EM>his</EM> little
different from times of mud huts."
<LI><em>Contra</em>: Moggy assumes he is a Third Ager because she doesn't know that the DO has been reincarnating dead
Forsaken; she might not even know that the DO has this power. Lacking that knowledge, the only conclusion she
can make is that Moridin is a Third Ager.  Furthermore, if Moridin is either the Watcher or the Wanderer, he
<em>has</em> to be an AoLer, and thus not Slayer.
<LI>He channels the TP.  Moghedien does assume that he must channel the OP as well, but this may not be the
case.  Isam seems to report directly to the DO (what Forsaken besides Ishamael would order Fain dead?). He is
the single character in the series that has the DO's presonal favor and does not channel.
<LI><em>Contra:</em>
<UL>
<LI>We dunno that Isam reports directly to the DO. His "kill Fain" mission was probably initiated
before Ishy's demise in <CITE>TDR</CITE>. After all, when Perrin gets word of the trouble in the Two Rivers, it's been
going on for some time. It started in <CITE>TDR</CITE>, when Fain convinced Pedron Niall to send a WC contingent to the Two
Rivers. Fain went with them, and Slayer followed Fain. Ishy was still alive and kicking, then. In fact, there
is textual evidence that Slayer is <em>somebody's</em> flunky: "But you, Goldeneyes.  Your presence was a surprise. 
There are those who want your head on a pike."  (<CITE>TSR: 42, A Missing Leaf, 477</CITE> If he was working
directly for the Dark One, he wouldn't give a fig what anyone else thought, or who else wanted Perrin's head. 
He probably wouldn't refer to the Dark One as a plural, either.
<LI>We don't know that Slayer IS in the DOs favor, anymore. (See below.)

<LI>As pointed out, Moghedian believes that you have to be able to channel the OP in order to channel the TP.
While she <em>may</em> be mistaken, there is no reason to assume so. Moridin notwithstanding, of the 30 people Moggy
knows who were permitted to use the TP, all 30 were channellers of the OP. Why should Moridin be different?
</UL>
<LI>Red and black livery for Moghedien, a joke on Moridin's part (whether of itself or making Moghedien wear
it, or both), may symbolize the amalgam of the reddish hued man (Luc) with the dark man (Isam).
<LI><em>Contra:</em> OR, they just may be Moridin's favorite colors.
</UL>
<H3>Further arguments for why Moridin is not Slayer:</H3>
<P>
Whether you argue that "Isam" is Slayer's true appearance, and Luc is just a disguise, or Luc is Slayer's true
appearance, and Isam/Moridin is a disguise, the theory runs into problems.
</P>
<P>
If the Luc-look is not Slayer's true appearance, but a disguise, <em>why</em> is he disguising himself as Luc every
when he goes out into the world, when the Isam-look would be just as unrecognisable (if not <em>more</em>
unrecognisable)? He didn't only use the Luc-look in the Two Rivers, he also used it the only other time he was seen by
"mundane" witnesses -- when he killed Janduin. Why? Furthermore, if Slayer=Moridin=SL Wanderer, then why is he
now using his "true" (according to you) appearance to go out in the worrld, when he's only used the Luc-look
before. Finally, if Isam/Moridin is in his original Isam-body, why does he look like he's barely over 20 years
old. Isam was born around the same time as Lan -- he'd be 40+ if still walking around. (No, you can't claim that
it's some sort of Power-induced "slowing," because no other male channeller has ever shown himself to slow at
such a young age.) If you say that "Moridin" is a disguise, then you lose your single point of actual
evidence -- a possible physical resemblance.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you argue that the "Moridin/Isam" look is the disguise, and (presumably) the Luc-look is
real. Again, <em>why</em> is he disguising himself for Moggy? What's the point? Why would he be disguiding himself as
Luc whenever he goes out into the world? People would have as much chance of recognising "Isam" as they would
have as Luc.
</P>
<P>
Moridin's star seems to be on the rise in the ranks of the Shadow. Slayer, OTOH, failed miserably on his Two
Rivers mission. He failed in his first objective, killing Fain. When Perrin showed up, Slayer's objective
shifted to include getting Perrin. He failed in <em>that</em>. He even failed to kill everybody in the Two Rivers. In
the process, he messed up further, by losing tons of Trollocs and Fades.
</P>
<P>
Moridin's position is not that of a failure. He's been given his very own Forsaken-class slave. He now not
only has his own resources, he has all of Moggy's skills and resources at his disposal.  He's got his very own
utterly loyal, very powerful and skilled minion. Even if the DO regards Mog as a second-hand citizen, she is
<em>still</em> an extremely powerful tool, in terms of both raw power and skill. He's also allowed to use the TP with
impunity, which is definitely a non-trivial demonstration of the DO's favor.
</P>
<P>
This is not consistant with the way we've seen the Dark Side behave to suppose that somebody who screwed up,
even if the screwup was beyond their control, should get <em>any</em> sort of increased power and responsibility. The
general management style of the Dark is "If you fail, you get punished," and the corollary "If you're still
useful, we'll give you another chance, on our terms, which you probably won't like." We've seen this applied
to everybody from the lowest-level DF up to the Forsaken themselves. Why should Slayer be an exception? Why
should the DO cut him some slack, when nobody else gets any?
</P>
<P>
Moridin can channel. Whether he can channel the OP and the TP, or just the TP, <em>he can channel</em>. If Slayer
could channel when he was in the Two Rivrs, why didn't he? It would certainly have aided him in his
mission(s). Even if we assume that he didn't because he would rather fail totally than chance anybody getting
suspicious, why didn't he channel at Perrin in T'A'R? (<CITE>TSR: 53, The Price of a Departure, 614</CITE>) The
only person to see would have been Perrin, and Perrin would have been dead. He used a bloody <em>arrow</em> to try to
kill Perrin with. That was the best he could manage.
</P>
<P>
In the big battle at Emond's field, the AS, of course, were an advantage to Perrin's side, but <em>if Isam could channel</em>,
he could have done something to counter that advantage. He clearly didn't (of course, he'd been shot
at that point, but if he could channel, he could have left, gotten somebody to heal him, and returned for the
fight.
