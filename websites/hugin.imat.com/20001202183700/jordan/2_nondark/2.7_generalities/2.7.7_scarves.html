<h1 align="center">2.7.7: When Rand and Mat are travelling to Caemlyn in
TEOTW, why does the scene with the scarves happen twice?</h1>
<P align="center">[Steven Cooper]</P>
<hr>
<P>
In TEOTW, after Mat and Rand split off from Thom in Whitebridge, they
travel to Caemlyn alone. During that journey, there are two scenes which
are exactly the same, even with almost the same wording. These to passages
are [TEOTW: 31, Play for Your Supper, 382] and [TEOTW: 33, The Dark Waits,
416]. In both descriptions, the farmer asks Rand and Mat who they are
running from. Then he says something about wanting to help them, but he
can't because he might get in trouble for helping strangers. He feels bad,
and offers them two woolen scarves, which he pulls from his pocket. He
explains that he knows it isn't much, but they are his sons' scarves, and
that's all he feels he can give them safely. He wishes them luck.
<P>
Is this an error? What's going on here?
<P>
It's a flashback scene, although not a particularly well-executed one,
judging from the amount of confusion it's generated. The confusion
comes partly from the fact that Jordan doesn't do anything special to
mark the flashback as such (e.g. using an italic font, like Mat's
flashback of Mili Skane in COS) -- subtle changes of verb tense are
the only clues. Also, that whole sequence from chapter 31 to chapter
34 contains not only a long flashback, but another flashback nested
inside the first one.
<P>
Hopefully, the following table will clarify what's going on. I've arranged
the events of these chapters into their proper, chronological order. In
the left-hand column are indications of the days passing. Sometimes it's
not possible to say exactly how many days Rand and Mat spend in travelling
from place to place, hence the use of A0, B0, C0 etc. to mark different
sections of the timeline. The numbers in the second column represent the
order in which Jordan presents the events in the text. Chapter 31 begins
with Rand and Mat travelling down the Caemlyn Road on day D3, before
flashing back to the start of the journey from Whitebridge. So, scroll
down to event number 1 near the bottom of the table, and just follow the
numbers.

</TABLE>
<P>
As you can see, chapters 33, 31 and 34 (in that order!) all start on the
same day, and both 31 and 33 end chronologically before they begin. I
always have to smile when I read Jordan's smartass comment at the start of
chapter 34: "[Rand] wondered if his whole sense of time was getting
skewed." [TEOTW: 34, The Last Village, 431] Whatever Rand is feeling, the
reader's sense of time should definitely be tied into a knot by this point.
