<h1 align="center">1.2.4: Who is Moridin? Why do we think the Watcher and
Wanderer are him?</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Why are we sure that Moridin is Ishamael returned from the grave?</h2>
<P>
[John Novak]
<P>
<h3>Evidence from ACOS:</h3>
<P>
It is fairly obvious from multiple references that Moridin is
a reincarnated Forsaken. He makes many references to the Age of
Legends as though he were there. He has personal knowledge of the
other Forsaken. His sobriquet translates to 'Death.'
<P>
Aginor and Balthamel, though reincarnated, are accounted for as
Osan'gar and Aran'gar respectively. Be'lal and Rahvin were
Balefired, and as such are beyond the Dark One's ability to restore.
Asmodean, in Robert Jordan's own words, is roadkill. Sammael, though
possibly dead, did not die until well after the introduction of
Moridin in the narrative. No other male Forsaken have been killed in
action. (And from [TPOD: 2, Unweaving, 81], we know that
Moridin is and was male, since he remarks that he would be able to use an
angreal tuned to Saidin.)
<P>
The Toxic Twins (Aginor and Balthamel) were recycled, and all they did to
merit it was getting killed at the Eye of the World. Ishy kept the faith
alive for 3000+ years, AND kept the other Forsaken somewhat in line before
he died. Surely, that merits some consideration in the "bring back from
the dead" competition; Ishy was overdue for a reappearance. Ishamael had
been a particularly loyal servant of the Dark One, as well as the most
effective. If any of the thirteen would deserve reincarnation, it would be
Ishamael, for he seemed not only to serve the Dark One, but to serve him
faithfully. It is likely that Ishamael knew that the Dark One's plans were
not for conquest but for total destruction, and still he served. (In the
AOL, he "called for the complete destruction of the old order-- indeed, the
complete destruction of everything." [Guide: 5, The Dark One and the Male
Forsaken, 51]
<P>
Moridin uses the True Power to the exclusion of the One Power. In fact, he
uses it for "routine" things for which the OP would be fine: like picking
up chess pieces, Balefire, and Travelling. The True Power, according to
Moghedien, is used only extremely rarely, even by the Forsaken. Of the
original Forsaken, Ishamael is the only one who we've seen use the TP.
<P>
Both Moridin and Ishamael display strange visual effects about their eyes.
Moridin has the saa, while Ishamael had those odd bursts of flame. It has
been speculated that the flames are an advanced version of the saa, or
that the flames were a method to disguise the saa.
<P>
<h3>New evidence from TPOD:</h3>
<P>
The Prologue of TPOD is particularly revealing.
<UL>
<LI>Moridin's blank-faced servants are identical to
Ishamael's servants from the prologue of TGH. Similarly, the chamber
in which he sits contains a fire that gives no heat and consumes no
logs. It has no physical means of egress. This is identical
in tone to the description given of Ishamael's chambers through TEOTW
and TGH.
<P>
<LI>(Also in the Prologue) while Moridin is musing over his
re-creation of an historical game of sha'rah, it becomes extremely clear
that the game is a metaphor for the struggle between the Dark One and the
rest of the world, with Rand (or the Dragon) embodied in the Fisher piece.
One can win by either controlling and moving the Fisher piece to a
particular location, by allowing your opponent to hold the Fisher and
leaving him only legal moves which similarly result in victory for you.
The style of the game parallels Ishamael's actions through the first three
volumes very well, always manipulating Rand even though he was in the hands
of other powers. The final method of victory is simply to be the last man
standing. Moridin muses that he had only attempted that strategy once,
with very painful results. This is almost certainly a metaphorical
reference to his desperate assault on Rand at the end of tDR, the painful
results being his own physical death.
<P>
<LI>The final observation from the prologue of TPOD is that
Moridin becomes angry as he muses over the fact that he does not understand
the origins of the name or the traditional shape of the Fisher piece on the
game board. He becomes angry because he regards that knowledge, likely
lost from some previous turning of the Wheel, as his right. Ishamael is
the only other villain to worry seriously over events from other cycles, as
he asserts in the prologue of tEotW that he and Lews Therin have fought
again and again since the beginning of time. According to [Guide: 5, The
Dark One and the Male Forsaken, 50], Ishamael believed "the war between the
Shadow and the soul of Lews Therin had gone on since the creatio, an
endless war between the Great Lord of the Dark and the Creator using human
surrogates."
<P>
<LI>In [TPOD: 3, Unweaving, 81], Moridin notes several modern
developments of the Aes Sedai and other channellers which had been unknown
and/or considered impossible in the Age of Legends. Among them, he lists
the Warder bond and notes that he had known about that for a long, long
time. Of all the Forsaken, only Ishamael could possibly have known about
the Warder bonds for more than a few years, since only Ishamael had been
active at all since the Strike at Shayol Ghul. <em>This piece of evidence
alone proves that Moridin is Ishamael.</em>
</UL>
<P>
Objections to the Moridin/Ishamael theory from before TPOD included the
suggestion that Ishamael did not work well behind the scenes and that
Ishamael might be expected to exert more influence on the remaining
Forsaken. However, since we now know the general shape of Ishamael's
activities during his rare periods of activity (as hinted at
throughout the series and almost spelled out in the Guide) as well as
his care in creating a cell structure for the Black Ajah, it is clear
that Ishamael excels at behind the scenes manipulations.
<P>
Furthermore, in TPOD, it becomes clear that Moridin is indeed exerting more
direct control over the remaining Forsaken. In ACOS, he takes direct
control of Moghedien through one mindtrap, and is known to control
another. In TPOD, it is revealed that 'Cyndane' (most likely a
reincarnated Lanfear) is the other mindtrap victim.
<P>
It is also clear that Moridin and Shaidar Haran are cooperating. In
[ACOS, 25, Mindtrap, 417], it is Shaidar Haran who delivers Moghedien
to Moridin, and Moridin who controls her mindtrap. In [TPOD: 12, New
Alliances], it is Moghedien and Cyndane (both under Moridin's control)
who visit Graendal to tell her to accept Moridin as Nae'blis. Shaidar
Haran later appears to convince her.
<P>
So we have three Forsaken under Moridin's control, which alone is
significant. Extrapolating this pattern, we also note that when Aginor and
Balthamel return as Osan'gar and Aran'gar in LoC, it is Shaidar Haran who
first greets them. It is not at all unlikely that they also encountered
Moridin offstage sometime thereafter. If true, this would place five
Forsaken directly under his control.
<P>
<h2>The Watcher and the Wanderer</h2>
<P>
[Korda, Paul Khangure]
<P>
In addition to Moridin's overt appearance in ACOS, there were two other
appearances by mysterious men of the Dark persuasion in that book. First,
we met the Watcher, i.e. the guy watching Graendal and Sammael in [ACOS:
20, Patterns Within Patterns, 356]. Then, we met Moridin in [ACOS: 25,
Mindtrap, 417]. Finally, there is the "wanderer" that Rand met in Shadar
Logoth during his fight with Sammael in [ACOS: 41, A Crown of Swords,
656]. Even before TPOD, it was reasonable to assume that all three were the
same person. After all, how many mysterious True Power channellers do we
need? Given that neither the "Watcher" or "Wanderer" appear as distinct
individuals in TPOD, we have even more reason to believe that both are
Moridin, who is Ishamael. Let us consider the specific bits of evidence.
<P>
<h3>The Watcher</h3>
<P>
We meet the Watcher in [ACOS, 20, Patterns within Patterns, 356-358]:
<OL>
<LI>Obviously a Forsaken from the AOL. He knows about AOL technology -
callboxes, Mask of Mirrors and fancloth, knows the Forsaken by name and
appearance. He definitely <EM>knew</EM> Sammael, as opposed to knowing of him.
Just a guy from the AOL is not enough; he has to be someone who
interacted and got to know Sammael's strengths and weaknesses. Notice
there was no fear of interfering with not just two of the Forsaken, but
with a potential battle between them! Furthermore, he uses the phrase
"so-called Aiel" which we have no reason to expect anybody except a
relic from the AoL to use; the Forsaken are the only AoL relics in
action, except Birgitte and "LTT."
<P>
<LI>Senses saidin being held by Sammael, skin prickles when Graendal
channels. This indicates that he has the ability to channel saidin.
<P>
<LI>He uses the TP. Note that he does so even though he can use the
OP. This indicates that he's probably uses it more than your
average Forsaken--he could have Travelled with the OP, but he used
the TP instead. Note that by the time he left, Sam had left the
vicinity, so there was no chance of him being detected.
<P>
<LI>He has eyebrows and eyes. (i.e. He is not Shaidar Haran.)
<P>
<LI>He has "expertise in many areas Sammael scorned. In some he
favored, too."
<P>
<LI>He doesn't seem to have the same attitude as the "normal" Forsaken
towards Nae'blis-ness. In [ACOS: 20, Patterns Within Patterns,
358], Sammael mentions (lies) to Graendal that he "will be
Nae'blis." Graendal then stops arguing with Sam and follows him
through his gateway. We then have: "The watcher smiled crookedly
behind his fancloth skulker's mask. Nae'blis. That explained what
had brought Graendal to heel, what had stayed her from killing
Sammael. Even she would be blinded by that." It seems as if the
Watcher is NOT blinded by the "Nae'blis" carrot, unlike the
"normal" Forsaken.
<P>
<LI>Obviously, he has an interest in what Sammael and Graendal are up to,
since he is spying on them.
</ol>
<P>
What can we conclude from these observations? From 1 and 2, we can
conclude that the Watcher is Moridin/Ishamael, Osan'gar/Aginor, or
Demandred. Aran'gar/Balthamel is out, because she thinks of herself as
"she," as indicated in [TPOD, 16, Unexpected Absences, 332-333]. The
relative lack of interest in Sammael's supposed Nae'blis-hood rules
Demandred out. (Recall Demandred's reaction to "WOULD YOU BE NAE'BLISS?"
in the LOC Prologue.) Nothing completely rules out the possibility that
the Watcher is Osan'gar/Aginor, but that is mostly because we don't know
much about Osan'gar at all. From the description of Aginor's activities
during the AOL (Shayol Ghul's resident Mad Scientist), it is somewhat
doubtful that he'd have expertise in ANY areas Sammael "favored." The last,
and overwhelmingly most likely, possibility is Moridin. This is indicated
by the Watcher's use of the TP in a circumstance where the OP would have
sufficed. Given the general attitude of the Forsaken towards the TP, it is
unlikely that there are TWO such TP addicts around, and that Osan'gar is
one of them. Unlike Moggy, Osan'gar didn't even consider using the True
Power when he found himself shielded by Shaidar Haran. The fact that the
Watcher was keeping tabs on Sammael and Graendal connect him to both the
Wanderer (who interfered with Sammael and Rand's fight in SL-- something he
could have only done if he knew what Sammy had been up to) and Moridin. We
know Moridin was watching Sammael, because he thinks about how foolish
Sam's plans are in [TPOD, 2, Unweaving, 81-82], and his minions Moggy and
Cyndane seem to know about Graendal's connection with Sam when they visit
her in [TPOD, 12, New Alliances, 262-268]. Thus, everything points to the
Wanderer being Moridin.
<P>
<h3>The Wanderer</h3>
<P>
We see the Wanderer in [ACOS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 656-659]:
<OL>
<LI>Description: Big fellow. Has a deep voice. Little older than
Rand. Black coat, Black hair. Rand doesn't recognise him.
<P>
<LI>He's most likely not a Third Age person. Knows Sammael, including how
Sammael thinks. He clearly knows Sam fairly well, and thus is probably
from the AOL. Furthermore, he has "never been afraid of Aes Sedai."
Everybody in Randland proper (i.e. not Seanchan, not Aiel, and not Sea
Folk) grows up hearing stories of Aes Sedai like those the Emond's
Fielders did. Such stories engender some sort of awe in the listener,
yet this guy acts like AS are no problem, and has never thought
otherwise. This comment is easily understandible if he's from the
AOL-- back then, he WAS an Aes Sedai, and modern AS are but "untrained
children" to him.
<P>
<LI>He uses the TP instead of the OP (Balefire and disappears without Rand
sensing Saidin or Saidar). This is a situation where using the TP
instead of the OP could be dangerous-- it might make Rand suspicious--
and yet the Wanderer uses it. This is evidence that the Wanderer is a
TP addict.
<P>
<LI>Even apart from his TP use, he is clearly a Minion of Darkness. He
calls Rand a fool, he doesn't "care to see [Rand] die today," he
doesn't "intend to carry [Rand] on [his] shoulders, or kill Sammael."
He's clearly only helping Rand because it coincides with some plan of
his, not because he particularly cares about Rand's wellbeing. He
certainly doesn't like Rand; when he falls down after the
crossed-streams BF incident, Rand offers him a hand, but the Wanderer
refuses "with a grimace."
<P>
<LI>[From the RJ aol.com chat, 27 June 1996]: "Question: There is a
mystery man who helps Rand in the last chapter of ACOS...is this a new
character, or have we seen him elsewhere. RJ: Well, we've
certainly seen him earlier in CROWN OF SWORDS."
</ol>
<P>
Given that the Wanderer must be a Forsaken (#2, #3, #4), we are left with
the same three suspects we had for the Watcher-- Demandred, Osan'gar, and
Moridin. The physical description (#1) does not match Demandred or
Osan'gar (neither are young). In fact, the description matches Moridin
quite well. From [ACOS: 25, Mindtrap, 417-418]:
<blockquote>
"The speaker was a tall, broad-shouldered young man in black boots and
breeches, and a flowing white shirt unlaced at the top, who watched her
with startlingly blue eyes ..." He has a deep voice. He has a strong
chin, else he'd be worthy of Graendal's collection. He looks to be just a
little older than Rand, "Not many years past twenty."
</blockquote>
The Wanderer's size, hair color, age, voice, and fashion sense all match
with Moridin's, as does his TP addiction. The attention to and
interference with Sammael's plans also agree with what we know Moridin (and
the Watcher) have been up to. RJ's remark that the Wanderer is somebody we
saw earlier in ACOS certainly works if he is Moridin. Furthermore, his
remarks to Rand, which indicate that he regards Rand as a tool or a piece
in a game, bring to mind Ishamael's comments to Rand in the first three
books, and also Moridin's analysis of the sha'rah game in [TPOD: Prologue,
Deceptive Appearances, 42-44]. All of this indicates that the Wanderer is
Moridin.
