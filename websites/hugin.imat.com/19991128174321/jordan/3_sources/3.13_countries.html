<P>
Obviously, the various countries and nations of Randland draw some of
their characteristics from real-world nations and cultures (both current
and historical). Here's a list of Randland countries and real-world
countries which may have influenced them. The ones labeled "RJ" are ones
which have been stated/confirmed by RJ. The rest are just reasonable
speculations. </P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Aes Sedai</STRONG>: AS organization is based on the way
convents were organized between 1000 and 1800 AD. (RJ)
<LI><STRONG>Altara</STRONG>: Italy; a loose confederacy of semi-autonomous
regions beneath a weak monarch. The capital city contains elements of
a much, much older city (Rome) complete with large public hippodromes
(race tracks), the diet is heavily into seafoods and cheeses, the
culture is outdoorsy and seems evocative of Mediterranean life.
<LI><STRONG>Amadicia</STRONG>: The fashions (gathers of ringlets, deep
shady bonnets, bows on the women, high crowned hats and long coats for
the men) seem vaguely suggestive of the Commonwealth Period of England,
when the Puritans held sway. This also meshes with the notion that
Amadicia is a quasi-theocracy, as they are essentially ruled by a
military order of "monks" who seem to encourage a well, puritanical and
pious lifestyle among the populace. They also like to throw
accusations of witchery everywhere, not at all unlike the Puritans who
moved to North America.
<LI><STRONG>Andor</STRONG>: England, Elizabethan England specifically with
its "Cult of the Queen."
<LI><STRONG>Arad Doman</STRONG>: Arabic cultures; firstly, the word "arab"
is almost present in the name "Arad Doman." Some of the characters
last names seem Arabic in theme (e.g. Shariff, Eriff, Zeffar), as well
as some of their first names (e.g. Alsalam, Rashad). The lacquered
sticks, sursa, used as eating implements are chopsticks by any other
name, and common throughout Asia.
<LI><STRONG>Aiel</STRONG>: Elements of Cheyenne, Apache, Zulu, Bedouin, Japanese,
Berbers (RJ). <A HREF="3.09_aiel.html">See Section 3.09.</a>
<LI><STRONG>Cairhien</STRONG>: France; the noblewomen's fashions seem to
be somewhat reminiscent of the clothing from the Eighteenth century;
high curled coiffures, full wide skirts and ruffs of lace. The Court
of Louis XIV was called the Court of the Sun King. Cairhienin
symbology is all about the sun, i.e. Sun Palace, Sun Throne.
Furthermore, the prevalence of Daes Dae'mar calls to mind the
lethal intrigues at the Court of Versailles. The officers and noblemen
wear "con" on their backs, small pennants attached to a short staff,
also seen in feudal Japan. Japan is the "Land of the Rising Sun,"
Cairhien is the "Hills of the Golden Dawn," and its symbol is a rising
sun.
<LI><STRONG>Illian</STRONG>: Illian has something of a
"Greek-Mediterranean" feel to it. Some of the he names certainly
follow a Hellenic pattern (e.g. Stepheneos, Demitrides). The King of
Illian wears the "Laurel Crown," an allusion the crowns of laurels
awarded at the ancient Olympic Games. "Illian" itself is a take-off on
"Illium," a name for Troy during the Classical Age. Lastly, the
Illianer Companions seems to be a reference to the Macedonian
<EM>hetairoi</EM> (meaning "companions" in Greek), which were a
prestigious mounted order of warriors that served the ruling House.
Any decent scholar of military history such as RJ would know about
the <EM>hetairoi</EM>. The bees on the flag seem to evoke the bees that
were common in the heraldry of Napoleanic France.
<LI><STRONG>Land of Madmen</STRONG>: Australia?
<LI><STRONG>Mayene</STRONG>: Cities of Hanseatic League, Venice, Genoa
(RJ); Also, many of the Mayener names seem to carry a French flavor
(e.g. Bertain Gallene, Evonne), and "Mayene" itself seems to be a take
off on "Mayenne," an extinct French estate.
<LI><STRONG>Malkier</STRONG>: Tibet, Nepal. A country nestled high in the
mountains of spectacular natural beauty. The ki'san (dots) painted in
the center of the brows of the women could either be an allusion to
the Hindu practice, or to some representations of the Buddha; an
overall thematic feel reminiscent of the countries near the Himalayas.
<LI><STRONG>Saldaea</STRONG>: "a number of middle eastern cultures and
several cultures in countries surrounding the Black Sea" (RJ) This is
most directly recognizable in the "horse-culture" of Saldaea, which is
evocative of many nomadic peoples of the Asian steppe. Physically,
Saldaeans can be seen to resemble the Mongols.
<LI><STRONG>Sea Folk</STRONG>: A combination of allusions. The people were
initially described much as Sub-Saharan Africans (tight, curly hair,
dark skin tones), but later versions have them with long, straight
black hair, which coupled with the dark complexions, silk garments and
the medallions on chains attached to noserings seems to evoke India
more than anything else. The intricately knotted sashes used to
connote rank and station resemble Japanese obi, (kimino sashes).
<LI><STRONG>Seanchan</STRONG>: Imperial China, Imperial Japan, Persian
Empire, Ottoman Empire. (RJ); The lacquer work of the Seanchan seems
to be inspired by the Far East, the Emperor/Empress too grand for the
eye is a concept borrowed from Japan. The phrase "Ever Victorious
Army" was actually in use in Japan during one point of its history.
Persian Empire: The Crystal Throne that inspires awe is a direct
allusion to a Persian epic story. Ancient Egypt: pleated linen
clothing, the tonsured heads, the patterns on Suroth's gown (symbols
within cartouche-like ovals) which could be visualized as resembling
hieroglyphics.
<LI><STRONG>Shara</STRONG>: Africa in a macro-sense. The name "Shara"
seems similar to "Sahara," and another name for Shara, "Kigali" is an
actual place in Africa. Furthermore, the two Sharans we have met were
described as "African" in appearance, with tight, curly hair and dark
skins. The silk production, "Silk Path" (Silk Road) and closed port
cities are allusions, however, to Imperial China.
<LI><STRONG>Shienar</STRONG>: Japan; the restrained, formal aesthetic, the
communal genderless bathing rooms, the haiku-type poetry recited by
Lan, the topknots of the warriors. Also, a dash of Medieval Feudal
Europe, notably the castle towns and the mounted warriors in full plate
armor (knights by any other name), and the idealized courtesy and
respect toward women, (chivalry).
<LI><STRONG>Tarabon</STRONG>: Arabic cultures. The word "arab" is
contained in the name "Tarabon," the veils seem to be reminiscent of
certain Arabic societies, although in Tarabon they are unisex. The
architecture has a Middle Eastern flair; minarets and peaked domes,
pointed arches.
<LI><STRONG>Tear</STRONG>: Spain (nobility); the names of some of the High
Lords have a distinct Iberian flavor (e.g. Estanda, Carlomin, Rosana),
their fashions seem to be reminiscent of Renaissance Spain (full
skirted gowns with wide lace ruffs, puffy sleeved coats, oiled beards
and moustaches). Furthermore, the lower classes seem to be very Asian
in feel; some of the names (e.g. Juilin, Suian, Huan), and some of
their clothing; flattened conical straw hats, ties instead of buttons,
wooden platforms for the feet as well as the usage of bamboo. But also
some of the lower class members' names seem very Spanish as well (e.g.
Sanche [Sanchez], Mercandes [Mercandez]).
<LI><STRONG>Whitecloaks</STRONG>: Teutonic Knights (RJ).
