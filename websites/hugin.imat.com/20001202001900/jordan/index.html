<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Welcome to the Wheel of Time FAQ</h1>

No, the FAQ is not yet updated for the new book, <cite>Winter's
Heart</cite>.  Here are the answers to commonly-asked questions about
the WH update.  In the meantime, you can still read the 
<A HREF="0_admin/0.01_intro.html"><CITE>The Path of Daggers</CITE> Version of
the FAQ</A>.

<h2>1. Will the FAQ be updated for the new book? When will it be done?</h2>
<P>
Yes, the FAQ will be updated for the new book.
<P>
It will not be done for some time. Probably late spring, or summer of 2001.
<P>
In the meantime, if you are curious as to what other people have been
saying, and don't want to use the monstrosity which is Deja.com, you
can check out this collection of <a href =
"http://linuxmafia.com/~pam/wh-posts/">WH-related posts</a>. 


<h2>2. Why does it take so long? I want instant gratification!</h2>
<P>
The WOTFAQ is not something handed down to me from on high, nor do I 
just sit down and make all that stuff up. It is a compilation of discussion 
among many readers on various WOT-related topics. Thus, I cannot even begin
to update it until there has been a lot of discussion on the new book. Then,
after there has been lots of discussion, it takes time to sort through it, 
summarize it, and arrange it into the (relatively) concise form you get in 
the WOTFAQ. Add to all this work the fact that nobody is getting paid to 
do the WOTFAQ, it must be worked on in my (and others') spare time, and 
you'll see why it takes a while to do. 

<h2>3. I have all sorts of great ideas. How can I contribute?</h2>
<P>
<strong>Please do not e-mail your theories to me!</strong>
<P>
It's not that I am not interested in other peoples' input, but that no 
idea or theory goes into the FAQ unless it has been discussed by multiple
people. After all, the "F" in "FAQ" stands for "Frequently." The WOTFAQ is
not intended to be a complete collection of all WOT theories. Rather, it 
strives to synthesize input from many different people on <em>some</em> WOT 
theories.
<P>
An exception is the "Sources" section (section 3). If you think you know
of a real-world mythological or literary source for something in TWOT and 
which is not already mentioned in the FAQ, feel free to mail it to me, and I 
may mention it in the FAQ. However, if you post it to the newsgroup, 
you don't need to mail it to me, as well.
<P>
To answer the question, you can contribute by participating in the
on-line discussion in the Usenet newsgroup
<tt>rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan</tt>. It is
<strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you read the <a href =
"http://www.landfield.com/faqs/sf/robert-jordan-faq/"><TT>r.a.sf.w.rj</TT>
FAQ</A> before posting, and take its advice to heart. Doing so will help
you avoid making social blunders which could lead to people ignoring
you or flaming you.

<h2>4. When will the next Wheel of Time book come out?</h2>
<P>
(Okay, technically this has nothing to do with the process of updating
the WOTFAQ, but so many people ask it, I'm going to put it in here, anyway.)
<P>
It is way too early for anybody to know that, including Robert Jordan himself, 
I'm sure. The best we can do is to guess, based on the time intervals between
previous books. The last few books all came out roughly 2 years apart, so Book
10 will probably come out around 2 years after Book 9. So, late fall 2002. That
is just a guess, though.
