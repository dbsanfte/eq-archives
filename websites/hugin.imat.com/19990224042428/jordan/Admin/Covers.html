<H1>What is the deal with those cheap Tor covers that don't stay on?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Eric Ebinger</H2>

<P>
No, you are not alone in having the cover fall off of your PB copy of 
<CITE>TDR</CITE>.  What can you do about it?  Patrick Nielsen Hayden 
says that you can send the book to Tor, and they will send you a new 
copy. You can also write a (snail-mail) letter of complaint to Tor. 
The address is on the inside of the books.  <strong>Do note send mean
e-mail to the nice Tor Books man!!!! It is not his fault!!!</strong>
If you want to repair them yourself, Eric Ebinger provides instructions:

Materials needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dry sandpaper, 220 grit
<LI>Walthers Goo (available at finer model train stores everywhere)
<LI>One or more <CITE>Wheel of Time</CITE> books, Tor edition, with 
loose or detached covers
</UL>
<OL>
<LI>If cover(s) are not yet completely detached, <em>gently</em> and carefully detach them.  A small, sharp knife may be
helpful.
<LI>Take sandpaper, and briskly sand the back of spine of the book (on the glue that failed to hold).  Continue
until the surface is slightly rough (don't over-sand).  This should only take 10-20 seconds of sanding.
<LI>Lay the cover down on a flat surface, with the outside <em>down</em>.  Gently sand the inside of the binding (where
the spine of the book would be, if the book were still in its cover), until the wax coating is removed.  Do not
over-sand!  The objective is to remove the wax coating, so that the glue can get a grip.
<LI>Following directions on the package of Goo, spread glue on the binding area of the cover.  Orient the book
so that its orientation matches that of the cover.  Press the book binding down on the cover, lift, wait two
minutes, press the book binding back down on the cover, and hold for two minutes.
<LI>Let dry overnight.  The book should be better than new.
