<h2>Verin's suspicious behavior</h2>
Throughout the series, Verin Mathwin has demonstrated more than her fair
share of suspicious behavior. Clearly, Something is Up with her. Is she
Black Ajah, or is it something else?
<P>
1) VERINISM: In TGH, Verin tells the boys that Moiraine sent her to look
after them: [TGH: 14, Wolfbrother, 195] "Moiraine Sedai sent me, Lord
Ingtar," Verin announced with a satisfied smile. "She thought you
might need me." Moiraine later says that she did NOT send Verin: [TGH:
49, What was Meant To Be, 572] "I did not send Verin." Moiraine
frowned. "She did that on her own." It is pretty obvious that
Moiraine is not BA, so that implies that Verin lied, and hence must be
BA.
<P>
EXPLANATION: Verin could have been tricked by somebody masquerading as
Moiraine. Or, perhaps she managed to find an
interpretation of her words that could be taken as the
truth. (Moiraine wanted somebody to watch over you guys, but she
couldn't be here...) Now, MAYBE Verin is using some sneaky thought
process to get around the Oath: '"Moiraine Sedai sent me, Lord
Ingtar," Verin announced with a satisfied smile (recalling how
satisfying the beer and pizza Moiraine had sent her for had been,
and also how satisfying it had been to come up with a literally
true statement which would preclude any questions from Rand,
et. al.)' [Edward Measure]
<P>
Here is a bit in [TGH: 7, Blood Calls Blood, 87], which might well
offer an explanation: Moiraine remarks to Verin, "Then we must find
the dagger, Sister.  Agelmar is sending men to hunt those who took the
Horn and slew his oathmen, the same who took the dagger.  If one is
found, the other will be." Verin could have been engaging in her usual
word-twisting to come up with "Moiraine sent me." It is not so clear
how one gets "She thought you might need me" out of that-- maybe she
was referring to the AS speculation that Mat would die quickly if he
didn't get the dagger back, and so he might need more healing. [John
Novak]

<P>
In [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive Appearances, 39-41], we learn that Verin
has worked out a subtle form of Compulsion which conveniently leaves
the victim forgetful of their "session" with Verin. Perhaps Verin
compelled Moiraine to send her. "Moiraine Sedai sent me (because I
made her), Lord Ingtar." [Tony Evans]
<P>
At a signing in Atlanta, RJ said that this discrepancy is not a
mis-step.
<P>
2) VERINISM: Verin does not give Corianin's notes to Egwene along with
the dream ring [TDR: 21, A World of Dreams, 187]. Maybe she wanted
Egwene to get killed, or caught by some Forsaken?
<P>
EXPLANATION: Four reasons that Verin wouldn't want to show the manuscript
to Egwene: 1) Verin is afraid that Egwene would not continue if she
knew how dangerous it is. 2) Verin is afraid that Egwene would not
continue if she knew who or what must be sacrificed. 3) The very
nature of prophecy requires that it be vague or kept secret. 4) Maybe
Verin was afraid that <em>Egwene</em> was a Darkfriend. Also, note
that she <em>considered</em> giving the notes to Egwene, but decided
not to. If she was withholding the notes for a nefarious purpose, she
wouldn't have even considered it.
<P>
3) VERINISM: Her suspicious behavior in the Two Rivers: a) Misleads Perrin
as to why she and Alanna are there [TSR: 31, Assurances, 345-6].
b) Tells Perrin not to trust Alanna, perhaps laying a false trail?
[TSR: 33, A New Weave in the Pattern, 373]. c) She also knows Luc
is the missing Lord Luc, Tigraine's brother who disappeared in the
Blight. She knows he is mentioned in the Dark Prophecy, yet she does
not warn anyone about him, or tell them who he is?
<P>
EXPLANATION: a) and b) are typical Aes Sedai behavior. Furthermore, since
Alanna had recently lost a Warder, Verin may have been worried that
she would try to bond Perrin, as she later did to Rand. As for c)...
<P>
4) VERINISM: Only three characters have referred to Perrin's choice of
hammer or axe: Ishamael, Lanfear and Verin. This puts Verin in very
suspicious company.
<P>
EXPLANATION: Verin is Brown Ajah, and thus is likely to know all sorts of
obscure things. Perhaps there is a prophecy involving blacksmiths,
hammers, and axes. (Also note that the above statement is somewhat
false: Egwene also knows about the hammer/axe choice. She dreamed it.)
<P>
5) VERINISM: She was observed in deep conversation with Barthanes, a known
Darkfriend, at the party in [TGH: 33, A Message From the Dark,
397]. When Hurin approached them, Verin waved him away. Perhaps they
were discussing "business matters?"
<P>
EXPLANATION: No, they were just talking about the weather/politics/etc and
Verin didn't want some Shienaran servant butting into her conversation;
it wouldn't look right and might make Barthanes suspicious.
<P>
6) VERINISM: In [TFoH: 53, Fading Words, 638] Moiraine mentions to Rand in her
last letter not to trust Alviarin, who is definitely a Darkfriend, and
Verin. Additionally, Siuan mentions that Verin never told her about
giving Egwene a ter'angreal.
<P>
EXPLANATION: The former is just an exercise in contrasts. Moiraine is saying:
"Don't trust ANYBODY. You are rightly suspicious of Alviarin, but you
should be equally suspicious of those you think you can trust, like Verin."
As for the latter, why should she tell SS?
<P>
7) VERINISM: Draghkar Attack on Moiraine [TGH: 22, Watchers, 278-9] was executed
at least with Aes Sedai help (the warding on them so they couldn't be
sensed). Moiraine seemed to think that pretty much everyone in the
Tower had forgotten about these old hermit Aes Sedai. However, we do
know one individual old enough to remember them who could have ordered
the attack --Verin.
<P>
EXPLANATION: This is totally wimpy speculation, and wouldn't even be
here, except that somebody might bring it up again. Liandrin (known
BA) could have easily followed Moiraine there, and one of the sisters
may be BA. (<A HREF="../../1_dark/1.4_whats-up-dark/1.4.8_ispan-whodunnit.html">See section
1.4.8</A>.)
<P>
8) VERINISM: Verin and the art of Stedding Channeling: in [TGH: 29, Among the
Elders, 435], she inspects an Ogier who lost his mind to Machin Shin in
the Ways. For all intents and purposes, it looks like she's Delving
him with the OP. However, she is in a stedding, where touching the OP
is impossible. Even more, nobody thinks this is weird!
<P>
EXPLANATION? Possibly, she didn't do the OP thing; she did something
else to see if there was anybody home. Maybe she spat in his eye, or
something. At a post-ACOS signing [Vancouver, 24 August, 1996], RJ
told Lara Beaton that "we're going to find out something in the next
few books about people without souls and characteristics of them. (he
started out saying that we're going to find out something significant
about Verin, then stopped)."
<P>
In the Prologue of TPOD, we get a scene which is from Verin's point of
view. At several points in that section, Verin uses clever thought
processes and tricks of the tongue to avoid telling untruths. This is
consistent with what one would expect of an AS bound by the First Oath.
Now, any intelligent BA would get into the habit of following the Oath as a
matter of course, because being caught lying could lead to the discovery of
the BA. However, consider the bit in [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive
Appearances, 41], when Beldeine comes out of the Compulsion-trance. She
asks Verin if she fainted. Verin replies, "The heat is very bad. I have
felt lightheaded myself once or twice today." Then, in her own mind, she
thinks that her own lightheadedness was "from weariness, not heat.
Handling that much of saidar took it out of you." If Verin is not bound by
the first Oath, she should not have needed to justify that misleading
statement <em>to herself</em>. It's not something that anybody could ever
have found out about, and is utterly trivial, besides. On the other hand,
it might simply be a habit, especially if she turned BA after having been
AS for a long time. However, Verin's self-justifications do seem to
indicate that she is bound by the First Oath, and is not Black Ajah (just
very dark Brown).
<h2>Alternative Verin Speculations</h2>
<P>
1) Something in those Notes Theory: We know Verin had access to Corianin
Nedeal's notes. There is something in those notes that Verin doesn't want
anybody to know about, something so potentially dangerous that she'd
consider destroying the notes and all the knowledge contained therein.
What if, in those notes, Corianin Nedeal describes how she discovered how
to break the Three Oaths in T'A'R? That would certainly explain why she
wouldn't want Eg to have the notes, especially after her speech at the
start of TDR about how important the Oaths are. This would also explain
how she managed to lie about Moiraine sending her. However, Verin's mental
self-justifications in [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive Appearances, 41] seem to
indicate that she is bound by the First Oath, as noted above. However,
who knows what eldrich knowledge is contained in the notes? Who knows what
Verin saw when she tried out the ter'angreal to go to T'A'R? This could
explain all sorts of Verinisms.
<P>
2) Verin == Corianin Theory: Verin is Corianin Nedeal herself, and is
thus very, very, old. That is how she got her hands on the ring
ter'angreal. Problem: In [TDR: 21, A World of Dreams, 191], Verin
is thinking on Nedeal's notes, and thinks of Nedeal in the third
person. One doesn't usually refer to oneself in the third person.
Another problem (which is also present in related Very Old Verin (VOV)
theories is that if there was a 400+ year-old Aes Sedai lurking around
the Tower, surely somebody would have noticed by now. Furthermore,
Verin is probably not older than 300 years (see below), and thus
cannot be Corianin.
<P>
3) Second Foundation Ajah Theory (aka Purple Ajah Theory): Verin is a
member of a secret society whose members preserve ancient knowledge for
humanity's need at the Last Battle. The existence of the BA shows that it
is possible for a secret group to exist in the Tower-- if there is a group
dedicated to evil, why not a group dedicated to good? Problem: there have
always been rumors of the BA. Nothing can be kept secret for centuries in a
place with so many people in it, and so much scheming as the White Tower.
And yet, we've never heard any hint of this secret group.
<P>
4) Very Old Verin: Verin is very, very old, and pre-dates the lying
Oath, and is thus not bound to it. This theory has been proposed as
part of various Second Foundation Ajah theories, Corianin Nedeal
theories, as well as independently. Problem: Verin would have to be
1000+ years old. We have seen no evidence, even in the AoL, that
<em>anybody</em> lives that long, without help from the DO. Plus, wouldn't
anybody notice that Verin had outlived dozens of Amyrlin Seats?
Furthermore, the upper bound on Verin's age (see below) is ~300. This
is not old enough for her to date from a pre-OR time.
<h2>How old is Verin?</h2>
<P>
Many pet theories hinge upon this question. From [LOC: 11, Lessons and
Teachers, 207], we know that Verin has been working on some plan for
about 70 years. This sets a lower bound on Verin's age. The only other
possible clue is [LOC: 43, The Crown of Roses, 549]. Merana Sedai is
considering the pecking order among the AS in Caemlyn: "Merana had
been Aes Sedai ten years the day the midwife laid Alanna at her
mother's breast...Verin was the problem...Five years as novice for
each, six as Accepted; that was one thing every Aes Sedai knew about
every other if she knew nothing else. The difference was that Verin
was older, maybe almost as much older than she as she was older than
Alanna." We know that the Tower doesn't take women much older than Ny
for Novices, and an average novice starts at about the age Elayne and
Egwene did (17-18). For the Very Old Verin folks, lets say both Merana
and Verin started late-- 24 (Ny was an exception, they only took
her because she was so strong). So if Alanna is about 70 (in [TPOD: 12,
New Alliances, 276], Cadsuane thinks that Alanna has "worn the shawl almost
forty years"), Merana is 24 + 11 years training + 10 years as full
AS = 45 years older than Alanna, that is, 150 years old. If Verin is as
much older than Merana as Merana is older than Alanna, then Verin is
150 + 45 = 195 years old. So if Merana is right about how much older
Verin is than she, Verin cannot be much older than 195 years.
<P>
More than once, Cadsuane Melaidhrin is described as "the
oldest Aes Sedai." In [ACOS: Glossary, 671], is says she is "thought
to have been born around 705 NE," which would make her around 300
years old. She's also the most powerful AS apart from El, Eg, and Ny,
which means she will have gotten maximum amount life-prolonging benefits of
channelling. In spite of this, she is at the end of her life [ACOS:
19, Diamonds and Stars], so it is reasonable to believe that AS who
are bound by the Oath Rod don't get much older than Cadsuane. If the
glossary is to be believed, that is about 300 years. By implication,
this puts an upper bound on Verin's age. (Assuming that the Ageless
look is caused by the Oath Rod- -Verin is Ageless.)
<P>
<h2>Is Verin bound by the Oath Rod?</h2>
The evidence in ACOS and TPOD tells us that the Ageless Look is caused by
being bound by the Oath Rod. (<A HREF="../2.3_one-power/2.3.03_oath-rod.html">See section 2.3.3.</A>) Without a
doubt, Verin has the Ageless Look [TGH: 7, Blood Calls Blood, 87]. The
conclusion is, then, that Verin is bound by the Oath Rod. Note that this
means that Verin has taken at least one Oath on the Rod. She may have
found a way to get around the First Oath, but didn't wish to free herself
from the second or third. Maybe she even discovered that the Oath Rod
could be used to release oaths taken on one [ACOS: 40, Spears, 631].
<P>
Furthermore, in [aol.com Chat, 27-6-96], RJ just about said straight
out that Verin has held the Oath Rod. Somebody asked if it was true if
he'd said that Verin had NOT held it, and if so then did Cadsuane also
avoid it. His answer: "No, I did *not* say that Verin had never held
the Oath Rod. Cadsuane has also held the Oath Rod." Cadsuane has ALSO
held it, implying that Verin has, as well.
<P>
<h2>Is there a connection between Cadsuane and Verin?</h2>
Both Verin and Cadsuane are from Far Madding. (Verin: [TPOD: Prologue,
Deceptive Appearances, 42], Cadsuane: [TPOD: 12, New Alliances, 273], and
RJ said at a post-POD signing [LA: 22 October, 1998. Report by Pam Basham.]
that they were from Far Madding. This raises immediate suspicions of some
sort of Far Madding Secret Society. However, in [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive
Appearances, 30], Verin thinks about Cadsuane: "What was Cadsuane after?
... Cadsuane herself was a legend, and even the believable parts of the
legend made her very dangerous indeed. Dangerous and unpredictable." This
indicates that Verin doesn't know Cads. very well, and is wary of her. It
seems unlikely that Verin and Cadsuane are in cahoots, or have been in the
past.
