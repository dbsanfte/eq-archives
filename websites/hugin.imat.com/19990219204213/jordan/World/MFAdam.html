<H1>What's up with male-female a'dam linkages?  Why do they die screaming?</H1>
<HR>
<P>
In <CITE>TGH: 40, 573, Damane, 484</CITE>, Egwene's sul'dam describes how the Empress
will sometimes make a man wear the bracelet of the a'dam.  Sometimes nothing
happens, and sometimes "both die, screaming."  We see something similar
happen in <CITE>TFoH: 32, 522, A Short Spear, 370</CITE> when Rand tries to free the
damane in Seanchan.  What's happening here?  Well, it seems as if the men who
are affected by the a'dam are those who can channel, or who have the ability
to learn.  According to Elayne's study of the a'dam, it works by creating an
uneven link between channelers, in which the bracelet holder has complete
control.

<P>
So possible explanations for the "die screaming" effect are:<BR>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a male and a female are linked, with the man in control.  A female must control such a link due to the
nature of the OP.  So the a'dam link is backwards, which could have a bad effect.
<LI>Possibly, they find themselves each touching the wrong half of the Source, and cannot stand to do this,
and consequently experience immense pain and have their pitiful lives snuffed out by the overbearing power of
the wrong half of the OP pouring through their frail bodies.
<LI>Putting a male in the a'dam link somehow creates a "short circuit" in the One Power, frying both
participants in the link unless they break it pronto.
</UL>
