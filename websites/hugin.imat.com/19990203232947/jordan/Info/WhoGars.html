<H1>Who are Aran'gar and Osan'gar?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="WhoGars.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
We've been told since <CITE>TEotW</CITE> that the DO is Lord of the Grave. It is
about time he started acting it.  In <CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First
Message, 59-61</CITE>, we see "Aran'gar" and "Osan'gar," two minions of the
Shadow brought back from the dead and put into new bodies. It is a
good first approximation to assume that they are reincarnated
Forsaken, and not some random Dreadlords.  After all, if the DO is
going to bring people back to life, why not Choose the strongest of
his servants?  So, what Forsaken are available for reincarnation (i.e.,
are dead)?  Aginor and Balthamel, the Terrible Two from the <CITE>TEotW</CITE>
finale, Ishamael, Rahvin and Be'lal, and possibly Asmodean and
Lanfear.  Well, Rahvin and Be'lal died of balefire, and their souls
are beyond the reach of even the DO.  Asmodean was a traitor, and the
DO apparently lumps him in with Rahvin as having "Died the final
death" (<CITE>LoC: Prologue, The First Message, 15</CITE>), so it probably wasn't
him.
</P>
<P>
Aran'gar is not Lanfear, because of Osan'gar's statement "Lanfear
seemed cautious in contrast [to Aran'gar]."  Furthermore, Osan'gar
cannot be Lanfear because his Forsaken-name had been "given in scorn
and adopted in pride."  Lanfear was the only Forsaken to have chosen
her own nom de guèrre. Finally, when Osan'gar tries to channel, he
naturally reaches for <EM>saidin, not saidar</EM>. This leaves us with
Aginor, Balthamel, and Ishamael.
</P>
<P>
Now, Ishamael was not bound like the other Forsaken during the Third
Age.  He was "partly bound," or maybe not even bound at all. There are
references to this throughout the series, starting with the prologue
to <CITE>TEotW</CITE>, where Ishamael appears to LTT during the Time of Madness
(chronologically <em>after</em> the sealing of the Bore). However, Osan'gar
makes reference to "waking from the long sleep" with an aged body.
The long sleep is obviously the time spent sealed between the universe
and the DO's dungeon dimension. Thus, Osan'gar must be either Aginor
or Balthamel.  As to which one, all we really have to go on is his
comment on having helped make the Trollocs and not liking the Halfmen
who were an unexpected effect of that experiment. We know that Aginor
was very involved in creating the various Shadowspawn, and that he was
unnerved by Fades, spending lots of time trying to discover how they
"fade."  So, if we have to choose one or the other for Osan'gar, I'll
say he was Aginor.
</P>
<P>
Now for Aran'gar:  She is extremely upset at being put into a woman's
body, and Osan'gar thinks it is a "fine joke."  From <CITE>TEotW</CITE>, we know
that Balthamel enjoyed "the pleasures of the flesh."  That is to say,
he was a real lecher.  Thus, it would be a great joke to put him in a
female body.  Furthermore, it is stated that Aran'gar was always
rather rash.  I really wouldn't classify Ishamael as "rash," not with
his centuries of careful planning.  So, it is a good bet that Aran'gar
was Balthamel.
</P>
<P>
Still, it is not 100% certain; we don't have enough
evidence to narrow it down to which of the two is Aginor and which is
Balthamel for certain, and, even though Ishamael probably isn't either
of the two, I would bet that he has been reincarnated in a similar
fashion, perhaps as <a HREF="Mystery.html#Moridin">Moridin</a>.
</P>
<P>
Here is a further hint that Osan'gar and Aran'gar are Aginor and
Balthamel: "Some of us are bound no longer.  The seals weaken, Aes
Sedai.  Like Ishamael, we walk the world again, and soon the rest of
us will come.  I was too close to this world in my captivity, I and
Balthamel, too close to the grinding of the Wheel, but soon the Great
Lord of the Dark will be free, <EM>and give us new flesh</EM>..." (emphasis
mine). (<CITE>TEotW: ?, 748, Meetings at the Eye, ? REF?</CITE>)
