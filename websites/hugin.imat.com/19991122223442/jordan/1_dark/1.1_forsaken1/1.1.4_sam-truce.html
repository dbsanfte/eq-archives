1) Andris died in a pool of blood, delivering the message to Sammael that
there would be no truce. Sammael lied to Graendal. Why would Sammael lie?
All the Forsaken want to be Nae'blis. All the Forsaken think that Rand
stands a chance at becoming Nae'blis if he caves to the Dark One.
Therefore, all the Forsaken want Rand dead. The Dark One, on the other
hand, most explicitly does <em>not</em> want Rand dead. He will punish any
Forsaken who kills Rand. Therefore, all the Forsaken want to make the
other Forsaken paranoid enough to bump Rand off on their own. This
eliminates <em>two</em> contenders to the title of Nae'blis-- Rand, and
whichever idiot kills him.
<P>
2) Andris died in a pool of blood, delivering the message to Sammael that
there would be a truce because someone else intervened to put Sammael off
his guard while Rand readies his counter-stroke from Tear and the Plains of
Maredo. Someone who knew that Sammael's emissary was meeting with Rand at
that moment. Who was present? Bashere, a Saldaean named Hamad, some Aiel,
and Aviendha. The evidence against this option is that Rand should have
been able to feel another man channelling or have experienced goosebumps if
a woman channelled, and Sammael's thoughts about manipulating Graendal
[LOC: 23, To Understand A Message, 349] don't make sense if he isn't lying.
