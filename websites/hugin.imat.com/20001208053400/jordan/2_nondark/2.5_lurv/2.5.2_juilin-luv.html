<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.5.2: Who is Juilin's honey?</h1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Michael Gonzalez, Korda]</P>

<P>
From [ACOS: Glossary, 675]:
<blockquote>
"Juilin Sandar - A thief-catcher from Tear. A man in love with
perhaps the very last woman he would ever have thought he could be."
</blockquote>
So, who is it? People have suggested an Aes Sedai, Nynaeve, Birgitte,
etc. However, there is only one idea backed by any demonstration of
tender feelings on Juilin's part: ex-Panarch Amathera of Tarabon:
<P>
We know from [ACOS: 14, White Plumes, 273], as well as other
places, that Juilin does not like nobles, so a high noble of some sort
might seem to be the last person he would think he'd fall in love
with.
<P>
How about some quotes?
<UL>
<LI>[ACOS, 14, White Plumes, 274] "Tarabon must be terrible now for a
woman not used to taking care of herself," Juilin murmured.
<LI>Going back to the group's trip away from Tarabon, [tFoH: 9, A Signal,
146], we have:
<P>
Nynaeve: "Amathera was difficult, but I do not wish her any harm.
Do you?"
<P>
Juilin: "A pretty woman, especially in one of those Taraboner
serving girl's dresses, with a pretty smile. I thought
she...." (shuts up when Elayne shoots him a dirty look.)
</UL>
<P>
So, it looks like Amathera's the woman. It just happens that Amathera
could do with some rescuing at the moment, and is in the same city as
Juilin (Ebou Dar), and is wearing a dress that Juilin would <em>really</em>
like to see her in! :)
