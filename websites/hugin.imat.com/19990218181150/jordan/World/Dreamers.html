<H1>What do Dreamers do?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by:Emma Pease</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Entering T'A'R.  We know that regular people can do this though are
not usually aware that they are doing so.  At times the forsaken seem
to pull people into T'A'R (the dreams the boys have in EoTW for
instance).  Also Dem thinks when he sees Elayne in T'A'R (LoC) that
she has a ter'angreal of the sort the AoL used to teach students how
to enter T'A'R.  My guess is this skill can be taught to any AS and
perhaps to anyone.

<LI>Entering other people's dreams.  This is what Egwene does with
Gawyn's dream and also the skill the Wise Ones use to pass messages
around.  This does seem to be specific to 'dreamers'.

<LI>Foreseeing via dreams. This can also be done by Wolfbrothers.
