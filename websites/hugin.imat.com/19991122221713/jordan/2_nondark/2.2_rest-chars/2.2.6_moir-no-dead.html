<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.2.6: How do we know that Moiraine is not dead?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
Well, we don't know what happened after Moiraine and Lanfear fell through the
twisted doorway into the land of the Foxes. We do have various visions
that imply that she will return. These are: Egwene's vision [TFoH: 15,
What Can Be Learned in Dreams, 214] of Thom pulling Moiraine's blue jewel
out of a fire, and Min's comment in [ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 543] that
Rand would fail without "a woman who was dead and gone," which almost
certainly refers to Moir., and her comment in [ACOS: 35, Into
the Woods, 546] that "Moiraine was the only viewing of hers that had ever
failed." She must have had one or more viewings about Moir. that were not
fulfilled, and since WE know that Min is never wrong, then Moiraine will
almost certainly return at some point.
<P>
One piece of evidence which points to her possible death is the breaking of
her bond with Lan. However, we know from [TPOD: Prologue, Deceptive
Appearances, 28] that "being stilled snapped [an AS's bond to her Warder]
as surely as death. One of Irgain's two apparently had fallen over dead
from the shock, and the other had died trying to kill thousands of Aiel
without making any effort to escape." (Irgain is one of the AS stilled when
Rand escaped from the box in LOC.) This quote shows that stilling an AS has the
same effect on her Warder as her death. Thus, Lan's reaction only indicates
that his bond was "snapped," by death, stilling, or something else.
<P>
Besides stilling, the breaking of Lan's bond could conceivably have been
caused by the shutting off of the Red Door into Finnland. When Moiraine
chastises Rand and Mat for using the Tear doorway in [TSR: 15, Into the
Doorway, 178-9], she says, "One of you would have been bad enough, but two
<em>ta'veren</em> at once - you might have torn the connection entirely and been
trapped there." If one substitutes "channelling combatants" for
"ta'veren," one has a description of what happened when Moiraine and
Lanfear went through the door. The "tearing" of the connection between the
two universes may have torn the connection between Moiraine and Lan, as
well.
<P>
In [LoC: Glossary, entry "Moiraine", 710], it says "She vanished into
a ter'angreal in Cairhien while battling Lanfear, apparently killing
both herself and the Forsaken." That "apparently" definitely leaves
the question open.
<P>
Furthermore, she has a "small shred of hope" before attacking Lanfear,
so there IS hope for her future. This "small shred" is probably a
glimpse that Moir. got of her future from a source other than the
Rhuidean rings, either from Min or the Red Door in Tear.
