<h1 align="center">2.4.6: Who or what was (the) Tamyrlin?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In [TEOTW: Prologue, Dragonmount, xi], Ishy visits LTT after he kills
his family: 'Elan Morin grimaced. "Look at you," he said scornfully.
"Once you stood first among the Servants. Once you wore the Ring of
Tamyrlin, and sat in the High Seat. Once you summoned the Nine Rods of
Dominion. Now look at you!"'
<P>
It's probably not too much of a stretch to assume that the term "Amyrlin"
derives from "Tamyrlin." The "Ring of Tamyrlin" was, after all, worn by
the last leader of the AOL Aes Sedai before the Breaking of the World
began. However, we have no idea of who or what "Tamyrlin" meant to the
AOLers. One idea is that "Tamyrlin" was a person, perhaps some historical
figure who was the original owner of the Ring. Another idea is that
"Tamyrlin" was another word for the First Among Servants (the leader of
the AOL AS). In either case, it is likely that the Ring was a badge of
office for the First Among Servants, rather than LTT's personal property.
Otherwise, Ishy would not have mocked LTT with it.
