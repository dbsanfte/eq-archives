"By the Light and my hope of salvation and rebirth, I swear to serve you
in whatever way you require for as long as you require, or may the Creator's
face turn from me forever and darkness consume my soul." (<CITE>TFoH: 1, 51, Fanning The Sparks, 39</CITE>)

Yes, but not much.  It is pretty secular.  It may be closer to many
pagan religions or in some cases to Judaism rather than Christianity.
However, like x'ty, there is a dualism between the light and the creator
who are often spoken of separately and together. Like Judaism, burials
are as simple as possible to encourage return to the earth. (<CITE>TGH: 10, 178,
The Hunt Begins, 151</CITE>) Like the religions of old merry England, the maypole
is a fertility ritual. (<CITE>TEotW: 1, 10, An Empty Road, 8-9</CITE>) Like Catholicism,
children are taught catechism <CITE>TEotW: 1, 14, An Empty Road, 12</CITE>.  Wisdoms
act as priestesses. Like Judaism, marriage is a public announcement to the
community. (<CITE>TSR: 53, 890-1, The Price of Departure, 618</CITE>)

This does not even begin to touch on the religious aspects of the Aes Sedai.
They have novices (like nuns), they are considered to be 'servants of all',
the rituals of acceptance and joining the sisterhood are rigid with
many religious overtones.  They are expected to serve the Light and the
will of the creator when they join the Aes Sedai.  They are almost Buddhist
in certain ways: in particular the view of the time serpent, the wheel of
time and the age lace. The Children of Light are another religious
organization, in this case a religious organization in turmoil with
inappropriate goals and methods.  Finally, we have the Tinkers, a religious
cult more or less who follow the early  Xtian/Calvinist 'Way of the Leaf', a
cross between pacifism and acceptance of fate (<CITE>TEotW: 27, 412, Shelter from
the Storm, 346</CITE>).  (<CITE>Contributed by: Erica Sadun</CITE>)

OTOH, in Randland, the Creator <EM>is</EM>. The DO <EM>is</EM>. No one disbelieves
in their existence; they are <EM>there</EM>. They are far more concrete and present
in everyday life than our God(s) is/are in our lives. If you cross the Blight
to Shayol Ghul, you will find a mountain with a hole in its side and evil
leaking out. Thus, many of the rituals and other trappings of <EM>organized</EM>
religion are unnecessary in Randland. Just because we don't see worship going
on very often doesn't mean it's not being done. Scratch a Randlander, and
you'll find a quite religious person 9 times out of 10, would be my guess.
There just isn't quite the need to formalize it the way we do, except on
occasions which, by their nature, are already formal... i.e. funerals,
weddings, harvest, etc. Just my humble opinion. (<CITE>Contributed by: Jocelyn</CITE>)

Randlanders pray to the Creator for favors, such as relief from the drought.
