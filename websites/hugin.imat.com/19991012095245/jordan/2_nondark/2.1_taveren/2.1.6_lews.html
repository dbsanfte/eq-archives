<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.1.6: Is LTT for Real, or is Rand Insane? Where did
LTT go in ACOS?</h1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Carolyn Fusinato, Korda]</P>
<HR>
<P>
So, Rand is hearing voices. Is Lews Therin a real entity, or is he a
product of Rand's taint-maddened imagination?
<P>
<h2>What is the cause of the "LTT problem"?</h2>
<h3>Option 1: Two minds are better than one</h3>
One idea is that two minds inhabit Rand's body; Rand and LTT. This seems to
be supported by Min's vision of [ACOS: 33, A Bath, 526] in which Rand and
another man touched and merged into one another. Rand certainly takes it
that way (which should alert the cynical reader to the distinct possibility
that this is probably the <em>wrong</em> interpretation :). This theory
implies that Rand is relatively sane still and his problems can be
attributed to stress, paranoia, fear and another mind trying to take him
over and that Lews is completely insane.
<P>
However, it doesn't make much sense for LTT to be talking to Rand. If we
look at the other people who have lived past lives, we don't see this
happening. Mat's memories of his past life/lives (if those are really his
past lives) are integrated into his own personality. Same with
Birgitte-- she doesn't talk to "Maerion," she says she was once called
Maerion. Furthermore, rebirth happens often to important souls. That is
the way the Pattern works. If everybody who was reborn had the voice of
their last incarnation nattering at them, reborn people would be widely
known, but not as heroes-- as deranged lunatics. As Rand's case shows, it's
hard to be sane when there's a dead person in your head claiming he owns
your body! So, LTT's presence cannot be a simple consequence of Rand being
a reborn person.
<P>
If LTT <EM>is</EM> a separate entity, it could imply that Rand is just some poor
sod who happened to be born into the same body that LTT was reborn into,
and that not Rand, but LTT is the actual Dragon Reborn. OTOH, it was
<EM>Rand</EM> who pulled the Sword that Ain't, not LTT; he hadn't even shown up
then. There is only one case in which we definitely know that two entities
coexist in one body: the Fain-Mordeth combo, and they are melding into a
single entity over time. (The Gars don't count, because there is only one
mind in the body. Slayer doesn't count, because we have no evidence that
any of Luc's consciousness survives. In fact, in TAR, we see only Isam.)
However, this wasn't a rebirth.
<P>
This theory also neglects to explain the fact that there is no
manifestation of LTT prior to Rand channelling, and that the "LTT problem"
has gotten worse over time. Furthermore, LTT wasn't crazy when he died.
Ishamael had healed him with the TP, in order to torment him. However, the
LTT in Rand's head is definitely loony.
<P>
Another argument against this, proposed by Joseph Rosenfeld, is that,
if the Dragon has been reborn over and over through all time (as
claimed by Ish and others), there must have been <EM>other</EM> "dragons"
before LTT. Why, then, is only Lews Therin Telamon Kinslayer, the Age
of Legends version of the Dragon, inhabiting Rand's head? Why not a
whole committee? Counter to this, also suggested by Mr. Rosenfeld:
maybe LTT is the easiest to access because he was the most recent.
If Rand tried really hard, he could maybe contact the 1st Age Dragon,
and the previous 7th Age one, etc.
<P>
<h3>Option 2: It's the Taint, Stupid!</h3>
Another alternative is that the LTT personality is the manifestation of
Rand's encroaching insanity. "...everybody has been telling him he is Lews
Therin reborn, so he starts perceiving Lews Therin is in his head. Not
only that, but he finds the voice responds to him. Now he's trying to
carry on conversations with this voice. It all seems logical to us, but
then it seems logical (sort of) to Rand, as well. I found myself thinking
he should tell somebody he was hearing a voice in his head. When I thought
how absurd this sounded, it struck me that I had been fooled into thinking
Rand was still completely sane." [James Beavens] Then, there is also, "He
raised the point that Rand's creeping insanity may manifest in much more
subtle ways than the people of Randland expect..." (from Emmet O'Brien's
account of Jordan's talk at Trinity College in Dublin in 1993).
<P>
This theory is supported by Cadsuane's statement that "some men who can
channel begin to hear voices....It is part of the madness. Voices
conversing with them, telling them what to do." [ACOS: 18, As the Plow
Breaks the Earth, 331] If we assume Dashiva is not a Forsaken, but just a
crazy channeller (see section 1.2.2), then Dashiva's reaction to
Cadsuane's statement, as well as some of his other behaviour, seem to
support it.
<P>
On the other hand, this doesn't take into account that "LTT" knows
things that Rand could never have known on his own--stuff about the
AoL, the Forsaken, channelling, etc.
<P>
<h3>Option 1.5: A little bit of both</h3>
Both the "rebirth" explanation and the "taint" explanation have points in
their favor. Both theories have problems, too. The rebirth theory
explains why Rand knows things, via LTT, which he couldn't possibly have
known on his own--things about channelling techniques, about the Forsaken,
and about life in the AOL. However, the voice cannot be solely due to
rebirth, because other reborn people don't have the problem, and Rand has
presumably been LTT Reborn all his life, and he's only started hearing
voices recently. The Taint theory, on the other hand, explains how Rand's
LTT problem correlates with Rand's channelling, and has gotten worse as
Rand has channelled more and more. Not to mention, hearing voices <EM>is</EM>
generally considered a sign of mental illness, and Rand channels so much
that he should be affected by the Taint in some way.
<P>
It seems likely that the LTT voice is due partially to the Taint, and
partially to the fact that Rand is LTT reborn. The big question is,
<em>how</em> are the two factors combining to produce the LTT effect? One
possibility is that the memories and knowledge expressed by LTT are some
sort of past-life leakage, real effects of being somebody Reborn, but the
actual LTT personality is not a separate entity, but something Rand's
subconscious constructed. Another possibility is that the Taint has a
special effect on some reborn people. Perhaps the Taint breaks down
barriers in one's mind between the present life and past lives/a past life,
and causes the past to intrude upon the present's mind, until the past
personality actually takes over. Note that this would explain a lot about
Dashiva, who appears to have many of the same mental problems which Rand
does, but in a more advanced state.
<P>
<h3>Option Three: From the loony bin.</h3>
(This is way out in left field, IMO, but some people do believe it, so
I'll mention it.) There IS a voice in Rand's head, but it is NOT LTT, or
Rand being crazy. Rather, it is the result of some skullduggery on the
part of the Shadow to infiltrate Rand's brain. Variations on this theme
have been Mesaana (disproved by her actual appearance in LOC), Ishamael,
and maybe others.
<P>
<h2>Where did LTT go in ACOS?</h2>
An interesting thing to note is that, as soon as Cadsuane mentions hearing
voices, in [ACOS: 18, As the Plow Breaks the Earth, 331] "LTT" stops
talking to Rand. Another thing to note is that Cadsuane channelled while
making that statement. The obvious thing she did was fetching the teapot
to her, but it is possible that she used the channelling of the teapot to
disguise something else she did. Furthermore, the voice reappeared in
TPOD. So, we're left with the questions of why did LTT go away? Was it
something Cadsuane did? Did he go away of his own volition (was he in
hiding)? Did Rand subconsciously suppress him? Why did he come back?
Also, what do his disappearance and reappearance signify?
