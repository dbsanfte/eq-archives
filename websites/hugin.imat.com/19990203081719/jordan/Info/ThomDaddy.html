<H1>Why Thom may have fathered Elayne and/or Garyn</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="ThomDaddy.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Elayne denies that Galad is her brother.  Thom was around at the right time.
Thom clearly had something to do with Taringail's disappearance. Thom was
Morgase's lover. In <CITE>TFoH: 19, 356, Memories, 252</CITE>, Morgase thinks about
Taringail, and how the only good to come of the marriage were "two beautiful
children."  This could be Elayne and Gawyn, or she could mean Galad (adopted)
and Gawyn.
</P>
<P>
Evidence from the Glossary: "A Royal Prince of Cairhien, he married
Tigraine and <EM>fathered</EM> Galadedrid.  When Tigraine disappeared and was
declared dead, he married Morgase and <EM>fathered</EM> Elayne and Gawyn." (<CITE>TEotW: Glossary, 787,
entry "Damodred, Prince Taringail", 661</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
In <CITE>TSR: 17, 277, Deceptions, 194</CITE>, Moiraine says Thom was "Morgase's lover
for a time, <EM>after Taringail died</EM>" (emphasis mine). Here, Moiraine
is trying to impress Thom with how much she knows. She wouldn't
include a detail she had any doubt about.  To be wrong about something
in such a situation would indicate faulty research, and Moiraine would
not risk showing any gap in her knowledge. If she had any doubt at
all, she wouldn't have mentioned the timing of events. Plus, Thom
didn't say or think anything to contradict Moiraine's statement.
</P>
<P>
If Morgase had been having an affair with Thom while still married to
Taringail, it is very unlikely that she would have been able to keep it
entirely under wraps; surely some rumor would have been around, especially
in Cairhien.  However, we see no evidence of such a rumor existing.
Specifically, in <CITE>LoC: 50, Thorns, 628</CITE>, when Rand mentions to some
Cairhienin that he means to have Elayne rule Cairhien, the Cairhienin
think she'd be a good choice, due to her descent from her father, Taringail
Damodred. Somebody says something like "Taringail's greatest dream was for
his son to be king of Cairhien, and his daughter to be queen of Andor." If
Morgase were unfaithful, surely there would have been some doubt as to
Elayne's right to the throne of Cairhien.
</P>
<P>
In a report from a signing in Seattle, Tony Z. says, "Jordan also
strongly implied that Thom was not Elayne's father."
