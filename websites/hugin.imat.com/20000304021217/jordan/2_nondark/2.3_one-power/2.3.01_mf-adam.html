they both die screaming?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In [TGH: 40, Damane, 484], Egwene's sul'dam describes how the Empress will
sometimes make a man wear the bracelet of the a'dam connected to a damane.
Sometimes nothing happens, and sometimes "both die, screaming." We see
something similar happen in [TFOH: 32, A Short Spear, 370] when Rand tries
to free the damane in Seanchan. A third example is in [ACOS: 8, The
Figurehead, 164], when Aran'gar frees Moggy from the a'dam while Egwene is
wearing the bracelet: "A sudden stab of pain through that pocket of
sensations in the back of her head.... Had she felt it directly, it would
have been numbing. As it was, her eyes bulged in shock. A man who could
channel was touching the necklace around Moghedien's neck; this was one
link no man could be brought into."
<P>
What's happening here? Well, it seems as if the men who are affected by
the a'dam are those who can channel, or maybe who have the ability to learn.
According to Elayne's study of the a'dam, it works by creating an uneven
link between channellers, in which the bracelet holder has complete
control. So possible explanations for the "die screaming" effect are: 1) a
male and a female are linked, with the man in control. A female must control
such a link due to the nature of the OP. So the a'dam link is backwards,
which could have a bad effect. 2) Possibly, they find themselves each
touching the wrong half of the Source, and cannot stand to do this, and
consequently experience immense pain and have their pitiful lives snuffed
out by the overbearing power of the wrong half of the OP pouring through
their frail bodies. 3) Putting a male in the a'dam link somehow creates
a "short circuit" in the One Power, frying both participants in the link
unless they break it pronto.
