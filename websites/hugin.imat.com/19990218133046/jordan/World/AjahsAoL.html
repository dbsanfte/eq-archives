<H1>Were there Ajahs in the Age of Legends?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Bill Garrett, Pam Korda</H2>
<HR>
<P>
RJ said, at a signing, that there were not Ajahs in the AoL. The Ajahs were formed within a few hundred years
after the Breaking. The colors of  the Ajahs were probably representative of something in the AoL or a
previous Age, because the Ajah colors are the colors surrounding the Portal Stones.
</P>
<P>
A possible, even probable, scenario of the forming of the Ajahs  is:<BR>
Perhaps the AS argued about what was most important... a few said, "we must find and stop all the male
channelers who have gone mad!" while others said, "we must fight the Shadowspawn and stay ready to fight them
should they return." Others might have placed importance on healing the wounded and stopping the ravage of
disease.  Then some said, "We must manipulate the governments of the people to make sure they are always
ready."  A few bookish sorts might have thought it was more important to preserve old knowledge to keep it
from getting lost, and to gather more knowledge. "What will happen in troubles to come if our descendants
forget even the meager things we've learned so far?"
</P>
<P>
The <EM>term</EM> "ajah" meant something different in the Age of Legends. In <CITE>ACOS, Prologue, Lightnings,
41</CITE> Mesaana is laughing at Elaida's machinations, saying, "Watching her play her little games is certainly
amusing. You children almost match the <EM>ajah</EM> at times." The meaning can't really be gotten from the
context, here, though.
