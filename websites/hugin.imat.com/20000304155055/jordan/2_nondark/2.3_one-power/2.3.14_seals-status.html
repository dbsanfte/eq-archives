<P>
Where we found the Seals, and their current state (broken or not):
<OL>
<LI>Found in the Eye of the World with the Horn of Valere and Dragon Banner,
broken;
<LI>Bayle had one, intact, which he'd bought from a Saldaean antiques
salesman. It was taken by Turak; Moiraine found it after the
fight at Falme, and it was broken by then.
<LI>Turak had one in his cuendillar collection. Moiraine found it
along with (2). Also broken.
<LI>Moiraine found one in the Stone of Tear's Great Holding, intact.
<LI>She found another one in Rhuidean, and made a scratch.
<LI>Nynaeve found one in the Panarch's Museum in Tanchico, accidentally
broken on the way to Salidar.
<LI>Mazrim Taim gave the last one to Rand, saying it was found in a
farmhouse in Saldaea. It is still intact.
</OL>
<P>
As far as we know, three seals are still intact (4, 5, and 7), although
they are very, very weak. The intact ones are all in Rand's possession (or
the possession of people on Rand's side.)
