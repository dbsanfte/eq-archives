<HR>
<UL>
<LI>(<CITE>TEotW: 15, 215-6, Strangers and Friends, 181</CITE>):<BR>
<UL>
<LI>LAN:  Seven ruined Towers/A babe in a cradle holding a sword(YES)

<LI>THOM: A man--not him--juggling fire/The White Tower(Uncertain.
	 either of these could refer to his nephew Owyn, and the Tower
	 could also represent future involvement with the AS)

<LI>MAT: A red eagle(YES-Something to do with his past life/lives as
		a Manetheren general)/A eye on a balance scale(NO-half the light
		of the world, again)/A dagger with a ruby(YES)/A horn(YES)
		/A laughing face(NO)

<LI>RAND A sword that isn't a sword (YES), A golden crown of laurel leaves (NO,
		But this is obviously the Laurel Crown of Illian),
		A beggars staff (NO), Him pouring water on sand(YES--Making it rain
		at Rhuidean.) Three woman standing over a funeral bier with him on
		it:(NO) A bloody hand and a white hot iron(NO) Black rock wet
		with blood:(NO--"his blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul")
</UL>
<LI>Perrin (<CITE>TDR: 6, 99, The Hunt Begins, 62-3</CITE>) and above.
<P>
A wolf(YES)/A broken crown(NO, but it has to do w/ his marriage
	 to Faile. Maybe Faile is heir to the Saldaean throne?)/Trees flowering
	 around him(Uncertain, poss. refers to Loial singing to the trees over
	 Perrin's family's grave, or maybe he will find the Song)/
	 An Aielman in a cage(YES)/A Tuatha'an with a sword(YES)/
	 A falcon and a hawk, perching on his shoulders, both female.(YES)
	 A darkness swirling around him.(Uncertain--poss. just meaning
	 the shadow was chasing him, or maybe more specific--there are
	 Darkfriends near to him? Maybe this is the same darkness Min sees
	 around Rand and Perrin, with the fireflies? or maybe something else
	 entirely)
</P>
<LI>Elayne (<CITE>TGH: 24, 362, New Friends and Old Enemies, 305</CITE>) (<CITE>TGH: 43, 605, A Plan, 511</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
The Rose Crown of Andor(YES), A severed hand, not hers(NO),
	 A red-hot iron and an ax.(NO)
</P>
<LI>Nynaeve (<CITE>TGH: 43, 605, A Plan, 511</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Man's ring of heavy gold.(YES, she has it, but no, she hasn't actually done anything with it besides carry it around.)
</P>
<LI>Egwene (<CITE>TGH: 24, 362, New Friends and Old Enemies, 305</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
A white flame (YES)
</P>
<LI>Logain (<CITE>TSR: 17, 284, Deceptions, 198</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
A halo of gold and blue, signifying glory to come.
</P>
<P>
(May have to do with being un-stilled, but I think there is more to this.)
</P>
<LI>Gawyn (<CITE>TSR:1, 25, Seeds of Shadow, 21</CITE>) (<CITE>TSR: 47, 786-7, The Truth of a Viewing, 544</CITE>)
<P>
A heron marked sword, his or threatening(uncertain. Threatening
	 could refer to fighting Hammar and Coulin in the Tower Coup)/His banner
	 with a field of green rather than white(YES-Younglings' banner)/
	 Either breaking Egwene's neck or kneeling to her(NO)
</P>
<LI>Random Aes Sedai in White Tower (<CITE>TSR: 1, 18-21, Seeds of Shadow, 16-23</CITE>)
<P>
A silver collar, similar to, or actually, a damane's.(NO)
	 [also lots of death and suffering/bones etc.referring to the
	 Tower Coup]
</P>
<LI>Sheriam (<CITE>TFoH: 26, 446, Sallie Daera, 317</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"Rays of silver and blue flashed about her fiery hair,
	 and a soft golden light; Min could not say what it meant."(maybe
	  has to do w/ her being Keeper? Somehow related to Logain's gold
	 and blue aura?)
</P>
<LI>Carlinya (<CITE>TFoH: 26, 447, Sallie Daera, 317</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"a raven floating beside her dark hair; more of a drawing of
	 the bird than the bird itself.  She thought it was a tattoo..."(NO.
	  tatoo == Property of Seanchan royalty.)
</P>
<LI>(<CITE>TFoH: 26, 452, Sallie Daera, 320</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"[...] a silvery collar suddenly appeared, snug around the
	 woman's neck, and as suddenly seemed to shatter. Min shivered.
	 She did not like viewings connected to the Seanchan.  At least
	 Edesina would escape somehow."(NO, but Edesina is one of the AS sent
	 to Tarabon, where the Seanchan are.)
</P>
<LI>Siuan Sanche/Gareth Bryne (<CITE>TFoH: 28, 484, Trapped, 343</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
	 'When Bryne came in, I had a viewing.  An aura, and a bull ripping roses from around its neck(YES--Bryne
leaving Andor and Morgase), and ... None of it matters except the aura.  I didn't even really understand that,
but more than anything else.'  'How much did you understand?' 'If you want to stay alive, you had better stay
close to him.'  Despite the heat, Min shivered.  She had only ever had one other viewing with an 'if' in it,
and both had been potentially deadly.  It was bad enough sometimes knowing what would happen; if she started
knowing what might ...  'All I know is this.  If he stays close to you, you live.  If he gets too far away,
for too long, you are going to die.  Both of you.  I don't know why I should have seen anything about you in
his aura, but you seemed like part of it.'(NO)
</P>
<LI>Faolain (<CITE>TFoH: 50, 835, To Teach and Learn, 592</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
'A nasty woman,' Min murmured, squinting after Faolain ... 'You'd think, if there was any justice, she would
have an unpleasant future ahead of her.'(NO)
</P>
<LI>Marigan, Nicola, and Areina (<CITE>TFoH: 50, 844, To Teach, and Learn, 598-9</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
(Three women refugees with Ny et al.)
	 'Those three you brought with are trouble, and that is a viewing.'
	 'I only caught glimpses of aura, and just out of the corner of my
	 eye.  Never when I was looking right at them, where I might have
	 made something out.'(YES,  Marigan was Moggy. Maybe the other two are
	 the 2 BA Mog had with her.)  (<a HREF="Min.html#Moggy">Survey Says</a>)
</P>
<LI>Rand, Elayne, Min, Aviendha (<CITE>TFoH: 50, 844-5, To Teach, and Learn, 598-9</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Elayne leaped off the cliff.  "Min, you had a viewing about Rand and me, didn't you?" [...]<BR>
"Yes."  It was a wary word.<BR>
"You saw that we were going to fall in love."<BR>
"Not exactly.  I saw you'd fall in love with him.  I don't know what he feels for you, only that he's tied to
you some way."<BR>
[...] "And you saw there would be someone else.  Someone I'd have to ... share ... him with."<BR>
"Two, "  Min said hoarsely.  "And .... And I'm one."<BR>
[...] "Who is the third?"<BR>
"I don't know," Min mumbled.  "Only that she has a temper.  Not Nynaeve."(YES -- Avi)<BR>
</P>
<LI>Rand (<CITE>LoC: 41, A Threat, 527</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
Countless thousands of sparkling lights, like stars or fireflies,
rushed into a great blackness, trying to fill it up, rushed in and were
swallowed.  There seemed to be more lights than she had ever seen
before, but the darkness swallowed them at a greater rate, too.[The
general fight against the Shadow.]  And there was something else,
something new, an aura of yellow and brown and purple that made her
stomach clench.[Rand's injury at the hands of the Tower AS?]
</P>
<LI>Rand (<CITE>LoC: 41, A Threat, 532</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"I saw an aura around you [Rand] in the throne room.  Aes Sedai are
going to hurt you[YES].  Women who can channel, anyway.  It was all
confused; I'm not sure about the Aes Sedai part.  But it might happen
more than once." [Only happened once.  Will some non-AS channelers
hurt him, now?  The Shaido Wise Ones?  The Seanchan?  The Sea Folk?
The Sharans? Some Fosaken?]
</P>
<LI>Melaine (<CITE>LoC: 41, A Threat, 534</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
'You will have two daughters,' Min murmured. 'Twins like mirrors.' {NO, but she's pregnant.}
</P>
<LI>Rand and Perrin (<CITE>LoC: 46, Beyond the Gate, 578-9</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"When you two were together, I saw those fireflies and the
darkness stronger than ever.... But with two of you in the same room,
the fireflies were holding their own instead of being eaten faster than
they can swarm, the way they do when you're alone." {Just a general idea,
not a definite event. cf the "sparks" Min sees in the inn in Baerlon.}
"Twice he's going to have to be there, or you [Rand]...." "If he's not,
something bad will happen to you." "Very bad." Rand: "Then I'll just
have to keep him around." Min: "I don't know that that will be enough,
it _will_ happen if he is not there, but nothing I saw said it won't
because he is. It will be very bad, Rand. Just thinking of that viewing
makes me...."{??? Once was probably the capture by the AS, the second
hasn't yet happened, for sure.}
</P>
<LI>Rand (<CITE>LOC: 49, The Mirror of Mists, 616</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
(possible viewing) Rand says, "`Trust me, Min. I won't hurt you. I will cut of my arm before I hurt you.' She
was silent, and he finally looked round to find her peering at him with a strange expression. `That's very
nice to hear, sheepherder.' Her voice was as odd as her face." {Rand will lose a hand? Rand will hurt Min?}
</P>
<LI>Miscellaneous Nobles (<CITE>LoC: 50, Thorns, 626</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"Maringil...was going to die by poison. (YES)  Colavaere... would die by hanging. (NOT YET, but she's scheduled
to) Meilan...would die by the knife. (YES) ...Aracome and Maraconn and Gueyam were all going to die too, bloody
deaths, in battle. (NO)
</P>
<LI>Berelain (<CITE>LoC: 50, Thorns, 628</CITE>):<BR>
<P>
"a man in white who will make her fall head over heels." {NO. Who is it? A Whitecloak? Galad? A Gai'shan?
(Rhuarc gets gai'shan-ed and Berelain falls in love with him?)}
</P>

<LI><CITE>ACOS: 2, the Butcher's Yard, 88</CITE>
<P>
"Taim has blood in his past and blood in his future, but you could guess that. He's a dangerous man. They [the
Asha'man] seem to be gathering images like AS....The problem is, what I can see is all blurry....Kiruna and
that lot have all sorts of things around them, but they stay so close together that it all...jumbles
together....It's even muddier with the [Tower AS] prisoners....I keep feeling there is something important, if
I could only pick it out. You need to know."
</P>
<P>
{Pretty vague. There is something important that Rand must know about Taim, or the Asha'man, or the Aes Sedai
sworn to Rand, or the Tower AS prisoners.}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS 33, A Bath, 526</CITE>
<P>
"I saw you [Rand] and another man. I couldn't make out either face, but I knew one was you. You touched, and
seemed to merge into one another, and....one of you dies, and one doesn't"
</P>
<P>
{NO. Rand takes this to mean that LTT is a real presence in his mind. It seems too easy, though.}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS 34, Ta'veren, 534</CITE>
<P>
Merana, Alanna, Bera, Faeldrin, Rafela: "They will keep their word....I just saw these five in your hand."
</P>
<P>
{YES. Those 5 will keep their oath of fealty to Rand. Note that Verin and Kiruna are not part of this group.}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 543</CITE>
"He [Rand] would almost certainly fail without a woman who was dead and gone..."
<P>
{NO. From the next one, it is likely that this is Moiraine}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 546</CITE>
<P>
"it was not as if she had really expected Moiraine to turn up alive. Moiraine was the only viewing of hers
that had ever failed."
</P>
<P>
{NO. WE know Min is never wrong, and thus, Moiraine will be back!}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 549</CITE>
<P>
Caraline Damodred &amp; High Lord Darlin will get married.{NO}
</P>
<P>
"To her eyes a crown suddenly appeared on Darlin's head, a simple golden circlet with a slightly curved sword
lying on its side above his brows. The king's crown he would wear one day, though of what country, whe could
not say. Tear had High Lords instead of a king."
</P>
<P>
{NO. Somebody suggested that this may be a stripped-down version of the Illianer Crown of Swords, but it is
more likely a crown that we haven't seen before}
</P>
<LI><CITE>ACOS: A Crown of Swords, 642</CITE>
<P>
"It's Cadsuane. She is going to teach you something, you and the
Asha'man. All the Asha'man, I mean. It's something you have to learn,
but I don't know what it is, except that none of you will like
learning it from her. You aren't going to like it at all."
</P>
<P>
{NO. What will Cads. teach the Asha'man? Our only clue is her experience in dealing with male channellers, and
that men she has brought to the White Tower for gentling live markedly longer than usual. So, it may have
something to do with how to decrease or slow down the effects of the Taint. Another suggestion is that she
will figure out how to do male-female linking. Given her Glossary entry, maybe she will teach them how to
survive without Saidin, which would explain why they won't like it.}
