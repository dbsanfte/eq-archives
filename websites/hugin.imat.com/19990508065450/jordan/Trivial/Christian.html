(Compare) the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve clans of the Aiel.  In fact, Jordan mentions that there
is (maybe) a thirteenth clan.  This clan is credited with building Rhuidean -- the holy place (temple if you
will) of the Aiel.  The Israelites also had a people charged with taking care of the Ark of the Covenant as
well as the religious ceremonies within the temple (especially within the Holy of Holies) and those people
were the Levites. A tribe not counted among the twelve, so in effect a thirteenth tribe also.
</P>
<P>
Craig Levin points out that the Levites are counted in the 12 Tribes. It's just that Joseph's descendants
split into 2 tribes later on, and the Levites don't get land, it is their job (theoretically) to care for the
Lord's Temple and other altars across Israel. Which is even better, since there was the Jenn/other Aiel split,
and the Jenns' job was to take care of Rhuidean/the temple.

<H2>Rebirth/Reborn notion of the Savior:</H2>
<P>
(Although this savior is going to do major damage before defeating the evil one).  The blood of the lamb
versus Rand's blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul.Wound in the side a la the Cross. Sea Folk saying Aes Sedai
would wash Dragon's feet with their hair.
</P>
<H2>Masema = Saul/Paul:</H2>
<P>
Anti-Rand to rabidly pro-Rand. Also, Masema = John the Baptist--the "voice crying out in the wilderness"
proclaiming the coming of the savior and all that.
</P>
<P>
Seven Seals = Seven Seals of Solomon? (revelation)
</P>

"Peace be on you always," Elyas replied, "and on all the People." He hesitated, then added, "I will find the
song, or another will find the song, but the song will be sung, this year or in a year to come.  As it once
was so shall it be again, world without end."..."Peace be on you," Elyas said. "And on you," Raen said sadly.
(<CITE> TEotW: 27, 412, Shelter from the Storm, 346</CITE>)

The former reminds me of the Catholic (maybe Christian in general -- I'm not sure) prayer called the Glory Be.
It goes: "Glory be to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and
ever shall be, world without end.  Amen." The latter quotes are reminiscent of the closing of a Catholic
Mass, where the priest pronounces "Peace be with you" and the people respond "And also with you."
(<CITE>J.Vessey</CITE>)

<P>
At Easter mass this past spring, I saw an adult baptized for the first time in the Catholic faith. They get
the person to kneel, pour water over their head, and say something like "Now you are sealed". I don't recall
the exact words, but "sealed" was in it for sure and I recall thinking Jordan must be Catholic.  Sounds a lot
like becoming Accepted to me. (<CITE>Judy G.</CITE>)

<P>
In <CITE>TGH: 26, 387, Discord, 326</CITE> we have the prophecy: "twice dawns the day when his blood is shed. 
once for mourning, once for rebirth." This is very similar to the darkening of the sun when Christ is
crucified: from <CITE>Luke 23, verse 44-5</CITE>: "And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
over all the earth until the ninth hour.  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the
midst." (<CITE>Pam Korda</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>Matthew 10:34-36 (TEV)</CITE>):<BR>
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the world.  No I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.  I
came to set sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers......a man's worst enemies will be the
members of his own family." cf: TFOH tailer prophecy: "And what was once did come again--in fire and in storm
splitting all in twain. For his peace...was the peace...of the sword." (<CITE>Zach Simpson</CITE>)
</P>
<P>
In LOC, some of the rumors about Rand say that he was born of a woman touched by no man (<CITE>LoC: 2, A New
Arrival, 78</CITE>).
