<DT>Myrddraal
<DD>?Murder All?
<DT>Lothair Mantelar

<DT>Aginor
<DD><Q>"Recently, a friend of mine had to read the _Iliad_. (Homer's story of the Trojan War)  In Book 21, a
character named Agenor attacks Hektor, and is defeated.  Not much is said about him (Agenor) other than that
he is "blameless and powerful", and knew that Hektor was stronger than he was.  He attacked anyway, figuring
that while Hektor was much more combat-capable, Agenor had the gods on his side, not to mention the fact that
even the powerful make mistakes.  In a few minutes, Hektor defeats Agenor, and Apollo surrounds the loser "in
a thick mist", and transports him back to Troy.  Some interesting  parallels between this an TEotW's final
battle: Both Aginors knew that his opponent was more powerful, both were full of pride, both attacked
anyway."</Q> -- Contributed by: <CITE>Mike O'Malley</CITE>
<DT>Birgitte
<DD>Brigit/Brigid, Celtic goddess of fire, poetry, smithing, and/or healing.
<DT>Ishamael
<DD>Ishmael: In Genesis, Abraham's eldest son (to an Egyptian serving girl Hagar) was called Ishmael.
Apparently Abraham's wife took a disliking to young Ishmael and pressured Big Abe into exiling Ish and Hagar
into the desert. There is a quote about "every hand raised against him" some-where but I can't remember it.
<DT>Mesaana
<DD>Possibly from Messalina, the notorious third wife of Tiberius Cladius Drusus Nero Germanicus, Emperor of Rome.
<DT>Selene
<DD>Selena, a Greek goddess of the moon,  (Hence the icon) merged in Artemis and Hecate. She loved a youth
named Endymion, and put him into a deep sleep so that he would not be conscious of her caresses.
<DT>Tuatha'an
<DD>Tuatha De Danann, "People of the Goddess Danu." A magical race of beings who were supposed to have
inhabited Ireland at the time of the arrival of the Milesians (i.e. humans).
<DT>Illian
<DD>Ilion, aka Troy, as in the <U>Iliad</U>.
<DT>"Rhiannon at the Tower"
<DD>Rhiannon from Welsh mythology. The closest connection between her and a tower that I could find is the
following from the story of Manawyddan: Manawyddan, his wife Rhiannon, her son Pryderi, and his wife Kicva
were out hunting. They came upon a mysterious castle. The hounds ran into the castle, and didn't come out.
Pryderi went in after them, and saw a large gold bowl. He touched the bowl, and became frozen. After a while,
Rhiannon went in to look for him, got similarly stuck, and then the castle disappeared. (They finally got
released.)
