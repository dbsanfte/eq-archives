<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">2.1.3: Is Mat still linked to the Horn?</h1>
<HR>
<P>
In [TDR: 12, The Amyrlin Seat, 118], Verin and SS are discussing Mat and
the Horn of Valere. Verin says, "So long as Mat lives, the Horn of Valere
is no more than a horn to anyone else. If he dies, of course, another can
sound and forge a new link between man and Horn." Later, SS tells Mat,
"For anyone else, it is only a horn-- so long as you live." There are two
points in the story where Mat could be considered to have died: when he was
hung from the tree in Rhuidean, and when he got hit by lightning in the
raid on Caemlyn in TFOH. So, is he still linked to the horn?
<P>
Firstly, in Tear, [TSR: 15, 253, Into the Doorway, 177]:
<Blockquote>
[Snakey Answers to "What fate?]:<BR>
"'To die, and live again, and live once more a part of what was!'
</blockquote>
<P>
The first time Mat Died And Lived Again:
<blockquote>
In Rhuidean, [TSR: 26, 437-8, The Dedicated, 306-7]:<P>
Letting sword and Power go, he ripped the rope away from Mat's
neck and pressed an ear to his friend's chest. Nothing.
Desperately, he tore open Mat's coat and shirt, breaking the
leather cord that held a silver medallion on Mat's chest. He
tossed the medallion aside, listened again. Nothing. No
heartbeat. Dead. No! He'd be all right if I hadn't let him
follow me here. I can't let him be dead!
<P>
As hard as he could he pounded his fist against Mat's chest,
listened. Nothing. Again he hammered, listened. Yes. There.
A faint heartbeat. It was. So faint, so slow. And slowing.
But Mat was still alive despite the heavy purple welt around his
neck. He might yet be kept alive.
<P>
Filling his lungs, Rand scrambled around to breathe into Mat's
mouth as strongly as he could. Again. Again..."
</blockquote>
<P>
The Second time Mat Died And Lived Again (maybe):<BR>
<blockquote>
Mat gets blasted by Rahvin's lightning in Rand's attack on
Caemlyn. He is "brought back to life" when Rand BFs Rahvin. However,
this is treading the knife edge of paradox, as does anything involving
BF. The way BF works is that it "rewinds" time, so that the actions
performed by a BF'd person never happened. Thus, Rahvin never shot
lightning at Mat. Thus, Mat did not die. Thus, he certainly did not
"die and live again." Or did he?
</blockquote>
<P>
So, is he still tied to the Horn? We can agree that Mat actually died.
I do grant that we can disagree and quibble over the binding of the
Horn, but that's a different matter. And on that note, Judy is
correct--the phrasing the Amyrlin used at any rate was "So long as
you live." [TDR: 20, Visitations, 182] I just wonder if anyone ever
actually linked themselves to the Horn before, then died and then came
back to life. In other words, is their knowledge absolute in this
matter, or is this just a turn of phrase? [John Novak]
<P>
If the Caemlyn incident is the only time Mat Died and Lived Again, then he
is probably still linked to the Horn, due to the way BF works: Mat gets
toasted, the link to the Horn breaks. Rand BFs Rahvin, making Mat
not-having-died, and thereby unmaking the destruction of the link to the
Horn. If the Rhuidean incident counts as Mat having died and lived again,
then the question of his being linked to the Horn is still up in the
air-- does restoring him to life restore the link?
