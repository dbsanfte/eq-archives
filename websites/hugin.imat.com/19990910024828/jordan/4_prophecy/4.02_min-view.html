<h2>From <CITE>The Eye of the World</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TEOTW: 15, Strangers and Friends, 181]
<blockquote>
LAN: Seven ruined Towers/A babe in a cradle holding a sword
</blockquote>
These refer to his Malkieri heritage: Lord of the Seven Towers, and sworn
as a babe by his parents to the fight against the Shadow.
<blockquote>
THOM: A man-- not him-- juggling fire/The White Tower
</blockquote>
Either of these could refer to his channelling nephew Owyn, who seems to
have been caught up in the "vileness" after the Aiel war. The Tower could
also represent future involvement with Aes Sedai.
<blockquote>
MAT: A red eagle, an eye on a balance scale, a dagger with a ruby, a
horn, a laughing face
</blockquote>
The eagle is related to his past life/lives as a Manetheren general. The
eye is another reference to him having to sacrifice his eye at some
point, in order to achieve total Odin-hood, and to produce some greater
good. Compare to the "half the light of the world" prophecy, and Eg's
dream about Mat with blood streaming down his face. The dagger is the
Shadar Logoth dagger which Mat was involved with for so long. The horn
is the Horn of Valere, which Mat blew in TGH. As for the laughing face,
it doesn't seem to refer to anything specific Mat's done so far, although
he is a bit of a trickster, or to any other prophecies.
<blockquote>
RAND: A sword that isn't a sword, A golden crown of laurel leaves, a
beggar's staff, him pouring water on sand, three woman standing over
a funeral bier with him on it, A bloody hand and a white hot iron, and
black rocks wet with blood.
</blockquote>
The Sword That Ain't is Callandor. The crown is the Crown of Illian,
achieved in ACOS. The beggar's staff vision doesn't relate to anything
which has happened thus far, but the vision ties in to other ones
involving Rand dressed as a beggar. Pouring water on sand probably
refers to Rand making it rain at Rhuidean. The three women over his
funeral bier are probably his three chicks--Min, Avi, and Elayne. No
idea about the bloody hand and hot iron, although there is a similar
vision for Elayne in TGH. (A suggestion that has nothing to do with
Elayne relates Rand's self-inflicted hand wound when Liah is lost in
Shadar Logoth in LOC (the bloody hand) to the balefire he used on her at
the end of COS (the "white-hot iron" is Min's description of balefire,
since she doesn't know what it actually is).) The bloody black rocks are
probably the rocks of Shayol Ghul; this seems to tie in with "his blood
on the rocks of Shayol Ghul" from the Karaethon Cycle.
<blockquote>
PERRIN: wolf, broken crown, trees flowering all around him.
</Blockquote>
The wolf refers to his wolfbrotherhood. The "broken crown" has to do
with his marriage to Faile. Faile is second in line for the Saldaean
throne, after her father. The meaning of the flowering trees is unclear;
it has been suggested that they refer to Loial singing to the trees over
Perrin's family's grave, or that Perrin will find the Song.
</P>

[TEOTW: 16, The Wisdom, 195]
<blockquote>
The number of sparks increased when Nynaeve joined the party.
</blockquote>
Obviously, Nynaeve is an important part of the group who will fight the
Shadow.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<A NAME="tgh"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>The Great Hunt</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TGH: 24, New Friends and Old Enemies, 305] [TGH: 43, A Plan, 511]
<blockquote>
ELAYNE: The Rose Crown of Andor, a severed hand, not hers, a red-hot
iron and an axe.
</blockquote>
The crown is the Crown of Andor, which Elayne claimed in TPOD. The
severed hand, red-hot iron, and axe may be related to the bloody hand and
white-hot iron Min saw around Rand.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TGH: 43, A Plan, 511]
<blockquote>
NYNAEVE: Man's ring of heavy gold.
</blockquote>
This is Lan's ring. The vision could symbolize Ny's love
connection with our favorite Warder, or it could refer to some
particular instance, yet to come, in which she'll need the ring for
some specific purpose.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TGH: 24, New Friends and Old Enemies, 305]
<blockquote>
EGWENE A white flame
</blockquote>
Duh. Refers to Eg. becoming Amyrlin Seat.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<A NAME="tdr"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>The Dragon Reborn</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TDR: 6, The Hunt Begins, 62-3]
<blockquote>
PERRIN: An Aiel in a cage, a Tinker with a sword, a female falcon and
a female hawk on his shoulders, a darkness swirling around him.
</blockquote>
The caged
Aiel is Gaul, who Perrin freed. The Tinker is Aram. The swirling
darkness is vague. Possibly, it just means that the shadow was chasing
him, or maybe more specific-- there are Darkfriends near to him? Maybe
this is the same darkness Min sees around Rand and Perrin, with the
fireflies/sparks?
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<A NAME="tsr"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>The Shadow Rising</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TSR: 17, Deceptions, 198]
<blockquote>
LOGAIN: A halo of gold and blue, signifying glory to come.
</blockquote>
This may have to do with being him being un-gentled, but there is
probably more to this than that. Suggestions include the "Rand fakes
death and Logain takes credit" theory (see Eg's dream), the "Logain uses
Callandor" theory, and the "Logain takes care of Taimandred" theory.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TSR: 1, Seeds of Shadow, 21]
<blockquote>
GAWYN: A heron marked sword, his or threatening, His
banner with a field of green rather than white, either breaking
Egwene's neck or kneeling to her
</blockquote>
The meaning of the heron sword is uncertain. I guess Gawyn could be a
blademaster. "Threatening" could refer to fighting Hammar and Coulin in
the Tower Coup. The banner is that of the Younglings, whom Gawyn
commands.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TSR: 1, Seeds of Shadow, 16-23]
<blockquote>
RANDOM AES SEDAI IN WHITE TOWER: A silver collar, similar to, or
actually, a damane's. Also lots of death and suffering/bones etc.
</blockquote>
The bones, death, etc. probably refer to the Tower's current strife (the
coup, etc.). The collar vision agrees with others which show that at
least some AS will be captured by the Seanchan.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<A NAME="tfoh"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>The Fires of Heaven</CITE></h2>
<P>
[TFOH: 26, Sallie Daera, 317]
<blockquote>
SHERIAM: "Rays of silver and blue flashed about her fiery hair,
and a soft golden light; Min could not say what it meant."
</blockquote>
*shrug* Could this have something to do with her being Keeper? Could it
be related to Logain's gold and blue aura?
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 26, Sallie Daera, 317]
<blockquote>
CARLINYA: "a raven floating beside her dark hair; more of a drawing of
the bird than the bird itself. She thought it was a tattoo..."
</blockquote>
Carlinya is one of Sheriam's faction with the rebel AS. The raven tattoo
indicates that a person is "property" of the Seanchan empress.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 26, Sallie Daera, 320]
<blockquote>
EDESINA: "[...] a silvery collar suddenly appeared, snug around the
woman's neck, and as suddenly seemed to shatter. Min shivered.
She did not like viewings connected to the Seanchan. At least
Edesina would escape somehow."
</blockquote>
Meaning is obvious. Note that Edesina is one of the Aes Sedai sent to
Tarabon, which we know to be under Seanchan control.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 28, Trapped, 343]
<blockquote>
SS/GARETH BRYNE: "When Bryne came in, I had a viewing. An aura, and
a bull ripping roses from around its neck. All I know is this. If he
stays close to you [SS], you live. If he gets too far away, for too
long, you are going to die. Both of you."
</blockquote>
The bull ripping off the roses indicates Gareth Bryne severing his ties
to Andor and Morgase. (The crest of House Bryne is a bull with a wreath
of roses, which symbolize the Rose Crown, around its neck.) We have not
yet seen a situation where SS's or Bryne's life depends on having the
other one around.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TSR: 47, The Truth of a Viewing, 544]
<blockquote>
GAWYN: either breaking Egwene's neck or kneeling to her
</blockquote>
The either/or vision about Egwene is similar to several of
Eg's dreams which imply that Gawyn will either get over his psychosis and
go along with Egwene, or that he'll end up destroying her, maybe killing
her.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 50, To Teach and Learn, 592]
<blockquote>
FAOLAIN: '"A nasty woman," Min murmured, squinting after Faolain ...
"You'd think, if there was any justice, she would have an unpleasant
future ahead of her."'
</blockquote>
By implication, Faolain has a good future. This perhaps will come of her
swearing fealty to Eg.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 50, To Teach, and Learn, 598-9]
<blockquote>
MARIGAN, NICOLA, and AREINA: (Three women refugees with Ny et al.)
"Those three you brought with are trouble, and that is a viewing." ...
"I only caught glimpses of aura, and just out of the corner of my eye.
Never when I was looking right at them, where I might have made
something out."
</blockquote>
Marigan was Moggy, which certainly was trouble. The other two are
possibly the 2 BA Mog had with her. Even if they are not, they are
causing problems among the Salidar AS--they tried to blackmail Eg, and
succeeded in blackmailing Myrelle. Their antics prompted Eg to tell El
and Ny not to return to the army until she deals with them, which will
doubtless cause more trouble.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[TFOH: 50, To Teach, and Learn, 598-9]
<blockquote>
RAND, ELAYNE, MIN, AVIENDHA:<BR>
'Elayne leaped off the cliff. "Min, you had a viewing about Rand
and me, didn't you?" [...]<BR>
"Yes." It was a wary word.<BR>
"You saw that we were going to fall in love."<BR>
"Not exactly. I saw you'd fall in love with him. I don't know
what he feels for you, only that he's tied to you some way."<BR>
[...] "And you saw there would be someone else. Someone I'd have
to ... share ... him with."<BR>
"Two, " Min said hoarsely. "And .... And I'm one."<BR>
[...] "Who is the third?"<BR>
"I don't know," Min mumbled. "Only that she has a temper. Not
Nynaeve."'<BR>
</blockquote>
This seems to be in the process of coming true. Elayne, Min, and
Aviendha (the third one, with a temper) are all in love with Rand, and he
with them.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<A NAME="loc"></A>
<h2>From <CITE>Lord of Chaos</CITE></h2>
<P>
[LoC: 41, A Threat, 527]
<blockquote>
RAND: Countless thousands of sparkling lights, like stars or
fireflies, rushed into a great blackness, trying to fill it up, rushed
in and were swallowed. There seemed to be more lights than she had
ever seen before, but the darkness swallowed them at a greater rate,
too. And there was something else, something new, an aura of yellow
and brown and purple that made her stomach clench.
</blockquote>
The sparks and darkness seem to be a continuous indication of the status
of the fight against the Shadow. They're first mentioned when we first
meet Min in TEOTW. The nasty bruise-colored aura could indicate Rand's
(physical and psychological) injury during his captivity by the Tower AS,
or it could indicate that he's growing more and more susceptible to the
Taint.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LoC: 41, A Threat, 532]
<blockquote>
RAND: "I saw an aura around you [Rand] in the throne room. Aes
Sedai are going to hurt you. Women who can channel, anyway. It was all
confused; I'm not sure about the Aes Sedai part. But it might happen
more than once."
</blockquote>
Injury at the hands of channelling women has happened once--Rand's
captivity by the Tower AS. It is possible that he'll be hurt by channelling
women again, although not necessarily more AS--after all, they've had their
turn. The most likely groups seem to be Sevanna's Wise Ones, the Black
Ajah, and the Seanchan. Other possibilities are the Sea Folk, the Sharans,
the Salidar AS, and some Forsaken.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LoC: 41, A Threat, 534]
<blockquote>
MELAINE: will bear twin daughters
</blockquote>
Melaine is currently pregnant.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LoC: 46, Beyond the Gate, 578-9]
<blockquote>
RAND and PERRIN: "When you two were together, I saw those fireflies
and the darkness stronger than ever.... But with two of you in the
same room, the fireflies were holding their own instead of being eaten
faster than they can swarm, the way they do when you're alone. Twice
he's going to have to be there, or you [Rand]...." "If he's not,
something bad will happen to you." "Very bad." Rand: "Then I'll just
have to keep him around." Min: "I don't know that that will be
enough, it <EM>will</EM> happen if he is not there, but nothing I saw
said it won't because he is. It will be very bad, Rand."
</blockquote>
The sparks indicate the odds in the fight vs. the Shadow. Clearly, Rand
doesn't stand a chance w/o Perrin. The first time Rand needed Perrin was
probably the capture by the Tower AS. The second hasn't happened, so
Perrin better hurry up in Ghealdan.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LOC: 49, The Mirror of Mists, 616]
<blockquote>
RAND: (possible viewing): Rand says, '"Trust me, Min. I won't hurt
you. I will cut off my arm before I hurt you." She was silent, and he
finally looked round to find her peering at him with a strange
expression. "That's very nice to hear, sheepherder." Her voice was
as odd as her face.'
</blockquote>
This may or may not be a real viewing. However, it seems like she saw
something related to what he'd just said. Maybe he'll cut off his arm
(or lose a hand!), or hurt her somehow.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LoC: 50, Thorns,626]
<blockquote>
MISC. NOBLES: "Maringil...was going to die by poison. Colavaere...
would die by hanging. Meilan...would die by the knife.
...Aracome and Maraconn and Gueyam were all going to die too, bloody
deaths, in battle.
</blockquote>
Colavaere killed the first two, or had them killed, and then hung herself
when her plan to seize the Sun Throne was foiled. The last three died in
Rand's Seanchan campaign in TPOD.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[LoC: 50, Thorns, 628]
<blockquote>
BERELAIN: "a man in white who will make her fall head over heels."
</blockquote>
Who is it? The only groups of people who regularly wear white are WCs
and gai'shain. It seems most likely that this mysterious man is
Galad--there's a certain symmetry to the Most Beautiful Woman and the
Most Beautiful Man getting together. Not to mention, Berelain is in
Ghealdan at the end of TPOD, and thus in prime geographic condition to
meet some handsome Whitecloaks.
</P>

<h2>From <CITE>A Crown of Swords</CITE></h2>
<P>
[ACOS: 2, the Butcher's Yard, 88]
<blockquote>
WHOLE BUNCH O' FOLKS: "Taim has blood in his past and blood in his
future, but you could guess that. He's a dangerous man. They [the
Asha'man] seem to be gathering images like AS....The problem is, what
I can see is all blurry....Kiruna and that lot have all sorts of
things around them, but they stay so close together that it
all...jumbles together....It's even muddier with the [Tower AS]
prisoners....I keep feeling there is something important, if I could
only pick it out. You need to know."
</blockquote>
This is pretty vague. There is something important that Rand must know
about Taim, or the Asha'man, or the Aes Sedai sworn to Rand, or the Tower
AS prisoners.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: 33, A Bath, 526]
<blockquote>
RAND: I saw you and another man. I couldn't make out either
face, but I knew one was you. You touched, and seemed to merge into
one another, and....one of you dies, and one doesn't."
</blockquote>
Rand takes this to mean that LTT is a real presence in his mind. That
seems too easy, and Min seems doubtful about that interpretation.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS 34, Ta'veren, 534]
<blockquote>
MERANA, ALANNA, BERA, FAELDRIN, RAFELA: "They will keep their
word....I just saw these five in your hand."
</blockquote>
Those five will keep their oath of fealty to Rand. Note that Verin and
Kiruna are not part of this group.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 543]
<blockquote>
RAND: "He would almost certainly fail without a woman who was dead
and gone..."
</blockquote>
The most likely person for this to be referring to is Moiraine, who
everybody thinks is dead.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 546]
<blockquote>
MOIRAINE: "it was not as if she had really expected Moiraine to turn
up alive. Moiraine was the only viewing of hers that had ever
failed."
</blockquote>
Obviously Min had some viewing of Moiraine which had not been fulfilled
by the time Moir took a header through the Red Door. WE know Min is
never wrong, and thus, Moiraine will be back!
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: 35, Into the Woods, 549]
<blockquote>
DARLIN, CARALINE: Caraline Damodred and High Lord Darlin will get
married.
</blockquote>
This has not occurred, but he is courting her.
<blockquote>
DARLIN: "To her eyes a crown suddenly appeared on Darlin's head, a
simple golden circlet with a slightly curved sword lying on its side
above his brows. The king's crown he would wear one day, though of
what country, she could not say. Tear had High Lords instead of a
king"
</blockquote>
Somebody suggested that this may be a stripped-down version of the
Illianer Crown of Swords, but it is more likely a crown that we haven't
seen before, or of a new country.
</P>
<hr width="50%" align="center">
<P>
[ACOS: 41, A Crown of Swords, 642]
<blockquote>
CADSUANE: "It's Cadsuane. She is going to teach you something, you
and the Asha'man. All the Asha'man, I mean. It's something you have
to learn, but I don't know what it is, except that none of you will
like learning it from her. You aren't going to like it at all."
</blockquote>
What will Cadsuane teach the Asha'man? Our only clue is her experience
in dealing with male channellers, and that men she has brought to the
White Tower for gentling live markedly longer than usual. So, it may
have something to do with how to decrease or slow down the effects of the
Taint. Another suggestion is that she will figure out how to do
male-female linking. Given her Glossary entry, maybe she will teach them
how to survive without Saidin, which would explain why they won't like
it. Given the general behaviour of the Asha'man, the thing they really
need to learn is <em>MANNERS</em>!

<blockquote>
FOUR TOWER AES SEDAI PRISONERS WHO WERE COMPELLED BY VERIN: <BR>
<BR>
BELDEINE: "She was going to bond an Asha'man as a Warder!"<BR>
SARENE: "A tempstuous love affair, of all things!"<BR>
NESUNE: "One red-and-green aura spoke of honors, and fame. A huge building
appeared above her head and vanished. A library she would found.<BR>
ELZA: No specific viewing.<BR>

SORILEA: "She had never seen anything really useful around that
white-haired harridan"<BR>
<br>
ALL FOUR, PLUS SORILEA: '"Suddenly an aura flashed, blue and yellow

meaning....'They will serve you, each in her fashion, Rand."....
<EM>Sorilea</EM> would serve him? Suddenly Min wondered exactly what

This is all either trivial, self-explanatory, or both.
