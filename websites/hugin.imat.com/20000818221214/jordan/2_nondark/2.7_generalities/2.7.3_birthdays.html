<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Aram</STRONG>: "about" same age as Perrin [TEOTW: 25, The
Traveling People, 311].
<LI><STRONG>Aviendha</STRONG>: almost twenty in [TPOD: 1, To Keep the
Bargain, 50], which occurs early in 1000 NE, so she was born in
979-980 NE.
<LI><STRONG>Berelain</STRONG>: at most a year older than Rand [TSR: 2,
Whirlpools in the Pattern, 57]
<LI><STRONG>Cadsuane</STRONG>: "Thought to have been born around 705 NE."
[ACOS: Glossary, 671]
<LI><STRONG>Elayne</STRONG> is eighteen in [LOC: 48, Leaning on the Knife,
602]. This is at the turning of the century, placing birthdate
close to Egwene's in mid to late 981.
<LI><STRONG>Egwene</STRONG> is two years younger than Rand [TEOTW: 3, The
Peddler, 35], so she was born mid-981. She's also listed as eighteen in
[ACOS: 8, The Figurehead, 157].
<LI><STRONG>Ewin Finngar</STRONG>: born 984 NE [TEOTW: 2, Strangers, 19]
<LI><STRONG>Faile</STRONG>: Of an age with Ewin Finngar [LOC: Prologue,
The First Message, 35]
<LI><STRONG>Galad</STRONG> was born prior to 972 NE [TEOTW: Glossary, 668]
(probably a year at most since he is described as an infant when
Tigraine left).
<LI><STRONG>Gawyn</STRONG>: 22 or 23 in 999 NE [LOC: Prologue, The First
Message, 40], he is listed as being a few years past twenty. The
earliest he could have been born is 975 NE which would make him 25--a
little older than a 'few years.'
<LI><STRONG>Isam</STRONG>: was a child when Malkier fell, so he is a few
years older than Lan, say b. 945-950 NE.
<LI><STRONG>Lan</STRONG>: b. 953 NE [LOC: Glossary, 709]
<LI><STRONG>Logain</STRONG>: born 972 NE [ACOS: Glossary, 676]
<LI><STRONG>Loial</STRONG>: born 908 NE [TEOTW: 36, Web of the Pattern, 461]
<LI><STRONG>Mat</STRONG> is the same age as Rand, b.978 NE [TEOTW: 8, A
Place of Safety, 94].
<LI><STRONG>Min</STRONG>: 'almost' Nynaeve's age [LOC: Prologue, The First
Message, 28]
<LI><STRONG>Moiraine</STRONG>: b. 956 NE [LOC: Glossary, 710]
<LI><STRONG>Nynaeve</STRONG> is twenty-six at the end of 999 NE, so she was
born 973 NE [LOC: 48, Leaning on the Knife, 602]. She looks to be a few
years younger, due to slowing.
<LI><STRONG>Perrin</STRONG> is the same age as Rand, b.978 NE [TEOTW: 8, A
Place of Safety, 94].
<LI><STRONG>Rand</STRONG> was born in 978 NE [TGH: 8, The Dragon Reborn, 109].
<LI><STRONG>Siuan Sanche</STRONG>: She was raised Amyrlin at age 30
[LOC: 35, In the Hall of the Sitters, 471], in 988 NE [Guide: 24,
The White Tower, 216]. Thus she was born in 958 NE.
<LI><STRONG>Taim</STRONG>: looks at least 15 years older than Rand, so thus
looks about 35 [LOC: 2, A New Arrival, 76]. Note that, due to slowing,
he is probably older than that. (At a post-TPOD signing in New York
[20 October, 1998, report by Ryan R.], RJ said that a man with the
spark wouldn't slow until 25, usually closer to thirty. He claims that
they could go past thirty, but that probably depends on how early they
start and how much they channel. Thus, if Rand's assessment of Taim's
apparent age is accurate, the only way Taim could be the age he looks
is if he started channelling at an unusually late age, and didn't
channel much for the first few years.)
