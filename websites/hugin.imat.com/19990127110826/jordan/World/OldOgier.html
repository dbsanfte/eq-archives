<H1>What did Ogier do of old?</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Windsor Williams</H2>

<P>
Basically, I'm wondering about the role of the Ogier in pre-Breaking
society. From what we know in general, the stedding did exist during
the period, but the Ogier were not bound to them by the Longing as they
are at the time of the series. So it seems reasonable to assume that
they were fairly common everywhere, although most common in and around
the stedding.
</P>
<P>
We know they were involved with the seed singing (as per the "through
the eyes of Coumin" scene (<CITE>TSR: 26, 432-3, The Dedicated, 302-5</CITE>), but what
other roles did they have? Some clues exist:
</P>
<P>
Ogier soldiers - also from the Coumin sequence, right at the beginning (<CITE>TSR: 26, 431, The Dedicated, 302</CITE>):<BR>
"He could see the next field, lined the same way, beyond the soldiers
with their shocklances sitting atop armored jo-cars. A hoverfly buzzed
overhead in its patrol, a deadly black metal wasp containing two men.
He was sixteen, and the women had decided his voice was finally deep
enough to join in the seed singing."
"The soldiers fascinated him, men and Ogier, the way a colorful poisonous
snake might. They _killed_."  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</P>
<P>
The "men and Ogier" phrase seems to imply that there were Ogier soldiers
as well as humans. (At least, it does to me.)
</P>
<P>
Ogier as police or enforcers - again, from the Coumin sequence
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>TSR: 26, 434, The Dedicated, 304</CITE>):<BR>
"Abruptly something struck Coumin in the mouth and his legs buckled; he
was pushing himself to his knees before he realized he was down. A hand
put to his mouth came away bloody. He looked up to find an angry-faced
townsman standing over him, nursing a fist. 'Why did you do that?' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
"The townsman spat at him. "The Forsaken are dead. Dead, do you hear?
Lanfear will not protect you anymore. We will root out all of you who
served the Forsaken while pretending to be on our side, and treat the
lot of you as we treated that crazy old man.
</P>
<P>
"A woman was tugging at the man's arm. 'Come away, Toma. Come away, and
hold your foolish tongue! Do you want the Ogier to come for you?'
Suddenly wary, the man let her pull him away into the crowd."
</P>
<P>
"Do you want the Ogier to come for you?" and the man's response argue
that the Ogier were enforcers of peace/police of some sort, and effective
ones as well. I'm guessing that they would come for him for the killing
of Charn ("that crazy old man"), but maybe it's his statements, instead?
</P>
<P>
I hadn't thought of Ogier in terms of soldiers or police before, but these
passages caught my eye while re-reading the series. We've been told at one
point or another that old tales refer to Ogier as bad opponents, who rarely
get angry but are very dangerous when they do. (I can't recall the exact
place...something about Perrin and some line about Ogier and mountains.
Anyone else recall where this is?)
</P>
<P>
We've seen Loial play an important role a couple of times already (knowing
the Ways, closing the Waygate in the Two Rivers), but I'm starting to think
we may see quite a bit more of the Ogier before the series ends.
