<h1 align="center">99.2: What is "The Guide"? What is "New Spring"?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<CITE>The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time</CITE>, more commonly
known as "The Guide," is a "companion book" to TWOT which Tor published in
November, 1997. It is by Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson, and is
basically a compilation of background and setting material for TWOT. It
contains information about "the world's geography, history, and
sociology." [Guide: Preface, 9] A lot of the information is stuff which we
already know from the series proper. There is also new information
about topics like the AOL, the founding of the White Tower, Artur
Hawkwing, and the Seanchan. The book contains artwork from the books
(icons, maps, and cover art), and some new art (which is generally
considered to be less than stellar). John Novak adds, "The Guide's framing
device (or conceit) is that it is a history written by someone from within
the Wheel of Time. Hence the first pages claiming that documents are copies
of copies, etc. As such, some readers do not consider the material canon."
<P>
"New Spring" is a 79-page novella which RJ wrote for the Tor anthology
<CITE>Legends</CITE>, published in early 1998. "New Spring" tells the
story of how Lan and Moiraine met, and the beginning of Moiraine's search
for the Dragon Reborn. It is set shortly after the Aiel War. IMO, it's
pretty good. <CITE>Legends</CITE> itself is a collection of "new stories
by the best-known and most accomplished modern creators of fantasy
fiction, each one set in the special universe... that made that writer
famous." [<CITE>Legends</CITE>, Introduction by Robert Silverberg] The
other writers featured in the volume are Stephen King (Dark Tower), Terry
Pratchett (Discworld), Terry Goodkind (The Sword of Truth), Orson Scott
Card (Tales of Alvin Maker), Robert Silverberg (Majipoor), Ursula K. Le
Guin (Earthsea), Tad Williams (Memory, Sorrow and Thorn), George R.R.
Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire), Anne McCaffrey (Pern), and Raymond E.
Feist (Riftwar).

hose same sentiments
      <STRONG>POLITELY</STRONG> but <STRONG>FIRMLY</STRONG>.  At the same 
time, impress upon
      Jordan that he ought to save all the letters which express
      dissatisfaction, and make his agent read those letters.

<P>
<STRONG>This plan is great! Where can I bend over, er, pay my $5?</STRONG>

<P>
Try the Simon and Schuster web site (http://www.simonsays.com/).

<P>
<STRONG>Will Tor provide any on-line sample of WH?</STRONG>
<P>
As of right now, we don't know.  They will certainly not provide the 
prologue, since they do not have the electronic publishing rights to that.
