<UL>
<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 43, 504, Shadowbrothers, 426</CITE>):<BR>
	  Egwene and Nynaeve and Elayne stood looking at a huge metal cage,
	  with a raised door held on a heavy spring.  They stepped in and
	  reached up together to loose the catch.  The barred door snapped
	  down behind them.  A woman with her hair all in braids laughed
	  at them, and another woman all in white laughed at her.(YES: the
	  Tairen adventure in TDR)

<LI>(<CITE>TDR: 43, 504, Shadowbrothers, 425</CITE>):<BR>
	  Mat, rattling a dice cup. His opponent stared at Mat with eyes
	  of fire.  Mat did not seem to see the man, but Perrin knew him.
	  "Mat!" he shouted. "It's Ba'alzamon. Light, Mat, you're dicing
	  with Ba'alzamon!"(YES)

<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 28, 458, To the Tower of Ghenjei, 320-1</CITE>):<BR>
	  Rand stood amid swirling stormwinds, laughing wildly, even madly,
	  arms upraised, and on the winds rode [dragons](NO, unless this is
		a ref to Rhuidean.); hidden eyes watched Rand, and there was no 
	  way of telling whether he knew it (possibly general--all the 
	  people watching Rand, e.g. Forsaken, Wise Ones, AS, etc. or maybe 
	  something more specific that we do not know about); Nynaeve and 
	  Elayne stalking cautiously through a demented landscape of twisted, 
	  shadowed buildings, hunting some dangerous beast(YES: Tanchico. cf
	  the way Tanchico looks to Egwene in TAR).  Mat, standing
	  where a road forked ahead of him. He flipped a coin(YES--
	  flipped a coin at the Portal Stone,
	  to get to Rhuidean), started down one branch, and suddenly was
	  wearing a wide-brimmed hat and walking with a staff bearing a
	  short sword blade(YES).  Egwene and a woman with long white hair
	  (Amys--probably not prophetic, but a chance meeting in TAR) were 
	  staring at him in surprise while behind them the
	  White Tower crumbled stone by stone.(YES, but will it be destroyed 
	  further?)

<LI>(<CITE>TSR: 53, 882, The Price of a Departure, 612</CITE>):<BR>
	  Egwene stood among a crowd of women, fear in her eyes; slowly the
	  women knelt around her, Nynaeve was one of them, and he believed
	  he saw Elayne's red-gold hair.(YES)  That window faded and was
	  replaced.  Mat stood naked and bound, snarling; an odd spear with
	  a black shaft had been thrust across his back behind his elbows,
	  and a silver medallion, a foxhead, hung on his chest.(??? Maybe
	  the incident in *finnland that got him hung, or maybe something
		yet to come.)  Mat vanished, and it was Rand.  Perrin thought 
	  it was Rand.  He wore rags and a rough cloak, and a bandage 
	  covered his eyes.(NO)
