<H1>Tigraine, an analysis</H1>
<H2>Contributed by: Ruchira Datta, P. Korda</H2>

<P>
It is a certainty that Tigraine was Rand's mother, Shaiel.
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>TEotW: 34, 525-6, The Last Village, 441-2</CITE>):<BR>
Tigraine was the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and was married to Taringail Damodred.  They had a son, Galad. 
Tigraine and her brother Luc were sent to Tar Valon, in the usual tradition of the royalty of Andor.  Tigraine
vanished mysteriously from Tar Valon, never to be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
(<CITE>TSR: 34, 562, He Who Comes With the Dawn, 392-3</CITE>):<BR>
We learn about Rand's mother, Shaiel.  Her tale corresponds marvelously with Tigraine's.
</P>
<P>
Add to this the fact that many people comment on how Rand looks like the Royal Family of Andor (Lord Barthanes
(<CITE>TGH: 32, 464, Dangerous Words, 392</CITE>), and many Andoran nobles (<CITE>LoC: 26, Connecting Lines,
380</CITE>)), the description of Luc (<CITE>TSR: 33, 526, A New Weave in the Pattern, 368</CITE>), and there
you have it.
</P>
<P>
In <CITE>LoC</CITE>, at one point in Caemlyn, Rand finally learns about Tigraine's story and is very upset until he figures
out that he is not actually directly related to Elayne.  Thus, he has placed himself in the family tree even
if no one else has.
