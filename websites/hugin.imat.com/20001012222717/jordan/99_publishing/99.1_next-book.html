<strong>When will Book 9 be published?</strong>

<P>
On September 14, 2000, Teresa Nielsen Haydon (Tor Books editor),
posted to rasfwrj:
<blockquote>
<P>
We have the finished manuscript. It's already in production. In fact, it
came in day before yesterday, went out to the copyeditor that same day, and
will be in first-pass proofs as of this Saturday. In production terms, that
means it's travelling at close to the speed of light.
<P>
I would have told you about it the day it came in, but there was another
piece of news hanging in the balance. It's now confirmed. Tom Doherty says
that, barring any further unforeseen problems, we will be sticking to our
previously announced publication date of 7 November 2000. Further word is
that in the unlikely event that we run afoul of further unforeseen problems,
we would anticipate at most a delay of a week or two; but what we expect is
November 7th.
<P>
If you're toasting the occasion, dedicate a round to our Head of Production,
Jeffrey Dreyfus. He's the guy whose job it is to get these books out really,
really fast, and there's none better.
