<H1>Is Sheriam Black Ajah?</H1>
<H2>(<a HREF="SheriamBlack.html#Survey">Survey Says</a>)</H2>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI><em>Pro:</em><CITE>TDR: 15, 187-191, The Gray Man, 142-6</CITE><BR>
	  The scene with the Gray Man in the Tower. Nynaeve points out that
	  Sheriam never once wonders about who killed the Soulless.  She acts
	  rather suspicious in general during that whole scene.
<LI><em>Con:</em> She was just being brusque with the kids, because she wanted
	  them to keep quiet -- and why <em>should</em> she wonder who killed
	  him in front of the Accepted?
<LI><em>Pro:</em> Mistress of Novices would be a plum position for a Black Ajah,
	  in terms of recruiting (voluntarily, or through the assistance
	  of a few Fades).
<LI><em>Con:</em> Just because it would be a good position, doesn't mean the Black
	  Ajah got one of their own into the job.
<LI><em>Pro:</em> Sheriam's also the perfect operative of the Shadow for the
	  Tower-in-Exile, in Salidar.  There were many suspicious things
	  about her treatment of Elayne and Nynaeve, when they arrived in
	  Salidar.  Sheriam seemed to be the most ardent about confiscating
	  the ter'angreal.  It won't be too surprising if it's Sheriam who
	  gives Nynaeve the hardest time when Nynaeve claims that she's
	  captured Moggy in Salidar.  Sheriam, by her refusal to believe
	  Nynaeve, will be the reason Moggy escapes.
<LI><em>Con:</em> Again, she's just being Aes Sedai.  Why should she let the kids
	  keep the ter'angreal, or approve of them galavanting about the
	  globe, instead of studying, as they should be?
<LI><em>Pro:</em><CITE>TDR: 22, 255, The Price of the Ring, 202-3</CITE><BR>
In Egwene's Accepted test, she says something like "He said they could turn him to the Shadow, against his
will. Can they?" Sheriam then tells her about the 13 Dreadlords + 13 Fades trick, but she doesn't wonder who
"he" was.  Could she already know, from the Darkfriend Social?
<LI><em>Con:</em> Why would a Darkfriend tell Egwene about that trick, so that she'd know to watch out for it?
</UL>
<P>
If Sheriam were a DF, isn't it probable that Halima/Aran'gar would've
attached herself to her, the Keeper of the Chronicles, instead of a DF
Sitter of the Hall? Or possibly to both?
