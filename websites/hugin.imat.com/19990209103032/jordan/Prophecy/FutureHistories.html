<H1>Fourth Age Histories</H1>

<P>
NB: Are these things written in the 4th age from the Age after the
books, or are they from the previous 4th age (i.e SIX ages ago)?  Are
they really prophecy? I think they are supposed to be histories of
Rand's age, written during the age which will start with the end of
the last book. Thus, they are not prophetic in that they are
supposedly written after the fact, but they are prophetic to us,
because we don't know the end of the story.

(<CITE>TEOTW: prologue, xv, Dragonmount, xv</CITE>):<BR>
And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would
come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land an weighed down the
hearts of men, and the green things failed(YES), and hope died. And
men cried out to the Creator, saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of
the World, let the Promised One be born of the mountain(YES),
according to the prophecies, as he was in ages past and will be in
ages to come. Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that
green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs(NO). Let the
arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and the great
sword of justice defend us. Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of
time. (from _Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon._
Author unknown, the Fourth Age)
