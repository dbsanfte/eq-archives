<H1>Where do Trollocs and Myrddraal come from?</H1>

{I wrote a letter to RJ in the early months of 1995. One question I
asked was, "Where do Trollocs come from? Are there male and female
Trollocs that mate? Are there only male Trollocs that mate with
animals and/or humans to reproduce?  Are Trollocs neuter, grown in a
big vat at Shayol Ghul? Enquiring minds want to know!" I got a bit
more of an answer than I'd bargained for. --pam}

"You know the original source, of course...a blending of human and
animal genetic material in an effort to produce the "perfect"soldier,
though as envisioned by somebody who had never seen combat. Yes, there
are female Trollocs, though you don't want to know more than
that...there was a clear statement of this actually--that Trollocs
breed--when where Myrddraal come from was explained. Sometimes a
Trolloc off-spring is a throwback, but not all the way back to human,
and twisted. Thus, eyeless but with keen vision, very strong indeed
though not in Trolloc-class, able to vanish into shadows and reappear in
other shadows...There are no female Myrddraal; not even the laddie who
made the Trollocs in the first place knew why...Myrddraal must have
their "pleasures" with captured human women...there is no possibility
of cross-breeding -- it was tested, during the War of the Power, in the
crudest sort of way; the Myrddraal isn't sterile, but its sperm kills
both human and Trolloc ova -- and the sex practices and other attributes
of Myrddraal are such that a very strong woman might retain her sanity
for six months, but very few do." {did I ask about the sex practices
of Myrddraal? No, I didn't think so.} "For the record, a Trolloc could
also have sex with a human...they are now two completely incompatible
species, so there isn't any possibility of offspring--the Forsaken
tested that out too...Trollocs are just not interested in human women
sexually; to them, humans are just another food animal...Trollocs are
of fairly low intelligence (I told you the designer was never in
combat), so they would think of it about as we would having sex with
sheep, though they would do it if ordered to. They'd just like it
better if they could eat her afterwards." (<CITE>Robert Jordan</CITE>)

And, of course, the diapers of baby Myrddraal don't wave in the wind. :) -pam
