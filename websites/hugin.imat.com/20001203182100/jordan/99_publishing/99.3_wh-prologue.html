<h1 align="center">99.3 What is the deal with the Prologue for Book 9?</h1>
<hr>
<P>
<STRONG>Will I be able to read the Prologue of Book 9 on the Web, before 
the book goes on sale?</STRONG>
<P>
In the past, Tor has made the Prologue chapters of TWOT books available on 
their web page, prior to publication of the respective books, in order to 
promote the books. <EM>This will not be the case for Book 9.</EM>
<P>
Rather, Simon and Schuster have bought the electronic publishing rights to 
the Prologue of <CITE>Winter's Heart</CITE>, and will sell it under their 
Scribner imprint to desperate readers for $5 a pop, starting September 13, 
2000.  So, you will be able to read it if you want, but it'll cost you.

<P>
<STRONG>I know that, but I don't understand what it <EM>means</EM>.  
Explain?</STRONG>
<P>
Here is the official word from Teresa Nielsen Haydon, the Extremely Nice 
and Helpful Tor Books Editor:
<blockquote>
This business with the Prologue developed very quickly. What happened 
was that Robert Jordan's agent sold *just the electronic rights* to 
*just  the Prologue* of Winter's Heart for a substantial six-figure sum. 
They're planning to charge five dollars for it.

Just to clarify one point: When our edition comes out, it'll have the
Prologue in it. This deal only affects the electronic rights.
</blockquote>

<P>
<STRONG>$5 seems kind of expensive. Are they trying to rip us off?</STRONG>
<P>
Well, Scribner/Simon and Schuster is probably trying to recoup the 
"substantial six-figure sum" they paid RJ for this treat.  But just because 
they're suckers, doesn't mean you have to be.  Let's assume that WH will 
feature similar print size to TPOD; that is about 400 words/page.  
According to Scribner, the WH Prologue is 20,000 words, which comes out to 
50 pages.  $5 for the prologue comes out to ten cents per page.  The book 
itself is 625 pages, so by Scribner's pricing scheme, WH should cost 
$62.50.  That is over twice the list price of $29.95.  Talk about 
inflation!  From a typical customer's point of view, this is not a good 
deal.

<P>
<STRONG>This is an outrage! Who can I complain to?</STRONG>
<P>
Firstly, do not send nasty-grams to Tor Books. They have always been very 
helpful to their readers, and they don't have anything to do with this 
project.
<P>
If you want to complain to somebody, or make some sort of protest against 
this scheme, here are some suggestions (copied from the rasfwrj FAQ, 
courtesy of John Novak:
<UL>
<LI> Simply do not buy the prologue.  You'll get it at the regular
      price when the print version is released.  Remind others who
      might be inclined that this makes no economic sense.
<LI> Go to the Scribner web-site, and use that forum to 
     <STRONG>politely</STRONG> but <STRONG>firmly</STRONG> express your 
     dissatifaction.  Let people considering
      buying this realize exactly how silly it is.
<LI> Write a physical letter to Simon and Schuster at:
<blockquote>
       Simon & Schuster Online<BR>
       1230 Avenue of the Americas<BR>
       New York, NY 10020     <BR>
</blockquote>
      Let Simon and Schuster realize <STRONG>POLITELY</STRONG> 
      but <STRONG>FIRMLY</STRONG> that they
      are not only unlikely to make a profit, but are garnering
      negative publicity in the process and perhaps losing customers.
<LI>Consider writing a printed text letter to Jordan himself,
      through normal channels, expressing those same sentiments
      <STRONG>POLITELY</STRONG> but <STRONG>FIRMLY</STRONG>.  At the same time, impress upon
      Jordan that he ought to save all the letters which express
      dissatisfaction, and make his agent read those letters.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>This plan is great! Where can I bend over, er, pay my $5?</STRONG>

<P>
Try the Simon and Schuster web site (http://www.simonsays.com/).

<P>
<STRONG>Will Tor provide any on-line sample of WH?</STRONG>
<P>
Teresa Neilsen Haydon, Tor Books Editor, says, "I don't know of any current 
plans to put sample text from <cite>Winter's Heart</cite> up on the Tor 
webpage.  As usual, I'll let you know if anything changes."
