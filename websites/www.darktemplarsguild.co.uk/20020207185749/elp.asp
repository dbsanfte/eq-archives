      ELPs have been introduced by most guilds to stop what are called bad lotto's.

      <b>Defining a Raid</b>
      <br>A raid is defined by :-
      <br>&nbsp;Something requiring 2 or more groups to complete.
      <br>&nbsp;Has a specific goal.
      <br>&nbsp;Generally the target monster is level 50+ (but not always).
      <br>&nbsp;The Raid has either previously been named as a Raid location
      (Plane of Fear, Hate, etc) OR an officer deems the task
      <br>&nbsp;to be of appropriate difficulty for it to be considered a raid.
      <br><br>ELPs are awarded to guild members for
      attending these raids.<br><br>
      Set Raids have associated points attached, calculated on difficulty and
      average duration to complete.</td>

every single situation, use common sense when deciding if something should be
      considered a raid or not.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Eligibility</b>
      <br>
If you can and will use an item that drops on a guild raid then you may bid on
the item. Please note the <b>will</b> use an item part, in such cases were an item
is all/all it is up to an officer(s) to make a judgement call on who can go in on it.</font></p>

      <br>There is no ultimate solution for this situation, someone is going to
      get put out of place no matter what we do. as such we are relying on personal discretion.
      The good point of our open bid system is that you can see who you are bidding against then use
one’s own judgement if you think you have a just cause to bid against said
other people. This doesn’t just go for secondary characters, this should be
      the case for anyone that thinks another person would benefit more from
something, and they could easily step out of the bid.<br>
<br>
      There <b>will</b> be cases when others feel that someone should have
stayed out of a bid, if you can let an officer know about
the way you feel straight away this should help.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anyone found generally abusing
this trust system will be taken and bound in an arena and killed many times
until they get the message or until the novelty wears thin. You will also be a
prime candidate for Death Touches.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Extra Points</b>
      <br>There will be NO extra points given for teleporting people to a raid,
teleporting after a raid, corpse retrieval, resurrecting people, leading a raid,
having a birthday on a raid day, casting clarity II, being able to find your
arse with both hands and other simple things that are part and parcel of the
game.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>IT IS YOUR
      RESPONSIBILITY TO GET TO AND FROM A RAID!<br>
IT IS NOT THE GUILDS, OR ANYONE IN THE GUILDS JOB TO COME AND GET YOU FROM THE BACK OF NOWHERE 10 MINUTES BEFORE A RAID.</b></font></p>
    </center>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
9 times out of 10 you will have been given notice of when and where a raid is to
be held, if you think you are going to have problems getting there you need to
set off early or find a map or go take a boat or get some cash out the bank and
buy a port. If a raid starts at 7 and you cant get online until 6.55 then you
had better think about heading there the night before or be willing to throw
100pp at some wizard or druid to assure a fast port.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b> Give people tells, do not
assume that everyone watches each and every line of text said in guild.</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
On the same note being a cleric of the guild does not make you every person’s
personal resurrection slave. Do not expect clerics in the guild to come out of
their way to resurrect you. If you are lucky enough that there is a guild
cleric somewhere near you and is willing to do it, be thankful! If there are
none willing or close enough then find one yourself and don’t bitch about it,
if you want to hunt in some backwater zone with no cleric with you for easy
experience don’t be too surprised when you find yourself without a res. Also
expect to receive a res from a cleric of somewhere near your own level, a
higher-level res is a luxury and something not to be taken for granted or
expected.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Old Items</b>
      <br>Items won from an ELP bid will <b>NOT</b> be sold for personal gain
    once you no longer have a use for them, <b>nor</b> will they be put on a
    twink <b>OR</b> sold more cash. The item will be, assuming that it is tradable,
    put onto a section of the message boards and others may bid on it for a set
    period of time. At the end of this period if no one bids on it, you can put
    it on a twink; sell it, eat it or whatever it is you want to do with it, as
    it is now yours. People will be allowed to bid on the item using ELPs on the
    condition that it will be used. The final amount of ELPs that the item is
    re-auctioned for, half of which will go back to the original owner.<br>
<br>
<i>For example</i><br>
<br>
    Warrior Fred wins a Cobalt Breast Plate from Trak on a guild ELP raid. He
    then gets an upgrade to this Breast Plate and wishes to put it on a twink
    (don’t ask me why he has a warrior twink, he just does... probably for the
    same reason as he called his main warrior Fred).<br>
<br>
    The Cobalt BP is put on the guild boards re-bid section for anyone to bid
    on. Whatever the BP goes for in ELPS is taken from the winner’s ELP pool,
    also half of the ELPs go back to Fred’s ELP pool. He must also face above
    mentioned ‘arena death loop’ if he abuses the system or unfairly bids
    against mains that need it.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
<b>Time Keeping/Logging.</b>
      <br>Officers present will be in charge of classifying anyone as being overly late or
leaving early enough to justify any ELP deduction. As a general rule anyone only
attending 50% or less of a raid will only receive half of the points awarded for
that raid. If you feel unfairly treated speak to an officer or class leader and
it will be addressed. Also anyone found abusing or trying to abuse the system,
i.e. going to every raid for 51% of the time and leaving once you have full ELPs,
please refer to above ‘arena slaughter’.<br>
<br>
Officers will take down a log or screen shot of the people
present on a raid and submit it. This submitted information will be used to
update the guilds ELPs weekly. Only official ELP lists may be used (you don’t
have access to the ELPs you have received until they have been updated).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Starting ELPs</b>
      <br>Each guild member will start to receive ELPs upon attaining level 47 and
thereafter. You will gain ELPs for leveling up your character (highest level
character is only accounted for)</font></td>

This is to encourage players to level, as they are more usefull to themselves and us
the higher level they become. There will be <b>NO</b> bonus ELPs for completeing
      your epic, since some are laughably easy in comparison to others for this to be fair
across the board.</font>

<b>Summary</b>
<br>
<i>Anyone that can and will use an item dropped on a guild event may bid on it,
assuming the officers present/online agree<br>
<br>
Items are only bid upon for characters that are present on that raid, unless
everyone else in the auction is ok with it. If none of the characters present
bid on the item it goes open to a zone roll. (If the item is droppable)
Otherwise it is lottoed to those present who can use.<br>
<br>
Points are given roughly based on the time and difficulty involved in the raid.
NO extra points are given. Being on time is something that is expected as well
as staying for as long as feasible. Points will however be deducted as seen fit
by officers.<br>
<br>
It is your own personal responsibility to get to and from raids, no one
else’s.<br>
<br>
Old items that no longer in use by the winner are to be auctioned to the guild
via the boards. They are not personal property, unless no primary characters
require the item (i.e. no one bids on it). The old owner receives half points
that it was re-auctioned for.<br>
<br>
Officers will take down who was present for the raid along
with any other information that would affect ELPs being awarded. Data of items
won, who by when and how much will be kept on the boards also.<br>
<br>
Bonus ELPs will be awarded for your highest-level character for leveling. The
guild and yourself will benefit from a mean higher level of player.<br>
<br>
As we are a pretty close guild, we encourage people to think about what they are
bidding on and who they are bidding against and try to be fair to yourself and
others.</i></font></p>
