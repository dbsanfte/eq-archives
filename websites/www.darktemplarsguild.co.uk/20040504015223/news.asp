<div class="txt"><br>
You might have expected a report about our exploits in Time before now. Unfortunately, someone left the Latmask in charge, so things have gotten incredibly slack on the news page! Anyway, after severe verbal abuse from all quarters, its here at last.
<br>
So, what have we been up to lately? Well, since killing Coirnav we have done another round of elemental god kills to get as many as possible ready for our new playground (albeit with some pain from Rathe to put us back in our place!)
<br>
Finally, after getting those out of the way, we got to go take a look. Armed with some general info on phases 1-3, we proceeded. Phase 1 caught us out, but having learnt a lot we went straight back, and it was not long before we found ourselves in phase 3. Suddenly, out of nowhere we get thrown back 3 years and hear that most terrible of shouts "Fear train inc!!!"
<br>
<br>

</div>
<br>
<br>
Getting over the retro feel to phase 3, we set to slaughtering everything, unfortunately though, someone forgot to slip in some extra sand, and the hourglass ran out on us as we started to talk to the two stone bouncers blocking the portal to phase 4.
<br>
<br>
Having to call it there for the night, we went back later and tried again. We again got to phase 3. This time however, we had enough time to convince them that we had valid tickets for phase 4.

We also had a couple of spare nights, so off we went to GoD for one of them to explore. We picked Ferubi with the general idea of paying Smith & our old pal the Packmaster a visit.
<br>
<br>
Apparently our bloodhounds picked up the wrong scent, and we found ourselves face to face with this guy:

Davon, our resident drunken bum also struck lucky, and walked off with:

After being ported out the week before at 3% we knew the plan was ok, we just needed to get everything right.  And we did, with 3 seconds to spare!  A little too close for comfort but we did recover from a slow start really well.<br>

So what was the objective of all this effort ? Well, what else but :-

<br>
Xegony died again very smoothly, about 40mins this time and we had Enchanter wars over the two Vests, grats to Jontom and Calven on breaking out ELP record yet again.<br>
<br>
We took a quick excursion into Ferubi and got mauled by Packmaster Skoiat Pizak, yay welcome back to no graveyard CR's, should be visiting him again soon.<br>

<div class="txt"><br>
Over the holidays we had some casual farming and some backflagging madness but nothing outstanding, we left that until the new year...<br>
<br>
Forward to 2004.  Time to get ourselves focused again and finish what we started a month ago.  After yet another Mystical Arbitor run to get our new recruits in, we again came face to face with our friends.

We have always prided ourselves on our individual resourcfulness, doing stuff with low numbers is our thing, this was put to the ultimate test by an event that just screams ZERG ME!  We had a few runs at it with under 60 people and just ran out of steam.<br>
<br>
So we pulled out all the stops, called in favours and offered our firstborns  to get people on and reached what is a phenomenal turn out for us of 79 on Monday.  Plans finalised and jobs assigned we started.  All proceeded smoothly, 6 down in no time.  Then disaster struck as never before and we got mauled, but the last piece of the plan was now clear and we managed to wipe out a GM so it wasnt all bad.<br>
<br>
We reassembled on Tuesday, down on numbers from the previous attempt to around 70 which was again a huge raid for us.  This time we knew it was in our grasp, all the silly mistakes, sloppy errors and outright bugs that had hampered us in the past were erased.  I wont say that we were perfect, not by a long shot, we had a few moments where all could have been lost, but we recovered in style to reach the moment of truth... Number 12 DEAD!!...<br>

Never in the years that we have played EQ have we had an adrenaline rush like it, killing the last Councilman in time was truely the most satisfying XP message we have ever seen.<br>

Only Coirnav now remains on our to do list, we had a run at Mr Fishy and although it looks tight we think we know how it will die, stay tuned.

Planes of Power brought us the oh-so-great concept of flags.  After working our way through every flag mob there is, we find that were back to *shock* KEYS!.<br>
<br>
So what happens when key mobs are up and Dark Templars have free time ??...<br>

With access to 3 Elemental gods aquired, we decided we may as well go the whole hog and crack open Ragrax.  Now, weve spent very little time in PoEarth to be honest, we have done the Stone ring a few times but nothing more than that.  So after the last patch we ventured over to the other rings for the first time.  All of which were well and truly demolished and showing a great deal of late night persistance we had a go at this bloke for the first time :-<br>

<b>Recruitment is OPEN</b><br>
Are you a GMT/Euro time player, play most nights of the week and are looking to see the delights of the Elemental Planes ? Good news!!  Dark Templars are now considering applications for all classes.  The emphasis is on playtimes, class desirability and AAs, if your equipment is a little shabby and your flags are slacking then there is a good chance we will offer a trial if your made of the right stuff.  If you have been thinking about moving to Dark Templars in the past but struggled to meet out entry requirements now is the time to put in an application.<br>
<br>
This special once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will run for a few weeks maximum, so look sharp!<br>

We started on a slack Friday, with the usual mid 40s numbers and knowing nothing about it we started clearing.  Demons came, demons died; demons came, tanks died... all in all a great effort.<br>
<br>
And so to the man himself.<br>
<br>
Took us a while and a fair bit of debate on how to actually go about the business, but eventually we gave him a shot.  Pull went well, positioning was great, we got smeared across the walls at 80%!  Woke us up a bit... <br>
<br>
We gave it a second run the same night but with even fewer numbers it was only a half hearted and tired prod, so we got some well earned sleep, but we knew he was there for the taking.  A few days later we returned, refreshed and itching (!) for another shot, this time at full strength.  Breezed through the first parts and straight at him!<br>

So for the past few weeks weve been getting to grips with Plane of Fire and Plane of Earth, with the odd dip into Water now and again (which as you can imagine, came as a bit of a shock to us soap dodgers up North).<br>

First up, <b>Doomfire.</b>  Now, im first to criticise SoE when they churn out bland, broken and crap zones, but credit where its due, Plane of Fire is a pretty much perfect zone.  Not only is it XPtastic, but varied and interesting boss mobs mean we get to fight bitch hard, but beatable encounters on fast respawns.  Its even more satisfying when we scrap and claw our way back from what looks like a wipe, snatching victory at the last second, good stuff indeed.<br>

<div class="txt">Ok, so its been over a month since an update.  I bet you all thought we were sat around outside drinking beer and enjoying the summer nights?<br>
<br>
First up, we backflagged through practically every single flag mob, twice!  This is now beyond the stage of being painful, and has moved on to the denial stage.  After each backflag raid everything goes kind of hazy and is replaced by memories of drinking beer outside in the sun.<br>
<br>
So what does backflagging give you ?  A lean, hungry guild camping Tower of Sol Ro to within an inch of its life!  It also gives you your next target, namely Rallos Zek the Warlord...<br>
<br>
Now, as im sure you all know, the Rallos Zek script comes with a brutal reputation.  Not only is it extremely hard, its also supposed to require dozens of nights wiping to the same non loot dropping mobs over and over again. <br>
<br>
Well, we came, we demolished Tallon Zek, we errrr died.  Then we died again.  Then we went on the rampage and killed Vallon Zek, then we died.  Then we had a think...<br>
<br>
We came back, Tallon Zek died, Vallon Zek died, Rallos Zek ran away!  Bringing us face to face for the first time with this goon...<br>

Short on time we gave it a shot, resulting in us dying, but we knew we were close!<br>
<br>
Plans updated, we came back again.  A hard fought battle resulted in Rallos winning at 8%.  But winning 2nd try was never going to happen, you all know that by now.<br>
<br>
Third Rallos Zek the Warlord pops in the pit, looking all smug, thinking he was going to escape yet again.<br>

He should have listened to Mith Marr... and Bertoxx... and Agnarr...  and known we dont do 4th attempts... <br>

Not content with killing him once, we came back a week later and added Rallos Zek the Warlord to farm status with a crushing victory!<br>

<div class="txt">So we farmed Ssra for weapons.  So we farmed VT for FT and Vengence.  So what do we do with out new found toys ?  Thats right, we blast <b>Planes of Power</b>. <br>
<br>
Our first target was our friend <b>Emmerik</b>, who had given us a whipping twice, and as per tradition we took no prisoners on out 3rd attempt.  With him dead we called on this bloke :<br>

The fight was fairly interesting and of course, resulted in us freeing Karana and taking our well earned flags.<br>
<br>
Next up we decided it was time to do some work on our <b>Saryrn</b> access, so off we wandered to Torment for a slack farm session.  Well, after blitzing the <i>get in ma bellaaay</i> thing we thought what the hell, lets all go and die to Saryrn.<br>
<br>
Took us a while to reach the top of her tower, and about 10 hours deciding how to actually kill her.  We neednt have worried...<br>

<br>
<br>
Next up, the Lord of Decay himself, big bad <b>Bertoxxulous</b>.  Now this was a blast.  We did a couple of quick Carprin rings to get everyone up to speed and ventured into the Crypt of Decay basement for the first time.<br>
<br>
With 45 ish people and only a vague clue about what was going on we engaged on 2 hours of carnage and thinly disguised chaos, resulting in the appearance of ...<br>

Pretty poor picture I grant you, next one will be better!  So we engaged as fast as we could, but alas our time ran out with Bert at 70%.  Infused with new found drive we came back a few days later and this time cleared in plenty of time, but we of course were not allowed to kill him on a 2nd attempt.  Early aggro resulted in us dying at 8%, but boy was it a close thing.<br>
<br>
So we came back a 3rd time, cleared the ring in record time and ask Bert to join us ...<br>

The kill was faultless (dorfs dont count).  Great work by our enchanter crew throughout the whole thing, your many deaths were not in vain!<br>

With Bertoxx dead, we picked up our flags and a couple of other prezzies :-

Vex Thal died about 10 times I think, it gets ever easier, think its down to about 4 hours now ?  Worked on a few back flags too, AerinDar down again and a few HoH trials in preparation for the final stage in our path to Tower of Solusek Ro, namely <b>Mithaniel Marr</b>.  You next Mr Paladin sir.<br>

Two steps to Elementals!!<br>

No, we are not a Village People appreciation club... <br>

But we are looking to add a few good people to our roster.  With an assault on the Planes of Power about to commence, and before we all explode from backflagging madness, now is the time to have a look at us and see if we are the guild for <b>YOU!</b><br>

<div class="txt">Shard farming... such fun!!  We are so unhappy that its almost over, some people even suggested we destroy all of our keys just so we can experience the high adrenalin rushes in Fungus Grove and Acrylia Caverns all over again.  Luckily their temporary insanity passed and we put them to use.<br>
<br>
Its been a long time since we got to explore a new zone like Vex Thal, and I for one loved it.  We had a quiet night, so off we went to VT for a bit of exploring, not really sure what to expect.<br>
<br>
With 24 people we started clearing and had our first loot!  Well, when I say loot it was only a palace key but felt good none the less.<br>
<br>
We moved on at a smooth pace before our monks found a few friends and invited them to the party ... <br>

Good work by all, we learnt a lot and carried on.  Another <b>Thall Va Xakra</b> followed soon after, this time very smoothly.  Not content with 2, we put our new North Wing keys to use and dropped <b>Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek!</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Vex Thal shopping centre was open for business.  Shopping lists at the ready...<br>

<div class="txt">Just when you think you have fine tuned your strategy, killed a target and then farmed it into submission it decides to get even.<br>
<br>
Such was our last Cursed cycle.<br>
<br>
After waiting patiently for a rogue Taskmaster to show its face, we kicked off the cycle as usual, and rejoiced that the TM bags were fixed!  Glyphed spawned and we quickly engaged.<br>
<br>
Not happy with us mauling it to 5% in minutes, he decided to evac!  One minute were spamming the wizzies to spoil their killshots, the next were staring at Daleth muttering huh?  A few moments later we found we have 4 snakes for company and Glyphed at spawn.  A brief period of charging about and he was back to 5%, this time he evacd and hid.<br>
<br>
By the time we found him he was back at full HP and looking out over the basement from over a door.  Not happy that our late night was turning into an early morning, we got sorted and dropped it at 3rd attempt.<br>
<br>
Exiled followed without a wimper.  Zhaz did a great job of sucking a DT, grats monk!<br>
<br>
Now for Cursed.  Its been a while since we had seen his face, but thats another matter (the servers will be rebooted to annoy DT in 15 mins, kthx) but we all knew the plan.  Things went slightly off plan from the first seconds.  Perhaps it was because it was late, maybe Dal was still looking for an escaped Glyphed and forgot about minor things like defensive, but we had a minor problem, namely a dead MA and a rampant Cursed looking for clerics to kill.  By the time we got things under control Cursed was at 96% and DT was at about 30%.  Lets start again we thought, so we did.<br>
<br>
Isnt MGB the best thing ever ?  10 mins and Cursed is pulled again.<br>
<br>
This time we looked better, for a while...  Just like his friend, Cursed decides that warping about is much more effective than staying put and dying.  In the wall, on the roof, in the open, he just cant make up his mind.  Well, were down about 4 deaths each when we decide enough is enough.  Do we give it up ?  ...  nah.<br>
<br>
After a hellish fight we finally get him into position and get on with the job, about 2 hours after killing the TMs!  Everyone half buffed, oom, resisting charmed rogues Khalshazer procs (:P Kellis), killing asslings (tsk Fara!) we finally drop him.  It was painful but what a laugh, lets do it again!<br>

Congratulations someone.  Our wizards must have paid someone a large pile of cash as we found our 3rd copy of Elneriks this week and our 2nd Garrisons.  Finie made out like a bandit on Blood too.<br>
<br>
Not content with destroying the boss of Ssra, we decided to do the same to Plane of Innovation, namely <b>Behemoth</b>.  We have a tradition in DT of doing things in bizarre ways for 2 attempts then getting serious.  This was no exception, 3rd attempt again!! <br>

Behemoth down, Tactics flags for all.  Unless your a slacker like me who went to bed.<br>

<b>Grummus</b> was the first to catch our eye, and once we decided it was probably better not to fight him with a swarm of adds he coughed up our much overdue Crypt of Decay flags.

We finished off that particular evening with a nice BoT tower kill, getting our first Strike of Solusek (inc Rez >> Alenia <<) and ornate chain BP for Kellis.

PoI dragon has died a few times, seems its our new early evening warm up favourite.

Highlight of the week however was completion of our first <b>Carprin</b> ring at first attempt...  no, no, the 50 skellies were just a slight missunderstanding...   which dropped some suprisingly nice upgrades.

<b>Behemoth</b> was next up, we had an encouraging run at it once we had more than 5 people who could tell East from West.  Its dead next time.

Ikky came and fell<br>
Aaryonar came and joined him<br>
<br>
We then set of on the evil task of cleaning the Flurry drakes out, they to came, they saw, they coughed up loots leaving a clear path to Mr Feshlak who soon joined dragon heaven with his friends. However we wanted Aary to have a dragon party in heaven so on we pressed on<br>

Dagarn followed, soon after Kriezenn .. OMG was there no stopping us, we then pushed after Koi Doken, after a messy start he to was in the process of been buried, although Lady Mirinella felt a little left out we soon sent her to the clouds in the sky to. <br>

We also slapped Rhag 1 during the day while we were bored making it a new DT record, in total about 20named mobs including flurries.<br>

Another 2 firsts for us, the Glyphed fight has gotta be the funniest thing since Cab lich''d to daeth, every member of the raid took about 30 dirt naps, Rak was to busy laughing to tank it like a real ranger, and we ended up playing ping pong across his room for a short while, excellent fight, took us a long time >20 mins to drop the bugger but we emerged victorious.<br>
<br>
Tormax on the other hand was a different story, he came, he got beaten, he died, he gave us uber loot, all that in UNDER 6 minutes, yes <360 seconds, it was an epic victory for the DTs once again.<br>
<br>
Great work by all involved, well done.</div>

As a side note, I intend to add a "Log Out" button, and also add a feature if you forget your password, it can automatically be emailed to you by providing your character name.
