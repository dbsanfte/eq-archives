<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="+3">Information on our members...</FONT></B></P><P>That which makes FOR unique are not only the people, but its basic constant     principles:</P>  
<BLOCKQUOTE>    
<P>1. A small group of close friends who share the same ideals and wish to       spend time together. </P>    
<P>2. To teach and show others that a game environment does not have to be       negative - we can make a difference through our actions, using a strong       positive image with a positive char. </P>    
<P>3. A governing body of the founder and council with all members having       a voice and the right to share their opinions. </P>    
<P>4. An adult-oriented guild whereby the members would not have to &quot;babysit&quot;       nor censure themselves in a game environment.</P>    
<P> 5. In keeping with the Truth tenet and expecting trust between members,       characters and PBK (person behind keyboard) are to be of the same gender.     </P>    
<P>6. That we would explore new places to play in order to expand our horizons       and keep interest in FOR. </P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>
