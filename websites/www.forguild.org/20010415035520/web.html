<P><I>The Wood Elf Brigade</I> was started in 1999 as a sub-guild within FOR     for the purposes of allowing all members to stay within the same area to hunt     together within Everquest. You must be a member of FOR to be in WEB, but this is not a requirement in our new sub-guild, Ishtar's Light (IL).  Most members of WEB are within the same levels     and we play on Friday nights. The same rules apply towards requirements of     a member of WEB, except that unlike FOR, dueling is allowed (but not PvP or     guild wars). </P>  
<P>Fornleaf is the leader, with the title of WEB Spider. Following is a list     of members who chose to make WEB chars for this specific gameplay night. Name     in parenthesis is their main FOR char name. </P>  
<P>We encourage PM's to make up a wood elf char so that they may participate     in this guild event as well as to get to know members in a different setting.   </P>
