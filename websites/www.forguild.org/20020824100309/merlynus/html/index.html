<P><FONT COLOR="Teal"><B>As the legend goes, Merlynus was born of a Cornish princess and an incubus. She is the twin sister of the famed Merlin of Arthurian legend, born as he was by magical means. Her travels from her home started in the land called Imagination Network in 1992 when it was still called The Sierra Network.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Teal"><B>Merlynus adopted her dear traveling companion, Bootlegger, as her brother in 1996...his loyalty is unsurpassed by any other!</B></FONT></P>
<P>Following, in her own words, is the story of her rebirth and the chronicles of her travels:</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">My name is Merlynus ap Ambrosius. I have awakened from my deep sleep and found a journal from a &quot;Galapagos&quot; by my bedside.  Opening the journal, I read the first page...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Maroon">My dear Merlynus:  You will not know me, only of me - I am Galapagos, keeper of the Crystal Cave.  Many years ago he entrusted his sacred magical home and all its contents to me and my heirs, passing the name of Galapagos and the responsibility to look after the Crystal Cave to each firstborn son.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Maroon">I am many generations from the original Galapagos and have kept this journal for you from Merlin, as did my ancestors before me.  All you need to know is discovered within.  As my beloved friend, Merlin, said...&quot;Travel By the Light!&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">Now thoroughly fascinated I turned the page, excited yet with some trepidation and read on.  In a spidery script I found what was my brother's story and soon to be my own...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Black">My dear twin sister Merlynus.  It was foretold that you would awaken many years hence.  This is a brief explanation of how you came to be where you are now.  The rest of this journal chronicles my life, my travels, magical powers with spells and incantations, and the story you have by now heard of regarding Arthur and his time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Black">At the age of 35 you were teleported by magical means to a time I have only seen in my visions; however, you will not remember much of your time before, an effect of the spell I'm afraid.  I know you will be safe now, as my enemies vowed the last of our family, you and I, would be destroyed.  As I had no children, you are the heiress to all that I am, was or will be.  Learn the teachings of Galapagos from this journal as I did from the man himself; learn of the world around you in the search for wisdom and enlightenment; befriend those in need, never asking for a reward and you will be rewarded tenfold; beware of those whom are treacherous and dishonest, travel your road well.  But most of all, dear sister, forgive me for sending you Forward...and Travel By the Light!&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">With a sense of wonder and some anxiety, I gazed one last time around my Crystal Cave and gathering my travel harp, potions and herbs, wandered out into a world that is both frightening and fascinating. On the path leading down to Meryddyn, I came across an old man who told me a tale which explained the current status of the world as it is now: my homeland has been divided into many sections; once again, great and petty kings rule under &quot;guilds&quot;. On my second day of wandering I met one such king, Llewelyn (a man with the majestic stature and even temperament of a poplar tree). He and his princeling son, Sean (a brawny, red-haired giant of a man) were hunting the local forests for dragons, which although almost extinct in my time, once more roamed the earth. Their guild (or kingdom) was called Forever Knights and their home was Fear Forest.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">My travels within Fear Forest lasted three years. During that time I met many wonderful folk, including a wonderful, playful Ranger and bartender named Rando. Rando and I were subsequently married, but due to my time-consuming duties as Royal Counselor to FK, we decided to part ways, keeping our close friendship to this day. One of my various duties was to travel other lands, see how other guilds fared and befriend the other guilds and their royalty on behalf of FK. I met many wonderful people and being driven by an inner force, decided to leave FK and travel abroad, offering my services as Counselor and Friend to all whom wished it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">During my travels I met and fell in love with my soulmate, Oak Leafsong. Our wedding was one of the greatest in the land, still remembered to this day. The special gift I gave all wedding guests was a brief glimpse into my private domain and true home inherited from my brother, Merlin...the Crystal Cave. Many were blinded by the Light of that Seeing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">Because of my reputation and regarded by those I befriended as an honest wizard of high powers and great diplomatic skills, it was brought to my attention that I should consider the possibility of starting my own guild. Thus, Friends of the Realms was formed. With the help of Harmony and her husband, Tybalt, together we forged a great friendship and the beginnings of a loyal guild following. They are both now retired from the guild.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="center">A New Beginning...</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">One day while hunting in the woods surrounding their castle, Leafsong disappeared.  Shutting herself up in the Crystal Cave and using her powerful magic, Merlynus was able to ascertain that Leafsong had been kidnapped by Sir Dastardly, his arch enemy once again.  He was surrounded by magic that could not be penetrated and after many attempts to free him over a long period of time, Merlynus had to conclude that her husband would not be able to come back.  Rarely defeated in battle with magic, Merlynus bowed her head and saying a prayer to the Goddess, had a quiet memorial in the woods where he was last seen with a marker placed to commemorate their love and life together.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">Merlynus had never been truly comfortable in the spacious castle called Leafsong and knew it was time to leave The Realm, so thus dedicating the castle to her guild, Friends of the Realms, she sought to pursue other realms in which she could make a happy home for the guild once again.  Leaving a portal for Meredydd, her trusted apprentice, to come and go from the Crystal Cave to whatever realm Merlynus inhabited, she invoked the Words of Protection to protect those she cared for until her return.  In her travels, Merlynus found a new wonderous land called Norrath.  Using the portal, she rushed back to the castle and notifed the members that she had found a place that they needed to consider as their new home in Everquest.  They all entered the portal and entered Everquest through E'Ci and recently have moved to Zebuxoruk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="Purple" FACE="Centaur Festive MT Italic" SIZE="4">Many changes have taken place in the past years, both personally for Merlynus and publicly with the Guild.  Never forgetting her great love for Leafsong, she sought companionship to relieve the loneliness, not realizing that the answer would lie within the guild.  Having travelled with Krovikan as fellow beta testers in Norrath, first as friends and fellow guildmates, then finally as teammates through the new system within FOR, she found a growing bond and a strength of love that broke through all the magical barriers she had put up.  In addition, through an odd chance happening with the head of another guild seeking an alliance (of which she declined, but offered friendship to them) she found that her guildmates loved her and were dedicated not only to FOR, but herself as well.  Humbled by that experience, awed by that knowledge, Merlylnus first roamed the land with her partner, Krovikan.  When real life intervened and Krovikan had to leave, Merlynus found brief happiness with LordCosmo, the Guild Enchanter.  Now Merlynus seeks solice in her guildmates, never wishing more than to find the true path to happiness with her friends and to build FOR into a guild where a few friends can get together, have fun and play the games we are in, Everquest (Zebuxoruk server) and Dark Age of Camelot (server to be announced).  Please feel free to join us and we'll be happy to show you our new beginning...Blessed Be!</FONT></P>
