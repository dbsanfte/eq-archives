Once it was known that INN was going to be shut down, the beginning     members began to seek out a new homeland. At the time, the only available     graphical RPG land (or realm, as we call it) was Sierra's "The Realm" and     all members moved there.</p>  <p align="left">During the beta phases of 1x and 2x on The Realm, the members     learned the game and taught others. Once again we grew in membership. We also     found Empiriana, which was very similar to our original realm and many of     our old friends were there. FOR pulled out of Empiriana when it was decided     the game was not a good match for the guild.</p>  <p align="left">While continuing to play in The Realm, we also found Diablo,     which did not offer us the opportunity for guild play in numbers beyond six     in any given game. Both Diablo and Empiriana have their own merits and remain     great games for individual play and are recommended for that purpose.</p>  <p align="left">With the advent of phase 3x of The Realm, The Realm became a     different place to play; it was decided that it was once again time to search     for a better homeland. With that in mind, we tested Illusia and found it to     be very similar to our old homeland without the great graphics we had become     accustomed to, but very well-suited for guild play. The members decided to     continue searching and we beta tested and are currently heavily involved in     Everquest on the E'Ci server.</p>  <p align="left">Although we may find a more suitable realm to house FOR in the     future, Everquest will continue to be the place that all members can get together     in because of cost, availability and the expertise of current members. Even     beyond the choice of a new homeland for FOR, our focus will remain to test     further lands, so that we may add them to the list of realms we inhabit.
