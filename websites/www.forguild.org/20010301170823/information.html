The members     of the Council are the governing body, discussing guild issues and policies,     guild events to be held, any new ideas or suggestions brought forth by the     membership and then the information is sent on to the members for voting.   </p>  <p align="left">EPI's (or Guild Designation) in games are all FOR. The guild     designation (FOR) is requested to NOT be a part of the member's chosen character     name. </p>  <p align="left">Meetings will be held when we can all get together, or when     there is a majority online, usually notified in advance via email or the Guild     newsletter on the member's section of the website. </p>  <p align="left">All prospective members (recruits) who wish to be inducted into     the Guild will be given a trial period of 45 days and their request for membership     will be voted on BY THE GUILD. If it is deemed by the membership that not     enough members have had the opportunity to get to know the PM, then an extension     of two weeks will be given the PM to offer the opportunity for further evaluation     on both the part of the PM and the guild members. The PM is to be treated     with respect and if they are not FOR material, the vote will show that after     the 45-day trial period. We encourage showing and teaching the PM the FOR     way by our own actions. </p>  <p align="left">Anyone wishing to join the Guild does not have to use their     main char name and may make up a new character name for use within FOR. Having     other chars or being in other guilds is a personal choice (founder discourages     this as it takes away from time and dedication to FOR), but your FOR char     shall strictly be for/with FOR (thanks). </p>  <p align="left">Each member is to be treated with respect and dignity and guild     matters are to remain within the guild. After recruitment is maximized, members     are encouraged to help others, quest or just to listen and talk to them. We     are Friends of the Realms and are experienced RPG players who feel that the     game is for fun, not treachery nor negative personal gain. </p>  <p align="left">We do not war. We do not condone violence or fighting. Any member     who wishes to do so will not use their FOR char for these purposes. PvP (player     versus player) is not allowed, except dueling for the purposes of training     skills within our sub-guild WEB (Wood Elf Brigade). Members who wish to participate     in dueling may do so with their WEB char, as long as they adhere to the rules     of honor and fair play. Dueling will be utilized for the purposes of testing     or training in skills or sparring - NEVER in anger or to settle a dispute.</p>  <p align="left"> If a situation comes up that is negative to a member, we will     stand by them and certainly for the sake of peace, hear both sides; however,     if a negative situation comes up, the Guild member is foremost to be instructed     to IGNORE insults, taunts, and role-playing situations, seek a council member,     go into a dungeon, our guild hall or meeting place and ask a member online     for help to resolve the situation. If the situation persists and there is     no member online, it is recommended that all facts be recorded and sent to     one of the Council members so that it will be brought before the Guild to     be discussed. </p>  <p align="left">This Guild is for the purpose of having fun, teaching each other     and others as well. The tenets of the Guild are valued highly, because the     PBK's (Persons Behind Keyboard) want to continue having fun while in the Realms.     We do not begrudge anyone within the Guild the opportunities to experience     role-play as long as they abide by the rules we have agreed upon. We ask that     while using your FOR char and wearing its EPI, you THINK BEFORE YOU ACT and     live by the tenets of this Guild (thanks). </p>  <p align="left">We appreciate your support and continued interest in our Guild.     Hail FOR! </p>  </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="8" height="1" valign="top"><img width="8" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>    <td width="663" height="1" valign="top"><img width="663" height="1" src="transparent.gif"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
