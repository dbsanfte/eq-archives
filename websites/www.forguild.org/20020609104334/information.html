<P ALIGN="center"><B><FONT SIZE="+3">Our History...</FONT></B></P>
  
<P ALIGN="left"><I>Friends of the Realms </I>was established in April, 1995 
    on Sierra's Imagination Network, in the lands of Yserbius, Twinion and Ruins 
    of Cawdor.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Born from a desire to create a small, harmonious group of individuals 
    with the same RPG standards and beliefs, FOR was slowly built with a handful 
    of members. Once it was known that INN was going to be shut down, the beginning 
    members began to seek out a new homeland. At the time, the only available 
    graphical RPG land (or realm, as we call it) was Sierra's &quot;The Realm&quot; and 
    all members moved there.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">During the beta phases of 1x and 2x on The Realm, the members 
    learned the game and taught others. Once again we grew in membership. We also 
    found Empiriana, which was very similar to our original realm and many of 
    our old friends were there. FOR pulled out of Empiriana when it was decided 
    the game was not a good match for the guild.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">While continuing to play in The Realm, we also found Diablo, 
    which did not offer us the opportunity for guild play in numbers beyond six 
    in any given game. Both Diablo and Empiriana have their own merits and remain 
    great games for individual play and are recommended for that purpose.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">With the advent of phase 3x of The Realm, The Realm became a 
    different place to play; it was decided that it was once again time to search 
    for a better homeland. With that in mind, we tested Illusia and found it to 
    be very similar to our old homeland without the great graphics we had become 
    accustomed to, but very well-suited for guild play. The members decided to 
    continue searching and we beta tested and are currently heavily involved in 
    Everquest on the Zebuxoruk server.  We are currently also beta testing Dark Age of Camelot, Legend of Mir and other games for suitability for our guild.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Although we may find a more suitable realm to house FOR in the 
    future, Everquest will continue to be the place that all members can get together 
    in because of cost, availability and the expertise of current members. Even 
    beyond the choice of a new homeland for FOR, our focus will remain to test 
    further lands, so that we may add them to the list of realms we inhabit. We 
    are...<I>Friends of the REALMS!</I></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="+3"><B>The Guild...</B></FONT></P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">If any of the tenets are broken, the Guild member is asked to 
    meet with the council and after the facts are gathered, the matter is to be 
    brought before the guild and settled BY THE GUILD if at all possible. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Each member has the choice to vote on decisions about the Guild, 
    unless an emergency arises or a spur-of-the-moment matter exists. The members 
    of the Council are the governing body, discussing guild issues and policies, 
    guild events to be held, any new ideas or suggestions brought forth by the 
    membership and then the information is sent on to the members for voting. 
  </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">EPI's (or Guild Designation) in games are all FOR. The guild 
    designation (FOR) is requested to NOT be a part of the member's chosen character 
    name. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Meetings will be held on our new live chatroom on our guild website, or when 
    there is a need online, usually notified in advance via email or the Guild MOTD online. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">All prospective members (recruits) who wish to be inducted into 
    the Guild will be given a trial period of 30 days and their request for membership 
    will be voted on BY THE GUILD. If it is deemed by the membership that not 
    enough members have had the opportunity to get to know the PM, then an extension 
    of two weeks will be given the PM to offer the opportunity for further evaluation 
    on both the part of the PM and the guild members. The PM is to be treated 
    with respect and if they are not FOR material, the vote will show that after 
    the 30-day trial period. We encourage showing and teaching the PM the FOR 
    way by our own actions. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Anyone wishing to join the Guild does not have to use their 
    main char name and may make up a new character name for use within FOR. Having 
    other chars or being in other guilds is a personal choice (founder discourages 
    this as it takes away from time and dedication to FOR), but your FOR char 
    shall strictly be for/with FOR (thanks). </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Each member is to be treated with respect and dignity and guild 
    matters are to remain within the guild. After recruitment is maximized, members 
    are encouraged to help others, quest or just to listen and talk to them. We 
    are Friends of the Realms and are experienced RPG players who feel that the 
    game is for fun, not treachery nor negative personal gain. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">We do not war. We do not condone violence or fighting. Any member 
    who wishes to do so will not use their FOR char for these purposes. PvP (player 
    versus player) is not allowed, except dueling for the purposes of training 
    skills within our sub-guilds WEB (Woodland Elves Brigade) and IL (Ishtars Light). Members who wish to participate 
    in dueling may do so with their WEB or IL char, as long as they adhere to the rules 
    of honor and fair play. Dueling will be utilized for the purposes of testing 
    or training in skills or sparring - NEVER in anger or to settle a dispute.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left"> If a situation comes up that is negative to a member, we will 
    stand by them and certainly for the sake of peace, hear both sides; however, 
    if a negative situation comes up, the Guild member is foremost to be instructed 
    to IGNORE insults, taunts, and role-playing situations, seek a council member, 
    go into a dungeon, our guild hall or meeting place and ask a member online 
    for help to resolve the situation. If the situation persists and there is 
    no member online, it is recommended that all facts be recorded and sent to 
    one of the Council members so that it will be brought before the Guild to 
    be discussed. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">This Guild is for the purpose of having fun, teaching each other 
    and others as well. The tenets of the Guild are valued highly, because the 
    PBK's (Persons Behind Keyboard) want to continue having fun while in the Realms. 
    We do not begrudge anyone within the Guild the opportunities to experience 
    role-play as long as they abide by the rules we have agreed upon. We ask that 
    while using your FOR char and wearing its EPI, you THINK BEFORE YOU ACT and 
    live by the tenets of this Guild (thanks). </P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">We appreciate your support and continued interest in our Guild. 
    Hail FOR! </P>
