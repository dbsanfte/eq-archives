<P ALIGN="left"><I>Friends of the Realms </I>was established in April, 1995 
    on Sierra's Imagination Network, in the lands of Yserbius, Twinion and Ruins 
    of Cawdor.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Born from a desire to create a small, harmonious group of individuals 
    with the same RPG standards and beliefs, FOR was slowly built with a handful 
    of members. Once it was known that INN was going to be shut down, the beginning 
    members began to seek out a new homeland. At the time, the only available 
    graphical RPG land (or realm, as we call it) was Sierra's &quot;The Realm&quot; and 
    all members moved there.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">During the beta phases of 1x and 2x on The Realm, the members 
    learned the game and taught others. Once again we grew in membership. We also 
    found Empiriana, which was very similar to our original realm and many of 
    our old friends were there. FOR pulled out of Empiriana when it was decided 
    the game was not a good match for the guild.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">While continuing to play in The Realm, we also found Diablo, 
    which did not offer us the opportunity for guild play in numbers beyond six 
    in any given game. Both Diablo and Empiriana have their own merits and remain 
    great games for individual play and are recommended for that purpose.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">With the advent of phase 3x of The Realm, The Realm became a 
    different place to play; it was decided that it was once again time to search 
    for a better homeland. With that in mind, we tested Illusia and found it to 
    be very similar to our old homeland without the great graphics we had become 
    accustomed to, but very well-suited for guild play. The members decided to 
    continue searching and we beta tested and are currently heavily involved in 
    Everquest on the Zebuxoruk server.  We are currently also beta testing Dark Age of Camelot, Legend of Mir and other games for suitability for our guild.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="left">Although we may find a more suitable realm to house FOR in the 
    future, Everquest will continue to be the place that all members can get together 
    in because of cost, availability and the expertise of current members. Even 
    beyond the choice of a new homeland for FOR, our focus will remain to test 
    further lands, so that we may add them to the list of realms we inhabit. We 
    are...<I>Friends of the REALMS!</I></P>
