<P>Tenets of the Guild:  Honesty, Integrity, Honor, Loyalty, Respect and Fun</P>

<P>Basis of Guild:  An elite harmonious group of eventually 30 people, dedicated to the tenets of the Guild.  If any of the above tenets are broken, the Guild member is then brought before the entire Guild and the matter is to be settled BY THE GUILD.</P>
 

<P>Each member has equal say and voting rights when making guild decisions if they so choose, unless an emergency arises or a spur-of-the-moment matter exists.  The members of the Council are there to guide members, assure the tenets and guidelines are adhered to and to assist the founder in setting agenda for guild policy decision-making, assess the state of the guild and to bring information from the membership to the council.</P>

<P>EPI's (or Guild Designation) in games are all FOR.  Titles can be awarded by the founder based on a "strength of character" of a char, a role within the guild or perhaps a favorite pasttime; at times the founder may just do it for no reason ;p  The guild designation (FOR) is requested to NOT be a part of the member's chosen guild name.</P>

<P>Meetings will be held when we can all get together, or when there is a majority online, usually notified in advance via email or the Guild newsletter.</P>

<P>All prospective members (recruits) who wish to be inducted into the Guild will be given a trial period of 45 days from date of receipt of application, which will be forwarded to all members (link to form provided below) will be voted on BY THE GUILD.  No one under 17 is accepted unless the Guild as a whole agrees to the exception.</P>

<P>Anyone wishing to join the Guild does not have to use their main char name, however, Guild matters remain within the Guild.  You MAY use your main char name, provided the following:  he/she is not currently in any other guild, has no outstanding disputes with any other guilds or individuals and is a char of good alignment.  You may make up a new char for FOR and a wood elf char for the subguild, Wood Elf Brigade.  Having other chars or being in other guilds is a personal choice, but your FOR char shall strictly be for/with FOR (thanks).</P>

<P>Each member is to be treated with respect and dignity.  Members are encouraged to help others, whether they are in a guild or not, to spar/duel with honor for the purpose of training, be an active participant in guild quests or activities, or just to listen and talk to fellow members and prospective members.  We are Friends of the Realms...originally encompassing the INN Realms of Yserbius, Twinion and Ruins of Cawdor; we are experienced RPG players who feel that the game is for fun, not treachery nor negative personal gain.  </P>

<P>Our home Realm for the time being is Everquest.  We would prefer that everyone be in Everquest on the E'Ci server and playing in the current game is a requirement for guild membership.  Not all players play in all games nor together at any given time, but active participation is highly encouraged.  Please also fill in a member form (link is below).</P>

<P>We would like to know about other graphic (not text-based) RPG games, as most of us are testing, searching for other realms to consider.</P>

<P>We do not war.  If a situation comes up that is negative to a member, we will stand by them and certainly for the sake of peace, hear both sides; however, if a negative situation comes up, the Guild member is foremost to be instructed to IGNORE insults, taunts, and role-playing situations and go into a dungeon, our guild hall or meeting place and ask a member online for help to resolve the situation.  If the situation persists and there is no member online, it is recommended that all facts be recorded and sent to one of the Council members so that it will be brought before the Guild to be discussed. </P>

<P>This Guild is only for the purpose of having fun, teaching each other and others as well.  The tenets of the Guild are valued highly, because the PBK's (Persons Behind Keyboard) want to continue having fun while in the Realms.  We do not condone violence or fighting.  Any member who wishes to do so, will not use their FOR char for these purposes.  We do not begrudge anyone within the Guild the opportunities to experience role-play in whatever form they choose - all we ask is that while using your FOR char and wearing its EPI, you THINK BEFORE YOU ACT and live and abide by the guidelines and tenets of this Guild (thanks).</P>

<P>We appreciate your support and continued interest in our Guild.  Hail FOR!</P>
