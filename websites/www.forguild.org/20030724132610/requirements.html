<P>Requirements for membership are listed below.  What you choose to do with any other chars not in FOR is up to you.  (PM = prospective member.)</P>

<OL>
<LI>Members must be at least 17 years of age in real life.  Submitting false information on application will result in immediate termination of membership.</LI>
<LI>Members cannot be in any other guild with the char they will be playing with in FOR.  Although it is a person's right to be in multiple guilds, the founder discourages it to enable more time to be devoted to FOR as well as a better showing on the game for a small guild.</LI>
<LI>Members must not have any outstanding disputes with other guilds or individuals.  If so, settle them before filling out the application with FOR.</LI>
<LI>One main char, multiple alternate chars, multiple WEB chars and multiple IL chars per member are allowed in FOR's family of guilds.  This allows for maximum guild participation on Everquest and variety in character play in order for members to stay together.</LI>
<LI>The gender of the member must be the same as that of the PBK (person behind keyboard) for any char.</LI>
<LI>Members must attempt (whenever possible) to display positive actions with their chars.  FOR has a good reputation and negative actions of players do not demonstrate the goals and tenets of FOR.  If you have a problem, please see a council member online or send info via email or on Guild Portal.  We encourage positive actions to make our gaming communities more positive for us as well as other players.  If you wish to roleplay being negative, please either put your char into our subguild IL or make SURE that the people you are speaking with know you are roleplaying.</LI>
<LI>Dueling is only allowed with the WEB and IL chars, if one is made, not the main or alternate FOR chars.  PvP is not allowed with ANY char.</LI>
</OL>

<B><FONT SIZE="+3"></FONT></B>

<P>That which makes FOR unique are not only the people, but its basic constant 
    principles:</P>
  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    
<P>1. A small group of close friends who share the same ideals and wish to 
      spend time together. </P>
    
<P>2. To teach and show others that a game environment does not have to be 
      negative - we can make a difference through our actions, using a strong 
      positive image with a positive char. </P>
    
<P>3. A governing body of the founder and council with all members having 
      a voice and the right to share their opinions. </P>
    
<P>4. An adult-oriented guild whereby the members would not have to &quot;babysit&quot; 
      nor censure themselves in a game environment.</P>
    
<P> 5. In keeping with the Truth tenet and expecting trust between members, 
      characters and PBK (person behind keyboard) are to be of the same gender. 
    </P>
    
<P>6. That we would explore new places to play in order to expand our horizons 
      and keep interest in FOR. </P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>Please go to our Application tab and select the appropriate application you are seeking.</P>

<P>We appreciate your support and continued interest in our Guild.  Hail FOR!</P>
