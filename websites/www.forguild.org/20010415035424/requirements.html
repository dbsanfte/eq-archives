<P>Requirements for membership are listed below.  What you choose to do with any other chars not in FOR is up to you.  (PM = prospective member.)</P>

<OL>
<LI>Members must be at least 17 years of age.  Exceptions to this rule would be voted on by guild members.</LI>
<LI>Members cannot be in any other guild with the char they will be playing with in FOR.  Although it is a person's right to be in multiple guilds, the founder discourages it to enable more time to be devoted to FOR as well as a better showing on the game for a small guild.</LI>
<LI>Members must not have any outstanding disputes with other guilds or individuals.  If so, settle them before filling out the application with FOR.</LI>
<LI>Only main char, alternate chars (number to be determined), one WEB char and one IL char per member allowed in FOR.  This allows for maximum guild participation on Everquest and variety in character play in order for members to stay together.</LI>
<LI>The gender of the member must be the same as that of the PBK (person behind keyboard) for any char.</LI>
<LI>Members must be of good alignment.  Char type cannot be in any way a negative char type as defined by the game or the actions of the player; most games attach negative gameplay parameters onto a negative-type char.  Although a member may wish to be a thief, for instance, the game would MAKE them negative just by their having to advance in thieving and other negative actions.  In the game of Everquest, those char types of Rogues, Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, Shadowknights, Necromancers and the like are not allowed.</LI>
<LI>Dueling is only allowed with the WEB and IL chars, if one is made, not the main or alternate FOR chars.  PvP is not allowed with ANY char.</LI>
</OL>
