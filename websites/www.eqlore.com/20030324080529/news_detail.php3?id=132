Breaking news this afternoon... Sony has officially acquired Verant Interactive in it's ongoing strategy to develop Sony Online Entertainment(SOE) as the premier source of hardcore multiplayer online games. Despite the housecleaning SOE's new chief, Kelly Flock seems to be inflicting on their corporation, Verant will most likely remain untouched, as they are the premier developers of exactly the type of games SOE wants to produce. Here is the official press release distributed today...<BR><BR>

<B>SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES ONLINE GAMING COMPANY VERANT INTERACTIVE & APPOINTS KELLY FLOCK AS PRESIDENT & CEO OF SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT (SOE)</B><BR><BR>

Verant Becomes Part of SOE as Sony Pictures Entertainment Takes Steps to Strengthen Its Interactive Gaming Leadership Position<BR><BR>

CULVER CITY, CA, May 31, 2000—Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) announced today it has acquired the online games company Verant Interactive, Inc. and named prominent digital gaming executive Kelly Flock as president and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) to bolster SOE’s position as the dominant cyber-destination for interactive game enthusiasts.<BR><BR>

Verant, a San Diego-based development studio that creates and markets cutting-edge online games, will be merged into SOE as part of SOE’s effort to concentrate on becoming the premier attraction for interactive gaming enthusiasts from its new San Diego headquarters. With a staff of more than 150 software developers, Verant has been responsible for operating the popular online games EverQuest®, Tanarus&trade; and Sovereign&trade;. Verant President John Smedley will remain with SOE as executive vice president and chief operating officer.<BR><BR>

Mr. Flock will supervise the development of engaging new interactive games by SOE and Verant, and will oversee SOE’s award-winning Web site, the Station@sony.com, which features EverQuest, the top-selling online PC game title, and such popular attractions for non-paying, casual users as Wheel of Fortune, JEOPARDY! and Trivial Pursuit Online.<BR><BR>

Yair Landau, president of SPE’s recently created Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment (SPDE) unit, which includes SOE, said the acquisition of privately-held Verant and Mr. Flock’s appointment reinforces SPE’s determination to fortify its online businesses and enable SOE to deliver the most exciting, cutting-edge, network gaming to interactive consumers.<BR><BR>

In Mr. Flock’s previous role as president of the interactive game company 989 Studios, he oversaw the rapid growth of EverQuest into an interactive gaming powerhouse. Under his supervision, EverQuest broke all subscription-based online gaming sales records, reaching more than 250,000 paid subscribers and 350,000 units sold. During peak periods online, more than 60,000 people can play EverQuest simultaneously, acting as adventurers and dragon slayers in cyberspace. Average playing time per player is about 20 hours a week.<BR><BR>

"As the pre-eminent executive in the interactive gaming community, Kelly Flock is perfectly suited to build on Sony Online Entertainment’s leadership position and lift it to new levels of excellence," said Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America (SCA). "With all of his wonderful skills, talent and creativity, we’re delighted that Kelly will continue to work his digital magic in the extended Sony family."<BR><BR>

"We’re delighted to welcome Verant and Kelly into the fold at a time when interactive gaming is an increasingly important part of our business portfolio," said Mel Harris, co-president and chief operating officer for Sony Pictures Entertainment. "Considering that consumers worldwide spent nearly $7 billion on computer games last year, we look to Kelly and his team at SOE to broaden our base and make us a pre-eminent force in this fast-growing business."<BR><BR>

"The acquisition of Verant is a very natural fit for us, considering the way our companies have worked together on games like EverQuest. And, we’ve been very interested in having Kelly join us for some time," Mr. Landau said. "Kelly is a world-class executive who commands enormous respect in the interactive gaming universe. As we focus more and more on SOE becoming a pure gaming company, we’re pleased to bring aboard both a high-profile industry leader like Kelly and to acquire an innovative gaming leader in Verant to oversee both our ‘casual’ gaming, led by such tent-pole properties as Wheel of Fortune and JEOPARDY!, and our pay programming led by the hot-selling EverQuest."<BR><BR>

"I continue to believe that online gaming is the fastest-growing, most exciting area of interactive entertainment," Mr. Flock said. "It is a great honor to be able to rejoin the pioneers at SOE and the EverQuest development teams, under John Smedley’s direction at Verant, in furthering our goal of facilitating the next evolution in games. Sony Online Entertainment has the edge in technology and content, and I am excited by the opportunity to create and lead the next mass-market category of gaming."<BR><BR>

The appointment of Mr. Flock, a longtime Sony executive, as president of SOE coincides with a shift in emphasis and location for the interactive gaming concern. The company has sharpened its focus on SOE as a creator and distributor of all kinds of networked gaming, and has moved its headquarters from New York to San Diego, where Mr. Flock will be based.<BR><BR>

Mr. Flock was appointed president of Sony Imagesoft in March 1995. Imagesoft evolved into Sony Computer Entertainment America’s (SCEA’s) sole North American development studio before launching as 989 Studios&trade;, an SCEA wholly-owned independent PlayStation publisher, in April 1998. In that position, he was responsible for day-to-day operations of the cross-platform, multimedia entertainment software company and reported directly to Ken Kutaragi, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc., who was recently named to the Board of Directors of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation.<BR><BR>

Before joining Sony, Mr. Flock held various senior executive positions at LucasArts Entertainment Company and other interactive entertainment companies, including Electronic Arts and Activision. During his tenure with LucasArts Entertainment Company, the company emerged as one of the leading CD-ROM publishers in the industry. He obtained his B.A. in English literature from San Francisco State University.<BR><BR>
