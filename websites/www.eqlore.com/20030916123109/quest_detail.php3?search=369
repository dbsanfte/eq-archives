Sultin makes various incandescent items, plus the rod, which are for Enchanters only. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=297">Incandescent Wand:</A>   He needs a Pouch of Silver Dust from the Dusty Werebat in the Estate of Unrest. He also needs a Silver Wand from the Silvered Guard in Cazic Thule, but asks that you get the wand enchanted before you bring it to him.  Both of the components for this quest are no drop. Once you find the Silver Wand, take it to Ezmirella in the gypsy camp in North Karana. Hand her the Silver Wand and 50 gold coins. She will return a Blessed Silver Wand and instruct you to seek out Raine Beteria in the Erudin Library.  Hand Raine the wand and 50 gold coins to receive the Glowing Silver Wand and the following faction adjustments: <I>MerchantsofErudin, HighCouncilofErudin, HighGuardofErudin</I> get better.  You must have a good faction for this, so you may need to use benevolence.  Take the Enchanted Silver Wand and Pouch of Silver Dust back to Sultin. Hand him both and he will give you the Incandescent Wand. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=221">Incandescent Mask:</A>  He needs a <A HREF=" http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=439 ">Glowing Mask</A>, found on the skeletal monk in the caverns of Guk (I have also been told you can get one on the froglock scryer)  and all three Runes of Fortune.  One Rune can be found on the Dark Elf Enynti in the chasm below Castle Mistmoore.  The other two can each be purchased for 50 gold coins each - one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City Library and the other from Madam Serena in Qeynos. <BR><BR>

<A HREF=" http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=222 ">Incandescent Gloves:</A>  He needs to sew together four other sets of gloves to make these. <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=311">Glowing Gloves</A> from Shadowed Men, Radiant Gloves from Radiant in the mazes of Cazic Thule and Enchanted and Gleaming gloves. For Enchanted Gloves you have to give Tarn Vislin in Highkeep a bloodstone he will then give you Gleaming gloves.  After that bring 50gp and the Gleaming gloves with you to Tizina of the Lavastorm Gypsies.  She will then hand you the Enchanted Gloves.  Now go back to Highkeep for another pair of Gleaming gloves.<BR><BR>

<A HREF=" http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=296">Rod of Insidious Glamour:</A> He needs a golden rod (from a froglok priest in Guk) and an Enchanted Shining Stone.  The enchanted shining stone is made from a Shining Stone from Shadow Men, take that stone to Cynthia, a gypsie in the Rathe Mountains and give it and 50gp to get it enchanted.  Then go to Highkeep and get the stone transmuted.  The two steps for getting the stone each raise faction with beta neutral and can be done separately from the rest of the quest for those who just need a faction boost.<BR><BR>
