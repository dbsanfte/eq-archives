To bad I had to work that night as it sounded like fun!<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#00478E">Hail fellow Norrathians. The drunken cruise on
Wednesday was a succes (for me at least).<BR><BR>
We got a total off about 30 people drunk and still the
booze was not gone.<BR><BR>
First of i'd like to thank Nathanial of the Seekers of Lore
guild for providing me with 600 casks, and of course Torf,
who unselfishly donated about 1000 casks himself.
Without them there would not have been a fest. <BR><BR>
We started out from the freeport docks with aobut 10
drunken friends including GM-Admin Vyriinya who
abstained from drinking but was kind enough to stick with
us and make fun of her drunken guide friend Ankolo, who
i think drank most of the beer we had (30 casks i
believe). <BR><BR>
Also a note of master drinking goes out to Khelbin who
drank more than 30 and didn't fall off the boat! <BR><BR>
Our cruise took us to the Butcherblock Mountains via The
Ocean Of Tears were we shouted our drunken words
through the zone and got hilarious responses form
everyone who was on, a great applause for those people
who dodn't yell out in anger over our babbaling! It was
there that our only casualty fell. My good half-ling friend
Pumpernickle (also known as Kalar the Dwarf by many)
fell into the water in a drunken walk and swam in place
for 40 min before starting his swim to shore....When
finally reaching land at the Sisters Island he was
mistakingly led by a friend to a not so drunk friendly
Cyclops and killed as a result, our hearts are with you
friend. <BR><BR>
All in all we had lot's of fun and I want to thank the 2
GM's for coming and joining in with us showing us the
GM's are just "one-of-the-boys" or girls in Vyriinya's case
(hope i spelled you name right!) <BR><BR>
Until a next time, greetings from Aviger of Fal 'Ngeestra
(<http://www.rpgamers.net/fng>) and all my guildmates!</FONT><BR><BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
