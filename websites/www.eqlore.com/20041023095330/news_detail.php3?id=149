<P>
A young bard entered the room. "Sire, we have had this message passed through our postal network from Kaladim. We believe it to be from one of your guild subordinates who may be in some trouble."
<P>
Aumaar took the proffered scroll, unrolled it and began to read...
<P>
"I write this during my fifth sleepless night. I dare not sleep as my 
dreams are filled with the cries of the tormented dead, and I know that I must return to that place of unrest and bring an end to their pain or else go insane. One face and one voice dominate the nightmares, that of a dwarf, Garanel Rucksif, pleading for release from its unlife.
<P>
"It would perhaps be best to tell you how this started. I had travelled to Dagnor's Cauldron in search of Conium Darkblade, a renowned toxicologist, to purchase supplies and texts from him. Whilst here, I realised that I was 
short on the zombie skins I use when making my own vials and with the Estate of Unrest being nearby, I thought this would be a good time to stock up.
<P>
"Avoiding the numerous aqua goblins that infest the area was easy, and I soon found myself inside the estate. A few swift and stealthy killings later and I had enough zombie skin to last me a little while.
<P>
"It would have been better for me if I had decided to leave at that point, and the nightmares would never have started. I would never have seen that ghost pleading for it's tormented existance to be brought to an end. My curiosity, however, was piqued by the building and what could be found 
within and so I slipped silently into the shadows and looked inside.
<P>
"I found skeletons, ghouls and mummies to begin with, none of which were observant enough to be able to peer into the shadows and see the rogue within.
<P>
"I wandered the estate for a little while, keeping clear of the creatures, until I found my way into the basement, and there, a true horror awaited me. I saw a ghost of a Dwarf, his face contorted with the pain of centuries 
of unlife and hatred of those who live. I crept closer to it, scared witless but my curiosity driving me closer. Who was this figure, tortured so by it's dark existance?
<P>
"I do not know how it became aware of me, perhaps it could see into the shadows, perhaps I breathed too heavily. Whatever it was it turned to face me fully and just for an instant, the madness on the ghosts face cleared and his expression changed to that of the most abject despair I have ever seen, and I heard a voice in my mind as it stretched out an arm in supplication to me.
<P>
"'Give me rest... this cursed place I am bound forever it seems. I cannot break the bonds that tie my soul here. Help me, I beg you...'
<P>
"Before I could react though, the madness descended upon it again. A sword materialised in his hand and the apparition shrieked 'Warm living one, you have intruded and you shall pay the price!' followed by the most blood-curdling laugh I have ever heard.
<P>
"My sense of self preservation finally kicked into play and I ran as I had never run before, the ghost a split second behind. Some of the other denizens struck at me as I passed but I was finally able to make it past the border of the estate where the undead could not follow.
<P>
"I have stayed here in Dagnors resting with Conium Darkblade, but I have had nightmares of that dwarf every time I closed my eyes. It is getting too much. I MUST ACT!
<P>
"I will leave this note with Conium with instructions to get it to Aumaar if possible. I will return to that place of horror and I will try and lay the ghost to rest. I do not know if I can do it but I will ask Bristlebane to protect me and may Ro guide my rapier.

Aumaar rolled the scroll back up and gave the bard some gold for his troubles. Foolish rogue. But still, a Reaper was in trouble and that demanded action...
