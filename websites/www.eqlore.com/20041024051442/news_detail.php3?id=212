*Velious Subscribers*<BR><BR>

Please run the "Velious Patch" off of the patch program.<BR><BR>

*New Patch*<BR><BR>

We appreciate everyone's continued patience over the past couple of days, and are happy to see that the problems that have been experienced are relatively minor compared to those of the past.  Tonight's patch is expected to be the last one we'll have to do for a while, so we hope to have you enjoying Velious over the weekend non-stop.<BR><BR>

Today's patch corrects the following issues:<BR><BR>

- The user interface problems that occurred as of last night have been addressed, such as window positioning and transparency.  Also addressed were problems with targeting, enabling and disabling windows, and switching to and from resolutions above 1280x1024.<BR>
- Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock up when killing giants.<BR>
- Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, and Flurry).  <BR>
- Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones.<BR><BR>

Enjoy your weekend!<BR><BR>

- The EverQuest Team<BR><BR>
