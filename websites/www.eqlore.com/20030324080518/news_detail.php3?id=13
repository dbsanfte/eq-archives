Here is the first part of this interesting interview. I will post the remaining parts as they are published on Games.net.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#00478E"><B>Jason:</B> Let's talk about the Expansion, The Ruins<BR>
of Kunark. As I understand it, there will be one<BR>
race added (yep) and one continent added (yep)<BR>
that will be a level 50 and above kind of area. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Undecided at this point. We are building<BR>
the levels now-- it's too early to decide the level<BR>
spread now. I probably won't do that for another 6<BR>
to 7 months because I want to see where most<BR>
people are on average in the game. So that we<BR>
can serve the sort of demographic that is<BR>
represented in the game and there are enough<BR>
zones to serve those people. So I'm more than<BR>
willing to raise the cap from 50 to whatever if I<BR>
need to but it might not be needed at that time. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Besides the race, continent, new npcs,<BR>
new armor, and weapons, and such will there be<BR>
new skills for the different classes. For example<BR>
Warriors get a new skill at 51. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> If were going to break the level cap of 50 it<BR>
would make sense to add additional skills. We<BR>
may approach it differently, perhaps it only goes<BR>
from 50 to 60 but it takes much longer to go from<BR>
50 to 51 than it takes to go from 49 to 50. And at<BR>
each point perhaps you are called something<BR>
different, maybe the Necromancer could be<BR>
known as a Lich. But we haven't really flushed all<BR>
of that out yet because it's too early. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> When will it be released? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Q1 2000, we would like to release on the<BR>
anniversary. March 16, 2000. But this far in<BR>
advance we don't want to lock ourselves in, we<BR>
are targeting Q1 2000. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> What about ownership of property in the<BR>
expansion, homes and such? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Features like that and even new skills in<BR>
general will probably be added as a patch over<BR>
time. The focus of the expansion is the addition of<BR>
a playable race and a whole new continent to<BR>
explore. And I really want people to understand<BR>
that in terms of other features and things that is<BR>
something that we will add onto the game through<BR>
patches for free. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> How many Zones? On the content. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> I don't want to give out the specifics<BR>
because if I say a number and we end up falling<BR>
short people will be disappointed but it should be<BR>
larger than 15 zones. Kunark is larger than<BR>
Faydwer but not as large and Antonica <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> What is the background of Kunark? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> The race are the lizardmen or Ixar and they<BR>
used to have an entire empire that almost<BR>
encompassed all of Kunark. But their empire has<BR>
since crumbled and they are not at their glory<BR>
right now. But they do have that empire as their<BR>
history behind them. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Will they then start on the island or I<BR>
heard a rumor that they will start in a revamped<BR>
Temple of Cazic Thule?(Lizard men are there now<BR>
for those of you that haven't been there) <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> The new lizard men player race are a<BR>
relative of the more primitive lizard men on<BR>
Antonica. They will start out in their own starting<BR>
city located on Kunark They are neutral evil in<BR>
nature. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Will there be a beta process? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes, a small closed beta to check out the<BR>
balance of the zones, etc.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Okay, let's move onto some general EQ<BR>
questions, it's been 3 and half months when do<BR>
you think you will start to ramp up the GMGuides<BR>
roleplaying quests started in-house by living<BR>
people. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> They are in the process now, they have<BR>
been going on for about 2 to 3 weeks now. Just<BR>
the other night on the test server a GM<BR>
summoned up an army of undead to surround the<BR>
tower in Oasis. We started them out simple<BR>
perhaps a Giant skeleton or something like that.<BR>
We had one where a mad dwarf was running<BR>
around the BB mountains attacking everyone and<BR>
screaming incoherently someone finally figured<BR>
out that he was cursed. They cancelled magic<BR>
him and he was freed from the curse and thanked<BR>
the person who figured it out and gave him a<BR>
reward. We are ramping up the complexity as the<BR>
players are getting used to the idea and honestly<BR>
as the GM/Guides get used to it.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Do you have the manpower with 20<BR>
servers to do quests that are on every server for<BR>
instance? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> No, Probably very individual server kind of<BR>
basis. I'm excited about that because it gives<BR>
each server a kind of flavor. That's not to say<BR>
there could never be a large plot that affects all<BR>
the servers but mostly they will be individual to<BR>
the servers. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Do you have the manpower to create<BR>
quests on an ongoing basis? Is enough to create<BR>
RP on a daily basis? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes I think it's reasonable to assume that<BR>
we will have at least one dynamic quest per day<BR>
per server.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Do you plan to increase this?<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> I think there will be more as the guide<BR>
program fills out. It's a goal to increase the<BR>
dynamic nature of the game.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Are you still adding static quests to the<BR>
game? <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes, we have several people that all they<BR>
do all day long is add quests. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Okay if you are adding them why are<BR>
some quests that were starter quest, I mean they<BR>
came with the game are still broken. For example<BR>
the monk headbands and sashes, you can't get<BR>
the high level of headband because they just don't<BR>
exist.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> But you see that's not broken its just not<BR>
there yet. There is a big difference there. For<BR>
instance the monk quests that are there do work. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> What I mean for instance the natural<BR>
progress is to go up to the Purple headband, or<BR>
sash but you can't get the purple sash because<BR>
the quest isn't there and if you talk to the monk<BR>
guildmaster he tells you they don't have anymore<BR>
to give out.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yea I don't consider those broken they are<BR>
just not implemented.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> I guess perhaps then the question is why<BR>
are wholly new quests being added when the<BR>
quests that came with the game aren't even fully<BR>
implemented? The opinion of some players is that<BR>
it's not a matter of not being implemented but that<BR>
the game came out of the box broke. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> I think that is definitely not the way to look<BR>
at it. I think that is some players being used to<BR>
single player games, where you buy the box and<BR>
that is what you get with the game. We put in<BR>
areas that don't exist yet, NPCs talking about<BR>
things that don't exist yet. To me that makes<BR>
sense it's a clue or indication of things to come.<BR>
So if one of our game designers goes in and puts<BR>
in the framework for a huge quest that will take<BR>
him 6 months to complete and some of his NPCs<BR>
talk about different aspects that aren't completed<BR>
yet I don't consider that to be broken, but<BR>
something to look forward to. And you will see all<BR>
sorts of references to that in game. <BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> What about quests for instance, and I<BR>
know this has to be a bug, a quest when…. <BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Oh don't get me wrong, there are quests<BR>
out there that are broken and we fix those as<BR>
soon as we can. But I also need people to<BR>
understand that it's a continual process, we are<BR>
continually putting in new quests and going<BR>
through revising old quests. For instance quests<BR>
where we feel the reward is insufficient going back<BR>
and making better rewards. It's a constant<BR>
process. But since we aren't perfect people and<BR>
we are adding to the game more bugs will be<BR>
added. I kinda want people to understand that<BR>
there will always be things like that by having a<BR>
game that is never finished being made. It's a<BR>
completely different mindset than a single player<BR>
game.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Playing devil's advocate I think some<BR>
player think that before you add even one new<BR>
quest, implement all the quests that are<BR>
mentioned out of the box. For instance back to<BR>
the monks, before you add any new monk<BR>
quests, fix the sashes and headbands.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> But you see we aren't looking at it like that.<BR>
Because the quest game designers sit down and<BR>
look at it, they read email, read the boards, listen<BR>
to the feedback and they look at the world. And<BR>
they think sure there could be another 10 monk<BR>
headbands and sash quests up to black or pooka<BR>
dot right but over here in the Troll hometown there<BR>
aren't nearly as many quests as in Qeynos. So<BR>
they think am I going to finish up the monk<BR>
quests which will never really be finished which<BR>
I've already put in a month into or should I help<BR>
the Shadow knights in Feerriot which have only<BR>
had 2 weeks spent on them.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
