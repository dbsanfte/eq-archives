Yet more restrictions (*sigh*). I have been watching this forum since the big changes went into effect, and while the flames are much less prevailent, I see no real change in the "general mood" of the posters nor in the topics of choice. I have also sadly seen evidence that Abashi has closed posts only because they were "dead topics", even though they were not addressed to Verant.<BR><BR>

It is dissapointing to see that almost all of Abashi's attention on these new boards is focused on making his life easier. Posters were shut out, rules of conduct were added, and posts are deleted... all in an effort to make sure that only the topics that meet Verant's approval are ever presented on their forums.<BR><BR>

Here is the text of the additional rules added...<BR><BR>

Hello all,<BR><BR>

We're quite pleased with the way the boards are working out so far, and hope that they will continue in this fashion. That said, there are a couple other issues that we need to address in order to facilitate the board's continued usefulness:<BR><BR>

Nerf Requests: We're going to begin closing requests to nerf others classes. It becomes a fairly common occurance when it's apparent that we aren't going to upgrade another class. Nerf requests are very inflamatory and are a breeding ground for all-out flame wars. As we don't want to have to liberally ban people if it can be handled via other means, closing the threads is probably the best action we could take.<BR><BR>

Dead issues: We'll also begin closing threads, explicitly or implicitly addressed to us, that we consider dead issues, issues that we've addressed already and consider "locked down". You all can feel free to continue discussing the issue amongst yourselves, but if it's a "Verant please read!" thread, and we consider the issue closed, we'll close the thread as well. We're going to do this in hopes of making room for new threads on other subjects that just can't seem to draw much interest on their first go-around. Rather than have a dozen threads pop up asking us to continue explaining the issue, this might be the best course of action.<BR><BR>

In addition, I'm going to create a "dead issue" section of the FAQ for these things as they continue to come up. We realize that not everyone can read everything on the boards every day, so we should have the data available someplace.<BR><BR>
