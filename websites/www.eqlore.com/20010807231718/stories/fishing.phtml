		<FONT SIZE="+1">I</FONT>t was a beautiful, clear morning in East Karana when Galun finally decided to roll out of his bed and take a look outside his tent. It had been raining when he set up camp the night before, and as this was his first day in East Karana, he was wary of sleeping in this very dangerous area. He had heard rumors of giants that walked the valley and of other vicious creatures that liked to prey on incautious people. But being a warrior, Galun didn't put much value to people's stories unless he saw it with his own eyes. The sun was just beginning to climb over the rolling hills and the sounds of life began to echo throughout the land. It had been quite a long time since Galun had seen a sunrise and he pondered this thought as he sat there and watched the sun climb slowly higher. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">B</FONT>y his calendar, it was Saturday, a day that people in Qeynos, his hometown, usually dedicated to rest and recreation. After cleaning himself up in a small stream nearby, Galun finished donning his armor and began to fix himself a meager breakfast. As he sat there and ate, Galun noticed an oblong pole sticking out from beneath his gear. It was the fishing pole that he had bought in Freeport a few months back. Smiling to himself, he now knew how he was going to spend much of today. After finishing off his vegetable pie and small piece of meat, Galun packed up his gear and set out across the plains.
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">A</FONT>s he made his way toward the river that divides North and East Karana, Galun was harassed by a few gorge hounds and a griffawn or two, but nothing that caused him to break even the slightest sweat. He was glad that he decided to wear his armor. Even though the day was already dedicated to fishing, he knew that the denizens of these plains never took vacations and that he must keep his eyes and ears open for any sign of trouble. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">A</FONT>s Galun crossed through a meadow tended by Druids, he finally saw the great river before him and the lush hills of North Qeynos on the other side. Galun stopped for a moment to speak with one of the Druids and a very wise Treant who told him what kind of fish could be caught in the river. They were even kind enough to supply him with some bait! 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">G</FONT>alun smacked himself as he made his way down the embankment towards the river. He had all the right gear except for the most important thing...bait!! He saw a small tree growing near the river's edge and decided to set up shop there. The weather was simply wonderful and even now he saw an occasional fish leap out of the water, attacking a small insect that had flew too close to the water. Opening up a small flask of Faygo, Galun baited his hook and cast it out about 30 feet from shore. As he watched his bobber float calmly on the water's surface, he realized just how long it had been since he had actually gone fishing. His close friend and fellow Seeker of Lore, Crystalreine Lionsbane, had introduced him to the past time when they were in Freeport months ago. She was already quite well adept at the sport and as she was pulling up fish by the buckets, Galun managed only a few fish scales, a pair of boots, and a rusty dagger. Galun chuckled at the memory, knowing that it only took him a few hours before he himself was catching some decent sized fish.
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">H</FONT>ours passed and the morning gave way to high noon. Galun looked down to the bucket of trout that lay at his feet and smiled. He would eat very well tonight and probably the next few days. The air had gotten hot and the small tree was barely giving any protection. As he cast his line out once more, Galun dazed in and out of consciousness. He tried to wake himself, but couldn't and before too long, Galun was fast asleep. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">I</FONT>t didn't seem too long before Galun was awakened by a loud rumbling sound. Startled from sleep, Galun dropped the pole he was holding and stood to see what was causing the commotion. As he looked up the bank he saw one of the ugliest creatures he had ever seen running toward him. It was a Cyclops, and it was making ground quite rapidly. Galun had heard tales of these giant, one-eyed beasts and how they loved to feed on sentient beings, especially humans and elves. Galun now knew that this was one tale that had become vividly and nightmarishly true. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">T</FONT>he thing was fast for its size and was upon Galun before he could even fully prepare himself. With one swat of its giant hand, Galun found himself thrown into the water. It announced its name as Broon and made sure that Galun knew he was going to be lunch for this powerful giant. With this, Broon once again rushed at Galun and tried to stomp him with a large foot.  But Galun had planned for this and while Broon introduced itself to him, Galun reached under the water and located a large stone. As the creature drew near to the water's edge, Galun threw the stone with an assassin's accuracy and smote the beast in its eye. Broon reeled back and howled in pain. Galun realized his chance and dove for his sword. Quickly taking a swig of Faygo from his flask, Galun charged the stunned beast and swung his Langseax of the Wolves with all his might and cut a large gash in the giant's knee. Broon roared in pain and swung its arms crazily, once again knocking Galun to the ground with such force that it knocked the wind out of him. Galun attempted to stand as sight finally returned to Broon, howbeit hazy. Broon's eye had a small gash as the stone had done its damage. Once again, Broon closed the ground between itself  and Galun and took another swing at the warrior. Galun had not fully stood up as the swing went over his head. Galun, noticing a free shot at the unbalanced giant, swung his sword and scored another ugly gash, this time to the creature's side. Broon stumbled back and a look of amazement seemed to fill its eyes, like it was surprised that a creature this small could deal so much pain to it. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">I</FONT>t didn't take long for Broon to clear its head and rush Galun once more. This time it's aim was true and Broon landed two crushing blows on Galun, the last of the two sending Galun to the ground. Blood now rushed from a cut in Galun's arm and he could feel himself losing consciousness again. Galun cried out to Rodcet Nife for help as he stood once more. Suddenly, Galun saw a bright glow around his body and could feel his wounds healing. Looking up the hill, he noticed an Elven Cleric casting a healing spell on him. Relieved at the aid from this stranger, he regained his balance and joined the fight once more. With a fierce determination in his eyes, Galun ran straight for the creature and swung, scoring a severe cut to the creature's stomach. As the creature bent over in pain, Galun leapt atop one of the creature's knees, spun around and sliced downward, beheading the Cyclops and sending both of them tumbling to the ground. 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">A</FONT>s he lay there dazed for a moment, Galun looked up and saw the Elven Cleric and an older Dwarf Warrior coming to help him to his feet. Galun stood up slowly and dusted himself off. "Well done!" the Dwarf said with a grin on his face. "I haven't seen a fight like that in quite a while!" No sooner had the Dwarf finished his sentence than once again the sound of rumbling filled the air. Looking behind him, Galun saw another Cyclops, this one much larger, running toward the corpse of Broon. "You killed my brother!!! Droon will make you pay with your life, puny things!!!" 
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">T</FONT>he trio of adventurers didn't need a moment more to know that this fight could not be won and made a dash for the bridge to North Karana. With Droon right on their tails, they made their way up and over the bridge and through the magical barrier that separates the two Karanas.
		<P>
		<FONT SIZE="+1">O</FONT>nce through the barrier, the trio fell to the ground exhausted. Unbeknownst to Galun, Droon had scored a glancing blow to the Dwarf, damaging its helmet. Where once there were two large horns emerging from its helmet, now there was only one. The other one was dangling by a small piece of metal. And as Galun sat there on the ground and cleaned the blood and dirt from his sword and armor, he knew that it was going to be a long time before he went fishing in East Karana again!
