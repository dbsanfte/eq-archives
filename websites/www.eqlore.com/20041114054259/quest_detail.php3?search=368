Morin Shadowbane, the ranger guildmaster of the forest, sends you on a quest for the new ranger only weapon, the <A HREF=" http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=315">Short Sword of Morin</A>. There are two ways to get the sword.  (1)  If you trade in an Ebony Bladed Sword to Morin, you will get a Short Sword of Morin , a Ranger only weapon; or  (2) She will also tell you that she will give
you her personal sword if you find and kill the Ghoul Messenger, who is located "between Kithicor and the Karanas" and bring back his note, or whatever he drops.  The messenger spawns somewhere in Western Karana, is tough to anyone not in his 30's, and is always running.  He drops a map of Kithicor.  Take that map back and you will also receive the sword. You get the same sword for doing this as for trading the Ebony Bladed Sword.<BR><BR>
