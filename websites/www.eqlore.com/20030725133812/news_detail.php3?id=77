<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="ariel"><B>Y</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">our mighty leader Sorontar and myself have come upon some disturbing information. A fortnight past, we intercepted a foul Gnoll messenger bound for Blackburrow from Infected Paw. Once slain, we found upon his corpse many documents. These documents gave vague reference to a planned re-population of their stronghold, Infected Paw. The gnolls have apparently made alliance with an, as yet unknown, race of warrior creatures. All we know about them so far is that they are much, much stronger then their predecessors ever were, and that they plan to move into Paw sometime after the 1st day of the final month, December. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="ariel"><B>T</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">herefore, it has been decided that the Seekers must make a bold attempt to learn all we can about our new foes, and to that task we are planning an assault on Infected Paw immediately following the re-population. We invite any and all Seekers to join us in front of Paw on Wednesday, December 1st at 4pm as those on the East Coast measure time. For you members in the West who call Qeynos and Erudin home, this would be 1pm. If our information is correct, this is the most likely time when the change will be taking place, and we should have the advantage of total surprise by attacking them this soon afterward. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="ariel"><B>A</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">s well, because it is rumored that these new tenants of Paw are extremely dangerous, much more so then their allies the Gnolls, it would be wise for only those members who have achieved their 20th season and more, to attend this assault. Information suggests that anyone below this level would be ineffectual against such foul beasts, and would suffer a quick death as a result. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="ariel"><B>B</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">ut do not despair, any that are not high enough to join the Paw assault! We have a plan to attack foul Blackburrow as well. It is hoped that by occupying the Gnolls in Blackburrow at the same time as we assault Infected Paw, we can prevent them from sending reinforcements from that foul nest and the surrounding Qeynos Hills. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="ariel"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel"> regret that I myself can not join in this glorious endeavor, so in my place I am sending one of my Officers of war…. Ogran Wrymbane, a Greenblood warrior shaman of the 26th season. I hope he has a great victory to report to me afterwards! </FONT><BR><BR>

<B>OOC</B><BR><BR>

<B>What:</B><BR>
A planned assault on Infected Paw right after the patch on Wednesday, December 1st at 4pm EST (1pm PST & 9pm GMT). Rumors suggest this is the most likely time that Verant will move the Paw changes to the Live servers. If they do not do it at this time, the event will be rescheduled for right after the NEXT patch, hopefully the following week.<BR><BR>

As well, it is highly likely that anyone below level 20 will suffer a quick death in the new Paw, and we do not suggest you attempt it. Therefore, so that all players below 20 can participate, we have planned an assault on Blackburrow as well, at the same time.<BR><BR> 

<B>Where:</B><BR>
This event is mainly planned for the Tarew Marr server, as we have not had any real guild-wide events on our server for a long time. However, I invite any of the other servers we have members on to organize their own assaults on Paw for after the patch. I will post any result your representatives send to me, after such a battle, to our website for all members to see.<BR><BR>

<B>Details:</B><BR>
For the Paw assault, we will group in front of the dungeon (loc. -3200,+800) at 4pm EST to form up our groups. For those who can not bind themselves, we will have members on hand who can bind you in the Arena zone to the south. Merchants nearby are the Centaurs to the NE of Paw (loc. +200,-2400) and the Aviak merchant at the top of their village to the south (loc. -6800, +1150). The Aviak merchant may be dead if he is camped at the time, or they may be aggressive to you. Consider them before trying to approach. As for food, I think the closest place to buy it is from the Gypsies in Lake Rathetear to the south. They are aggressive to 'Evil' races, so you may want to stock up before coming to Paw.<BR><BR>

For the Blackburrow assault, I would suggest grouping in front of the entrance to BB, in the Qeynos hills, at the same time as we are at Paw. For bind points , non casters can choose between North Qeynos, or Surefall glades, both nearby. For evil races, best bet would be to bind just inside the North Qeynos zone, or down in the catacombs at the Bloodsaber guild, if they are non aggressive to you.<BR><BR>
