Gardern and Vilissia will make several items for wizards:<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=299">Staff of Temperate Flux:</A> (Gardern)  He needs a Heart of Fire from an Inferno Goblin Wizard in the Caverns of Solusek, a Heart of Frost from a Goblin Wizard in the Caverns of Permafrost, a Rod of Bone from a Stone Skeleton by the shores of Lake Rathe and a Staff of Ro (also known as the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=298">Darkwood Staff</A>).<BR><BR>
 
<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=300">Weeping Wand:</A> (Gardern) He needs a Silver Wand (from a silvered guard in Cazic), A Bloodback Wand (from giant skeletons in Mount Rathe), Twice-Woven Silk from a Faerie Guard in Faydark, and a Scepter of Sorrow from the Tomb in Castle Mistmoore. I have been told that you will need to pick up the flower (looks like a bag) in the tomb house (the one  where you can fall down through two trap holes) in graveyard, then give the  flower to the named shadowed man ssylore(something similiar) right behind the tomb house and he will then give you a scepter of sorrows.   You can also find the sceptor in Lower Guk. Bring them all back and get the weeping wand. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=110">Tishan's Kilt:</A> This quest begins at Vilissia in the temple of Solusek Ro. You must obtain a Shadowed Ball from a shadowed man. You must then hike it to Everfrost and give this item to Trankia. (Loc pos 2662,neg 2240)<BR><BR> 

Trankia ask you to avenge his brothers death. Goto Upper Guk by the entrance to live side of Lower Guk and bring back his brother's head. There is a froglok here who drops the Barbarian's Head. This froglok is in a group of 3 frogloks and by 2 other froglok groups (Hint: Think Shinta). Give the barbarian's head to her and she gives you a reminder note, and asks you to kill Martar Icebear (Karg's brother) and return with the Warthread Kilt which he drops. To find Martar hang around the ice river by the ice giant statue(approx loc 2130,-5857) however remember that he is a roaming NPC and spawn every 6 hrs. So stay sharp and keep on the prowl. Return to Trinkia and give her the kilt and the 2 reminder notes and she will give you the Tishan's Kilt.<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=111">Acumen Mask:</A> This quest begins at Vilissia in the temple of Solusek Ro. She needs a Glowing Mask from a Skeletal Monk in the Caverns of Guk, A Patch of Shadow from a Shadowed Man, a Darkbone Skull from a Darkbone Skeleton in the Estate of Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a Goblin Headmaster in the Ocean of Tears. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=112">Runescale Cloak:</A> This quest begins at Vilissia in the temple of Solusek Ro. She needs a Lizardscale Cloak from the Temple of Cazic Thule and the three Runes of Scale. All three can be found on Crocodiles - Saltwater Crocodiles in the Caverns of Guk, Deepwater Crocodiles in the Oasis of Marr and Firescale Crocodiles in mountains of Lavastorm.<BR><BR>
