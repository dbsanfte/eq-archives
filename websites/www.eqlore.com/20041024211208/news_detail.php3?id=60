<B>EverQuest Breaks All Online PC Game Industry Sales and Subscriber Records</B><BR><BR>
<B>FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Oct. 18, 1999</B>--989 Studios(TM), a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest(TM) has broken all subscription-based online gaming sales records.<BR><BR>
In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players.<BR><BR>
"EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software," said Kelly Flock, president, 989 Studios."What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer game."<BR><BR>
The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 -- and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor of Verant Interactive -- involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique interactive storyline that evolves according to a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics.<BR><BR>
"EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually," added Flock. "It's continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience."<BR><BR>
During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the "real" world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand.<BR><BR>
The Station@sony.com is the official provider of EverQuest, with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for EverQuest's monthly subscription fee of $9.89.<BR><BR>
Verant Interactive is an independent development studio that develops cutting-edge online games. Based in San Diego, Verant Interactive has a staff of over 70 employees who consist of the development teams responsible for the online games Tanarus and EverQuest.<BR><BR>
