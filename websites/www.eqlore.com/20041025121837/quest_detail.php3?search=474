This is the Warrior's version of the new Epic Class Weapon Quests. It's final result is in a unique 2H Sword called the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=476">Jagged Blade of War</A>, which can also be split into two 1H swords called the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=477">Blade of Tactics</A> and the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=478">Blade of Strategy</A>.<BR><BR>

The quest starts with <B>Kargak Redblade</B> and <B>Wenden</B>, who are found in East Freeport.<BR><BR>

You must complete quests for two different sword hilts (<B>Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt</B> & <B>Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt</B>) and two different sword blades (<B>Ancient Sword Blade</B> & <B>Ancient Blade</B>), which can then be combined in a special scabbard (<B>Red Scabbard</B>) to make the final sword.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt:</U></B><BR><BR>

In Lake Rathtear, on the lake bottom under the 3 spawn Aviak Tower, you can find an <B>Unjeweled Dragon Hilt</B>. Wenden tells you that he can restore this hilt, but you need to bring him a <B>Diamond</B>, <B>Jacinth</B> and a <B>Black Sapphire</B>. These gems can be looted of various high level mobs, and have been reported most common on Plane mobs, high level Kunark dungeons and the Allizewsaur in Ocean of Tears. Take the three gems and the unfinished hilt to Wenden and he will give you the completed Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt:</U></B><BR><BR>

Wenden can restore this hilt as well, but he needs the <B>Damaged Dragon Head Hilt</B>, a <B>Ball of Everliving Golem</B> and <B>Rejesium Ore</B>. The damaged hilt can be found on an island in Timorous Deep. At the apx. location of neg.6500, neg.3000, there is a chessboard. At the foot of the King piece there is a small bag with the hilt in it. The Ball of Everliving Golem can be found in the Plane of Fear, on such mobs as the named Golums (Dread Terror and Fright) and possibly off Cazic-Thule himself and the Dracoliche. The Rejesium Ore is obtained from a Giant in the Giant Fort of Frontier Mountains named <B>Mentrax Mountainbone</B>. He requires a <B>Giant Monocle</B> for the ore. The monocle is looted from a rare spawn called the <B>Mountain Giant Patriarch</B>, who can be found near the Giant Castle west of Karnor's Castle in the Dreadlands. Return to Wenden with all three items and he will hand you the completed Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Ancient Sword Blade:</U></B><BR><BR>

<B>Denken Strongpick</B>, on the Aviak island in Ocean of Tears, has the Ancient Sword Blade. He will give you the blade if you find for him the following four components...  A <B>Keg of Vox Tail Ale</B>, a <B>Block Of Perma Frost</B> & TWO <B>Rebreathers</B>. Vox Tail Ale cane be bought from various vendors around Norrath, such as the Port Authority in East Freeport. Blocks of Permafrost can be looted off Ice Giants in EverFrost and Permafrost. Rebreathers are tinkered by Gnomish craftsmen and cost a pretty plat. Expect to pay as much as 4,000 plat for two of them. Return these four items to Denken and receive the Ancient Sword Blade.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Ancient Blade:</U></B><BR><BR>

This blade is loot from the <B>Queen of Chardok</B>. She doesn't drop it every time.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Red Scabbard:</U></B><BR><BR>

Back in Freeport, do a [favor] for Kargak, and take the <B>note</B> he gives you to an Ogre in Feerott named <B>Oknoggin</B> who is near the stone bridge. He will in return give you a <B>Tiny Lute</B>.<BR><BR>

Bring the lute back to Kargak, and he hands you a <B>Book</B> to take to his brother <B>Tenal Redblade</B>, who can be found at the base of the ramp in East Karana that leads to HighPass. Tenal will reward you with a <B>Frozen War Totem</B> and instructions for getting him a <B>Frozen Goblin Heart</B>.<BR><BR>

You get these off random Goblins in Permafrost, so it would save time to get one while you are camping for the Block of Permafrost mentioned above. When you return your Totem and the Heart to Tenal, he gives you back a <B>Totem of Fiery War</B> and more instructions for two more items... a <B>Green Dragon Scale</B> and a <B>Red Dragon Scale</B>.<BR><BR>

The Green Dragon Scale is dropped by the dragon <B>Severlious</B> who can be found in the Emerald Jungle. The Red Dragon Scale is dropped by <B>Lord Nagafen</B> in Sol B, or by <B>Talendor</B> in Skyfire. Return these two scales with your totem to Tenal results in you getting the <B>Mark of the Sword</B> and yet another quest. This time to get the <B>Maestro of Rancor's Hand</B>.<BR><BR>

Head to the Plane of Hate and kill the Maestro for his hand (doesn't always drop). Bring the Hand and the Mark back to tenal, and he has one last quest for you... He gives you a <B>Note</B> and tells you to obtain the <B>Spiroc Wingblade</B> from the <B>Spiroc Lord</B> in the Plane of Sky, and take these two things back to his brother Kargak in East Freeport, who rewards you with the Red Scabbard finally.<BR><BR>

<B><U>Conclusion:</U></B><BR><BR>

Kargak will give you instructions on how you can combine the two Hilts and the two Blades in the Scabbard to make your new epic weapon, the <A HREF="">Jagged Blade of War</A>.<BR><BR>
