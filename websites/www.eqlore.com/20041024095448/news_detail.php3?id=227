Not much of an update today, but I thought I would take time to assure all our regular visitors that the Seekers of Lore website will always be here and will never go the pay route.<BR><BR>

Even though we do not play EQ here anymore, we still want to keep this site up for all the people who may find the information here useful. It came as a bit of a shock when I was doing some idle browsing of the other EQ sites today, only to see that many of them have folded, or have gone to a subscription format. Rest assured that Loreseekers will remain here and free for all!<BR><BR>

With the announcement of the new expansion for EverQuest, "Shadows of Luclin", it appears that EQ will get another shot in the arm and continue to break all records for subscriptions.<BR><BR>

To honor the new expansion, I thought the new poll should ask "Which of the three chapters of EverQuest have you enjoyed the most?" The last poll was just a trivia one to see who has been playing this game from the start. The results show that 518 people responded and 140 of those were there at the beginning. We'll ask again in a year after a couple of more expansions.. hehe.<BR><BR></FONT>
