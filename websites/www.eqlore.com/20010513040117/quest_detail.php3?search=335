<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=99">Boots of the Reliant:</A>  (Blaize)  You need the ingot and icon of Reliant and 1 bar of enchanted platinum.  Go to Kithicor Woods, in one of the burnt houses you will find a book (looks like a bag on the floor). The book will reveal that Turgan the Reliant lived here once, and his brother perished in the fire that burnt the house. It also states that one of the items is hidden in Kithicor. This is the Ingot of the Reliant. Look for it on one of the tree stumps in Kithicor Woods (it is among a group of stumps). The book also states that Turgan has moved to Lake Rathetear. There, he is situated off to the left of Gnoll Camp. Hailing him is useless, as well as asking him about the Icon of the Reliant  (he will shout at you and tell you to go away). Give him the book and he will give you the Icon. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=338">Gauntlets of the Ardent:</A> (Blaize)  You need the ingot and icon of Ardent and 1 bar of galvanized platinum.   You need to kill Babbinsbort, a gnome necromancer in Befallen, to get the ingot.  The icon is found at the bottom of a river in Everfrost (loc 2996, -5711). <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=153"> Greaves of the Penitent:</A> (Blaize) You need the ingot and icon of Penitant and 1 bar of magnetized platinum.

The icon is held by an Erudite named Maugrim who resides in Kerra Ridge on the necromancer Island. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=100">Vambraces of the Fervent:</A>  (Blaize)  You need the ingot and icon of Fervent and 1 bar of vulcanized platinum.  To get the ingot, you need to kill an aviak named Gull in the Ocean of Tears.  For the icon, get a <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/quest_detail.php3?search=129">Tumpy Tonic</A> and give it to Jovan who resides in a 2nd floor bedroom in the back next to a guard of HighHold Keep. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=101">Bracers of the Reverent:</A>  (Gavel)  You need the ingot and icon of Reverent and 2 bars of enchanted platinum.  Speak with a Gypsy named Lianna Ferasa in the Rathe Mts. Ask her what has become of Regis the Reverent and she will tell you that he was killed in the N Karanas by an evil man named Zahal the Vile. She says if you go kill Zahal the Vile Regis' body will rise from the dead where he was killed along to NE tree line of the zone.  She also asks that if he has her flute on his body to bring it to her. I used a tracker buddy to Zahal the Vile is a ghoul in his mid 30's who spawns in the NE part of NK. The ingot is on the corpse of Regis when you kill him along with the flute. Take the flute back to Lianna in the Rathe Mts. and she will give you the Icon. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=102">Chestplate of the Constant:</A>  (Gavel) You need the ingot and icon of Constant and 2 bars of galvanized platinum.   They are found on 2 aqua goblins, 1 named Sludge in runnyeye, the other named Bilge in Dagnor's. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=647">Shield of the Devout:</A> (Gavel) You need the ingot and icon of Devout and 2 bars of vulcanized platinum.  The Icon of Devout is looted from a Mino Sentry in the Mino caves in the Steamfont Mountains.  The Ingot of Devout is found on a Glacial Bear in the caves under the river in Everfrost peaks<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=302">Caduceus of Sacrament:</A> (Gavel) He needs the ingot and icon of Sacrament and 2 magnetized platinum bars (?).  The Icon of Sacrament is in Castle Mistmoore, in the back of the graveyard.  There is a room through the illusionary wall that has 4 doors.  Opening one of the doors (the only one you can) causes all 3 of the other doors to open.  There are things behind the doors that are kinda ugly (mid blue to 34). In the center room (these rooms are no more than closets) on the floor is where the Icon spawns.  It is on the floor and looks like a small doll until it is picked up. <BR><BR>

The Ignot of Sacrament is droped by a Darkened Giant Skeleton in Mountain Rathe. When you zone in from Feerrot, head south until you see a tower. From there, head to west and you will see a ruin with
many Skeletons spawns. Clean them all up (As I have heard, it spawns on random places in this ruin). You will see a Giant Skeleton that is darker in color, just like those Dark bones.<BR><BR>
