<P>
Seekers of Lore Bristlebane held their 2nd Befallen Run last nite, followed by a drunken beach party in North Ro.
<P>
Two groups of Bristle Seekers made it into Befallen, including new inductees Dralt, Dian and Petri.  The higher level group made immediately for the depths of the dungeon while the lower level group swept through the upper levels.  A mishap in the lower level group resulted in several players plunging into the very bowls of the foul place and losing their lives, but other Seekers were there to insure they got their corpses back without mishap, aiding some non-Seekers in the area as well with their massive firepower and fighting prowess.
<P>
A bit later Seekers were able to camp the fearsome Shadow Knight who sometimes carries the bone bladed claymore, a weapon that our unoffical guide Batlet had spent many hours trying to obtain.  After a bit of a wait, he appeared, and was slain. Fortune smiled on the Seekers, for he was carrying the legendary weapon, and the huge magical blade was awarded to Batlet.
<P>
Shankara, longtime Seeker and sweetheart of all the Seeker men, raced all the way from Everfrost to join us.  She missed the first part of the Run, but she wasn't too late to attend the party afterward. :-)
<P>
And after the Run, the Seekers were ready to party.  Palakin made a beer run while the others raced to the fishing village in North Ro.  Soon everyone was working diligently on their alcohol tolerance skill, dancing, offering spirits to strangers who happened by, and singing.  Levitation spells began to he cast, and drunken Seekers dotted the evening sky along the coast.
<P>
Some of us may be regretting it this morning (ohhh, what a headache...), but the event was a huge success.
