<P>
I remember some years ago, I was up for a scholarship, and five minutes before it was my turn the auditions were stopped and I watched on a large television President Bush announced the attack on Iraq
<P>
I remember a few years later walking into a resturant and seeing a building on fire.  I ask the waitress what was going on and she told me the Branch Davidian compound in Waco was on fire.
<P>
I remember driving though Oklahoma City and arriving in Dallas late in the evening.  The next morning I turned on the television and found that the Arthur P. Murrah building had been bombed.  
<P>
Most of all I remember how each of these events, affected each one of our lives; directly or indirectly.  In the worldwide community that we have become, most of us know someone who had some connection to the area or recovery efforts, or someone who was personally affected by these events.
<P>
I will remember this morning to the same degree of horror.
<P>
To many of us, we witnessed this morning, what to our parents and grand-parents, witnessed in 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  The shock and after effects of this may not be realized for many years to come.  The coordinated attack we witnessed this morning were 3 attacks on Icons of Americana.  It is almost impossible to grasp the horror of what we have witnessed this morning.  Watching the firemen run back and forth across a carpet of sheets of copy paper that was once a New York City street, is almost as morbid and horrific as watching the passenger jet, carrying civilian citizens of the United States crash into the Trade Center and then watching the building, still full of people crumble to the ground.
<P>
We will continue to be affected by this for the weeks and months to come. I think what is paramount is that we make sure that we take care of our families and friends in this time of crisis.  All of us will need to come to grips with what has happened and each of us will deal with this in different ways.  Telling our children that some bad men did a very bad thing, just isn't going to be enough for an incident such as this.  I hope and pray that none of you were personally affected by what has happened today.  I know some of you live in that general vicinity and most assuredly have friends and family in the area that will have been affected to a greater degree than some of us.  I want you to know that I and We are there for you and will offer what ever assistance we can.  I will make myself available to any who just need to talk and my heart goes out to Citizens of New York, The United States, and the World on this tragic day
<P>

I don't know what more I can add to this, all I can say is I am deeply shocked and words cannot describe the way I feel.<BR>
