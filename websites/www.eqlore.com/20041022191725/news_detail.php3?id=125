As you can see, the site is still undergoing some major changes! Updates done over the last couple of days are listed below. Also, please note that today I am rebuilding my computer system, and tomorrow I am heading to LA for the E3 Expo, so I won't be doing any updates till probably Saturday at the earliest. Next week when I get back, I plan on a huge quest update, adding all the quests discovered so far on Kunark.<BR><BR>

<B>Polls:</B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ARIEL">
The polling feature is now fully operational. Sorontar had to re-do the cookies functions, and it should now be working on both Netscape and Internet Explorer. We will try and update the polls when there is a news development that effects all EQ players.</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Ad Banners</B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ARIEL">
Yes… we have started posting some ad banners on certain pages. I know this may upset some long time visitors of our site, but we are in a position now where it is going to cost us more money to keep the site going. We unfortunately lost a great deal of free server space last week and had to move all the maps, screenshots, and misc. files over to our main loreseekers.com domain or some of our personal web space. Because of this, our bandwidth usage on the server hosting www.loreseekers.com will rise to over 8 Gig/month. The banners will help defer these costs. We have tried to make them as unobtrusive and tastleful as possible.(You will NEVER see any pop-ups here!)<BR><BR>

We are not "making" any money here, just trying to ease any personal costs we have to spend. I am sure most of you will agree, that we provided a completely commercial-free site for over a year with a large amount of quality EQ information… not to mention the efforts involved in managing a large guild on several servers as well. By adding these banners, we will be able to continue upgrading and enhancing our site.</FONT><BR><BR>
