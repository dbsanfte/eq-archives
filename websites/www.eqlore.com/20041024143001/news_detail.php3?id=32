Seems that last weekend they also had an expedition into the depths of Befallen. Here is Guild Officer Pooperoo's report of the event...<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#008040"><B>SEEKERS CONQUER BEFALLEN!</B></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#008040">Bristlebane Seekers are happy to report a successful conclusion to last
nite's Befallen Run, our server's first oganized Seekers event.  About a
dozen made the event, including several members who had never had a look
inside.  After meeting in the EC/NR tunnel, we formed 2 groups, a level 17
through 21 group to clear out the 3rd level and an early to mid teens group
to explore the upper levels.<BR><BR>

We weren't lucky enough to find any really valuable items, but did get lots
of bronze weapons and rawhide, and a few interesting odds and ends.  Death
was ever present and several members died, but with other Seekers there to
back them up and open doors, we had no trouble getting to their corpses.
Even those who died ended up with a net gain in experience, and those who
didn't had a very good night in this respect.<BR><BR>

After the event, Seekers met back in the tunnel to divy up loot.  Everyone
ended up with at least a bronze weapon and some rawhide, and several members
got some other loot as well.<BR><BR>

Everyone behaved in a manner that made me proud to be a Seeker of Lore,
helping each other out, sharing our loot with no complaints, and being
patient during the inevitable delays before, during, and after - thanks to
all of you .  A special thanks to Aanur and Mish, our highest level members
present, who knew their way around and acted as guides and mentors to the
rest of us.<BR><BR>
