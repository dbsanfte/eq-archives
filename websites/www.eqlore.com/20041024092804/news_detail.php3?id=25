Since our Charter was created based on the "non-PvP" type servers that predominate EQ, it is not feasable to just apply it to the new "race war PvP" server without some changes.<BR><BR>
So effective on Tallon Zek, and Tallon Zek only, the Seekers of Lore will only officially support one team of players, and the team that was chosen by votes was team #3 - Humans, Barbarians, and Erudites. Any persons wishing to join the Seekers on this server can only do so if they are a member of this team. Any person who is already a member of the Seekers and who wants to play on Tallon Zek can also only get inducted there if they are a member of this team. Eventually, if as I suspect they will do, Verant creates more "Race War PvP" servers, the guild will support a different team for each of these servers they create. Hopefully this way we can allow our members full choice in what team to play.<BR><BR>
The only real difference between our policy on Tallon Zek and all the other servers is that we can no longer say we are "unbiased towards any race, class or faction...". All other statements and rules of conduct will apply on this server as they do on all others.<BR><BR>
