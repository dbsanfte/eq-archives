<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">

This is the Shaman's version of the new Epic Class Weapon Quests. It's final result is the Shaman <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=471">Spear of Fate</A>.<BR><BR>

The following is a summary of all the information I have been able to find so far on this quest. The majority of the information was gathered from <A HREF="http://home.elp.rr.com/wolfclan/alchemy/alchemyindex.html" TARGET="_new">Belgar's Ultimate Guide to Alchemy</A> and other Shaman specific forums such as <A HREF="http://www.eqshaman.com/" TARGET="_new">EQShaman's</A> message boards. As always, feel free to email us here with any corrections, comments, etc.<BR><BR>

There are apparently four different NPC's who can start this quest for you. They are...<BR><BR>

- <B>Capt Surestout</B> in the Ocean of Tears;<BR>
- <B>Blinde the Cutpurse</B> in Rathe Mountains;<BR>
- <B>Peg Leg</B> in Butcherblock Mountains;<BR>
- <B>Iksar Outcast or Manslayer</B> in the Field of Bones.<BR><BR>

Since different Shaman races have different dieties, and since I have also read reports that these NPC's have different responses based on your choosen religion, I am guessing that which NPC you initiate your quest with may be tied to your race and diety.<BR><BR>

I will post the spoiler as it starts with Capt. Surestout as that is the only one I have seen confirmation of so far.<BR><BR>

You begin in the Ocean of Tears with Capt Surestout. You have to kill him to get a <B>Lesser Spirit</B> to spawn. The Lesser Spirit wants to know why you killed Capt Surestout. Tell him he threatened you and say you wish to know more and the Spirit will give you a <B>Tiny Gem</B> and have this to say...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"That is good, Player. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Next, you have to travel to North Freeport and find an NPC named <B>Bondl Felligan</B>, who is hiding aat the openings to the sewers of Freeport. Give Bondl Felligan the Tiny Gem and he will say how he could drink for a month on what he can sell this gem for. Wait for him to move then follow him out as he walks away. He will soon stop and then say to you...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze with this or not?"
</FONT><BR><BR>

Tell him that he can buy booze, and Bondl will instantly sober up and command you to follow him.<BR><BR>

Bondl leads you to the Jade Tiger's Inn, where upstairs you will find a <B>Greater Spirit</B> waiting. (note: You can make this spirit spawn any time by saying "You can buy booze" to Bondl). The Spirit asks if you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]. Your response is based on your race... Justice=Barbarian, Hate=Ogre, Fear=Iksar and Hate=Troll. This spoiler is based on a Barbarian players work so he picked Justice.<BR><BR>

After this, the Spirit directs you to go to the next room and talk to another Greater Spirit there. This Spirit has much to say about [True Spirits], [Wisps of Consciousness], and especially the [Heyokah]. Ask about the [Heyokah], and the Spirit should give you another <B>Gem</B>.<BR><BR>

After you get the gem, tell the Spirit you will walk the path of the Heyokah, and he will go into details about the process of becoming Heyokah, and then despawn...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of <B>patience, wisdom, and might</B>. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Patience:</B></FONT><BR><BR>

After hailing <B>Ooglyn</B> on the Island in Erud's Crossing, give her the gem, and she will want you to follow her to a spot under the water. You must have endure breath up or something equivalent because you will be required to spend an extended time under water. Be prepared to also fight off any killer sharks that bother you while doing the quest.<BR><BR>

When Ooglyn runs off she goes under the water to a spot near loc -1600, +4200.<BR><BR>

Down here, you will meet an NPC named <B>Abe the Abandoned</B>. The PATIENCE part of this quest is that you stay at this spot patiently, not following or running when told. You eventually need to get a broken arrow from Abe, and another gem from another Greater Spirit. Abe talks to you about himself [Abe], [Eyes], the [Combine], and eventually the [Arrow]. If you waited patiently for the proper response, then tell Abe that you will give them the arrow, he will hand you a <B>Broken Arrow</B> and command you to follow him. Do not follow him, and wait patiently again, and eventually another Grater Spirit will spawn.<BR><BR>

The Spirit acknowledges your success at Patience, gives you another <B>Gem</B> and tells you the following about the [next path]...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his instructions."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Wisdom:</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Head to the Western Plains of Karana and seek out the <B>Wandering Spirit</B>. It looks like a wisp and wanders around, making it hard to find, but it has been noted that if you wait near loc -500, -5300, you will eventually see it go by. The Wandering Spirit just directs you to go to Rathe Mountains to find someone who needs your help.<BR><BR>

In the Rathe Mountains, you need to find <B>Tabien the Goodly</B> who is near loc +6300, +1550 and <B>Glaron the Wicked</B> who is near loc +2900, -1900. Both these NPC's have conflicting stories, and therfore must be both false, so you must kill them both and retrieve the items they carry, taking them back to Western Karana and the Wandering Spirit.<BR><BR>

Giving the items to the Spirit will result in him telling you about the two fools you just killed...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked the path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one [last path]"
</FONT><BR><BR>

Ask about the <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=871">Shield of Falsehood</A> and he will reward you with it! Then ask about the [Last Path] and you will get another <B>gem</B> and the following instructions on starting the final test...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"You have trusted us along the paths we have set before you. You have been known to be patient and await the right moment. And now, you have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path they set you on."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Might:</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Head to the Emerald Jungle and find the <B>Sentinel Spirit</B> who can be found near loc +1250, +300.<BR><BR>

The Sentinel Spirit speaks of a brother drawn to the dark side by a dark elf (dark point ear) and instructs you to destroy him. Head to Castle Mistmoore and find the wolf spirit named <B>Black Dire</B>. Black Dire is a very powerful spirit, who is guarded by four lesser spirits, and can be found at the base of the ramp leading up to the castle. Do not expect as easy a time at this as you had the rest of the quest, bring many friends!<BR><BR>

Once you have killed Black Dire, bring his <B>Pelt</B> back to the Sentinel Spirit in the Emerald Jungle. He tells you you are now Heyokah, and says he will fashion a pair of boots from the pelt you returned to him, to aid you in your duties as Heyokah. After following the long conversations and using then right words, you will recieve the <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=872">Black Fur Boots</A> and the directions for the next stage of the quest as follows...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you can. The ghosts who still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will aid us. Take this booklet and combine what you find in it. Then bring me the completed report. From there, we will know where to look next."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Reports from the City of Mist:</B></FONT><BR><BR>

You must use the <B>Booklet</B> to combine six reports you need to find in the City of Mist. The first five reports can be found on various skeletons, golems and goos at the zone, but the sixth and final report can only be found on a Spectral Courier. Here are the six reports in order...<BR><BR>

<B>Personal Diary Page</B>, identifies as "Report Information 1 of 6" in Lizardman. It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"I heard last night that there was some kind of commontion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon fro the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Crier's Scroll</B>, identifies as "Report Information 2 of 6" in lizardman. It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Hear of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Merchant's Letter</B>, identifies as "Report Information 3 of 6" in lizardman. It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Written Annoucement</B>, identifies as "Report Information 4 of 6". It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Priest's Diary Page</B>, identifies as "Report Information 5 of 6" in lizardman. It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his "wisdom" has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wipe out during the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying our church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Student's Log</B>, identifies as "Report Information 6 of 6" in Lizardman. It reads:<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Combine the six reports in the Booklet and then return the results to the Sentinel Spirit in the Emerald Jungle. He will then set you on your next task...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle beneath the murky waters of a pond."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Three Books:</B></FONT><BR><BR>

You now need to kill <B>Lord Ghiosk</B> in the City of Mist to get three books that he drops. Take all three books to another <B>Spirit Sentinel</B> located under the "murky waters of a pond" in the Emerald Jungle at loc +3685, -640. The three books translated are as follows...<BR><BR>

<B>Book 1</B><BR><BR> 

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have a saying that goes "Neh's chances". We all know this is used to define an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Neh Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for good measure a few pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two that implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as Kirn left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak' Ashiir reflected his despair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well known fact that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Book 2</B><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster and place the order tomorrow."<BR><BR>

"2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to the contract holder tomorrow."<BR><BR>

"3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumours abound of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane."<BR><BR>

"4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the shortage of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure the symbolism."<BR><BR>

"5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it ourselves with the help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people that know of this the better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within the sheets."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Book 3</B><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kirn was given the hallowed title that contact between the sexes became tolerated. While Kirn wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle known as the Bone Rending when Kirn lost his fabled whip, Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only. Before this battle many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a leader and patriot for the people."<BR><BR>

"However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade and duty convinced the public that celibacy had its place in divinity but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kirn among many women was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial as it was lost far across the ocean among distant brothers on faith."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Bring all three books back to the Spirit Sentinel at loc +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle, and he will set you the next task...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards."
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The High Scale Icon</B></FONT><BR><BR>

You now need to obtain the <B>High Scale Icon</B> and bring it to <B>High Scale Kirn</B>. The Icon is a simple spawn in a small bag inside the City of Mist in the temple at loc apx -200, -350. It lies on the floor in a room of the temple near where three Phantoms spawn. You can pull and clear all mobs or use Invis to Undead to get to the bag, but beware that Gholums can see through Invis to Undead.<BR><BR>

High Scale Kirn is found in the Hole in the tower behind the city. It is a tough fight to get to this tower so bring plenty of friends. After you reach Kirn, give him the Icon. He will then fight to defend a ring you need off him. When you kill him you will recieve an <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=873">Engraved Ring</A> which identifies as "Promise Ring of Neh`Ashiir". Here is what Kirn has to say just before he does battle with you...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Why did you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!"
</FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Conclusion to the Quest!</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Here are the final stages of this long involved quest...<BR><BR>

Return the Engraved Ring to <B>Neh`Ashiir</B> in the City of Mist who will then attack you. Kill her and loot her <B>Diary</B>...<BR><BR>

<B>Neh`Ashiir's Diary:</B><BR><BR> 

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"..another bazaar.. I was asked to judge..wrestling contest. It must have been the ten thousandth one... .week. Oh how I grow weary of...political monotony. The earlier days were much..exciting, crusades against..unworthy and smashing our opposition. Kirn's life must be epic indeed. He.. at me again during.. match. Hmmmm."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Take Neh' Ashiir's Diary to the Spirit Sentinael in the Emerald Jungle (The one at loc +3685, -640) who then has this to say...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"So, the truth is found! Nak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go!"
</FONT><BR><BR>

Now you must find and kill the <B>Iksar Child</B>. The Iksar Child is found on the Plane of Fear in the little pyramid at loc -630, -360. He is an easy kill to anyone who is actually fighting in Fear. When you kill him, loot the <B>Tear</B> off him and return it to <B>Lord Rak' Ashiir</B> back in the City of Mist.<BR><BR>

Lord Rak' Ashiir has the following to say when given the Tear...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but [betrayal] and I immediately set out to abandon Cazic-Thule."
</FONT><BR><BR>

and this about [betrayal]...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Kirn was right. Before he left my side and that of Torsis he told me I would have the blood of my own people upon my hands. How could I be so foolish? Even my idiot wife could see the truth. How could I begin to fathom the depth of a god's mind and the reasons for his actions? Kirn's prophecy has come to light. You have shown me the truth and now I have no more use for this. Take it away from me, please, and do with it what you will. My father was as much a fool as I have been."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Details are sketchy at this point, but either by dialog with him, or by killing him you must obtain a <B>Scale</B> from him. He is the toughest battle by far yet, and has a very nasty AE Fire spell. Some people have reported that a good tactic is to send in Fire Elementals to do battle with him, while everyone else stays out of the AE spell range.<BR><BR>

Take the Scale back to the Spirit Sentinel in the Emerald Forest who has a lot to say about such things as the [mantle], the [Spear of Fate], [Black Holes], [Powerful Shamans], the [Cosmos] and the [Breach].<BR><BR>

Eventually, he will gte around to giving you your reward, the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=471">Spear of Fate</A>! Not as good at first glance as the other Epic Quest weapons discovered so far, it still has some impressive stats, and a Shaman is rarely in need of melee power at this level. There is also the other items aquired through this quest to consider.<BR><BR>
