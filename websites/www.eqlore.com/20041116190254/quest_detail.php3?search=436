This quest results in the Medallion of the Jarsath, which is one of three medallions needed for the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=434">Rune of Scale Quest</A> to get into Veeshan's Peak.<BR><BR>

The quest begins with Xiblin Fizzlefut, on the chessboard island.<BR><BR>

You say, <I>"what Jarsath Tribe?"</I>.<BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik says <I>"About two thousand years ago, there were five different tribes of Iksar that dwelled on the continent of Kunark.  Of these tribes was the Jarsath.  They were a very primitive sort, proud and tribal… but also cannibalistic.  Often, they were at war with the other tribes that existed durring this era.  The ruins that stand on this island were created by the Jarsath.  I've been excavating for quite some time now, but haven't been able to find anything of significance."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"What are you looking for."</I><BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik says <I>"In my studies, I have learned that the Jarsath believed they could draw power from a holy symbol… specifically a medallion that represented their tribe.  When Salthir became king of the Iksar empire Sebilis, he had the medallion broken into three pieces and hid them on the Kunark continent so that they would never be found.  I'm searching for the pieces so that I can put it back together and learn more about this tribe.  Perhaps you wish to help?"</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"I will help you".</I><BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik says <I>"All I know is that the pieces were most likely hidden in water regions.  If you manage to find them, bring them to me and I will be able to put the medallion of the Jarsath back together.  I am sure there is much to be learned from it."</I><BR><BR>

Remember that there are three separate medallions in the game, each broken into three peices that just say a piece of broken medallion when you find it. You need to identify the piece of medallion you find to determine which one it is. These are the locations:<BR><BR>

<B>(1)  Middle Portion:</B>  In Firona Vie on an Iksar monk skeleton named "an ancient Jarsath".<BR>
<B>(2)  Bottom Portion:</B>  This is located on the BloodGill Marauder, who guards the Entrance to Veskar at the bottom of the lake of Ill Omen.<BR>
<B>(3)  Upper Portion:</B> This is just laying around in the Swamp of No Hope at /loc +52, +2935, -6.<BR><BR>
