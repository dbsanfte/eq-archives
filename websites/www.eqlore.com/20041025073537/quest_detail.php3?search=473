<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">

This is the Cleric's version of the new Epic Class Weapon Quests. It's final result is the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=473">Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>Shmendrik Lavawalker</B>, in Lake Rathtear, begins this quest. He tells you that the Riptide Goblins have been killing and robbing all who come near. He wants you to kill the Riptide Goblin King, <B>Lord Bergurgle</B>, and return his crown as proof of his death.

Shmendrik Lavawalker says,<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Hail, good player!! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle. I simply ask that you bring me his crown as proof."</FONT><BR><BR>

Lord Bergurgle is a tough level 40'ish mob that spawns in the Goblin Tower in the underwater cave in Lake Rathetear. Kill him and loot his 'Lord Bergurgle's Crown'.<BR><BR>

Giving the crown to Shmendrik causes him to reveal his true madness though as he shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"You Player, have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!"
</FONT><BR><BR>

At this point an NPC named <B>Natasha Whitewater</B> will spawn and attack Shmendrik...

Natasha Whitewater shouts,<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"The Triumvirate of Water has decreed your fate, Shmendrik Lavawalker!! I am here to deliver said fate!!"</FONT><BR><BR>

Shmendrik Lavawalker says,<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"I'll slay you like I slaughtered your fellow missionaries! The Triumvirate can not decide the fate of a follower of the Tyrant!!"</FONT><BR><BR>

Natasha Whitewater says,<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Enough!! Your existence has come to an end! This conflict has been destined by the waters of the Triumvirate!"</FONT><BR><BR>

When she kills Shmendrik, a level 40 elemental named the <B>A Spirit of Flame</B> will spawn and attack you and your party. You loot a 'Damaged Goblin Crown' from it.   Note that Natasha Whitewater may attack the elemental herself, and if she kills it the corpse could dissappear, so you should make sure your party kills the mob before her. Another tactic is to kill Shemdrik yourself, then the elemental, bypassing Natasha, and loot the damaged crown. Then wait for Shmendrik to spawn again, and do it in the proper order now to make Natasha to spawn.<BR><BR>

Once you have the damaged crown, give it to Natasha...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"I will have this crown returned to the Riptide Goblins immediately! Should you ever come across an Erudite named Omat Vastsea, give him this sea shell. The waters of Norrath shimmer with awareness of your deeds here today!"
</FONT><BR><BR>

She then gives you an 'Ornate Sea Shell', which you must take to <B>Omat Vastsea</B>. He is found in the southern part of Timorous Deep, in the area you have to reach via an underwater entrance.<BR><BR>

It seems that Omat is a high priest of the Triumvirate missionaries. These three gods are E'ci, Tarew Marr and Povar, and they watch over all the waters of Norrath, protecting them from the ravages of the Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro, and his worshippers, the Plasmatic Priesthood.<BR><BR>

Give him the Sea Shell, and he will give you a 'Coral Statue of Tarew' while bestowing the following duty upon you...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Seek out the priests in the Temple of Solusek Ro and find among them the one who is secretly a <B>Plasmatic Priest</B>. Handing him the Statue causes the Priest to shake violently, flames dancing in the depths of his eyes! The statue then begins to emit a reddish glow finally shattering in a burst of fire and smoke! The flames in the Plasmatic Priest's eyes vanish with the explosion and only madness remains!<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"The Triumvirate thinks that destroying my spirit of flame will stop me?!! I will kill you all now, the goblins will continue to war, and when my spirit is restored I will ensure that Ixiblat Fer consumes all of Norrath in his flames!!"
</FONT><BR><BR>

The Plasmatic Priest is level 55, and can summon. Kill him and take his 'Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe' back to Omat in Timorous Deep, who gives you the first of three orbs, the <B>Orb of Frozen Water</B> as he then says this...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement in the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy women and will depart soon"
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Note:</B> Since he now wants you to kill <B>Lord Gimblox</B>, and give his ring to Natasha, it would be a better idea to kill Gimblox right after you have killed the Priest, and before returning the robe to Omat. Lord Gimblox is a level 30 fire goblin found in Sol A. Kill him and loot his 'Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring'. Hand the Robe to Omat, which makes Natasha spawn, then hand the Ring to Natasha, who in turn gives you another 'Ornate Sea Shell' and charges you to do the following...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Thank you, Player, for your services thus far. The Triumvirate missionaries are, so far, impressed. However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assit them in summoning Ixilblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxton Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I Must depart now. I pray for your success."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Travel to the Burning Wood and give <B>Naxton Deepwater</B> the shell. He will give you a 'Message to Natasha' and cause <B>Ixilblat Fer</B> to spawn. This is a level 62 Fire Elemental who is a god-like encounter, having apx. 32,000 HP's and doing up to 575 melee damage. When you have killed Ixilblat, he will drop the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=474">Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer</A>, as well as one of the following nice items... <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=874">Circlet of Fire</A>, <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=875">Mantle of Fire</A>, <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=876">Gloves of Fire</A>, <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=393">Cloak of Flames</A> or <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=877">Belt of Fire</A>.<BR><BR>

The evidence you need to show that the priests are dealing with the Sarnaks is a 'Singed Scroll' dropped by <B>Overking Bathezid Di'Zok</B> in Chardok. Kill him and get the scroll which reads...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Greetings Overking Bathezid. The time has come for you to return the boon owed to me from so long ago. I have need of your most powerful summoners to bring Ixiblat Fer into the mortal realm and rain fire upon my enemies. Your old friend, Zordak Ragefire"
</FONT><BR><BR>

Return to Omat with the Sceptre and the Singed Scroll and give them to him. He then has this to say....<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"I commend you on your success over the fire elemental lord, Ixiblat Fer. The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. If you are the one whom my visions foretell, then seek Zordak Ragefire and bring me his heart."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Omat then gives you the second orb, the <B>Orb of Clear Water</B>. Now give the 'Message to Natasha' to Natasha, and she will give you a 'Shimmering Pearl' as she says this...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"It is a shame that fate has decided one so young and from such a background should perish, but we must not attempt to change what was destined to be. Priestess Naxot sacrificed herself selflessly so that others may be spared the horrors Ixiblat would have brought to Norrath. May the waters of Norrath forever remember her reflection. I thank you for delivering Naxot's message to me and give you this pearl imbued with the power of the Triumvirate. Should you find Zordak Ragefire, speak with him before all else and hand him this pearl. No mortal enemy of the Triumvirate can resist its enchantments."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<B>Zordak Ragefire</B> is a priest in the Temple of Solusek Ro. When you hail him he has this to say...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Welcome to the new fortress of the Plasmatic Priesthood! It's a shame about Lord Nagafen's untimely death, really it is! Such a powerful and noble creature should not perish at the hands of mortals."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Hand him the pearl...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"The Triumvirate missionaries think their petty magic can affect me!! I will send your heads to Omat as a symbol of what is to come for all of his missionaries!"
</FONT><BR><BR>

Zordak Ragefire will attack you at this point. After you kill him, he respawns in his true dragon form as <B>Zordakilicus Ragefire</B>, who is a clone of Nagafen. Among the normal Nagafen loot items, he also drops "Blazing" armor pieces and of course the 'Heart of Zordak Ragefire', which is what you are after.<BR><BR>

Return the Heart to Omat who gives you the third orb, the <B>Orb of Vapor</B> and then gives instruction on how to obtain the <B>Orb of the Triumvirate</B>...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Go to <B>Jhassad Oceanson</B> and present him with the three spereate orbs, 'Orb of Frozen Water', 'Orb of Clear Water' and the 'Orb of Vapor'. He then performs the following ceremony...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
Jhassad Oceanson kneels in the sand and places the three orbs into a large abalone shell bowl. A blue glow surrounds his hands as he waves them over the orbs resting in the bowl. The orbs crack and fall apart, releasing their contents, then reform into a single glowing orb. Jhassad Oceanson gently removes the Orb of the Triumvirate and places it in your hands.<BR><BR>

"The Avatar of Water approaches.", he says. "You must hand him the Orb of the Triumvirate and it will be decided if it is your destiny to wield the Nem Ankh Sprinkler."
</FONT><BR><BR>

Finally, hand the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water, and it will reward you with the ultimate weapon of the holy cleric, the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=473">Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh</A>!<BR><BR>
