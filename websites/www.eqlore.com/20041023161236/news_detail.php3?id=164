*Updated Patch Message*<BR><BR>

Some additional changes were included in today's patch that were not listed in the patch 
message earlier today.  This patch message is a replacement for the one posted earlier:<BR><BR>

*Miscellaneous Changes*<BR><BR>

- /trackplayers now supports a "GROUP" option, allowing trackers to exclude all player 
characters, except ones in their current group.<BR>
- The EQCLIENT.INI has some new features, including one allowing logging (/log) to be on by 
default.  Updated documentation for the EQCLIENT.INI file is at the end of this patch 
message.<BR>
- Activatable items, such as Journeyman's Boots, can now be activated by the corresponding 
number-key if placed in a hotbox.<BR>
- Items that are "out of charges" now display "Charges: None" when inspecting the item.<BR>
- Attack-speed buffs and debuffs will now stack correctly.  In other words, lower level 
spells will no longer overwrite higher level spells of the same type.<BR>
- The "U" key (short for "use") has had its functionality enhanced.  It now does the 
equivalent of a single left-click and single right-click at the center of the screen.  In 
addition to opening doors, it will now consider and inspect PCs, consider NPCs, and use 
bankers, merchants, and guildmasters.<BR>
- Fixed the way that spell-effect icons are displayed on the UI.  Previously, after adding 
several "buffs" to a character, one of the icons would be placed down in the chat window.<BR><BR>

*Chat/Login Server*<BR><BR>

This patch contains eqmain.dll, which is used by the EverQuest login/chat frontend.  The 
following changes have been implemented:<BR><BR>

- #help now accepts arguments.  #help #command will return help for the requested command.<BR>
- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an "Error Number".  Please 
have this error number ready when requesting technical assistance.<BR><BR>

*Looking for Group Flag*<BR><BR>

Players can now indicate that they are "looking for a group" by typing /LFG.  This command 
will flag your character in both zone-specific /who lists, and the server-wide "/who all" 
list with "LFG".  The LFG flag will remain active until you either enter a group or log out.  
Players can search for other players who are LFG by using filters in the /who command.  For 
instance, to find rangers between level 40 and 50 who are looking for a group across the 
server, type "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg". <BR><BR>

It is our hope that this flag will make it easier for players to seek out group members, 
allowing for more adventuring with less preparation time.<BR><BR>

*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<BR><BR>

If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an 
entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<BR><BR>

The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors 
are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color 
range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, 
and black in normal mode.<BR><BR>
