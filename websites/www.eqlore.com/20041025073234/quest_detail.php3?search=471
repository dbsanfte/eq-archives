This quest starts out in North Qeynos at Crow's Tavern. Inside, an Erudite librarian named <B>Umvera Dekash</B> wants you to return to him 4 different LORE Tanned Split Paw Skins, which are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected Paw and look like scrolls (not the old style tanned split paw hides that looked like spells). The skins can be identified even if you cannot read Gnoll, as the number of the scroll will always appear near the beginning of the first sentence (1-4), not to mention that you will not be able to have more than one of each in your inventory.<BR><BR>

After returning the 4 skins to the librarian in Crow's tavern you will receive a <A HREF="books.php3">Book of the Translated Split Paw Skins</A>. Umvera will then tell you that you need to have the book bound by <B>Jheron Felkis</B>, who can be located in a spare room upstairs at Velith & Bardo's bar in East Freeport. Once bound the book magically rewrites itself into a series of Letters written by Ishva Verishe Val to his subjects called "<A HREF="books.php3">A Paw Book</A>".<BR><BR>

Return the bound book to Umvera in Crow's and he will give you a sealed letter to take to <B>Durkis Battlemore</B> in Butcherblock Mountains. Durkis can be found in the guard hut just before Kaladim, on he path from the docks. In return for the letter Durkis gives you a set of <A HREF="armor_detail.php3?search=878">Gem Inlaid Gauntlets</A>. Great gloves for monks IMHO, since they weigh only 1.0 and are 3ac more than Shiverback!<BR><BR>

<B>Editor's Note:</B><BR>
I completed and verified this quest myself yesterday. The whole quest is working now, including some graphic glitches from before. Also, most of the items used in this quest, with the exception of the final note you take to Durkis, are Lore but NOT no drop, so you can use a mule to do parts of the quest if you are KOS or have bad faction in Qeynos or Freeport. For example, I collected the skins with my necro, then handed them to a Paladin mule I created in Qeynos. He had Rodcet Nife as his diety, and with Umvera, he was indifferent. With Jheron Felkis in Freeport, he was amiable, and with Durkis in Butcherblock, he was apprehensive, but could still complete the quest. Also, all steps in the quest returned only some experience, and no faction changes. This is one of the nicest quests I have seen in a while in terms of reward.<BR><BR>
