today of major crimes that have been filed against the Rathe branch of
the Seekers of Lore. The group is charged with several accounts of
genicide, murder, disturbing the peace, and public drunkenness. The
incident occured this past Saturday when about 20 members of the cult
showed up at the fortress and proceeded to slaughter the goblins without
regard or reason. the whole time they laughed and imbued in alcohol to
major extents.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>ne survivor was quoted, "It was horrible. There were bodies everywhere.
they charged into our homes and slaughtered everyone. And..and then they
looted the dead. Ohhhh the inhumanity!"
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>rostbite says he plans to seek the death penalty for the seekers for
what they did to his kindred. What's more he says they violated
international law by killing a diplomat from the clan of the ice giants.
Both countries are prepared to go to war over several stolen holy
relics. "The first step is recovery of whats ours. The ice crystal
staff, our priests crown, the holy wolf slippers, and the crystalline
blade belong to us and we want them back," said Frostbite.
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>oladen Moonsong leader of the cult was asked for comment and declined
but when told of the threat of war to him and his group he did offer return comment to the goblins and giants : "Bite me".
