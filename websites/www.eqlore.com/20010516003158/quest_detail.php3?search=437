Honorable Guildmaster Sorontar:<BR><BR>

As a Wizard, I am professionally interested in all things having to do with ethereal transport.  As such, I was drawn to rumors concerning firepots throughout the lands of Norrath.  These rumors spoke of an ancient transport system "for those of evil race", which could be accessed through having the appropriate "key", and inserting it (or using it) with the appropriate "firepot" in a Norrathian city, to be instantly transported to another city of Norrath, without the need of spell, Wizard or Druid (shudder!).<BR><BR>

Knowing that most ancient magic was not related to the evils that plague Norrath, I have long discounted the likelihood that such devices, if they existed, were for evil races' exclusive use.  Evil races are prone to destruction, rarely creativity of any sort!  However, it has come to my attention, that such teleportation devices do, in fact exist, and can be utilized by all races.  However, their utility is, at this stage of my investigation, limited to travel from one hub point to twelve (12) of the cities of Norrath.<BR><BR>

This hub point is deep under the Timorous Deep, located at -12260, +4365, -277.  It came to my attention, that the top of a classic Combine Era Wizard Spire, with its familiar four tines, was observable above the waves in this depth of Ocean.  If you swim down directly between the four tines, you will find a square opening on the ocean floor.  Descending, you will find yourself suddenly in air, in a square room, with three firepots along each wall.  In the center burns a magic fire of blue, such as can be seen at certain ancient Elvish and Combine towers (e.g. Oasis).  Note that the descent from the surface is one way, and I was unable to find any way to leave the room by normal means.  No monster nor person disturbed my researches that followed.<BR><BR>

Binding myself to the locale, I commenced to mediate on the twelve firepots. It was immediately apparent that the style of each was different, and each was familiar to a particular culture of Norrath.  I proceeded to test my hypothesis, and touching the rust-colored low firepot, similar to many in the city of my youth, found myself, being dusted off by a very surprised guard (my second cousin, twice removed), in Northern Felwithe.  Without answering my startled cousin's queries (he knows I tend to gate around hastily...), I immediately gated back.  I tested all twelve pots, and here is the key of their wisdom:<BR><BR>

North Left:(fire on floor)Grobb (entrance)<BR>
North Center:(6 side gray)Ogguk  (entrance)<BR>
North Right:(6 side tall)Erudin (near dock)<BR><BR>

East Left:(6 side gray)Neriak Commons (entrance)<BR>
East Center:(4 side wood)Greater Faydark (under Kelethin)<BR>
East Right:(6 side rust)Northern Felwithe (entrance)<BR><BR>

South Left:(Brown box)Halas(near dock)<BR>
South Center:(Dark with blue)East Freeport (on dock)<BR>
South Right:(tall gold vase)Cabilis West (entrance)<BR><BR>

West Left:(White marble)South Kaladim (entrance)<BR>
West Center:(Lava Lamp)Akannon (entrance)<BR>
West Right:(torch stand)Rivervale (entrance)<BR><BR>

It is to be noted that "the Black Hole", Qeynos, and Highpass, are not represented here.<BR><BR>

An intriguing question, beyond the origin of these firepots and their creator's identity, is: "Are there other pots out there that bring you to The Timorous Deep?"<BR><BR>

Respectfully submitted,<BR><BR>
