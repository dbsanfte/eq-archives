Unfortunately, some of the servers we have members on lost their guild tags during these problems. Starting tomorrow morning (Friday the 20th) I will be working at getting these guilds fixed ASAP. After that, I have 2 new servers to set up. Here is the full text of the patch message...<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#008045"><B>*Guild Update*</B><BR><BR>
Our programmers have spent the last few weeks completely revising the guild file structure, which should eliminate the loss of guild status that has occurred on some of the EverQuest servers.  We are comfortable with the amount of time our test department has spent checking the changes internally, in addition to the extensive testing performed on the Test server.  If the changes to the guild code work as planned, all of the current guilds should be converted to the new format - a process that is performed on the server-side and would not effect current guilds in any way.  However, due to the sheer number of guilds that have been established throughout the live servers in comparison to the number of guilds tested, there is a possibility that a few, or possibly all players may lose their guild status after the update.  In a worst-case scenario, some or all of the guild leaders would have to be reassigned by GMs.  If this is the case, our Customer Service department has a complete record of all guilds and guild leaders across all of the servers.  As an added measure, we will have additional GMs on-staff beginning tomorrow morning at 9am Pacific to begin addressing problems if they arise.  Though the possible initial effects of this change to the guild system may seem unsettling, it is a change that must take place to assure the long term wellbeing of guilds as a whole.<BR><BR>
