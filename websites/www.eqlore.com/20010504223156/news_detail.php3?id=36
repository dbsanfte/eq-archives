This is mainly because of the futility in trying to get any GM support on a timely basis. Because I do not play on most of these servers, I would have to waste many hours sitting around in game hoping a GM would answer my petition and this was time I could better spend working on our website, or even just playing my main characters.<BR><BR>
Added to this are some other factors like my upcoming holidays, and a possible second job soon. So in the interest of the guild getting better attention for it's members, I have decided to split up the leadership of each server to an officer on that server. What this means is that the senior officer on each server will become the guild leader there. They will have total control over all aspects of the guild, such as membership applications, guild wars, guild policy, etc.. Instead I will become an officer on Tarew Marr and Tallon Zek, as Sorontar will take over the leadership of Tarew Marr.<BR><BR>
Also, I have decided that , for now, the guild will not branch out onto any other servers, instead concentrating on the membership we have now.  This is because the most time consuming and wasteful thing I have had to do was wait for GM's that never show on these servers. So instead of relying on non existent GM support for new servers, we will stick with what we have set up now. Unfortunately this also applies to 2 servers we lost our guild status on during the problems recently. I tried for 4 nights straight to get them fixed and was unable to find a GM to assist me. So I have had to withdraw the guild from Fenin Ro and Erollisi Marr. I apologize to the few members on each of these servers.<BR><BR>
As of this moment, these are the servers we have the guild official on, and they will remain the only servers for the time being…<BR><BR>
<B>1. Tarew Marr - founding server<BR>
2. Bristlebane<BR>
3. Bertoxxulous<BR>
4. Cazic-Thule<BR>
5. Innoruuk<BR>
6. Quellious<BR>
7. Rodcet Nife<BR>
8. The Rathe<BR>
9. Tunare<BR>
10. Veeshan<BR>
11. Xegony</B><BR><BR>
When I have received confirmation from all the officers, I will post the new leaders of each of the servers. Confirmed so far, though, are Sorontar as leader of Tarew Marr, and Maldian as leader of The Rathe.<BR><BR>
This change , I hope , will allow each server to set it's own path, and allow them all to grow and flourish. With the demands on my time relaxed, I can concentrate again on expanding our website and playing my characters. Please be advised, as well, that the resources of our website will remain for any and all to use. Very soon, Sorontar will be finishing modifications to the site that will allow each server leader to process their own applications, and administer their own members.<BR><BR>
So, here's to the continued success of the Seekers of Lore on all 11 servers!<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR><BR>
