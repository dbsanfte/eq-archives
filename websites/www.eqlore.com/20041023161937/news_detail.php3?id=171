*Today's Patch*<BR><BR>

Today we modified the EverQuest client to implement the following changes:<BR><BR>

- Corrected a bug that would cause players to crash if they entered the game, exited to the server selection screen, and tried to reenter the game.<BR>
- Corrected a bug that caused delays when switching between UI modes due to the text wrapping change implemented last week.<BR>
- The /book command (/book #) now accepts pages 1 through 50, and will switch to the proper page.<BR>
- Opening your spellbook will automatically cause you to begin meditating providing that you have the skill.<BR>
- Removed the /meditate command since it is no longer necessary.<BR>
- You can now activate a hotkey while the spellbook is open by pressing the corresponding number-key.<BR>
- The "/target [name]" command can be used to target other players by name.  Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the target.<BR>
- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating the EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a few weeks ago.<BR>
- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target.  For instance, if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at @", the output will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".<BR>
- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their over-head name prefixed with an asterisk.  Remember that you can search for people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" commands.  Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all rangers between 40 and 50 that are looking for a group.<BR>
- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer point you towards people's pets.<BR><BR>

*Note on Voice Recognition*<BR><BR>

Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest.  To use this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory.  Please note that you must already have a voice recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4.0.  The voice recognition technology was tested with Dragon NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0.  Check with the developer of your software to find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.<BR><BR>
