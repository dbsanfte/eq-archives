<p class="body2">Our two main goals at this time are:</p>
<p class="body2">Number One: PoP Flagging as a break from SSRA Emp Key farming</p>
<p class="body2"> Number Two: Continue to take targets of opportunity that still 
  upgrade the guild</p>
<p class="body2">The guild is on no set faction at this time.<br>

<p class="body2">Sublimity is a guild where you can be yourself and have some 
  fun. There are no hard set rules right now beyond common sense. If you have 
  reached this level of the game without learning the basics of giuld interaction, 
  then you have a serious problem. Guild chat is very loose, so if you are easily 
  offended, this is not the place for you. In essence, just a bunch of people 
  who moved to MS to have some fun again.<br>

  first time in years)</p>

      <p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules</p>
      
<p class="body2">No grocery-list of rules at this point. The people know what 
  is expected of them and can use common sense.</p>
<p class="body2">Sublimity does not use a point system, but the guild does track 
  prior loot and participation by using EQDKP with zeroized points. Loot is decided 
  by a council of officers. The officers evaluate participation, prior loot awarded, 
  and what kind of upgrade it would be for the individual. <br>
