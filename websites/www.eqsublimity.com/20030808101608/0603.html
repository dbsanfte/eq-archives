  Behemoth Down, Terris Thule Down, 29 June 2003</p>
<p class="body2">After a few time-intensive days of acquiring the key to Saryn's 
  penthouse apartment, we moved in to take Saryn down. The guild was eager to 
  see her pay for the past few days of boring hell in Torment getting that stupid 
  Screaming Sphere. Saryn down, and Herbal caught trying to talk the girlies into 
  testing out Saryn's spiked bed.<br>

<p class="body2">Not to let the ball stop rolling, Sublimity hit Innovation for 
  a little smackdown on the MB. Awesome fight, and I now officially HATE those 
  damn clockwork spiders.<br>

<p class="body2">Oh no, it's not over yet. The marathon continued, whilst I took 
  huge marital faction hits for being up so late. We final flagged a few groups 
  for PoNB, and then took Terris Thule down. Grats bedtime 2am CST...jeez I'm 
  tired.<br>

<p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: Lots of Mobs down, more 
  drama on this next episode of &quot;Soap&quot;, 19 June 2003</p>
<p class="body2">As a way to burn out frustrations from key farming and guildchat 
  drama queens, Sublimity decided to have some fun in the Bazaar Arena. Many dwarves 
  were tossed and crowds rejoiced.<br>

<p class="body2">While doing some backflagging, Einaden discovers that asking 
  the Tribunal what color underwear he is wearing is NOT the way to find out which 
  one is the Execution Trial. Oh, BTW, inc rez as soon as we stop laughing =)<br>

<p class="body2">Oh... AoW and Statue down like three times with the patches. 
  ST cleared a couple of times (The three Shroud drops from Ventani was awesome, 
  and the monks took a few minutes recovering from the loot FD shock). Arch-Lich 
  down a couple of times. Lots of Emp Keying in SSRA going on. See you tonight 
  scrubs...<br>

<p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: High Priest down again, 
  beautiful take-down, 10 June 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Last night we gathered for High Priest, but Timeburn moved quicker 
  and gave it a shot. With 26 people, that was one heck of a try, and I thought 
  they'd pull it off. Kudos Timeburn for such a valiant attempt. Sublimity moved 
  in, buffed up, gave some of our delinquents a job, and beat the HP down. No 
  deaths, crowd control was sheer perfection. That was the smoothest HP takedown 
  I have ever had the pleasure of attending... thanks for the fun.</p>

  bin, 03 June 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Yes I know the Roster needs to be updated. I'll get to it this 
  weekend at the latest. One thing at a time folks. Last night was rather interesting 
  for raiding. Live, learn, and fight another day. Very tired today at work. Don't 
  keep me up that late again, else I'll get grumpy... and you wouldn't like me 
  when I'm grumpy. I turn into the Incredible SULK.</p>
<p class="body2">OMG Quiggles, a Teletubby!?!?! Have you no shame at all?<br>
