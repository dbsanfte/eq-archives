  from the loony bin, 03 June 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Yes I know the Roster needs to be updated. I'll get to it this 
  weekend at the latest. One thing at a time folks. Last night was rather interesting 
  for raiding. Live, learn, and fight another day. Very tired today at work. Don't 
  keep me up that late again, else I'll get grumpy... and you wouldn't like me 
  when I'm grumpy. I turn into the Incredible SULK.</p>
<p class="body2">OMG Quiggles, a Teletubby!?!?! Have you no shame at all?<br>

  burrito. /comfort Linare.<br>

<p class="body2">Sublimity first kill... enjoy guys, hopefully many more to come. 
  It just keeps getting better &amp; better every day.<br>

<p class="body2">My favorite part of a HP kill. TRAP DUTY! Yes, this lovely scene 
  is all you see as a rogue for an extremely long period of time usually. This 
  job rates right up there with cleaning chemical toilets, or listening to Hillbilly 
  music. <br>

<p class="body2">But wait, all is not lost! After a long tired evening, I got 
  a very pleasant surprise.<br>
  Who said there was no such thing as Christmas?! I should thank the little fella 
  though, without his incarnation on my last server, I wouldn't even have moved 
  to Maelin Starpyre at all. Manure stinks, but it does promote growth..<br>

<p class="body2">While killing Coldain Dwarves, I noticed something. SoE are pervs, 
  no DOUBT about it.<br>

<p class="body2">This is over a month old, but I just had to post Malakriss's 
  train in Western Wastes so everyone could get into NToV. The picture is missing 
  the extra 100+ mobs over the hill behind. It was quite impressive.<br>

<p class="body2">When in Umbral Plains for a pickup raid, we noticed that a frog 
  was frolicking with a known celebrity. You would think mister &quot;Sweatin 
  with the Oldies&quot; would have more taste. It was hard to take the frog's 
  harassing comments and insults seriously while Richard kept rubbing up against 
  him and saying &quot;Jump me!!!&quot;.<br>

<p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: The road to 
  Vex Thal, 7 May 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Recently Sublimity took a trip to SSRA as a guild to start on 
  Emp Keys. I think the final tally was around 22 insignias in one night. I've 
  never seen so many third floor named smacked-down in one evening. It appears 
  the journey has begun, and with a vengeance. It's quite awesome to see the guild 
  focused as one in its goals.<br>

<p class="body2">I spent today, Saturday, changing the site from pure table format

  EQSublimity now online, 2 May 2003 </p>
<p class="body2">If you are wondering where I have been for the last week, well 
  this is what I have been working on. Welcome to EQSublimity.com! Some parts 
  of the site are still being worked on, but please feel free to click around 
  and explore. <br>

<p class="tableHeading"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: 
  Frames or not to frame? That is the question, 2 April 2003</p>
<p class="body2">The website is currently designed using pure tables and no frames. 
  Unfortunately in the future I would like to integrate some of other links and 
  functions into the website layout. This would require frames to pull it off. 
  Hopefully you will see no visible change to the site when this modification 
  is made. <br>
