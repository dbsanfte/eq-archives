  DISBANDED!!!</p>
<p class="body2">That's right, the guild is no more. Kaput, Fini, Corpsicle. I 
  won't get into too many details, but things had been brewing for awhile. Sildaorf 
  was fed up with leading, and in a fit of anger deleted the guild in one fell 
  stroke. I posted my resignation from the guild at 2:45pm and he disbanded at 
  4:15pm CST. I'm not sure if he even saw my resignation post, but if I was the 
  killing blow, I apologize sincerely to those so abrubtly left without a home. 
  The site still has another 6 months of hosting, so I may turn this into my personal 
  playground for bad jokes or something. /shrug<br>

  to do, 9 Aug 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Well, let's see, lots of new faces have joined, and some old 
  faces have left. We've downed the Emp of SSRA a few times now. Keeper and Saryn 
  down, another Behemoth in there somewhere, Vallon and Tallon Zek 016_093, some 
  BOT tower runs, Aerin Dar down, some HoH trials, lots &amp; lots of VT keys 
  being completed. Drama, politics, bytch-fests, and your normal every day run-of-the-mill
