  Yes yes, killing the Emp in SSRA was just a diversionary tactic for our REAL 
  target, CRUSH!!! No one noticed our raid force tearing across GFay until it 
  was too late.<br>

<p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: Bah, more stuff dead, guild 
  conflicts, and the return of STNF, 19 July 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Well a few interesting things have happened since the last update. 
  I personally hope that the drama can die down and guilds can communicate with 
  each other. I really don't miss the SSRA spawn and mob fights I left on the 
  Tunare server, and would really really rather not see them here. Our first tidbit 
  for the update is a random Quiggle's tell I received. It was sufficiently twisted 
  enough to warrant a mention.<br>
  <img src="news/july/quigrt.gif" width="376" height="13"><br>
  If you cannot read it that well, it says &quot;I want to bear Rob Thomas's Children&quot;. 
  One question, WHO is Rob Thomas?</p>
<p class="body2">Fulmon, in a bout of jealousy at the utter pink gayness that 
  is Quiggles running amok on the server, decided to follow the same fashion trend. 
  Thank god he has gone back to colors not so loud recently. I think he's overdoing 
  it just a bit with the phallic spear thing from the crotch area.<br>
  <img src="news/july/fulmon.jpg" width="189" height="250"></p>
<p class="body2">Somewhere in that fashion parade, we decided to give Aagnar our 
  very first try. I think we got him to something like 40 percent. It was fun, 
  and we'll get him 2nd try for sure. Tagnar spent most of the fight under Aagnar's 
  skirts. <br>
  <img src="news/july/aagnar.jpg" width="231" height="277"></p>
<p class="body2">Among all this fun, we've been doing our standard Zek kills. 
  Tallon and Vallon are in the habit now of just handing the loot over nicely. 
  A couple of Saryn kills, another Behemoth kill, and a cheeseburger &amp; fries 
  to go with all the giant bladder busting serving of PoP. Here is a shot of Vallon, 
  permanent scream on his face after seeing Herbal drop his skivvies and moon 
  him. Herbal has dubbed it his &quot;Moonstrike&quot; nuke.<br>
  <img src="news/july/vallon.jpg" width="241" height="200"> </p>
<p class="body2">Last but not least, with all the bickering, flaming, fighting, 
  and relative nasty behavior. I think I'm just going to go back to playing the 
  best damn Role-Playing Game that has ever existed. Created around 1980, STNF 
  was THE game of choice for us bastards who were burnt out on TSR's crappy AD&amp;D 
  platform. From now on, Devyn and Petachok will be played by my Tabbie-Cat Isis. 
  I shall be elsewhere troubleshooting the Paranormal with copious amounts of 
  firepower. The good old days loading 12-gauge shells with a mix of silver-shot 
  and garlic, sigh.<br>

<p class="tableHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News: Grummus down, 1 July 2003</p>
<p class="body2">Grummus down, crappy loot, and the best line of the raid went 
  to Rypto &quot;I didn't think he would aggro, I was just standing there staring 
  at him&quot;. That's ok Rypto, we're planning something very nasty in your near 
  future, like leaving you in a dark room with Herbal for an hour. WEG (Wicked 
  Evil Grin)<br>
