  off during down times then dont bother applying.</p>
<p class="body2">Guildchat is however sensored to talking about running over cats, 
  makeing fun of dark elf warriors who wear robes and likes it, and there will 
  be no makeing fun of herbalhealer's mom! Telling Ignacius his sister is hot 
  is acceptable tho.</p>

  to have a good time while learning the game a few more requirements that are
