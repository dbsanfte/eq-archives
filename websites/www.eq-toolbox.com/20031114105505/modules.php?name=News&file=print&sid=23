    It seems that some people are installing the mod and are seeing various things; some maps are BLOWN UP REAL HUGE, some people are missing Luclin, and one person reported his spell gem icons were fubared.
<br><br>
If you are having problems such as these, please send in feedback with the following info:
<br>
- Video card brand and model, and amount of video RAM<br>
- System RAM in megabytes<br>
- How many expansions you have installed<br>
<br>
If you don't want to submit all this info, all I can offer you is the guesstimate that you are running out of video ram and can't load the 30+ 2048x2048 images in the map set.  Unfortunately, there is NO workaround for this, except maybe disabling all your expansion graphics, which would suxx0r.
