From EQLIVE<br> 
<br>
After much faithful service, it's time for us to bid a fond farewell to EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces. In yesterday's Test Server patch, the old interfaces were disabled. 
<br><br>
While adding many features to the new interface over the past six months, including the built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, and enhanced /bug reporting tool, we've done the best that we could to keep all three interfaces, at the very least, usable. 
<br><br>
However, some of the features that we've been quietly working on over the past weeks have unfortunately forced our hand. 
<br><br>
We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes at once, however, in yesterday's Test Server update, we released the first run of the new EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works for quite some time now. (In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.) Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth. As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed. 
<br><br>
In addition, the long-rumored "Bard Box" has also been revealed on the Test Server. For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs. Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character. 
<br><br>
These updates will remain on the Test Server only until after the new year, as we expect that much additional testing will be required. 
<br><br>
We hope you'll be as pleased with these latest changes as we are, and we look forward to bringing you many new features in the coming months. 
<br><br>
