    Where to start?<br>
<br>

Planes of Power appears to be a huge success from SOE's point of view. From the user's point of view, I don't recall a new expansion ever being rolled out so smoothly. <br>
<br>

Seems like every patch they do they are breaking the UI modifications people have made. Quite a few folks have told me that they are holding off making any mods until all of the changes are done.  Unfortunately, I don't think they will ever be 'done'.<br>
<br>

We now have a couple new windows for our amusement.  We have a built in alarm clock for those who can't keep track of their online time. We have a new MP3 window. I haven't seen alot of new skins for that yet, but there are a few.  The EQIM came and went. It's still there. It's free.. but I know maybe 3 people who are using it. Are you one of them? <br>
<br>
Most of the functionality we had requested in the UI still isn't there. Holding your breath until it arrives is not advisable.<br>
<br>
