    EZBoard appears to have suffered a meltdown of major proportions. EverQuest message boards seem to favor the EZBoard system and are all unreachable at this time. Visitors are being greeted with the following message:<br>
<br>
This server is temporarily down:<br>
We are performing a system upgrade.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. We expect to be back up Thursday evening (8 PM Oct 3, 2002 PDT). <br>
<br>
Please note that we will credit all down time to all GOLD communities once we have finished our maintenance. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. <br>
<br>
UPDATE: We are taking this opportunity to balance the core database servers to improve performance and reliability. We appreciate your understanding and patience. <br>
<br>

The time is constantly being pushed back. Originally it was scheduled to be back up at 11pm PST last night, then  8am PST, now 8pm PST. <br>
<br>

Time to consider hosting your own message forums perhaps?
