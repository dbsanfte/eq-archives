But wait, there's more!  Click <b>Read More</b> above to get the full story!
<br><br>
<i>PS: They need some people with real creative writing skills to do their fictional stuff.  I mean, that blurb at the end about some reptilian creature waking up is REALLY poorly written.  Words are misused several times.</i><br><br>

<p><b>Important Notice about Alternate Advancement</b></p>
<p>When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red message 
stating: </p>
<p>Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of 30. 
Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able to earn further 
AA points until you have fewer than 30. On October 21, 2002, all points over 30 
in your AA pool will be deleted. </p>
<p>It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the release of 
Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier expansions. In addition, many 
of the Luclin abilities are pre-requisites for Planes of Power abilities. When 
the servers come up on October 21st, all unused Alternate Advancement point 
pools over 30 will be wiped. </p>
<p><b>New Spell Effects</b></p>
<p>We are implementing a few new spell effects using our new particle effects 
engine with this patch as a way of easing into the new system. The new effects 
are faster and give you more control over how they look. We have changed the 
Display Options menu to accommodate these new options. </p>
<p>On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four options 
regarding particle effects. The first three, listed under Spell Particles are 
Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity. These are the options for controlling the 
new particle effects. They will not change the old particle effects. The old 
particles are controlled using the Other Particles option. </p>
<p>Note on Near Clip Plane: This option chooses how close to you particles cease 
to be visible. So Near allows particles to be seen right up to the character. 
Farthest will clip out particles near the character and only show those at the 
'farthest' distance. </p>
<p>Note on Opacity: This feature works at all settings for cards that support 
TnL. For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the effects and any 
other setting will show them fully. </p>
<p>We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new particles...
</p>

  <li>Beastlords now have access to three unique class alternate advancements.
  <br>

 </li>
  <li>Updated Finishing Blow  <br>
  <br>
  "This ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below 10 percent 
  health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level works on NPC's below 
  50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third on NPC's below 54. 
  (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat Fury to use this ability.) 
  " <br>

  spent after level 1. </li>
</ul>

  initial findings have proven very powerful, rumors exist of even greater 
  magics that might channel the nightmares of Terris Thule herself into the 
  minds of mortals. Where that power might be found is not yet known.  </li>

<p><b>An Ancient Arises</b></p>
<p>Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a dark, 
menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent for ages. The 
eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the darkness, his memories 
flowing freely once more. In the depths of this beast's mind sparks the 
knowledge that his prophetic savior has been released from the ancient magiks of 
time, let loose upon an unsuspecting world where the kin shall once again reign 
supreme. </p>
<p>"My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in this 
world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall bring power 
back to those of the scale." The deep rumbling voice of the beast lingers 
throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely distinguishable figure of a mighty 
lizard moves through the stone and dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy 
surroundings and find his place once again upon Norrath proper. </p>
<p>"For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might that kept 
me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been victim to the 
ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now I awaken and bring life 
back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood of the Four once again spread the 
word of prophecy!" The footsteps of this great beast are slow but sure, moving 
through the depths of the gaping mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the 
walls, pebbles and stones that have remained dormant for years crumble and 
crack, falling to the ground as the immense beast walks past. </p>
<p>A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse beyond 
the figure's resting place. The skeletons of those who had tried - and failed - 
to make their way to him in the years he spent in forced slumber remain, tumbled 
landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, his reptilian eyes darting back 
and forth looking for any meager meals that may still be available. As he 
proceeds, he steps atop a mighty echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not 
defy the magical properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of 
fathoming the power that lay beyond them. "Time has been good to you, my 
faithful warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The time for the 
revival is at hand." </p>
