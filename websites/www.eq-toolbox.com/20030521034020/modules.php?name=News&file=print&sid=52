    More news from the test server regarding recent changes.

This one includes the sound engine, high level experience, and some new commands.

<br><br>
    <b>Sound and Music</b>
<br>
We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the first step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't fixed, please be patient. There's no need to re-report existing sound/music bugs.
<br>
<br> 
<b>Gameplay</b>
<br>
Experience: Post-50 characters will now gain far more experience from hunting NPCs at or above their own level than ever before. This is a test of a potential new system. Briefly, the idea isn't really that much of a stretch: The larger the risk you take, the larger the reward should be. 
<br>  
Experience: Post-50 "hell" effect levels are gone. There are no longer any levels in EverQuest that are anywhere near twice as hard as their previous levels. Please note: This does not change the amount of experience required to go from "No experience in level 1" to "Full-bar in level 60." It's just about smoothing out the trip. 
<br>
Resists: More work on the resist system. Please don't expect every spell to resist exactly the same as it used to. However, do feel free to report anything that you suspect is obvious brokenness. (Note: Whoever killed Hobart's two-million HP Fire Beetle of Testing while we were at lunch - That was mean.) 
<br>
<br>
<b>Support</b>
<br>
Two new commands to play with: /viewpetition, /deletepetition. You may now review your existing petition. If you happen to resolve it yourself, you can then delete it.<br><br>
