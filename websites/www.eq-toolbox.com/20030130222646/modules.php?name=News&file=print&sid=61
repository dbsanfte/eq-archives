    There was a huge patch today, as everyone has been expecting.  It was put off a couple times, and it's a real whopper.  Many people were expecting the 75% complete heals in this patch, but they are NOT in yet; we've heard that testing hasn't been completed on them.  Click Read More to get the full patch message.
<br><br>
<i>BTW, they broke the /Note command, as EQWatcher has already discovered.  He posted a workaround in our Utilities section; check it out!</i><br><br>

Please note: there are a lot of changes going into the game with today's 
patch. Some of these changes (such as the changes to resistances and spell 
stacking) will change aspects of the game that may make gameplay different. Keep 
this in mind when you log in. With system-wide changes like these it is entirely 
possible that there are still bugs. Please report these bugs using /bug, and 
know that we will work to fix them as fast as we can. But also note that some 
intended changes might appear as bugs (perhaps a spell no longer stacks with 
another spell). Feel free to report these as bugs if you are unsure. But please 
keep in mind the changes listed here as well. </p>
<p><b>Petitions</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>/viewpetition</b> displays the petition you have in the queue, if 
  any. </li>
  <li>
  <b>/deletepetition</b> deletes the petition you have in the queue, if 
  any (unless that petition is currently being viewed by CS staff).
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Keyrings</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. This will mean that 
  all existing keys in the keyrings will be removed. You will need to place keys 
  back onto the keyrings. Keys are added to the keyring by using the key. The 
  keyring is a part of the character, not a space in inventory. To find out what 
  keys you have just type /key and the game will give you a list. If you have 
  recently deleted a key, please contact your GM for a replacement.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Experience Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should 
  mitigate the "penalty effect" that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59. Note that 
  it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did before.</li>
  <li>
  Also, death experience loss will appear different in some levels. This 
  is an unfortunate side effect that must remain to prevent some experience 
  exploits. </li>
  <li>
  We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over 
  level 50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you less 
  experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, and for the 
  best results you should fight the most challenging monsters you can reasonably 
  manage. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Spells</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Fixed the "You have been healed for X damage" message. It once again 
  reports the actual amount of damage healed. </li>
  <li>
  Added a message telling the caster when NPC can't be charmed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug with duration boosting Alternate Advancement abilities and 
  foci that was only allowing the first 12 buff slots to be modified as opposed 
  to all 15. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug that was allowing focused and Alternate Advancement 
  ability enhanced damage spells to do more damage than they should (meaning 
  that both the Alternate Advancement and the Focus improve the base damage. The 
  focus damage was never supposed to compound with the added AA damage.)
  </li>
  <li>
  Enchanter spells that have a hit point component and a stun component 
  can now be partially resisted. </li>
  <li>
  The Enchanter "visage" series has had their recast time reduced to 
  make them more useful. </li>
  <li>
  Shadowknight and Necromancer Drain type spells can now be clicked off 
  by the recipient of the beneficial portion of the spell. For example; 
  Shadowknights and their group members can now click off the effects of spells 
  such as Torrent of Hate. While the target of spells such as Shadowbond can 
  click it off if they so choose. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Torrent of Hate should no longer overwrite Call of the Predator
  </li>
  <li>
  Repaired some problems with Beastlord stat buffs - specifically that 
  the higher level ones weren't always better than the lower level ones.
  </li>
  <li>
  Furious Strength made available to Beastlords at Level 54
  </li>
  <li>
  Dexterity made available to Beastlords at Level 57 </li>
  <li>
  Stamina made available to Beastlords at Level 57 </li>
  <li>
  Divine aura is now available to Paladins at level 51, instead of level 
  55. </li>
  <li>
  Harmshield made available to Shadowknights at level 51 </li>
  <li>
  Augment Death made available to Shadow Knights at Level 60
  </li>
  <li>
  Death Peace made available to Necromancers at level 60 </li>
  <li>
  Flaming Sword of Xuzl has casting time reduced from 6 to 2.5 seconds, 
  recast increased from 2.5 to 60 seconds and mana cost lowered from 600 to 250.
  </li>
  <li>
  Unswerving Hammer of Faith has casting time reduced from 6 to 2.5 
  seconds, recast increased from 2.5 to 60 seconds and mana cost lowered from 
  600 to 250. </li>
  <li>
  Added a new line of spells for Shadowknights, Voice of Darkness. 
  Merchants in Echo Caverns have been able to appropriate many of these new 
  spells, but Voice of Terris has so far eluded them. </li>
  <li>
  Added two new Mesmerize type spells for Bards, one at level 40, and 
  one at level 58. Rumor has it that Serilia Whistlewind has recovered the 
  melody written by Sionachie, but has been unable to locate the transcript for 
  the Dreams of Ayonae. </li>
  <li>
  Whispers in the taverns of Katta Castellum speak of recently 
  discovered Ancient melodies. Brave adventurers search far and wide for the 
  song of the ancient combine empire, and the Lullaby of Shadows. </li>
  <li>
  Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells.
  </li>
  <li>
  Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC to 
  30. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Spell Stacking Changes</b></p>
<p>
We've made two changes to the way spells stack. <br>
<normal /><br>
Damage Over Time (DoT) spells are spells that linger on the target doing 
damage. Until today two different characters could not have the same DoT spell 
on the same target. As long as one copy of the spell was active any new version 
of the spell would not take hold. After today the same DoT spell cast by 
different casters can affect the same target at the same time. Also, if you cast 
a DoT spell on a target and you already have that spell active on it, the spell 
will refresh. (Note: It will not be possible to stack Lifeburn). <br>
<normal /><br>
This does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior 
spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the same target. 
However, Heat Blood, being an inferior spell, will still not stack.)
<br>
<normal /><br>
Several DoT spells that have debuff components such as Tuyen's Chant of 
Frost and Breath of Ro will not stack due to the balance issues of having 
several hundred points of Resistance debuffs on a single NPC. <br>
<normal /><br>
We've also rewritten the way that spells stack with other spells with 
the same benefits (for example, to spells that give bonus hit points). Generally 
speaking spells may now 'bounce' off each other (neither overwriting the other) 
and stacking issues should now be easier to resolve. In specific: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Warder's Protection should have considerably fewer stacking and 
  overwrite issues. Thanks to the folks at the Ranger's Glade for all of their 
  help in 'tracking' this down. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order.
  
  </li>
  <li>
  Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs.
  
  </li>
  <li>
  Harness of Spirit and Visions of Grandeur should interact a bit more 
  sanely. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Existing effects should no longer be stripped off when the incoming 
  spell isn't going to take hold. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Boon of Garou and other illusions now interact the right way.
  </li>
  <li>
  Spells that have both group and single target versions (and no special 
  coding to tell them otherwise) now mutually overwrite each other.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Resistance Changes 
</b></p>
<p>
We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance 
system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to having resists 
over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its entirety, completely 
replacing the old system with one that is more logical. <br>
<normal /><br>
The idea behind the changes is pretty simple: Resists should matter in a 
way that makes sense. <br>
<normal /><br>
Important things to note about the new resistance system: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Resists matter more for PCs. There are now tangible differences 
  between having 50, 150, and 250 in a given resistance, for example. Resistance 
  buffs, bard songs, and resist gear have actual value, all the way up the line.
  <br>
 </li>
  <li>
  Conversely, resistances also matter more for NPCs. Some NPCs became 
  more vulnerable to things they have always been vulnerable to, other NPCs 
  became more resistant to things that they were inclined to be somewhat 
  resistant to. <br>
 </li>
  <li>
  Resistance debuffs should also have more value, all the way up the 
  line. For the first time, resistance debuffs now have the ability to bring 
  NPCs that were lure-style only down into the range of being hit by normal 
  spells. <br>
 </li>
  <li><b>
  The hard level limit involving players casting on NPCs has been 
  removed. This used to be referred to in EQ folklore as the "Six Level Limit" 
  (It was actually 1.25 times the caster's level, but more people likely thought 
  about it the other way.) This means that in the vast majority of cases, there 
  is at least a small chance that a person will be able to connect a spell with 
  an NPC, even if they are out of that NPC's traditional level range.
  </b></li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, against NPCs that have medium-to-high resistances of a given 
type, expect to see more full hits, fewer partials, but more full resists in the 
new system. Taken over time, the damage done by PC casters to semi-high 
resistance NPCs should be approximately the same, but will definitely improve 
when the proper debuffs are applied (we wanted to make sure that this did not 
turn into a universal nerf of casters). <br>
<normal /><br>
We look forward to seeing how these changes play out in front of a 
larger audience. 
</p>
<p>
<normal /><b>
Line of Sight Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>
  For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at 
  the beginning of the spellcast, not the end. </b></li>
  <li>
  Spells that require but do not have of LoS will now fail immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
  Harmful spells require LoS. </li>
  <li>
  Most Beneficial spells still do not require LoS. </li>
  <li>
  Bind Sight type spells do not require LoS. </li>
  <li>
  Any beneficial spell containing a Cancel Magic component requires LoS.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Priest Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Clerics gain the Bash skill beginning at level 25. They will have a 
  maximum skill of 125 at level 50, 165 at level 60. </li>
  <li>
  Clerics gain Hammer of Judgement - a level 56 summoned hammer with a 
  powerful and frequent proc effect </li>
  <li>
  Clerics gain Yaulp V - a level 56 self-only melee and mana regen buff 
  that adds haste, dexterity, mana regeneration and stamina regeneration.
  </li>
  <li>
  Clerics gain Ethereal Elixir - a level 60 group version of Celestial 
  Elixir, the heal-over-time spell. </li>
  <li>
  Clerics gain Ethereal Light - a level 58 upgrade of Divine Light, the 
  single target heal spell. </li>
  <li>
  Clerics gain Ethereal Remedy - a level 59 upgrade of Remedy, the 
  single target heal spell. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Sound and Music</b></p>
<p>
We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have 
sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the first 
step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't fixed, please 
be patient. There's no need to re-report existing sound/music bugs. </p>
<p><b>
Items</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Items now display level-restricted statistics besides armor class and 
  damage as a red number with the unrestricted value in parentheses.
  </li>
  <li>
  Duration focus items now give focus message when a group spell lands 
  on caster. </li>
  <li>
  Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl has been given a minor upgrade.
  </li>
  <li>
  Small Cloth Sandals are no longer wearable by large races.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed the Plane of Mischief boxes. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Pets</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>
  Changed Specter pets so they're able to equip items and armor.
  </b></li>
  <li>
  Pet-only buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet if you 
  cast them with the wrong target or no target at all. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug that would prevent the creation of Familiars and Warders 
  if the caster had created more than 99 in the same zone during the current 
  game session. </li>
  <li><b>
  The limit on the amount of haste that can be applied to a pet has been 
  changed (aka. The Pet Haste Cap). The amount of haste that can be placed on a 
  pet now scales with the level of its owner. The scaling occurs in a way that 
  is consistent with how much haste a given caster can place on his own pet 
  (using a Level 56 Magician as an example: The idea is that both Burnout IV and 
  Muzzle of Mardu should be useful). </b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>
User Interface</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells can be deleted from 
  your spellbook. To delete a spell just right-click it to highlight it and tap 
  the DELETE key. Please note: This does not convert the spell back into a 
  scroll. You will have to buy a new scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. 
  No reimbursements will be made for deleted spells. </li>
  <li>
  Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-Left-Click, the item 
  inspect window stays up. To paste a "link" to the item you're looking at into 
  your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will "speak" a link that 
  others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if they were inspecting 
  it themselves. </li>
  <li>
  Updated the /note window. The old /note <text> command still works as 
  it always has. But you can now use /note without additional text to produce a 
  text window for entering note text. The /note command window should not break 
  existing skins. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug with the tracking window that was showing the sorting set 
  for something other than normal for non-rangers (this was just a visual bug).
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the corpse 
  window open. </li>
  <li>
  Added UI Label type #74 = Player Title </li>
  <li>
  "Reply to" will properly prepend a ;tell in front of names that are 
  from other servers. </li>
  <li>
  Extended the "reply to" queue to 50 names. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed some aesthetics with labels. Percentages will never show above 
  100 now (even during a heal). Corpse HP will always show 0. </li>
  <li>
  There will now be sound when banking coins. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Bazaar</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Added Focus Effect search parameter to the Bazaar. </li>
  <li>
  Items that are no-drop on other servers but tradable on Firiona Vie 
  should now show up in Bazaar searches on that server. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Alternate Advancement</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Frenzied Burnout no longer makes the pet suicide after the buff's 
  duration ends. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug that would cause the Dire Charm ability not to reset if an 
  enchanter used it when he already had a pet. </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug that was causing Dire Charm to not give the "this mob 
  cannot be Dire Charmed" message or reset the timer in Cazic-Thule.
  </li>
  <li>
  Added the Quest Completion sound to AA point dings. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Quests</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  There is a fellow named Moltak in Sol Temple. Killing him gives a 
  negative faction adjustment with the True Spirit faction. BUT, if you have a 
  very, very bad faction with True Spirit, killing him will also reset your 
  faction to a more tolerable level. So don't mess with this fellow unless folks 
  on the True Spirit faction are willing to kill you on sight. </li>
  <li>
  Made some modifications to the faction effects of the Wizard Epic 
  quest. </li>
  <li>
  A powerful warder has been seen in the Skyfire Mountains. Those who 
  seek retribution against Ragefire would be wise to speak to her, she may be 
  able to provide information about his whereabouts. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Miscellaneous</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>
  Merchants now display up to 80 items in their inventory. There should 
  also be less delay when opening up merchant windows. </b></li>
  <li>
  The Help window will now be displayed on startup. This will happen 
  only if it has never been seen before (since this change). </li>
  <li>
  Sirens should have female voices. </li>
  <li>
  Bloodgill Goblins should now sound like goblins. </li>
  <li>
  Several spell caster guild masters are now teaching magic skills. In 
  Shadowhaven: Palomidiar Allakhaji, Loewnsaz_Waldalon and Lamukas Kaesoanls. In 
  Echo Caverns: Kelador, Celerik, Wirgus and Yurian. </li>
  <li>
  Erudites of Prexus now start at the proper location. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Bards singing songs should no longer prevent group members from /split'ting 
  coins. Only teleportation spells being cast in group will prevent /split'ting. 
  This change was required to keep coin from disappearing if a /split occurred 
  while a person was in the process of leaving a zone. </li>
  <li>
  Leather Padding can now be made from Rockhopper Hides. </li>
