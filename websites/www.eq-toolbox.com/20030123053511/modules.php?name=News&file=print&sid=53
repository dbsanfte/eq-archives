    <b>EQWatcher Advanced v1.15 Released</b> 
<br>
This update fixes some reported bugs (the Script Management line of bugs are finally terminated) as well as assures proper functionality of some other interesting things.<br>
 #1 Internet connections (the "email myself at work while my character is in the bazaar at home" idea will work successfully)... note that your internet connection protection settings deny any unwanted connectivity. <br>
#2 The guys at EQ Toolbox have asked for some light assistance with a project, so the CopyFile script command was added which can copy binary files... note that your file protection settings deny any unwanted file i/o outside of the EQWatcher directory tree, as well as protect many files important to EQWatcher Advanced. 
<br>
Changes:<br> 
----------- <br>
Interpreter <br>
----------- <br>
- Changed SockConnect so that it does not hold up the script thread while trying to connect, and it now uses the "On Connect" callback alias to notify of connection. <br>
- Changed sockets support to not send NULL after each transmission<br> 
- The two above changes made possible the SMTP (send email) library, which is now included in the Source directory (it does contain a commented-out main function for demonstration)<br> 
- Fixed that last pesky Script Management bug that prevented one single character from being omitted from the list each time <br>
-------- <br>
Compiler <br>
-------- <br>
- Fixed bug with automatic string concatenation using "string"+data<br> 
- Added "CopyFile" script command, which.. copies a file <br><br><br>
