    I have been exchanging emails with Roy Eltham, Senior Programmer for Everquest and one of the original folks who worked on the UI. The questions answers can be found by clicking the <b>Read more</b> link.
<br><br>
    1) Will you folks be releasing a 'schema' that a standard XML editor (for instance, xml spy) would  be able to use to actually display the files the way they would be displayed in the game? We currently have a working version of a 'viewer' but there are still issues with it, mostly due to unseen/unknown rules not available to us as a user.<br>
<br>
<i>Unfortunately, the way our stuff works it would be difficult (probably impossible to get it right) to make a schema that a standard xml editor could use. To be honest, we currently just use standard text editors internally, and a special version of the client that lets us run offline and windowed. So the game itself is our viewer.</i> 
<br>
<br>
<b> Luckily, someone else has made great progress with this and a viewer is available - Ram </b><br>
<br>
<br>
2) Can we get a list of which windows have hard coded requirements that certain elements must be present in. For instance, we can't just rewrite any
window because in some cases it fails due to missing element types.<br>
<br>

<i>The list would be pretty much every window. Currently, we are in the process of making the code deal with missing elements without crashing. In most cases it will just run and whatever function the mission piece had will just not work on that window, but in some cases (primarily whole windows or tab pages being missing) it will revert to the default UI files. We realize that it would have been more idea to make everything completely flexible as to what window it goes in and so forth, but that would have required a great deal more work (and the new UI was already a great deal of work) and time (we probably would still be working on it and not have it live yet). </i><br>
<br>
<br>
3) Will we have the ability to create our own windows? Currently, we are modifying windows that have other functionality. Obviously this is not
optimal for the developers or for VI. It looks like most of the code is there, what seems to be missing is the ability to actually call the window.<br>
<br>
<i>We would like to eventually work something out for this to be possible,
but it will be somewhat limited since the "new" windows will only be able to
have elements on them that we have coded to work on any window (guages,
labels, animations, and some inventory slots).</i><br>
<br>
<br>
4) We see that the STMLBOX tag is present and some folks have totally rewrote the help window. This is not our preferred method, we don't want to
alter the content you are providing in the help window. If we could create a new window, or alter an unused window, to be an STML window and actually designate a <src> for the stml file, alot of these issues would disappear.<br>
<br>
<i>
I will look into the idea of the STMLBOX tag having a default source file to go in it. Keep in mind that you can only access files from the local hard drive.</i> <br>
<br>
<br>
<B> And last but not least.. the EULA question</b> <br><br>
5)Could we get an exact definition as to what kind of UI mods would be against the EULA now. We assume if it doesn't interact with the datastream
or alter the actual client's code, it would be allowed.<br>
<br>
<i>UI mods should not be able to violate the EULA. However, if through some bug in our system you should find a way to alter the code of the game such that it allows you to exploit or cheat then it will be considered a violation. However, while I can't say this will never happen, I can say that is it very unlikely because we have set thing up in such a way that it should not be possible.</i><br>
