    Major changes in the two tools is the advantage that both now use same support files so you just have to create the file for one tool and can use it for the other.<br />
<br />
2nd major change includes reading all the necessary spell data from the spelldata_live file from http://lucy.fnord.net/ (thx for this great service). this way you don't have to add new spells all the time.<br />
<br />
3rd major update only goes for EQAnalyser and makes live monitoring available.<br />
<br />
For next versions to come see details.<br><br>
    EQSpellTimer v3.0.0 - 23.09.03<br />
