    New (lengthy) patch message on Test.
<br><br>
Interesting stuff!  Click Read More to see it.<br><br>
    <p>The patch on <u>Test Server</u> from yesterday contained quite a bit of new 
goodness in it. Here are the details for those keeping score at home: </p>
<p><b>General</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Merchants: You can now view 80 items worth of inventory from both PC 
  Traders and NPC Merchants. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Internal</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewrote the "Do I Own This Expansion?" validation that happens when a 
  person changes zones. Prevented people from entering old world zones. One 
  world patch later, it appears to be working properly. Sorry about that. <br>
 </li>
  <li>Items can now have both a traditional Effect and Focus Effect. Please 
  check out the new and improved 8th Shawl for an example. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Interface</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>New /note window. The window should allow people to take notes in game if 
  they like, but the old /note <text> command still works as it always has. Use 
  /note without additional text to see. The /note command window has been 
  intentionally designed to <u>not</u> break existing skins. <br>
 </li>
  <li>The Tab/Shift-Tab "/reply" queue now takes into account the people who may 
  be talking to you across servers, and knows to use a ";reply" command to talk 
  back to them. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Magic System</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>DoT Stacking: Many player-cast Damage over Time spells now allow multiple 
  versions of themselves to land on a single NPC. This only works for spells 
  that are already on a creature, and does not allow for inferior spells to 
  stack along with superior spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land 
  Boil Blood on the same target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior, will 
  still not stack.) Please note, there is at least one bug preventing some 
  spells from stacking that we've already fixed and will be shipped fixed next 
  test patch. <br>
 </li>
  <li>NPCs can now hold a total of 30 effects (buffs and debuffs) before effects 
  begin to stop taking hold. <br>
 </li>
  <li>Your-Pet-Only targeted buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet 
  if you cast them with the wrong target, or no target at all. <br>
 </li>
  <li>Foci/AA Criticals: Last patch, foci began adding their damage to post-AA 
  damage. They now stack linearly again. (Meaning, the AA improves the base 
  damage, then the Focus improves the base damage as well. The focus damage was 
  never supposed to compound with the added AA damage.) <br>
 </li>
  <li>Focus items: Many internal enhancements to the focus system. From the 
  gameplay point of view, everything should still be working as it was. </li>
</ul>
