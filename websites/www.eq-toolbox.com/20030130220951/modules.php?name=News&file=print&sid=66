    Some of the details for Planes of Power were released recently on the EQ Live website.  Click <b>Read More</b> above to read it!<br><br>
    <p>The Planes of Power development team has been working hard to ensure 
development is on schedule and things are looking really fantastic. Initially, 
we wanted to avoid mentioning too much too soon; unfortunately the lack of 
details has lead, at least in part, to an increase in rumors as we get closer to 
the release of Planes of Power. We'd like to put some of those rumors to rest 
and give you a general outline of some of the things we have planned. </p>
<p>For Planes of Power there will be two forms of character advancement: level 
increase and Planar Advancement. </p>
<p>The level cap will increase to 65. Those levels will have inherent benefits 
much like previous levels. However, they will not be exactly the same. The rate 
of advancement in character levels is designed to feel more natural and not take 
the punishing time commitment required between 51 and 60. We understand the 
frustration that painfully long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that 
experience for players. This, combined with the new bonuses for fighting higher 
level opponents, should make leveling seem less like something that you have to 
do and more like something that just happens as you play. </p>
<p>Level advancement is closely tied to Planar Advancement. The systems 
compliment each other. Planar advancement includes extensions on the Alternate 
Advancement system, along with new abilities for all classes. Advancing your 
character is a combination of traditional leveling and advancement through 
planar abilities. Players who enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people that 
prefer a combination of level advancement and investment in specific abilities 
can do that as well. </p>
<p>That's the basic plan for advancement in Planes of Power. We'll continue to 
refine and tune the specific details as we go through the remaining six weeks of 
beta testing. </p>
<p>Many of the game balancing and system changes you've seen in Live EverQuest 
over the last few months have been done with this future advancement in mind. 
Expect to see more balancing that allows us to once again develop high end 
content that does not involve marathon battles that are more about attendance 
and endurance than tactics and skill (e.g. The first time people rounded the 
corner, stared Trakanon square in the face, and knew they had mere minutes to 
win or lose, as opposed to the second hour of an end-game encounter.) Creating 
Planes of Power has been as much about re-evaluating existing gameplay as it has 
been about creating new gameplay. </p>
<p>We believe that advancement should be fun and rewarding. We are very aware of 
the issues that players are not enjoying in current gameplay and some of the 
mechanics introduced with other expansions. We plan to avoid contrived "timesinks", 
so that you'll be playing rather than just spending time. This is not to say 
that success in Planes of Power doesn't require some time, we just want it to be 
time that you can enjoy. And even though this is a high level expansion, there 
will be ways for both casual and hardcore players to advance. </p>
<p>That is as much detail as we can give you right now. We appreciate your 
patience, and we hope that you'll enjoy Planes of Power. </p>
