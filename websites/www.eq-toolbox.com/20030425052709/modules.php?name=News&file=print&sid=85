    On the test server, EQ is now playable in a window.  This is good news for all the folks who have been using EQwindows or wanted to have EQ in a window but didn't want to violate the EULA.

This is from the Test server forums:<br>

Hi folks, just wanted to let everyone know that we are making some huge changes on the Test server today.<br>
The changes being made involve a new character file format, which means every aspect of an EverQuest character could be affected.<br>
I would like to encourage as many people as possible to log on to Test server and check out your characters. Be sure to report any anomalies you find via /petition.<br>
<br><br>
Yay.
<br><br>
ALT ENTER should flip windows for ya.<br>
Also noticed a new window called short duration buffs. I guess this should free up buff slots by putting bards songs and heals over time etc in this new window.  Should be interesting.
<br> 
Check it out on test.
