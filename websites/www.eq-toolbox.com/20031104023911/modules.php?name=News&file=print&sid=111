"I asked people where are the LoDn maps and they all say at eq-toolbox..... so i now ask where exactly is the maps all i see is mappie i download it and its some darn program outside of eq...<br>
IM LOOKING FOR MAPS and not programs... ... then you have 100,000 maps ... i click on that and i dont see not one map to download ... you need to fix it to where people can come and get what they are looking for or some kind of direction "

And yes, I agree. I know it is very confusing to folks to remember that maps.eq-toolbox.com is the site where the maps are. That is why I added the link at the top that says : <br>
<br>
Maps! Maps! Maps! <br>
If you are looking for the maps, the correct URL is maps.eq-toolbox.com <br>
<br>

I added it about 6 months ago.  Sorry if that is too difficult to understand.  Amazingly enough, 7000 people a day are able to find them. maybe they have a map. I bet they are the same kind of people that like to do things like.. oh, i dont know.. read.  <br>
<br>
Ok, now that we have cleared up where I have cleverly hidden the top secret maps, let's address the issue of me hiding the ability to download them.  Again, this is a common issue mentioned daily. <br>
<br>
Lets go take a look at the map page and see just exactly what the problem is.. <br>
<br>
AHA! I have found the problem.. <br><br>
The text at the top of the page : <br><br>
To install a map, right click the filename and click Save Target As, and save the map into your EverQuestmaps directory.
<br><br> is just too damn confusing<br>
<br>Apparently it has to actually be read to be understood.  Imagine that.. oh.. and one more thing..
<br>
<br>
I realize that those instructions can be a little difficult for your avergae adult and not everyone has a second grader to assist them, so we added the text: <br>
Click here to download a Zip file of all maps.
<br>
<br>
That text was also added quite a while ago. <br>
<br>
While this is not idiot proof, it goes a long way in pointing out the idiots to me. And while I don't usually harrass people who ask me specific questions, you sir submitted your question as a story to published on the front page.  I'm just honoring your request.   :)
<br> <br>
And to the users who just drop me a line saying thanks etc,  I say, glad I can help.
