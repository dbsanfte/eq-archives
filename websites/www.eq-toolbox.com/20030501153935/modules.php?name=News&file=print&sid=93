    The <a href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com"> Maps </a> site seems to be a huge success.  I am starting to receive quite a few updates and I will be adding them daily. <br> <br>

The site is being redesigned daily to add additional functionality and ease of use. Keep the suggestions coming. <br><br>

The Maps site is a community based effort. Your submissions of updated maps is what will keep it going. As I receive each submission, a picture of it is generated and i compare it to the one we currently have. If it is indeed an updated map, it replaces the current one.  Currently, this is a manual process and takes a bit of time so i will be doing it once a day. As the process it updated and becomes more efficient, it will be done more often.
<br><br>

Again, thanks for your support and keep those maps coming! <br><br>
