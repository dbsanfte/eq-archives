agent of the spirits. In the deep waters where the megalodon is said to hunt, 
there is another. And where the wonders of nature rise in the dark, another ally 
awaits. Look for light in the denseness of entwined shadows. One will greet you 
with all you have learned. She is doing research in a bustling labyrinth of 
creatures and can educate you where I cannot. Tell them all of me and they will 
give you audience.'</span><font size="2"> </font></font></p>

spirit talismans. In times past, the spirits bestowed very powerful talismans 
upon a few, but [great] heyokah. We are going to need some of them to perform 
this ritual as they contain some of the essence of the very beings we are tying 
to save.'</span></font></p>

Juktopp Gantroc. Though he was small in stature, his knoledge seemed and endless

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Kimm McShannel says 'Aye, 
so ye have returned. We have much to do here, me friend. The first thing we must 
do is [break down] this bangle into its gems and metal. This here bangle was 
very carefully made. First, the gems were blessed by the spirits, then the metal 
itself as it was forged. Aye, we need to carefully separate them. The two gems 
were blessed by the spirits of Wisdom and Patience, and the metal was 
strengthened by the Spirit of Might. We will use these to call them back to us.'</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">You say, 'break down?'</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Kimm McShannel says 'As 
most things, the process is not a simple one and we'll need some ingredients for 
a special potion. You must retrieve four items, which should not prove difficult 
for a shaman of your stature. They are very specific and I can tell you more 
about the [skin], the [powder], the [tooth], and the [goo]. When you have all of 
these things, use my medicine bag to create this potion and return it to me.'</span></font></p>

find a foul hound of flesh with no fur and fangs. We need a perfect specimen of 
some of its skin for our potion. Three should do nicely.' </span>

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Kimm McShannel says 'The 
powder is very unique and can be difficult to obtain -- many have died trying as 
it's a coveted magic. There is an undead fiend that uses this powder to turn 
many creatures and darken them. It is a beast in a sickly plane which makes it 
that much more challenging, of course. This powder is needed so that we can use 
a pinch of it to attract the Spirit of Might close enough to us to have it turn 
its back on the path of the wasichu.' </span>

Kimm McShannel says 'In suffocating lands, there are a few revenants with a

goo is very special and will provide a strong acidic base for the agent we are 
creating. You will find it deep where the spirits groan and drift, where it 
seems even the walls howl in agony. There is only one creature that produces 
this goo that we use to separate gem from metal. It is very deep within that 
place. You should try to obtain two samples of goo.'' </span>
