                        Last week we took a dive in PoWater to get a first shot at Coirnav.
                        <br>
                        However he did not show his ugly face,we decided to take down his minions 1 by 1.
                        <br>
                        And we got another Alliance first by killing Ofossaa the Enlightened.
                        <br>
                        First we went to see Grioihin the Wise who decided to drop down the floor when he died.
                        <br>
                        Gladly a Guide was helpful by dragging the corpse up to our camp for the loot.
                        <br>
                        Thank you Guide Rhagnor for your kind and swift help.Of course he had his own opinion about Grioihin the Wise:

                              And he was right,so we moved down to Hydrotha to give him a royal smackdown

                                 Then commenced with the pull for Krziik the Mighty.

                                       1 Day later our mage that camped out near Coirnav's spawnpoint was happy to bring us the good news.
                                       <br>
                                       Coirnav was ready to be triggered.We did good for a first try and we will certainly nail down the strat soon.
                                       <br>
                                       Coirnav's days are numbered.
