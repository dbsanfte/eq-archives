Since I retired from EverQuest I have been kind of slacking on updates.  I feel the need to update now.<br>
This is a topic noone ever likes to do because it is hard to express feelings by typing it is  hard to find the right words.<br><br>

On Friday the 27th of February Our friend and fellow guildee Whytknight was tragically killed. 
Words can not express the loss of a dear friend and member of our online family.<br>
Our hearts and prayers go out to his family and all those close to him. <br>


We will miss you Eric.

It's been a while since there was an update, but telling you we backflagged a lot to get prepped for our first run in Plane of Time is not all that exciting.
And then our time finally came......Our first turn in the rotation. It's amazing how 3 guilds that use to compete and fight till the last man standing now learned to work together and come to an agreement on rotations. Cudos for that. 
But anyways, how did time go Scel ??? It was beyond our imagination that we managed to get to phase 3 on our first run of 3 days. Excellent teamwork and persistance got us to phase 3.
I would love to put some pictures here but i am sure you all saw them on the websites of other guilds, so i won't muhahahahaha.
After our time run we went backflagging and gearing up with a good feeling. The gods would soon die, we just knew it. And 10 days later it was our turn again. We had some minor problems with getting a full team of 72 raiders in PoTime. We had enough flagged people but sometimes RL can be a drag.
Phase 1 and 2 down on the first day. Phase 3 down and our first attempt on Saryrn on day 2. And the sweet taste of victory on our first time god on our last day. It's only a matter of time before we kill the others. But we smelled blood, we tasted the sweet taste of loot dropping like candy and it made us hungry.
I am sure on our next run we will attack like a pack of hungry wolves and once again come out victorious.
The loot was good and plenty. I started on a list of the bling bling ...but some of the info was missing and it would not be complete.

"Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.<br>
As they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.
At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly
visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam.<br>
He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish- rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably
flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising
from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;
and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons."<br>

How does one summarize the fortitude and perseverance of so many people? By bashing SOE of course!
This encounter is just ridiculous. It’s simple and mechanical. You have to do 3 things to win, well 4 actually, that’s it.
None of these things require very much skill or organization in of themselves.
What do you need to beat the Rathe? What is our UBER secret strategy?<br><br>
1.        An extended focus item for your brain! <br>
2.        Reading comprehension skills that don’t diminish too badly over time <br>
3.        A unidirectional sense so that when you get shadow stepped you can find the raid again<br>
4. A bladder the size of Texas and enough drinks and food to come around for a few dreadful hours.<br><br>
Do something, do it over and over and over again, don’t mess up. Do it to 12 mobs,
 kill them all and have enough DPS left for the Avatar. Those with ADD (Attention Deficiency Disorder) need not apply (they suddenly recruit with other guilds).
This is an encounter where you are literally your own worst enemy.<br><br>

I can only heap praise on all the participants on sticking to this and not burning out.
The relief in surviving Murphy’s Law and beating this was palpable. We will take a break from this mob and do some brainless stuff for a few days and head over to the other stupidity in water. Of course,
 we will return to the dreaded encounter of mind numbing to ensure that EVERYONE gets flagged.
We don’t leave our comrades behind.<br><br>

At this point, progression is just a matter of getting enough tries on the boss of water.
Sadly, Bobby Bouche, The Water Boy™, is a blowable spawn with a seemingly random timer.
This mob remains highly contested as a result.<br><br>

The 10th Councilman had been our Achilles heel for 2 days and you could almost hear the sigh of relief when we had him properly OT'd.
It's ridiculous how much concentration this encounter asks of you. Everyone was destined to finish it tonight.
I was in Offtank team 1 who kept a Councilman OT'd for over 2 and a half hours. Seeing mobs break free from mezz and the yelling of people in raid chat didn't really help keeping focus
The golden line of "we're F***ed" was a common sight in all kinds of chat.
There was relaxation and a good laugh too because nothing can break our spirit. Our Iksar cheerleader Slasra was back and the Shaman vs. Magician war lived up in full effect.

                        We ventured back to the windy planes to unravel the wonderous new pathing challenges presented by our friends at SOE.
                        
                        It's OK,really.Not like Xegony provided a HUGE margin for error before.It took us a bit to adjust to this new puzzle.
                        
                        We changed our pull and setup strat and after a few runs refining it, voila.
                        
                        Those adds pathing out the back of the rainbow can be annoying. Xegony 2.X down. Yay more sad looking shields.
                        
                        Grats Dwarvenale the Mighty on plate legs, our 4th set, most providential.
                        Parsed DPS by Xegony was 890, compared to my own paltry 99dps, 59 minute fight, /cheer the clerics!!
