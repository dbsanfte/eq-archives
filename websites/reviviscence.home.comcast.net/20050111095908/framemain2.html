        <P align=left>Welcome to our newest members! Great to have you on board.
        I know we will kill lots of things together. For those not in the know,
        we recently invited a Quellious landmark guild to join us. EHL has
        joined our ranks to help keep back the darkness of EQ2 and WOW. The
        Wraith/Reviviscence alliance is as strong as it ever was. Our point
        system as fair as they come. Our new members have settled in earning
        points and buying gear from the get go. <br>  <BR>
        In the first week of our union, we hit Coirnav, Xegony,
        MA+Rathe(in one night), Ikk4 and Weapon Master. All this a prelude
        to gearing people up in Time and QVIC+. <BR>   <BR>
        Once again, WELCOME ABOARD ! ! Success to all !

        <P align=left>"Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped 
        through the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.<BR>As they neared 
        him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its 
        waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the 
        breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his 
        entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if 
        an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, 
        fleecy, greenish foam.<BR>He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the 
        slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish- 
        rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky 
        forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and 
        behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving 
        valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and 
        danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of 
        hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their 
        fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull 
        of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected 
        from the white whale's back; and at intervals one of the cloud of 
        soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the 
        fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers 
        streaming like pennons."<BR>--Herman Melville(1819-1891). - Moby

        <P align=left>How does one summarize the fortitude and perseverance of 
        so many people? By bashing SOE of course! This encounter is just 
        ridiculous. It’s simple and mechanical. You have to do 3 things to win, 
        well 4 actually, that’s it. None of these things require very much skill 
        or organization in of themselves. What do you need to beat the Rathe? 
        What is our UBER secret strategy?<BR><BR>1. An extended focus item for 
        your brain! <BR>2. Reading comprehension skills that don’t diminish too 
        badly over time <BR>3. A unidirectional sense so that when you get 
        shadow stepped you can find the raid again<BR>4. A bladder the size of 
        Texas and enough drinks and food to come around for a few dreadful 
        hours.<BR><BR>Do something, do it over and over and over again, don’t 
        mess up. Do it to 12 mobs, kill them all and have enough DPS left for 
        the Avatar. Those with ADD (Attention Deficiency Disorder) need not 
        apply (they suddenly recruit with other guilds). This is an encounter 
        where you are literally your own worst enemy.<BR><BR>I can only heap 
        praise on all the participants on sticking to this and not burning out. 
        The relief in surviving Murphy’s Law and beating this was palpable. We 
        will take a break from this mob and do some brainless stuff for a few 
        days and head over to the other stupidity in water. Of course, we will 
        return to the dreaded encounter of mind numbing to ensure that EVERYONE 
        gets flagged. We don’t leave our comrades behind.<BR><BR>At this point, 
        progression is just a matter of getting enough tries on the boss of 
        water. Sadly, Bobby Bouche, The Water Boy™, is a blowable spawn with a 
        seemingly random timer. This mob remains highly contested as a 
        result.<BR><BR><FONT face=Verdana size=2>

        <P align=left>After these words of Ragnarz i would like to add something 
        as well. This encounter sux. SoE has become better at pushing their

        <P align=left>The 10th Councilman had been our Achilles heel for 2 days 
        and you could almost hear the sigh of relief when we had him properly 
        OT'd. It's ridiculous how much concentration this encounter asks of you. 
        Everyone was destined to finish it tonight. I was in Offtank team 1 who 
        kept a Councilman OT'd for over 2 and a half hours. Seeing mobs break 
        free from mezz and the yelling of people in raid chat didn't really help 
        keeping focus The golden line of "we're F***ed" was a common sight in 
        all kinds of chat. There was relaxation and a good laugh too because 
        nothing can break our spirit. Our Iksar cheerleader Slasra was back and 
        the Shaman vs. Magician war lived up in full effect.
