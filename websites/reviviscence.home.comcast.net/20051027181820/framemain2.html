<center> Been awhile since an update, but the bah bah farming Anguish, Tacvi and Dragons of Norrath is a rather boring update. But! the release of Depths of Darkhollow, it's given us a chance to actually try some new encounters.
<br>
<br>
<b>
<center> First we started out with Matriarch Shyra, i must say this was an easy easy raid for being part of Progression, she went down on the first try with only 1 deaths! (Oompha ate Enrage ~ send him "your a noob" tells!" ~) He's earned it.

<center> <b> But of course, we all know who was going to win that fight, but a bard sacrifice always makes me feel better about the raid at hand, how about you?
