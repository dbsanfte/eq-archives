FAQ<br>
Q: What is a sponsor?<br>
A: A sponsor is someone in the guild that will take responsibility for you.<br>
 This person vouches for you and makes sure that you get the information you need to be a positive contributor to this guild.<br>
 They make an effort to get you in groups and to bring you to raids.<br>
 They make sure you get an invite to raid channel and that you have an idea of what is going on.<p>

Q: I don’t know anyone in Reviv; how do I get a sponsor?<br>
A: Seek out members and group with them. <br>
Spamming members asking for them to sponsor you is not a viable path to achieving your goals.<br>
 Fore-warned is fore-armed.<p>

Q: What can I do while I am trying to find a sponsor?<br>
A: If you have grouped with guild members and gotten some positive play then you can join us on some of our easier raids.<p>

Q: What does my sponsor have to do?<br>
A: Your sponsor will be responsible for moving your post from the general section to the super secret recruiting board.<br>
 Your sponsor must make a credible attempt at explaining to the guild why YOU should be considered for membership.<br>
 If your sponsor can not market you to the guild in an effective fashion it is likely that your application will be denied or put on hold.<p>

Q: I got my sponsor, now what?<br>
A: It’s your job to seek out members and group with them so that a positive impression is made.<br>
 You need to get 2 endorsements from members and the only way to do that is by spending time with us.<p>

Q: How long does this process take?<br>
A: We have tagged people in under 10 days and had others take over a month. It’s different for everyone.<p>

Q: I hear that bastage Ragnarz is evil!<br>
A: Occasionally even those who have met all the requirements i.e. sponsor and 2 x endorsements have had their applications turned down.<br>
 The officers reserve the right to deny an application.<p>

Q: I hear that bastage Ragnarz is evil!<br>
A: All newly tagged members are on double secret probation for their first 30 days.<br>
 The officers reserve the right to remove someone within the first 30 days.<p>

Q: Do you guys raid with Wraith?<br>
A: Yes we do<p>

Q: How do you guys do loot?<br>
A: We are on a points based system. You earn points for attendance.<br>
 While in your first 30 days you can earn points, YOU MAY NOT BID on any item unless it is going to ROT.<br.
 Please read the Wraith web site for the rules on points. This additional rule will not be found on the Wraith site.<br>
 It is Reviv specific.<p>

Q: Do I have to raid?<br.
A: Raiding is not mandatory. That is one of the more attractive aspects of our guild.<br>
 "Do what you want, when you want" to pretty much sums it up. BUT we do quite a bit of raiding.<p>

Q: What happens if I am denied entry?<br>
A: You can’t apply again for 6 months<p>

Q: Whom can I talk to about all this?<br>
A: Feel free to contact an officer: Ragnarz, Epicure, Aesir, Lunara, Slasra, Ktesios, Denea and Enkor.<p> 

Q: Do you guys have a recruiting channel?<br>
A:No<p>

Q: Are there any exclusion to the rules set forth here?<br>
A: Yes, all R/L family members of existing guild members can be considered for recruiting upon their relative posting in the super secret membership board.<br>
 The member must have completed their 30-day probation. This is not an auto tag, but the path is much easier.<br>
 The officers of this guild do not recommend R/L marriage to facilitate recruiting with this guild.<p>

Q: Anything else?<br>
A: Play the character you are applying for. Alts wont be tagged until your 30 days are done.<br>
 If you are in raid channel MAKE SURE you are in there as a recognized recruit or a tagged character.<br>
 If you do lots of body swapping make sure you follow these guidelines,<br>
 there are way too many issues associated with masquerading as someone else. Your twink not tagged? dont join the channel.<p>
