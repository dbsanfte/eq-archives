I was fighting in Mystmoore with a group, (Just people that got together), we had no loot order, (loot but don't get greedy, deal). We had talked about that the shield is found here, but no mention as to actually getting it for anyone in particular. I spot the NPC with the shield, we end up killing it. I ended up with the shield. <br>Now, there is big ranting about who should get the shield. <br>wizard, enchanter, shaman, paladin, (the shaman, paladin where using a two handed weapon).<p>Yes, I know I can't as wiz, use the shield, but 1. I can give it to a friend of mine, who is a shaman.<br>1. trade it for black robe, or observer staff.<p>Well, what would you have done? We were all there for basically exp, (the loot pretty much, stinks).<p>???? Please as many people as possible post their answer, I want to know?
