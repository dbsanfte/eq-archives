If you just wanna kill some time and earn a little bit of exp and cash..try kiting aviaks at the village in South Karana. You will need to beg or buy a SOW from a friendly druid, but that shouldn't be hard. Pay 1 pp for a sow, you'll make it back in no time. It is conveniently located only 1 zone away from your north gate location. Start with aviak rooks, and then move on to harriers maybe at 23 or 24. With sow you can outrun any of them and get to the zone to Lake Rathe if you have trouble.<br>
