: you can handle guk without any problems,
: the woven is found on the 7 frogs at the enterance.
: first 2 as soon as you zone. then 2 more down the first ramp,
: then 3 more if you turn right at the bottom of the first ramp.
: all of these should be from level 4-12 tops.
: And if you just go for these, do not group up and go deep into the zone,
: for as a wiz, if you start to get hit, you will soon die.
: If you are goign to group up, get them to pull to the zone,
: then you blast, if problems run to zone.
: Also watch for high level players pulling baddies, sometimes
: they will root you if you are close to them.

: : is there any way a wizard can get a better AC, i have all cloth and it sux. i want woven but do not know where to find it. i am a lvl 13 almost 14. any input on where i can make, buy or loot for it? what else is out there beside woven?
