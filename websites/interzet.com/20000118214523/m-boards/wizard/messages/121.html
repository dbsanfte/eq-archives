The next step after cloth woven or netted. Netted has the same AC as cloth but is lighter. Woven has a better AC then cloth and netted. Woven can be found on the frogs in Guk, and rarely on frogs outside Guk.<p>After woven theres still lots of stuff. Gossamer and Damask come to mind. Theres also a variety of nice robes, that have good AC and change your appearance.<p>And, theres lots of magic stuff. Bone bracelets, lupine armor, bearskin items, etc.<p>I dont think you can make anything. Most of it is buyable, but usually expensive. Your high enough level to try getting woven on your own, but remember, Guk is extremely dangerous. Far more difficult that it seems when you first go in.<p>I think your best bet is trying to buy woven. You just gotta start /auctioning for it. Try doing it near the troll zones, SRo, Oasis, etc..<p>Ninecattiess.<br>

: The next step after cloth woven or netted. Netted has the same AC as cloth but is lighter. Woven has a better AC then cloth and netted. Woven can be found on the frogs in Guk, and rarely on frogs outside Guk.

: After woven theres still lots of stuff. Gossamer and Damask come to mind. Theres also a variety of nice robes, that have good AC and change your appearance.

: And, theres lots of magic stuff. Bone bracelets, lupine armor, bearskin items, etc.

: I dont think you can make anything. Most of it is buyable, but usually expensive. Your high enough level to try getting woven on your own, but remember, Guk is extremely dangerous. Far more difficult that it seems when you first go in.

: I think your best bet is trying to buy woven. You just gotta start /auctioning for it. Try doing it near the troll zones, SRo, Oasis, etc..
