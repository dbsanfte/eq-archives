I have seen so many posts on a lot of boards about every class. Everyone has at least 1 or 2 legitimate complaints about their class...I guess that&#8217;s what balance is all about, nobody being perfect...I have played a lot of classes and I have played them to a very respectable level, so I know the game well and know limitations of most of the classes. The classes I have not played, I know people at very high levels who I speak with and group with often so I can say I know those classes too!<p>Here is my version of what really needs to be done to wizards to make me happy...I would love to hear from any of you whether it be a flame or anything else you have input on. If any of my suggestions are completely crazy I want to know...<p>I think warriors and rogues have it very tough with skills. I think mages need to be able to have better control over there pets, enchanters need to not be resisted as much, druids should be thanking the gods for portals and group gates! Something wizards should only be able to have. Get to that later :)<p>I think EVERY CLASS needs to have more quests implemented, a game with part of the name being ever QUEST and not having more class specific quests for class specific items actually worth something is totally unacceptable. If the quests yielded very nice items make them non-drop non-sell items so you could not gain monetarily from it just gives exp and the item.<p><br>Anyway here goes my list of little things I would like changed, again if I am nuts tell me imp nuts :) but IMHO they are good suggestions...<p>1.(RESISTANCE)my first and far most complaint is being resisted. after level 20 you can group with people up to 8 levels or even higher and still get exp. if I can get exp in a group why should I have to just sit there and watch? it would only be fair to break down some kind of formula that says, (and this goes for all classes, tanks when they attack deep reds miss a lot or hit for 1 or 2 points, its not just us casters that are effected by deep reds) if you attack something that is say 8 levels higher you will get resisted 80% of the time or something like that, anything 6 levels you get resisted 50%, 4 levels 25%, even con 10% something along those lines.. I get resisted by blues a lot, that is ridiculous when it says "looks like you would have the upper hand" and I try to burn it or root it 5 times and get resisted not once not twice but 3 or 4 times...very annoying...there should be some sort of pattern to what will resist me but so far I do not see any. I can cast a spell and get resisted but the MOB still registers it as a full blow and I am now #1 on the MUST DIE list this is not just wizard specific this goes for all casting classes. nothing to ask for because it would not just benefit us. after all we are intelligent creatures right? who learn how to live in norrath...well except for ogres and trolls :) I hate to flame necros but I have seen 4 level 22 necros take out a Sand Giant, they can do life tap on a DEEP and I mean DEEP red without being resisted, I could only dream of the exp gained from them at level 22 taking on SG's. there must be some kind of weakness I have not seen somewhere, and I am sure there are, because I have not seen too many level 50 necros so maybe they are not playing wisely or there are things I don&#8217;t see that limit them as well. NOT A FLAME NECROS, truth...<p>2.(DAMAGE GAP) ok at level 24 you get a neat spell called frost shock, does 170 damage and is easier on mana than force shock, they both do about the same damage but frost shock does not get resisted as much...however that 170 point spell has done 3 damage and 4 damage on 3 or 4 casts on a BLUE...big problem, is there a formula for that also? it needs to be fixed...something like DEEP red, 75% chance it will do 20% damage or something, Yellows, 25% it will not do max damage...BLUES should almost always, like 90% of the time hit for max damage, this goes for caster and hack and slashers...you ever see a level 25 barbarian warrior hit a carrion ghoul for 5 points, that&#8217;s got to be frustrating...I have been resisted at level 24 by ghoul that con blue. AGAIN at least make it where there is a pattern I can catch onto...why give us a con if we cannot gauge what we can or cannot do? <p>3.(ROOT / ENSTILL) Root worked well for me at lower levels, seems to work less at high levels, Enstill is an upgraded version of root that gets resisted so much I don&#8217;t use it because it sucks up 60 mana every cast. Root uses 30. for 60 mana it should be predictable and should also have a duration...not a set duration but at least one with a minimum, longer than roots minimum making it worth wild to have memorized...also I have noticed some spells can actually knock a MOB from the root...is it because our spells at later levels are powerful enough to knock them off of that level 8 root? if so enstill should hold for a bit longer and a bit stronger...not so random, I don&#8217;t use it for soloing my wizard, wizards aren&#8217;t meant to be solo players, I use it for escape or to hold something down so I can burn it fast so if one of my members is getting nailed I can take it down ASAP without it running at me and nailing me too...same goes for entangle and entwined for other casters....AGAIN show a pattern here so we can figure it out and make it more consistent...10 levels above cant be rooted or enstilled, 5 levels 80%, 3 levels 30% even to you, 10% resistance....something......<p>4.(SHIELDS) when a fighter is sitting and resting and he has a few buffs on he/she can see the icon in the view and when it starts flashing its time to get buffed again. a wizard only has his spell book to look at while meditating, I guess that&#8217;s a way to pretend closing your eyes and medding as a caster...my problem is there is no warning in the text to tell us when the shield is about to wear off..."Your Shielding Fades Away" that&#8217;s what you see. then when you recast your shields you HP has to regen again...not a biggy but it would be nice to know when your shield is "Fading" maybe? so you don&#8217;t lose 50 hp and 3 more precious mins in that dungeon where stuff is popping up left and right and every second counts....AGAIN not just for wizards but for all casters...<p>5.(Memorized Spells)this one may be out of the question but wizards have so many spells 8 slots in not enough to mem all of the useful ones I would like 16 slots to be very productive at doing the only thing I know how CAST SPELLS..<p>Last but not least AE spells AKA "Ok I want to die today spells"...there has to be something where an ae spell can be cast with root at the same time, or something where you can root 2 or 3 MOBS at one time if they are say right on top of one another...if they are spread out tough luck root one at a time then cast it...the only place I have found AE spells useful is when I am grouping with 3 or 4 other wizards and we all cast an AE at the same time...then it has some effect. and a laggy one too :)<p>Someone mentioned that wizards should be able to cast utility spells, I think that is ridiculous we are about pure damage and no others rival us in that area. well except mages at level 49 till we get ice comet but nobody on any server has found it. and the mage can buy his 900 point bolt in a shop...while we have to research for our most destructive spell and possibly fail... :)<p>Now does anyone feel any of those would give us an advantage? If so I would like to hear your reasoning...I also have a comment about wizards out there with intent on kill stealing...you are really plucking at my nerves and giving us honest wizards a bad name...I use my power to help make a fight and downtime shorter and to help my friends travel...an even more satisfying thing I can do with my power is burn down a MOB that is on a player about to be killed and getting that cleric like aura of healing someone about to die...<br>

: I have seen so many posts on a lot of boards about every class. Everyone has at least 1 or 2 legitimate complaints about their class...I guess that&#8217;s what balance is all about, nobody being perfect...I have played a lot of classes and I have played them to a very respectable level, so I know the game well and know limitations of most of the classes.

: Anyway here goes my list of little things I would like changed, again if I am nuts tell me imp nuts :) but IMHO they are good suggestions...

: 1.(RESISTANCE)my first and far most complaint is being resisted. after level 20 you can group with people up to 8 levels or even higher and still get exp. if I can get exp in a group why should I have to just sit there and watch? it would only be fair to break down some kind of formula that says, (and this goes for all classes, tanks when they attack deep reds miss a lot or hit for 1 or 2 points, its not just us casters that are effected by deep reds) if you attack something that is say 8 levels higher you will get resisted 80% of the time or something like that, anything 6 levels you get resisted 50%, 4 levels 25%, even con 10% something along those lines..

: 3.(ROOT / ENSTILL) Root worked well for me at lower levels, seems to work less at high levels, Enstill is an upgraded version of root that gets resisted so much I don&#8217;t use it because it sucks up 60 mana every cast. Root uses 30. for 60 mana it should be predictable and should also have a duration...not a set duration but at least one with a minimum, longer than roots minimum making it worth wild to have memorized...also I have noticed some spells can actually knock a MOB from the root...is it because our spells at later levels are powerful enough to knock them off of that level 8 root? if so enstill should hold for a bit longer and a bit stronger...not so random, I don&#8217;t use it for soloing my wizard, wizards aren&#8217;t meant to be solo players, I use it for escape or to hold something down so I can burn it fast so if one of my members is getting nailed I can take it down ASAP without it running at me and nailing me too...same goes for entangle and entwined for other casters....AGAIN show a pattern here so we can figure it out and make it more consistent...10 levels above cant be rooted or enstilled, 5 levels 80%, 3 levels 30% even to you, 10% resistance....something......

: 4.(SHIELDS) when a fighter is sitting and resting and he has a few buffs on he/she can see the icon in the view and when it starts flashing its time to get buffed again. a wizard only has his spell book to look at while meditating, I guess that&#8217;s a way to pretend closing your eyes and medding as a caster...my problem is there is no warning in the text to tell us when the shield is about to wear off...&quot;Your Shielding Fades Away&quot; that&#8217;s what you see. then when you recast your shields you HP has to regen again...not a biggy but it would be nice to know when your shield is &quot;Fading&quot; maybe? so you don&#8217;t lose 50 hp and 3 more precious mins in that dungeon where stuff is popping up left and right and every second counts....AGAIN not just for wizards but for all casters...

: 5.(Memorized Spells)this one may be out of the question but wizards have so many spells 8 slots in not enough to mem all of the useful ones I would like 16 slots to be very productive at doing the only thing I know how CAST SPELLS..

: Last but not least AE spells AKA &quot;Ok I want to die today spells&quot;...there has to be something where an ae spell can be cast with root at the same time, or something where you can root 2 or 3 MOBS at one time if they are say right on top of one another...if they are spread out tough luck root one at a time then cast it...the only place I have found AE spells useful is when I am grouping with 3 or 4 other wizards and we all cast an AE at the same time...then it has some effect. and a laggy one too :)

: Someone mentioned that wizards should be able to cast utility spells, I think that is ridiculous we are about pure damage and no others rival us in that area. well except mages at level 49 till we get ice comet but nobody on any server has found it. and the mage can buy his 900 point bolt in a shop...while we have to research for our most destructive spell and possibly fail... :)
