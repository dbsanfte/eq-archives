Yes, it sucks you died and lost that item but Microsoft has proven that consumers don't care, in the end, they will come back if your the only game in town.  Expect more software products to come out half complete with bugs.  Most consumers today would rather have the latest technology with bugs, then older technology bug free.  Again, Microsoft has proven this over and over.  EQ is just following the industry standard.<br>: SON OF A !!!!!! I TRULY WILL QUIT EQ IF I DONT GET THIS BACK...<p>: OK HERES STORY, THERE WAS A FESTIVAL ON BRISTLEBANE SATURDAY I THINK IT WAS. LOTS OF AUCTIONS AND THINGS, SOMEONE DID NOT AUCTION THIS BUT I RAN ACROSS SOMEONE THERE THAT HAD LUPINE ARMBAND AND I ASKED IF I COULD BUY IT FROM HIM. HE SAID FOR AN INSANE AMOUTN OF MONEY YES HE WOULD. I SOLD MY BUTT OFF GETTING READY OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I HAD IN THE BANK AND MADE ABOUT 250 PP !!! I BOUGHT IT FROM HIM...<p>: GET BACK TO FAYDWER, I WAS IN FREEPORT, AND HAD THE THING IN A BACKPACK WITH OTHER JEWELRY I HAD. A FRIEND IN CB SAID DVINN HAD KILLED HIM AND NEEDED SOME ASSISTANCE GETTING HER BODY BACK. SO I WENT IN. BIG MISTAKE, CRUSH SEES US INVISIBLE AND WE BOTH TRAINED BY PROPHET AND LEGS I DIED IN THE WATER BELOW THE CASTLE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW. THE WINDOW WHERE EVERYONE CAMPS ON THE TABLE . OK ANYWAY I DIED IN THE WATER, I WENT BACK TO MY CORPSE JUMPED IN THE WATER AND SUMMONED IT TO THE TUNNEL THAT I THINK LEADS TO WHERE SOME SLAVES ARE SO I COULD LOOT REASONABLY SAFE. WELL HERES THE REAL SHITTER I OPENED MY BACKPACK AND THE ARMBAND WAS NOT THERE, EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE BACKPACK WAS, THE SPOT WHERE THE BAND WAS, WAS EMPTY. THIS IS A RARE ITEM ADD +4STR +4AGI AND 2AC...NOBODY LOOTS MY CORPSES BUT ME I DONT TRUST ANYONE. I DIDNT DROP IT, I DIDNT TRADE IT ON ACCIDENT I AM SO ANAL WHEN IT COMES TO MY VALUBLES. I DONT EVEN LIKE ROGUES AROUND ME FOR SOME REASON, SORRY ROGUES...I TRIED RELOGGING, NOT THERE. I TRIED SEARCHING AROUND FOR 3 HOURS. SERIOUSLY 3 HOURS IN ABOUT A 10 STEP RADIUS I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS I ALWAYS GET A LOC IF I THINK I AM GOING TO DIE. I TRIED PETITIONING AND THEY SAID THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT...<p>: THIS IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME QUIT, I SPENT EVERYTHING I HAD JUST ABOUT TO GET THIS RARE ITEM. NOW THIS HAPPENS...<p>
