That a Shock of Lightning spell can do as little as 4 HP of damage.  The damn thing costs 60 mana to cast, and if I get a couple low hits with it, I have to retreat if I am soloing or wait 20 minutes after the fight so the tanks can heal (if no *good* healers are present)<p>I have heard that Lightning is just as bad hitting as low as 9 sometimes.  Just seems to me that 4-80 damage is an uneccessarily large span and something closer to 50-80 would be a little more realistic, after all, there's still a chance to fizzle, which actually is better than hitting at ungodly low damage because you only burn half the mana when you fizzle.  I mean, what the hell does 4 damage do to *anything* I fight at level 15?  I can only pump out that spell 6 times, and if by chance 3 of them do a 4, 20, or even a 30...I'm screwed.<p>Don't get me wrong though...I love wizards.  This just burns me.<p>Xeni
