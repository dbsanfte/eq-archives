I think you should start anew. Just 5 levels is easy to make up. It should be around 10-15 hours of playing. (At the teen levels, it takes probably 20 hours to playing to level.)<p>Mana is more important to wiz than any other spell class. Mage/Necro have their pets, cleric have armor and some melee abilities.<p>All our power (attack or defend) comes from mana.<p>Usually if i run out of mana, i am dead. I need mana to fight and i need mana to escape (shadow step and gate). In a group, if i am out of mana, i am useless. <p>Depending on your race, the number of points that you should have put into INT is different.<p>Take erudite as an example, he can put 25 pts into INT. That is a 5 pts per level difference in mana.<p>At level 12, it is a 60 pts difference which allows you to cast one more shock of lightning (78 dmg at 60 mana) which can mean life or death.<p>At level 20, it is a 100 pts difference. I usually keep about 100 mana for reserve. It basically allow me to shadow step 3 times and gate .. my escape option.<p>: I spent my attribute points on strength, oops.<br>: I'm about to hit level 5.<br>: I spent my training points on abjuration and meditation.<p>: Will my guy be any good?
