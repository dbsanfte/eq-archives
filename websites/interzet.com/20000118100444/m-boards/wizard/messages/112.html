Funny you should say that, it seems that way to me too (the fizzles) but I never thought to mention it.  I know they screwed with the enchanters (am clueless on that class though) I hope they don't/didn't mess with us as well.  Verant needs to NOT listen to all these damn whining melees who have never cast a spell or know anything about it.  Most of the whiners have NO CLUE what it is like to only have a limited amout of hitting power before you are instantly transformed into "Little Lulu swinging a hairpin" at a monster with little more than that cute little dress on as protection :/<p>
