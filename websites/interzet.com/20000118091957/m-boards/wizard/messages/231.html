They are some really good formulas you have come up with.  As only have played a necro, havin the lifetap line of spells is great for takin down red things in a group.  At least u don't have to sit there and have everything resisted. Yet they aren't very mana effective for the dmg they do. Not sure about the lvl49 AE lifetap One question i have is about debuffs is do they really work? I hardly ever see an effect from usin debuffs on a mob.  <br>Apocc-Xegony<br>Ahkamden-Prexus
