You have run accross a known bug.  I tried twice to research Fire Spiral Al'Kabor (20th level) and got the same message.  It's in the book as the two runes I used, but it simply won't work (for me, anyway).  I talked to several GMs about it and got the same answer each time: "Screw off and quit bothering us!"<p>They won't replace items lost to bugs (I don't disagree with this, since there is too much opportunity for exploits and since they keep crappy logs), but they won't post bugs so that we don't do things that lose us items.  That's stupid.<p>BTW: Did anyone notice that 1-888-GAMES02 changed their hours?  They went from 8a-12p S-S to 9-5 M-F.  So, you can't get a guide online (petitions have taken from a low of 45 minutes to never in a million years for me), you can't get any help in the chat forums (I almost never see tech help in there and they ignore all tells or requests when I see them) and you can't call anyone. . .<p>Just my rantings for the day.<p><br>: I researched Pillar of Fire, first try, Identify, first try, Project lightning, failed 3 times, what am i doing wrong, i get some stupid message "these items do not combine to make an item"?<p>
