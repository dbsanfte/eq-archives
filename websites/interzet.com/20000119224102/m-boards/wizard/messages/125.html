<br>PB and AE Spells are Verry Effective.  I seldom cast these spells, but always keep them handy.  True, If you are Soloing, dont use them, it can draw attention to you from other beasties.  But n a group getting hit by 3 or 4 creatures just after a spawn, these spells make you the most effective person in the group!  Last week while I was Medding out near the Orc Camp my crew got in trouble getting slammed by first one wave of three Cents, then another.  I saw that they needed my help with the second group and ran inot the fray. While crushing on one with my Great Worn Staff, I cast fingers of fire.heres the result:<br>Orc Centurion says: Hit for 22 points damage<br>Orc Centurion says: Hit for 22 points damage<br>Orc Centurion says: Hit for 22 points damage<br>You hit Orc Centurion for 14pts damage.<br>One meelle round and 80pts of damage dispensed.<br>and only one of the Orcs turned on me.  So I got to cast it again with the same results.  Dont count out AE and PB spells, they can be handy. (on the down side, a similar expierince ended with Guard hits you for 1000 points damage, you are slain by the Guard.  I never saw him.)<br>: Been so long since I used a PB or AE spell since they are worthless compared to direct dam <p>
