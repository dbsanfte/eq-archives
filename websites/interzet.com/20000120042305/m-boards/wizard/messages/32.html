: : Being level I would recommend to atleast group with someone else til you can get your next ring of spells. Right now I'm level 10 and having a hell of a time getting above that.

Go back to the guards if you must but do not go into a trance with no one around.  Never engage without a healthy amount of mana.  And, perhaps the most important of all, be friendly to those around you.  They will help when you get in trouble only if you havent made them adversarial.<br>Once Crushbone is no longer effective, go to Two Guards Crossing in Butcherblock and use the same strategy.  After this, go to North Ro just outside of Freeport.  You should be productive there until at least 15th level.  Of course, the most effective way to learn quickly is to partner with a warrior class but I would limit this to only one partner of equal level as mush as possible.  Large groups require many more kills and kills do not come in high enough concetrations until you reach Ro.  From there you will know where to go next.  Good hunting.
