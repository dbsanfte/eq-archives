: I was able to put an additional 5 points into research at level 23, another 5 points at 24.  I was also sent an interesting email that everyone here will be very happy to read:

: From: Quil &lt;quil2@yahoo.com&gt;

: I too noticed that the Rune of Velious seemed to be an
: odd rune, that was not used in any spell creation.
: Many of us have been aware the Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor
: requires 2 runes, Nagafen and Al'Kabor, and that this
: spell is bugged with research, and fails to combine.
: Well, I decided to take a chance, and combined the
: Al'Kabor with Velious. Bingo, I'm now the proud owner
: of the Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor spell. :)

: I also had Energy Storm fail last night, didn't
: combine properly. I used the last of the runes needed,
: or I would have tried switching Velious into that mix
: too.

: Quil, wizard from Bertoxxulous

: Thank you very much for the info Quil, I cant wait to try this myself, I know I have both Al'Kabor and Velious in the Bank...
