Good luck, <br>: Nimis<p><br>I have to disagree with that first comment.  In a large group situation, I use Pillar of Fire all the time.  It will do 74ish (at 20th lvl) to all crits in the area for 84 mana.  Much more efficient than 110 from Flame Shock at 85 mana.  Now I usually only use it once in the beginning of the battle when everyone first engages to kinda soften them up a bit then pick out solo targets.  If you use it more than that it generally draws some of them to you and that's not good.  If used correctly it can be used effectively.<p>Ylandril Feanaro <br>High Elf Wizard of the 6th Initiate<br>Mithaniel Marr<br>
