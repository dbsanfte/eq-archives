Man, you are asking for a rough time if you want to solo. If your first root doesn't take it gets messy. I also have a High Elf Wiz, level 10, and damn near everytime I solo I die. <p>You could try Kobolds in Steamfont until 8, then Orc Centurions until 9, then work Goblins in Butcherblock. Just don't let two things jump you at once and you should be okay.<p>But if you really want to advance, I suggest grouping. One tank and you can do very well for yourselves. Stick in Butcherblock until level 8 or 9, killing basilisks and scarabs for experience (easy with a tank/wiz combo) and goblins for cash. Then you are set to move to Steamfont and kill skeletons for both cash and experience.
