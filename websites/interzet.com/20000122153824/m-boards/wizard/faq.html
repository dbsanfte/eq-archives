<h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>

<p>Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may
have about WWWBoard.</p>

<hr>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my
        posts?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message
        section when I try post a followup?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this
        program?</a> </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a></p>

<p>No. You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the
message. The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing
or disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting. If
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in
&lt;&gt;'s. If they allow it, your html markup will appear in the
posting. It can't hurt to try.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I
try to post a followup?</a></p>

<p>Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to
followup up on a message to indicate that those lines are quoting
the previous document. The owner of the WWWBoard can decide
whether they wish to enable or disable the quoting of previous
messages.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a></p>

<p>Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser
did not reload the page, it simply pulled it out of cache. Please
reload your browser and it should then appear.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a></p>

<p>The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.
They are free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get
them as well as other scripts at: <a
href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.
Enjoy!</p>
