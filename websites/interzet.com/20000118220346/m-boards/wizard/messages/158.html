Any kind of group is FAR better than soloing. Soloing as a Wizard is extremely hard. I think its one of the hardest classes to solo. It gets harder as you go up in level. Things hit a lot harder and have multiple, fast attacks that interupt casting.<p>As far as what makes a good group.... just about anything. Like I said, any kind of group is better than soloing. I actually favor a 2 or 3 person group for exp gain. If your still unsure, the old healer/warrior/mage combo always works. Although ive had success with all combinations, even wizard/wizard is fun.<p>At level 10 I think I was working in east commons and north ro. Both are good for exp. NRo has better loot.<p>Ninecattiess
