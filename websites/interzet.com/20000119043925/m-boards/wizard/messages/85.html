I take it your soloing.  Not good at your level.  You really should group up with a cleric and a fighter. Makes your life expetancy much longer and gives you massive xp.  I've stayed away from the Fay continent due to it overcrowded.  Main places I hunt are the Everfrost plains, Oasis, Split Paw, Beholders Maze and Befallen.  I never go alone.  The place I recommend is Befallen.  The atmosphere is totally creepy.  Though be prepared to die alot.  Very tough dungeon.<p>No offense intended if you are grouping. :)<p>As for the eye of zoom.  It can't be used as a pet, if you get attacked and take damage the eye disappears.  I've never used the spell due to all the bad publicity it has recieved.  Though it is really neat looking.  I'd spend your plat on a more useful spell.<p>Hope some of this helps.<p>Daimos
