: ok this whole bug thing is bothering me. why should i bother to start research<br>: 1. if there are bugs i guess i should be saving runes til they are fixed<br>: 2. when am i going to have to research to get new spells. i see a list of spells all the way up to lvl 29. is that a complete list or are there hidden spells that are not in the list?<br>: 3. where can i get a spoiler list for runes to combine. i dont mind someone telling me because i do not have the time or the inclination to search for runes<p><br>Go to www.mythiran.com.  There you can find a lot of info about research for all classes, with lists of the components needed for each spell.  I personally have successfully made Project Lightning so they have the correct combination on the site, and they have corrected the combination needed for Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor as well.  2 people have confirmed success with it.<p>Ylandril Feanaro <Soulforge><br>High Elf Wizard of the 6th Initiate<br>Mithaniel Marr<p><br>
