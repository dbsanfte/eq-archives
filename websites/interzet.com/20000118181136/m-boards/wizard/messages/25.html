OK, cgi script changed. Now, tell me if I did a mistake again?<p>Chtuga<p>: Well im running things in 1152 by 864 pixels on a 21", and it looks pretty good. I've tried it with lower resolutions and it seems that the color we are using is getting lighter and as some of you said, almost hurting the Eyes.<p>: So how about the one im using now? (The message body still is yellow, but Chtuga has to do some changes in the CGI script, so until then hang in there and wear your sun glass' or something =)<p>
