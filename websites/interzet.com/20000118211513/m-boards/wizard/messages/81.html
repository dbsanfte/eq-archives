: : I have 2 mana rings and an Apprentice robe so total my MANA is +11. My int is 112 i think. Are these mana items worth the effort in trying to make or worth the money of buying? Does int make more difference than MANA bonuses? Also has anyone seen a Fine Steel Staff !! <p>: <br>: All mana is good mana. The Int is better then the straight mana boost. The items are a good investment and cant hurt but at the same time dont expect a big difference in the amount of extra casting ability for that little bit of mana. The calculation is somthing like 5 mana per point of int. So obviously thats your best bet. About the Finesteel staff, what server are you on I have been trying to sell mine forever :) <p>I am on the bristlebane server, why are you selling it? is the great staff as good? the damage is the same and the attck is faster than the steele one  but the steele one cost a helluva lot more for some reason<p>Thanks
