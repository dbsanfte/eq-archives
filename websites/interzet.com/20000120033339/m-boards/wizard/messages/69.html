: : : Being level I would recommend to atleast group with someone else til you can get your next ring of spells. Right now I'm level 10 and having a hell of a time getting above that.

Of course, the most effective way to learn quickly is to partner with a warrior class but I would limit this to only one partner of equal level as mush as possible.

Good hunting.<p>I am now a lvl 13 dark elf wizard.  I'd pretty much prefer Lavastorm over N Ro.  A lot of nice loot from the elementals etc there.
