: here is my suggestion:

: Let all high lvl items that might be camped today have to be triggered by an npc:

: Lets say you want a runed totem staff. then you have to find npc A and ask for the runed totem staff. Then he will say it is found on xxx (no
: spoilers here =) )
: This will put a flag on the player stating Yes on runed totem staff, and makes this item spawn on xxx when he or a group he is in kills xxx.
: Then this npc wont give this quest out to another player untill a certain amout of time or the player has recovered the runed totem staff. He will
: neither give this quest out to same person twice ever if he has succeded in getting the item.
: This makes it possible to take away the no trade flag on items and also allow players to trade and wear 2 of these items for dual wielding
: players =)

: I got this idea while reading on Eq'lizer webpage, so I dont take full credit from it, I just tought about his toughts and improved it slightly.

: Anyone think this is a great solution?
: I would love us to have a brainstorm on this tought and maybe we can improve BOTH Quest system AND camping problem in one solution =)
