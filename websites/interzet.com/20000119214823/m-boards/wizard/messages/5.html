The guild will be based loosly on Robert Jordans books "The Wheel of Time"  This guild will be exclusive to male charactors that can channel magic in one form or another.  There are other things that will make this the RPGer's best guild, but I don't want to let the cat out of the bag just yet.  I began actively recruiting last night and unfortunately grouped with a couple of Dolts who should never have gotten to wear the robe.  Find me on Inoruuk or give me a /tell and I will let you know some of the more interesting features of the Toughest magic castin fools on all of Norath!<br>Yes, you will have to be reasonably good at playing your magic user.  We will test.<br>Thank you,<br>Ravice, a Wizard from Felwithe
