I agree and disagree with your statement. We are probably the weakest<br>class as far as early levels are concerned, and death does come for <br>us fairly regularly. But our class isn't meant to be soloed early on<br>either. Grouping with a couple of healers and a tank or two is our lot <br>in life. I'm nearly 12th level now and I'm finding that as long as I'm <br>careful to con everything before attacking, that I can usually safely <br>solo most blue con's. If I find myself losing the battle, I Shadow Step<br>my way to safety.<br> Grouping now is very satisfying as well, as I love being able to dish out <br>large amounts of damage, saving the tanks from taking mega damage from<br>protecting my butt, as in early levels. I'm gonna hang in there, just longing<br>for the day that I can get the spell that dishes out 1100 damage per shot.<br>I do wish that mana would regenerate quicker, however.<br> Oh well, there's my 2 coppers worth.<p>Syngefinger<p>
