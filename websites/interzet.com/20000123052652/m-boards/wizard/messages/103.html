Strength. The reason?  Well, agi supposedly makes<br>you harder to hit, but if you are getting hit at<br>ALL then you're in deep sh*t and are most likely<br>going to die.  At high levels when the mobs are<br>doing hundreds of hp's worth of damage a round, <br>that extra agi isn't going to help much.  Same<br>reason why stamina doesn't help.  The extra hp's<br>you get will ultimately mean nothing.<p>But I digress, the REAL reason to put the points<br>into strength is so you can CARRY more loot.  It's<br>just the most practical attribute to put the <br>points into because you will get more benefit from<br>being able to carry 5 more pounds than adding it<br>to agi or sta.  just my opinion of course.
