You put one point into research at level 16.  You <br>buy a lexicon in your guild, this is the book that<br> is a container.  You buy the other 4 books in <br>your guild, they range in price from a few gold <br>to quite a few plat.  The first book is written <br>in Old Euridian, the second in Elder Elvish, the <br>third in Dragon, the fourth in Ancient Dragon.  <br>These 4 books have all of the rune combos you need<br> to combine in your lexicon.  You get the runes <br>from creataurs that are either intelligent, or <br>take magic weapons to hit, and the runes spawn on <br>about 1 in 50 kills.  You are better off <br>advertising to buy them in all the zones you pass <br>through.  Put the proper runes the book lists in <br>your lexicon and hit combine.  If your prayers to <br>Innorruuk have been heard, you will create a spell<br>.  Otherwise, you will fail, similar to smithing, <br>and the runes will be destroyed.  Good luck, there<br> are many bugs, see my above posts for some of <br>them.<br>Nimis Nex
