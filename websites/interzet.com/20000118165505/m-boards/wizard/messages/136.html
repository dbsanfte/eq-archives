I have researched a few spells, and wasted LOTS of runes trying to research<br>others. I have found many bugs along the way, far too many to bug individually<br>in the game, so I am posting them on the web so other players can see, and I<br>think Verant employees read most of the major sites too. First, I successfully<br>researched Project Lightning using a rune of Periphery and a Rune of<br>Fulgeration. Then I scribed it into my spellbook. Then I used the same two runes<br>and tried again. "These items do not combine in these quantities" WTF? Very<br>odd, since I did it once already... So I tried again cause I though I may have<br>got the combo wrong from lack of sleep or something. Same message. I bugged<br>it and waited till latest patch, then tried a third time. Same message... Oh well,<br>at least I have this nice useless spell in my book. I successfull did a few copies<br>of Pillar of Fire, and about 3 copies of Identify, only forgetting once that spells<br>are LORE ITEMs and the new one disappears if you are still holding the first<br>one... Doh!<br>I tried to research Fire Spiral of Al'Kabor with Nagafen and Al'Kabor runes...<br>"These items do not combine..." WTF? Checked book, checked level... Yep, book<br>says that, and I am level 20, tried again, runes gone again. Tried many different<br>combinations that gave me the "these items..." message, including: 1. Periphery<br>and Proximity 2. Periphery and Fulguration 3. Al'Kabor and Fulguration, 4.<br>Proximity and Fulguration. None of these combined in usefull quantities... Ouch!<br>my poor bank account is looking pretty bare... <br>Next research bug... I am a Teir'Dal and I started the game with Elder Elvish at<br>Average. There it has stayed. I am excellent in every other language known to<br>children of Order, and I know a smattering of others. I have bugged this four<br>times so far, but still cannot read the second book properly. (Nimis twiddles his<br>thumbs)<br>Next problem is with my research skill. How the hell does it go up? At level 16 I<br>trained 1 point, then message says I have to train in field. Ok, all the runes I<br>blew at level 16 didn't raise my skill a bloody point. At level 18, I went back to<br>trainer, and trainer told me I could not put in any points, had to learn in the<br>field. What a jerk. At level 20 I played with more runes, and my skill went up<br>almost 4 times in a row, to 20 points. WAHOO!! Then I went back to trainer,<br>and she let me put in another 5 points as skill practice, before telling me I need<br>to go back to field. Anyone know how this is supposed to work? Why the wierd<br>combination? I can normally work this stuff out on my own, but I dont see the<br>pattern here.<br>Anyone with solutions to my wiz research problems, please post. Thanks,<br>Nimis of The Rathe<p>
