I'm not sure wether you guys came in on the frames or not, but if you do it looks pretty good.<br>And for information, it was a professional web designer who made up the colors for this website.<br>This is the first I have heard about there beeing bad colors here, and I might belive its got something about the color mix on your pc, but that I cannot say for sure. But I will look into it. A colorchange on this board would have to include my whole website.<p>: While I have been wanting a wizard board for some time I have to request that whoever runs this board please make the colors more standard. I spend a lot of time on message boards and funky colors are difficult to read. Unless you are a trained designer don't try to be creative with the colors. Otherwise the board will not be as popular.<p>: Just my humble opinion.<p>
