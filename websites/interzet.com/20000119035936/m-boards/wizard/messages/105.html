<br>: I'm sick of people telling me that Wizards are EASY to play and that we are all kill stealers!<p>This is one comment I have never understood!  We are by far the weakest character in the game and therefore die more easily than the rest.  After we die, going back for our body is, sometimes, no easy task.  <p>I for one think that this is the most difficult character to play.  I am only level 10 and things may change, but for now it bites.  <p>We need faster mana refilling time to equal things.
