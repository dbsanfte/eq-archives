I fear that I may not have put enough investment into my intelligence.  This is the biggest concern which I can conjure.  Intelligence translates directly into mana at the rate of about 1 point per level of 5 points of intelligence.  This means that if you could have spent 20 more points on intelligence and didnt, at level 1 it would only make 4 points difference in mana.  However, at level 30 you are penalizing yourself by about 120 points of mana.  To put this in perspective, I have roughly 308 points of mana at level 14.  I can cast shock of lightning (does 80 dam at 60 mana cost) 5 times with a root thrown in.  If I had put those other 20 points (yes, I made this mistake too) into intelligence, I would have enough to cast another high level spell.  Frequently at my level, the mana I have isnt enough to finish an even con off (if I have a fizzle or reduced effect).<br>If I were level 5 I would probably rebuild my character.   As I didnt realize my error til level 10 or 11, I am going to contiue.<br>One thing that I can recommend (it is a little twinking), is that you find someone you trust to hold your equipment (all of it).  You may then bring your new character in and retrieve your belongings from your trusted companion.  This will at least allow you to not lose your material benefits.<br>Whatever you decide, dont dwell on it.  This is a most wonderful of games.  Have fun and Good Hunting.
