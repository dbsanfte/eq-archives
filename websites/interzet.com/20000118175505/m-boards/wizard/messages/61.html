: : Being level I would recommend to atleast group with someone else til you can get your next ring of spells. Right now I'm level 10 and having a hell of a time getting above that. But at level 8 you should be able to take on Orc cent's and orc oracles (1 at a time tho just to be safe). If your on Karana drop me a tell.<p>: You want him to take on orc cent's and oracles at lvl 8?!  I hope he hits hard.  I couldn't take on cents until I was lvl 11, and sometimes not even then.<p>: -- Brevelan<p>You people must not be watching your mana bars or something! I've been soloing cents and oracles since lvl 5! although i wasn't able to handle two at a time until 7 <still 7- as sometimes two at a time still kick my butt> but about half the time I can drop both of them before moving out to meditate. the trick is to root- and use your area affect spells, they do work good.
