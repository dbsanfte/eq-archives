Runes are what Wizard's use to make their spells, if you get components for another class, save them for trading instead of selling for money. To make a spell you only put in the listed ingredients, no quill or blank scroll is needed. The book you start making your spells in is sold at your guild and their are four books to do this in, the cheapest one makes the lowest level spells you can research, the highest priced one makes the highest level spells. You need to be skilled in the language the book is written in to be able to research the spell properly, it doesn't matter if you 'know' in real life what components go into the book if your character has a zero in the language you aren't likely to get a spell-thus no spoiler site can truly spoil research since your in game language skill is one of the key factors in making the spell. The more obscure languages that the higher level books are written in come available to you at the appropriate level via your guild trainer. Dont buy the book of Ancient Restoration, it's a left over from beta with no use, as said by GZ the master of magick at VI. Put one point into research at level 16 and you get 16 points, put one point in at 20 and you get 20, basically if you have a skill with a zero in it and pay one point to train in it you get an equal amount points based on your current level, thus putting that point into research at level 20 saves you spending points at L16 to get to 20 before the trainer won't train you anymore.
