I am confused to just what is camping. Take the orc camp in BB for example since you mentioned it. No really good loot is dropped there.  The loot is ok, but its really not great. What is good about that camp is that a wizard can solo there from 12\14ish all the way to level 18.  Now granted, if a solo wizard goes there and none are at the camp, it will be VERY hard if not impossible to clear the camp and keep up with the spawn rate, but most group do not mind letting one wizard solo in the back just so long as the camp does not become overcrowded. Is this camping?<p>Second example: Dvinn and Crush do drop nice loot in CB but a dirk is lore and a tunic is pending lore.  Say you have one of both and you and a couple of others group and want to kill crush and Dvinn repeatedly for the experience.  If you don't sit at the top of the castle, DVinn won't leave unless some fool who can't handle him goes in and he chases them which usually kills lots of low levels in the zone.  Is it camping to stay there and kill him each time he spawns for the experience? How does this differ then sitting at an orc camp in BB?  Those BB orcs are not leaving the camp unless they see someone and the person runs. Its the same with DVinn and Crush, they are not roaming NPCs unless they see someone.
