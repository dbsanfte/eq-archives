When I first heard of this spell i said to myself .. What a stupid spell!.  which i thought was the case.. then i read a post from sombody who said that this was an awsome spell.  I couldn't figure out why this may be useful. but then i came across sombody who purchased it.  And they filled me in on what makes it an invaluable spell.  Here's a scenario,  you are in a full group. say in.. Unrest.. one of your fellow groupmates is Fetching a monster. .. you can Bind Sight to see through HIS eyes, this way as soon as he attacks somthing, or gets in trouble, you know EXACTLY where he is, and what is attacking him. and if he's ok..  a very useful spell indeed.<p><br>I have purchased it, but alas, i have not used it yet.. but i shall when i get a chance<p>Moish Osiris<br>20 Wizard<br>Karana
