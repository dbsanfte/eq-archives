: I researched Pillar of Fire, first try, Identify, first try, Project lightning, failed 3 times, what am i doing wrong, i get some stupid message "these items do not combine to make an item"?<p>You are using the incorrect rune of fulguration.  See my series of posts below.  I suggest you just buy runes of fulguration until you have two piles that do not combine with at least 2 runes in each.  Take one from the first pile, and use it to try the researh.  If it works, this is the stack for Project Lightning, if it doesnt, then the other stack will be for Project Lightning and this stack will be for Energy Storm.  I have found no other way to tell the different level runes with the same name apart.  Good luck.  And just so you know know, The fire Spiral of Al'Kabor uses the runes Al'Kabor and Velious, the research book is incorrect.<br>Nimis Nex of the Rathe<br>
