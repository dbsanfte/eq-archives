Depends, if you are a human, I would say without a doubt, because 75/80 int is just too low for a caster. If you have around 100 in int, then  you should do pretty well, alot of wisdom casters have around 100 wisdom or less since wisdom stats don't get as high as int stats do for the races. The formula for mana, btw, is ((level/5)+2*level, so you can figure out how different your mana would be if you started over with a new character, more mana isn't always helpful, especially if you have the most in a group, people will always complain that you are the last person ready to fight again after a medding/healing break. Str doesn't do much, cept for melee types, other than giving you the ability to carry more than others. If you are a DE, High Elf, or Gnome, you can probably play your wizard and be fine, they all start with high int, and int can be boosted by magic items. <p>So its not the best thing to have done, but its not the worse thing either. If you don't have alot of time or loathe the idea of starting over, then don't, unless you are human with a 75/80 int, then you really should start over unless you want to role play the wizard who didn't have enough mana for the 100th time in a row.<p>The skill points you spent already aren't that big of a loss when you consider you will get another 45 levels worth of them if you play to 50. Skill points aren't too helpful with skills, most go up on their own, like spell skills or combat skills. Points are mostly useful in jump starting a skill like dodge at L22 or putting points into research or langauges. The latter isn't a big worry either, at level 16 when you get research, if you put one point into it you will actually get 16. If your skill in a skill is zero when you spend a point on it you actually get the equivalent of points equal to your current level. Spend that one point at 20 on research or a language and get 20 points added to your skill for the cost of one, so don't sweat that angle of the game at all. Plus by the time you hit research levels, there should be a good supply of fellow Wizards skilled enough in research for you to be able to buy spells from them and skipping research all together, tho that costs money and research is theoretically almost free other than buying the recipe books to place the compenents in- the going rate for runes is about 5pp now and that should decrease as times goes by and more people have runes.<p>qq<p>: oki I'm very new.<p>: I spent my attribute points on strength, oops.<br>: I'm about to hit level 5.<br>: I spent my training points on abjuration and meditation.<p>: Will my guy be any good?
