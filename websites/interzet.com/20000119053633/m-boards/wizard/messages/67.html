: I am looking for all the info on jewlery making i can find. only skill 21 now and have only made a cople of rings. I want to be able to make some kick magic jewlery in the future. Only draw back is having to beg, and bribe enchanters to enchant bars for you.<p>Sorry but the concensus seems to be that jewelry making isn't all that great.  Most of the magical jewelry that can be made are pretty minor effects.  Especially compared to the effects of jewelry that is found instead of player made.<p>Although some people have reported that Jaded jewelry not only increases the amount of mana a caster has but also the regeneration rate I serious doubt that it will affect that much.  A jaded ring (+5 mana) only adds that much mana to your total.  Not per level which would be an awesome item to have.  <p>Even if it added +5 to the amount of mana regenerated per tick (while meditating) it still wouldn't be worth it.  At 20th level an erudite wizard has 600 mana.  That's 120 mana per bubble and each bubble gets regenerated over the course of about 40 seconds.  The amount of mana regenerated is based on the skill roll made vs meditation (which is why sometimes mana does regen and others it regens a huge jump in one go) and then the +5 would be added if at all.<p>Doubtful at best, worthless at worst.  Do you really want to pour 400pp into this skill??<p>ed<br>McDeath<p>BTW if anyone seriously claims that jaded jewelry helps mana regeneration then all I can say is "prove it".  Set the time (at night), the server and the place.  I'll create a character to watch.<p>You empty all your mana out using a set of agreed upon spells and then meditate.  I'll time you.  Once you go FM then you cast the exact same number and type of spells you cast to go OOM.  Meanwhile I'll calc the max mana you should have for level and Int and subtract the mana cost of the spells cast so that they match closely.  Then we do it again once more.  If after all that there is a measureable and *repeatable* improvement of mana regeneration then I'll eat my words and save up for those jaded items.<p>
