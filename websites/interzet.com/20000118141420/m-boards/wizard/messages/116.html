Well that's when you really see why enchanters are so po'd about all the 'overpowered' nonsense from Brad, GZ and the rest Verant. The sheer nonsense of blowing your entire line of mana without doing one point damage and having to flee from a now very pissed mobs is not enjoyable... Brad who plays a level 50 ranger with that godlike green armour and flaming swords (yeah i really doubt he didnt twink or worse)... and the dev team who play mainly druids of course think pure casters are waaaay too powerful, thus the toning down of high level wizard damage, that screwy random number generator thats not really random at all, and unannounced changes in fizzle rates and exp needed to level...  Getting resists from green mobs for zero damage is so angering...<p><p>: At level 20 you only get one new DD spell.<p>: Force Shock.<p>: Does nice damage, when it isnt resisted. Unfortunately, blues resist it about 30% of the time, for ZERO damage. Harder stuff resists more.<p>: Then you'll wish you got the 4 damage :)<p>: Luckily the other spells dont get resisted too often.<p>: First time trying my new level 20 stuff against a real critter went like this :<p>: Enstill - resisted<br>: Enstill - resisted<br>: Root - rooted<br>: Force Shock - resisted<br>: (root wears off)<br>: Root - resisted<br>: Root - rooted<br>: Force Shock - resisted<br>: Run for zone with no mana left<p>: Seriously though, I agree, a Wizards spell should be resisted for half damage or something. Not resisted for little or NO effect. All a Wizard gets is damage stuff, only fair that it be a little more effective than others.<p>: Ninecattiess<p>

: : At level 20 you only get one new DD spell.

: : Force Shock.

: : Does nice damage, when it isnt resisted. Unfortunately, blues resist it about 30% of the time, for ZERO damage. Harder stuff resists more.

: : Then you'll wish you got the 4 damage :)

: : Luckily the other spells dont get resisted too often.

: : First time trying my new level 20 stuff against a real critter went like this :

: : Enstill - resisted
: : Enstill - resisted
: : Root - rooted
: : Force Shock - resisted
: : (root wears off)
: : Root - resisted
: : Root - rooted
: : Force Shock - resisted
: : Run for zone with no mana left

: : Seriously though, I agree, a Wizards spell should be resisted for half damage or something. Not resisted for little or NO effect. All a Wizard gets is damage stuff, only fair that it be a little more effective than others.
