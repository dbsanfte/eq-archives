When I'm the leader I make it clear that any named loot or special loot, as you found, is GROUP loot.  In other words, it's up to the group to decide what do to with it.  Also, if someone in the group wants it then they have to compensate the rest of the group, after all it was a GROUP effort!  I try to get the group to agree to sell it to someone in our group at a reduced rate, this one is really hard to do heh.<p>IF no one can afford it, then auction it and split the auction money.<p>IF no one listens I boot them.  <p>IF you join a group and this isn't made clear, leave.  Not worth the head ache.  <p>Since you're a wizard give it to someone who will duel you then take it hehe jk.  <br>__________________________________________________<br>: I was fighting in Mystmoore with a group, (Just people that got together), we had no loot order, (loot but don't get greedy, deal). We had talked about that the shield is found here, but no mention as to actually getting it for anyone in particular. I spot the NPC with the shield, we end up killing it. I ended up with the shield. <br>: Now, there is big ranting about who should get the shield. <br>: wizard, enchanter, shaman, paladin, (the shaman, paladin where using a two handed weapon).<p>: Yes, I know I can't as wiz, use the shield, but 1. I can give it to a friend of mine, who is a shaman.<br>: 1. trade it for black robe, or observer staff.<p>: Well, what would you have done? We were all there for basically exp, (the loot pretty much, stinks).<p>: ???? Please as many people as possible post their answer, I want to know?<p>
