Who doesn't agree with this. There are only 2 dmgs i can do to a creature. Max and min, which is like 48dmg and 4dmg with FireBolt. Thats it. I might get a odd 22 dmg hit but that never happens in the same day twice. I haven't had much trouble or complaints about fizzles, since they don't happen that often to me. <p>One really big grip i have is this: I was going to by some new lvl 12 spells and by accident i bought one magician spell which cost me almost 7pp. So after swearing alot i go and sell it back. He offered me 1pp back. THATS IT! I find this really annoying. I should aleast be offered half of the orginal price back aleast. O'well stupid me for buying it(stupid mouse as well *grin*).<p>One really bad complaint i do have also is floating yk's. I was going to attack one the other day and usally you can tell if there are moer then one floating there. Not this time. Looked like one complete tk. So i rooted it. All of a sudden 4 young kodiaks start to run at me! I pull up my robes and high tailed it to the zone. Ack thats annoying. <p>Blarg!<p>(this useless response was brought to you by a raving looney)
