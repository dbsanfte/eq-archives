At higher levels we do get alot better.  Our damage rates are much more than other classes and our casting time is also.  Some people will try to compare damage rates with other classes and say that they are about even.  They are missing the picture here.  We gain new damage spells with increasing damage every four levels with out fail.  Other spell casters do not and when they do equal us in damage they must wait for many levels to get a new damage spell.  While we quickly over reach them with in the next 4 levels.  It all works out.   <p>We are some what lacking in the shielding department.  I can see that.  But it's not really that bad.  As for pets. Bah!  Who needs them or wants them.  Hard to control, and often worthless.  Buffs.. really aren't needed.  Why should a Wizard need buffs.  Can't really justify this. Enchanters and shaman I can see.. more up there alley.<p>Now enchanters on the other hand have been taken for a ride.  That class has been royally screwed.
