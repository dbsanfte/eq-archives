Very ironic that this was mentioned less than a week later..<P>.. from Annastacia<BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR> <BR>Last but not least, camping one person in each of the major spots cannot claim you that spawn. Coming up with an acceptable solution to this would benefit BOTH of our guilds. In the past we have backed down because of a very few amount of people in a specific zone on your part, but you cannot honestly expect us to continue like that... or we will just do the same thing (and what is the fun of sitting and waiting for a mob to spawn -- then siting and waiting for a guild to spawn. :P)<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The holier than though (what a wonderfully ghey phrase) sentiment that Salkins FD monk(why the fk does a mage need a cleric epic?  couldnt the cleric make a monk if they didnt want to make a raid of 40 lay claim to the lair for 3 days or so if it was that important), who was asleep (jerking it, who knows, but was unresponsive, and in the least ) in Nags lair, and was prompted several times about intentions on Ragefire before he awoke, was a legit means to *claim* a spawn... justifiaction, its inconvienient to have a force waiting around for the mob to spawn.  <P>Seems this bit ya in the ass again.  I suppose farming all the major spawns is hard, and thus the necessity to claim camps with FD monks might be necessary here, too.  In fact, you should probably park one in Plane of Fear for the next CT   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">  When you use the word *honor*, you really bring it to new levels.. <P>As mentioned Derrick, bringing up instances of ninja'd items is probably not a good idea for sake of arguement since that blood is shared among yours as well 8)<P>78 point dmg shield against a 425 dain is nice btw.. heh<P>/salute <P>Disclaimer I - apologies to those I offend, and to those I impress, neither was intended<BR>Disclaimer II - personal view, I dont represent anyone but myself here<P>Member Star Camp 2k+1!<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Wanyen ]

First off, let me say kenuvan, dont put words in my mouth. I never said anything of the sort..except when I was in /tells with Cunnan, and we were trying to work things out. And all I said, was IC got the last 2 MotG's, we would like one. Kills had been IC,IS,IC,IC.<BR> Second, the first person I tried to talk to in ST, was Kenuvan, aka Abdazen (Altho he didnt mention this fact when I was trying to talk to you  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> ) Thats when you guys pulled the first Sentries, which in my personal opinion was rude as hell. So.. we followed suit.. and pulled a few ourselves. I died, grts fizzle on DA. Thank you Syndi for the res.. was very nice of you, even tho we did have two clerics of our own.<BR>  After we pulled Sents, not before mind you, Abdazen, Cunnan /tells Me, and we start talking to work things out. I told him our take on it, he explained yours. We discussed rolling for it.. which was a negetive from you guys..Cunnan offered us the next 2 (future) MoTg's for yesterdays. I brought it to my members, who had the forsight to be curious why IC would be so generous. So Anna, went and checked him.. sure enough, he was slashing.../shrug not going to call anyone underhanded, esp. not Cunnan.. but Im pretty sure someone there in IC knew.  I also told Cunnan, that we were checking him, so its not like we were trying to be greedy, as you claim. More as in, dont trust a dog with fleas, to not give you.. well fleas.<BR> To get into, the pull.. I know Sharfeer pulled first, I also saw Cunnan in MotG's prox range.. saw him get agro'd. Cunnan would have never agro'd him had he not already been pulled. Why use CoH (ala reagent spell) to pull? Well, imo thats the smartest, safest way to pull sometimes, but im sure you guys already knew that. Im not sure if Sharf got CoH'd or not, I wasnt in that group.. either way the point is mute, as using a bow (low damage agro) versus prox agro, and a 60 warrior doing damage.. yeah pretty much Cunnan got the most agro.<BR>  When I zoned in, IS had more in Zone than IC, prior to that, as I told Arie, It had been.. Zendak, first (this is not a disputed fact)Then 2 vs 2 and so forth.. The longer it went on, the more people that zoned in, which is sure what both teams wanted.. to have as many of thier people in zone as possible, making the kill both easier, and more efficient. However, IS did have the majority of the people in zone at any given time. We simply did not start killing Sents, or anything else because, I was trying to talk to Kenuvan, first.. then later Cunnan. You all seemed to have thought that /ignoring that fact would give you the rights to keep on, or start on clearing. I am sure this makes you feel justified. <BR> You may want to say that we are lying, and that we did lie to the GM, Therdar.. I am sure a Lead GM has seen and heard it all before.. and after his reading our Guild Chat logs, he did side with us. Please feel free, to /petition Vedan, or Email him.. as we have no problem with his viewing our chat logs, or defending ourselves in anyway. Had we simply wanted to allow you guys to do the work, and KS/Ninja the weapon.. then I am sure we wouldve looted it right away. Not holding the corpse, until given the go ahead to loot. Nor, would I have stayed in zone discussing this with you, until I had heard all I was going to from you guys.<BR> Elumino, and Endar.. well ya know.. when one is expecting a pull to come to you, you tend to med or what-have-you.. until it gets there. I am sure Endar wasnt making any sort of judgement call.. he more than likely didnt want to be caught in the middle of our fighting. And anyone who says they are his friend, would understand that.. and allow him to do as he wished.. unmolested from /tells of Fuck you you asshole I cant believe you helped them.. etc. Which makes Endar more forgiving a person than myself, as when you guys Dicked him over on his ELP's.. just because he went on a few raids with us. Choose or loose .. right? Oh, as a side note, GW on getting rid of Gnost from the game as well.. God knows you all didnt need such a loyal person on your team. Elumino, on the other hand, just figured you would all train us, if we got the kill and was preparing to /camp out  <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">. So whatever.<BR> As for teaching us Trak tactics, thanks.. but thats about all you ever taught us. And FYI, we did invite some IC members along on our first raids, as well as Ook Ook. Talk to Hurtz, we had several conversations about it, about how many wouldnt come, because they would either get into "trouble" or just felt too weird about it. While the rest of you werent even speaking to us  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">. As for the rest, well I have never cared that much about what you guys did in the past, or present, or future.. never liked being talked down to, very much, or being bashed by those in IC that have more.. assholish qualities. Oh and Learic, hun.. if you feel the need to "shadow" us around.. please feel free. You can laugh when we wipe out.. which is quite a bit.. usually 2 or 3 times a night. You can examine those "stacking exploits" you all seem to be going on and on about..oh and if you can FD.. well damn you can see how we kill stuff too. but if you ever try to cause harm to my guildmates, not only will I /petition you.. I will email Vedan a copy of all you posted here.. all that you do, and say.. and I will make it my personal vendetta, to get your account/accounts banned.. and if you are guilded.. Inner Circle to be disbanded  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> . So, if you remain a harmless annoyance, fine.. thats your decision, but dont ever threaten us, or my husband again. mmmkay?

Let me clarify a few things.  First off, I was in exactly the right position to aggro and pull Master of the Guard.  I did the exact same thing I did to pull him the first time which you all witnessed.  Best possible case regarding Sharfeer pulling is he aggroed at the same time I did, which could indeed cause confusion.  But let no one else accuse me of stealing the pull, or not knowing how to pull or what I'm doing and accidentally taking it off Sharfeer.<P>You thought my deal was fair on the offering of the next two spawns, but it was only fair if the master had no loot?  That really kind of destroys the deal.  My offer was to yield us a chance at loot and we would yield you the next two chances of loot, which by the way I had NOT run that idea by my guild yet I was just testing the waters.  You were all perfectly willing to yield it if it had no loot and that makes no sense what so ever.  If both of us knew it had no loot why would either of us want it?  I can assure you this much, if you guys had found it to not be wielding and decideded to leave there would have been no deal because that totally by passed the point of my offer.  None of us hadd aggroed and attacked the master.  We don't have a mage for CoH and we don't have a necro to summon corpses and the chances of a monk surviving that are more against than for.<P>As for Endar and Gnost, I don't know what to say about conflicting stories there.  I would like to know what we did to Gnost to make him quit EQ because I can assure you, whatever you know about Gnost and IC is very one-sided and you shouldn't be bringing it up.  As for Endar, it was my understanding that he spent the bulk if not all of his ELP on his last raid with us for an item and chose to raid with you guys from that point on.  I'm not criticizing Endar at all for that choice.  I like him and am glad he is having fun.  And if someone in IC chased him off then I would like to hear that from Endar and not from second hand sources posting off topic in a thread as volatile as this one.<P>The GMs probably told us both two different things.  The GM told me he could not side with anyone he simply couldn't do anything because he could not prove anything one way or the other.  That doesn't say anything about either side's arguement.<P>I urge you and Derrick both to go back and read my earlier post in this thread and consider it seriously over the next few days.<P>Cunnan<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Cunnan ]

Damn ubb code!  =)<P>Quote:<BR>--------------------------------<BR>megdailie, as much as ive chatted with you in the past and have been cordial with you, i regret to tell you to shut the fuck up. go to the bard boards and request more information on how to kill yelinek now with no hp stacking buffs. if you havent been inside ST, you got no idea what the fuck youre talking bout, so please again shut the fuck up. know your role and sing manasong. from now on itll always be 15 + 1 on your st raids. that +1 is me in your rear view window. fuck you 13 bitches. *pause* shout out to my dog endar, and elumino for doing the right thing.<P>LL <P>End Quote<BR>--------------------------------------<BR>Way to completely ignore what I said in my post LL.  Not everyone can be distracted like little babies when someone spews something new in front of them.  As for going to the bard boards asking about Yelinak, I think Kenuvan does enough of that for both of us.  Lastly, no my char Megdailie has not been in sleepers, but that doesn't mean I wasn't there.<P>In response to those who said we didnt back down on Klandicar.  The last one you guys had 10 in zone, we had 5.  You guys quickly grew from that, and we had about 3 full groups enroute, but turned around when Derrick decided to stand down to you guys because you had the larger force.  Funny thing is, you guys didnt even kill him for another two hours or so.  But the point remains, we both could have had killing forces there within the next 10 minutes, you had more sooner, so we stood down.  <P>Unfortunately, this is probably one of the first times you guys have ever been in a situation where it was your turn to obviously stand down.  I just hope we dont have to rehash this every time this happens.<P>Megdailie<P>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Megdailie ]<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Megdailie ]

Well this is all so cute but I'll add some comments. This thread actually had some decent chance of an actual discussion of what happened until people like Learic felt like adding stupid ass comments...How I wish you could see how stupid you make yourself look.<P>Bottom line issue here is basically the pull...not who had the exact rights to the mob first since we basically both did(clearing the first two golems is basically jack shit). So after we cleared the right ramp golem and one of the others...it was pull time...Sharfeer does not want to post on any of these threads( cant blame him) so I'll give his basic side of the pull. He was on the left side, Cunn was on the right..A roamer was passing on Cunn's side going up so he had to wait due to a possible add while Sharf could pull instantly..He did and took off...By this time the roamer was far enough away so Cunnan was able to aggro Motg usually whatever means(Sharf had ran like a baby ranger back to camp)...So of course the actions followed the pull steal..which was perfectly fine...you tried to fuck us and we weren't going to allow it~<P>Soo Sharf had first aggro because Cunnan couldn't aggro before him due to a possible add..then he gained aggro on Motg and pulled him back to camp...Thats the definition of a pull steal right there folks..And theres no way around it...even if it accidently aggroed on him he could of done the right thing and just died instead of taking it to camp( Hi pull steal).<P>Anyway this is most likely in vain since Side A isnt going to change their feelings and neither will Side B even though logically one of those sides were truely right~<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Sitten ]

It was not a pull steal.  Sharfeer could not have pulled the master without aggroing that sentry before I could because the master paths very oddly and to the right when he is aggroed, which would have caused the sentry at the top to aggro as well.  Call me a pull thief if you will, but you are dead wrong Sitten.  I will at least compromise the issue and agree that sharfeer *could* have pulled the same time I did.  You guys seem to be unwilling to extend me that same courtesy.  Must be my extreme reputation on this server as a kill stealer and a pull thief.<P>Cunnan

This is the exact reason I dont even want to play this game.  We are both in fear at the same time.  Flip and I are trying to do fear.  We yield and then are bitched at later for never yielding.  Excuse me?  I wasnt there but motg can be done with 8 people easily and from what Ive seen from both sides, there was 8 pulling and ready to go.  I guess the fact that it had the weapon and you guys had to get the second one as well made you guys greedy enough to killsteal it.  Ya...I dont think I will be back soon if ever.  Shit like this makes me sick.<P>--------------------<P>Xantha Xziere - "Gimp"<BR>60 Warder<BR>Inner Circle<BR>"--MIA--"

Oh and... the tidbit about us being greedy after we found out it had a sword?   We still waited apparently over an hour to even get to the attack, and then held the corpse afterwards while being mediated by guide/gm? :P<P>Frankly, what upset us about finding out he had a weapon was that Cunnan suggested us let them have this one and we get the next two WITHOUT saying "Nem, this has a primal 1hs... let us have this one and we will back off the next two" when he *knew* that it did. :P<P>We were upset about being misled, not greedy cuz it had some ph4t l3wt!  Mind you, if he had been hitting he could still be carrying 2h.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">  /point Kilt

Wanyen, for your information, Ragefire has been camped by a single person since the quest was invented.  See Krista, or Sahrah.   And many many others.   There's a difference between a mob that will spawn between 1 and 72 hours and a mob that is already up (ala trakanon, dain, klandicar, MOTG).<P>And frankly, if you'd like to discuss this, feel free to do so on IS's or Xeg.net.  You should see what Vedan suggested!

For what it is worth this was one of the most dispicable acts I have ever witnessed while playing this game.  Actually probebly the most dispicable act.  I don't know or care about the politics of what you guys are trying to accomplish as a guild or who did what to whom in the last 3 years.  What I don KNOW is that you were not prepared to fight when we pulled the first mob.  Nem had just been killed and ressed.  We had the force we started clearing and the Leadership of IS decided to make this your Right of Passage.  When MOTG was pulled he went towards Cunnan and our side of the Hall.  As a matter of fact it took him quite sometime to get to ourside.  You all didn't start running over until we had engaged, tashed, meloed and slowed.  Did your clerics cast one heal spell?  Did your chanter cast one debuff spell?  Did your bard Play any song?  Did your warriors taunt to try and take agro from the MOTG?  I would be interested to know.  Actually, I do know, but I would be interested in what you the leadership of IS has to say about it.  I hope you all are happy with how you obtained that particualar item, carry it proudly Sharfeer.  Everytime it procs think about the glorious battle you and your cohorts fought to obtain it for you.  It sadens me to no end that you all felt it nessecary to KS a mob and than think that that Act is identifed as your Right of Passage.  I held quite a bit of respect for IS and what you have accomplished, but that respect is gone.  This wasn't the act of one lone person this was an act by the very Core and Leadership of the guild.  You have sent a message to the rest of the Server we IS will walk over, KS, and do what ever we feel like because, in our minds, WE desearve everything.  Enjoy your new world.<P> I don't know about this whole arrow thing that is being discussed, but I do know that when I root a mob I get summoned.  I am not a druid or ranger my root does no damage, but who really cares.  I also find it quite interesting that Shaf says he was cohed after he fired the arrow, but everyone else in IS, that was there, doesn't seem to know one way or another.   Easy to find out ask Shaf or or Salkin your mage.  I like how you have muzzled Shaf and told him not to talk and that Sitten will talk for him.  Well I will be waiting to see if you infact answer any of the above questions.  Oh, just a by and by, don't think your Friendship will help you with Vedan if the shit really hits the fan.

Cunnan,<P>I am not going to pointlessly argue when clearly the is no remorse or resolution to your past actions and ST recently. No point going on about it.<P>If you want to work out sharing some static mobs with me then I am willing to talk as well. I don't consider it being a "pussy" and all that other crap. IS has rarely ever been in conflict for anyone, and we don't enjoy it.<P>As for Learic's threats and the other less intelligent people that keep sending tells that "our lives are going to be a living hell" and "Prepare yourself for DA trains shit", "Fuck you", etc. Someone ( I assume IC ) that I never have known logged in and actually told me that you guys set up a Training thread and that pics of our dead asses are gonna line up in there like trophys??? I kinda doubt thats true but god the timing was there.<P>Everyone assumes your the new level headed leader of IC so I will talk to you about guild relations, just have them stop the "fuck you" and training threats, its beyond silly.<P>Thanks

I dont have too much active participation in the high end leadership anymore but I think your actions have proven themselves.  I don't even know what could even patch things up.  A possibility would be the next two Weapons being backed down upon and given over.  Thats just my opinion as I havent even conversed with the guild but I eye for an eye seems fair...that is if you have any sense of fairness left in you<P>--------------------<P>Xantha Xziere - "Gimp"<BR>60 Warder<BR>Inner Circle<BR>"--MIA--"

I didn't see everything that happened during the pull(s), but I remember Sharfeer saying in group for Salkin to start casting the CoH, shortly after that the MotG shouted his aggro message, and I noticed Sharfeer was back at the group again. I didn't witness first hand what exactly happened with the pull (aside from what was said in group), but I do know Sharf was CoH'd as he said he was.  And for reference, Sharfeer chose not to post here because he's well aware that it would simply lead to more flaming by some people. If you doubt his honesty in this situation, then I can't really do anything about that.<P>There's a huge temptation to go on at length about karmic retribution, and how what you guys are feeling right now about what you interpret as us screwing you over is precisely the kind of feelings that IC members have invoked in countless other Xegony players, but it's fairly pointless to do so. This was not a "rite of passage", that was not what Derrick said. This was simply a case where both sides felt they had the moral high ground, and neither was willing to back down. IS has backed down for IC in the past on several occasions, and IC has backed down for IS in the past -- nobody is keeping a scorecard (or if they are, it's a little weird). As an officer of IS, I would much rather this whole episode hadn't taken place to be honest, but I don't feel that our members did anything that violates the "rules", and had the roles been reversed, I sincerely doubt IC would have backed down either. Maybe I'm wrong, who knows. If this results in some sort of arrangement between our guilds to avoid these types of circumstances, than that would be a good thing IMO. That is all.

Thank you for the honest post Durham, I will only respond to a couple things, I am a believer in the race to the mob method.  I enjoy it, having said that, if you had pulled the first mob, we would have left, there may have been arguement about it but we would have.  I can gaurentee you I would have as would a few others.  We have done this quite a few times in the past.  I don't keep count on who wins or who does't.  If you guys beat us to a spawn we leave.  It seems if we beat you to a spawn it is some how different.  Some of your members seem to think that if they can take a spawn than they have lost something by leaving.  I don't know what the future holds between the two guilds, but at this moment there are quite a few ppl upset.  They aren't upset because they lost a mob or an item, they are upset because ppl they thought were there friends, and in some cases real friends that they talk to every day, Endar, screwed them about as bad as you can be screwded in this game.  It hurt them emotionally, they were obviuosly wrong about the ties they thought they had.  For IS it is just a matter of trying to show you were justified in doing what you did.  For many of the folks from IC it was the a loss of something much more important.  In my mind there always was a friendly competition between the two guilds, but I guess there was some more deep seeded revenge type things, that I just never had a clue about.  Oh well, what can you do.

You invite him into guild, he fights with you in fear, wins the bloodfire weapon, secretly the IS warriors didnt feel he earned it, you kick him out of guild, tell him if he returns sword hell be welcomed back, get the sword returned, and say sorry jovo we didnt want you in guild. touche motherfucker, i got your godddamn number. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Just as an addendum, I was 'banned' from IC raids after I won my Blood Fire because Warlord had had a boyhood dream of owning one of these for a long time.    <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0">  I was not about to let myself get screwed out of it like the blade of the black dragon eye in the second week of Kunark.  I didnt really mind all that much (about being 'banned), I was more concerned with just doing stuff with my guildmates and the friends I had in IC.  Thats okay though, I'm happy in my current situation and I'm sorry that there had to be some strife.  At least Warlor went on to exact his revenge on me at the botb, albeit by using 6 or 7 pieces of borrowed equipment O_O  That didnt really matter though simply because the level difference was too great to make up.<P>As for a MoTG being able to be killed 'easily' (quote from Xantha) with 8 people, that seems to be a bit of a stretch to me.  An avatar proc'ing MoTG can be killed with 10-11 and some luck.. but dont even begin to assume that one without a primal approaches the difficulty level of one with a primal.<P>P.S. As to Wanyen, that number is easily acheived by getting a druid dmg shield and call of earth.  He then will play his songs which stack intentionally with other forms of damage shields.  So that last part of your post was pretty silly.  I know it is fairly easy to get up to nearly 100 dmg per hit if you are grouped with a bard in fact.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: MeierDorf ]

You weren't banned because you won something.  You were banned because I said I didn't want you on any raids with me anymore, and since I was in IC and you were not you didn't get to go.  So you figured you'd suck off some GM to move your whiney ass to a new server.  Thx drive thru.<P>--------------------<P>Serieux the Dorf

There you have it. Why would you CoH Sharfeer before he got to the group? Never was Sharfeer seen running back, he was CoHed right before/after the pull, probably becuase he knew he was going to agro the sentry. Even if he did get CoHed, it's Cunnan's pull then. Thank you for the honest post.<P>As for not being anble to kill MotG with primal, we sure can, we basically did it yesterday. We tanked him, we slowed him, the *only* thing you did was run over and attack him from the back.<P>Still waiting for the full logs, Gathu.

I joined started raiding with IC in November of last year.  I did so with a certain amount of concern because I knew they had a reputation for being, in a word, asses.  The majority of the players I had grouped with from IC did not fit that category and they were all great players.  I don't like it when gank other people pulls, etc. and I didn't want to join a guild that did that.  I didn't.  <P>For the 32 raids since I started raiding with them, IC has NEVER "ganked" anything while I have been with them.  I have seen them backoff a number of times - on Trak, on Kland, on Zland, etc.  I have seen them wait in a bunch of ubers while HL or some other guild tried them.  Once, we waited through 3 wipeouts.  <P>Do we race for the spawns?  Yes.  Will we contest them if we feel we were there first?  Yes.  Will we take them if another group tries and fails?  Yes.  <P>When we see people in a zone that are sufficient to take it, we don't contest it.  When we see a force that is a "maybe" or when we are racing and come up a bit short, we sometimes wait and give the group ahead of us has a crack at it.  Then IF THEY FAIL, we let the mob reset and whack it.  In no case in the last 32 raids I have been on has IC jumped past someone or "ganked" a mob from another raid.<P>Vedan set the rule: the first there and ready gets the first shot.  Most of the time, if we see a large group from another guild in a zone (like we saw IS in Thurgadin after the servers came up), we don't even consider going there.    <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR> IC pulled the first two ancient golems, and slowly killed them.

Weee, this is just like the old eqvault boards! ..so I feel compelled to reply, too! Even tho it has nothing to do with me...<P>This sounds like the same old deal.. Group A wants to do Mob. Group B wants to do Mob, too. They both work as quickly as they can, and are a little on edge because of the direct competition. When it comes down to the moment, someone in Group A says "I'm pulling." And of course, about the same time, someon in Group B says "I'm pulling." Then everyone sees Mob running around.. Do they fight? Everyone wants to, and will pretty much take any excuse, especially the "I was only following orders" excuse that you get when your designated puller tells you "I pulled!" (which is exactly what happened in IS's case, looking at Gathu's logs..)<P>But, I wasn't there.. maybe the situation was clear cut, and maybe it was obvious that one group was first.. of course, it doesn't sound that way..<P>The real question is what do you do now. Seems like nothing is happening except people building grudges. Grudges would only be fun if EQ were pvp, tho.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"><P>But I gotta say, Gathu... That whole "You have 5 mins to kill or we take" thing is bullshit and you know it. It's an excuse to make yourself believe you are entitled to a mob, when you know you aren't. If you felt you deserved it, you wouldn't wait 5 mins, you would take it right away. Either decide to move in, or let the other guys have their shot and move in after. I expect that kind of stuff from HL, not from you.

And people ask why I play less and less these days.<P>I, like many of my guildmates, have in the past always considered quite a few members of IS to be friends.  I've known quite a few of you for a long time and as far as I know I personally don't have a single enemy in the guild.  Yes, we'd developed something of a friendly rivalry due to competition over the same mobs/goals, but I can honestly say that with ONE or TWO possible exceptions, nobody in the guild harped on buff stacking or crap like that.  The attitude 95% of us took was more like, "Hey, IS has their $%it together, we need to get ours together too."  <P>Of course our problem of late has been that we've lost people (including myself to some extent) that are just tired of this game and we do not like guilding people without spending quite a bit of time with them first.  But that's neither here nor there.<P>Having said this, I'm really disappointed things have gotten to this point.  No, I wasn't there for this.  I wasn't even online that entire day, nor the day before or the day after.  And I'll almost certainly never see ST, nor do I really care.  Whoever it was that was right or wrong doesn't matter, although I must say that without even knowing what happened, just reading Derrick's post I was struck by the extreme arrogance of it.<P>What the bottom line is to me is that you've hurt my friends... my family... and have shown absolutely NO willingness to compromise, make amends, try to settle our differences, etc.  Cunnan's arm is falling asleep from holding out the olive branch for so long before you deigned to even acknowledge that fact.  I and several others have no desire to even play now.  Where you think the honor is in this behavior I don't know, but I do know that everywhere in life you reap what you sow and I can only hope that I hear about it in whatever game I'm playing when your day comes.  Hope you're proud of yourself and your actions.

I was in Sleepers Tomb during this event. I have friends who belong to IS who were there at the same time. I resd Nem after she died while fighting a sentry because I had no reason not to. I'm a cleric, I res people.<BR>I saw Cunnan pull. I was in tells with a guide for apx 20 min prior to pull. When IS charged, I asked guide to come. He arrived as I died, and missed the first part of battle. If he had arrived one minute sooner, All IS members present in ST would have warnings on their accounts right now. <BR>My friends are still my friends. IS knows what they did was wrong. Having to justify why you did something usually indicates at least some small sense of guilt.As I left the zone, I noticed one of your OWN people sitting at zone in, disgusted with what had happened. This person refused to even help you at all. <P>Nemeweh, I want you to know that you disappointed me. I had trusted you, your intentions, your morals. I always believed you would do the right thing given the chance. I'm going to lay the blame for this event entirely on your shoulders. You stirred the pot, fanned the flames, encouraged and supported doing the wrong thing in ST. I believe it's called hate-mongereing. <BR>I do not and will not condone any sort of "revenge" against your guild. I will not look at anyone with your guild tag above their head any differently than I always have. <BR>Reclaim your integrity Nem, I know how proud of it you were.<P>--------------------<P>~Syndi~<BR>~Synhara~<BR>~Synhex~

Hi! K, i've kept my mouth shut just gonna say something and keep it short unlike you people who type 10 page essays jeje. The Motg you guys got when vaedar got a primal we could have brought in the people to come and start pulling also but you know why we didnt? cause you pulled the first mob and we respected your claim to Motg that day and I think you should have given us some respect to the motg yesterday. I'm sure there was confusion and this "who pulled motg first" will never get resolved. And to the claim that we didn't have enough people to do motg, we do him with 9 and I DONT CARE if you think we can't do him with a primal even though we had 12. Let us fail, then you can take it but in my eyes what happened was Ksing and a bunch of stories with holes in them.

Hasn't anyone realized that racing to spawns is not going to work with having so many uber guilds on xegony?.....I mean ya guilds back off if you get there first etc etc...but they get tired of it and then both guilds or multiple guilds start running over each other. Funny how you talk about being adults....how can we if we can't even try to discuss agreements or spawn order or so forth?<P>I don't know what this is about and its not my place to talk about but I see these fights all over forums on guild pages. Eventally when people stop attacking each other and actually try something we could be a very sucess server...but that takes everyone. Either people get bored of this shit and quit the game or people start realizing its not getting them anywhere and try to make this better for everyone.<P><BR>The fights between guilds are getting worse. <BR>Guys are just adding more chains to each other...player1 flames player2, and player3 gets pissed at player1, then player4 gets pissed at player 3 and 2 for pissing player1 off... heh Thats all it looks like just flames and rants...I'm not saying didn't post to some helpful things to work this out..*cough* Cunnan, ya some people hate him or whatnot but doesn't change the fact that uhhh HE MIGHT BE RIGHT! stop fighting and listen. Rants Flames he did this she did that kiddy crap gotta stop sometime. <P>Hear lets start. If really want this to work tell your buddies to read this post and at least consider what I'm saying might have some kind of sense to it. If not your choice.<BR>The biggest challenge I see on Xegony is to see all guilds come to agreement and don't have to care about stupid matters like this anymore and maybe instead of flamming and complaining you can Have fun on the game. If you get mad...just blame Verant <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Having seen the movie, (As I am sure most of you have), and after witnessing last night's behaviour by IS,(wah, you trained that orc on me two years ago, wah, you lagged me so I lost a big fight. HELP HELP ME mr. GM, please be my special friend and do special time with me)  I can't think of anything that would be more appropriate than what Redlance posted. <BR>'Cept that adoring Svensk part. Not understanding that bit with all these damn sexy barbarians (like myself for example)  just hangin' around, trying to count past ten without taking their shoes off. (Well, ok. Actually I can count to 11 pretty easily just lifting my kilt a wee bit)  <P>oh oh. I suppose I will be accused of training some hapless warm and fuzzy guild now. bad me. Anyone ever talked much to Aei'Desai btw? Some darn nice people in that guild. I'd personally do backflips for them anytime. Fine players, fine people. I Wonder when it improved so much.....<P>Shout out to my boy Wanyen. (Did I ghetto that right?) <P>Annastacia, Aramiz, Sitten  /sigh<P>Gathu; Not a big surprise to see conflict following someone who loves PVP as much as you do. Always wondered why you don't play full time on a PVP server. Wouldn't think the blue servers would be the place to challenge someone with such self confessed PVP skill as yourself. Or is it that. hmm.  Ah well. Outta my league. Those five times that Teemuu or I ever did PVP just don't match up to your skill.No wait. Teemuu almost took that one didn't he. Guess his four PVP's before that just weren't enough to carry him over the top though.  Hmm. Wonder if I practiced really really hard, I could grow up to be a big strong TROLL like yourself. <P><BR>Silai 'May have just made the undesireable list for IS' Walking<P><BR>P.S. before I see any whiney cry posts about 'you don't know us'. Actually, I do. It's you who don't know me.

Heh you keep telling yourself that Serieux.

I cant keep track of the replies on this thread...<P>To whoever it was who called me a liar about IC stepping aside, then you might want to check with shards, HL, CoV, VS, etc...  We dont bully past.  That is against our guild policy.  But if you fail, and the gm's say fine it's time to let you try, then we try.  And we win.  There's no dispute when we do it.<P>Seemingly when IS does it, they like to train us, or call gm's and say that we trained them.  Heck we wont even be in the zone and we get gm's questioning us.  WTG delaying tactic IS.<P>Nemeweh, what you posted there, if noticed by a GM, is a bannable offense.  I like you, so I suggest you remove it now, before someone points a gm at this thread.  I guarantee you it wont be an IC person.<P>You IS people disgust me.  Dont give us any more excuses.  You were wrong and you KNOW it.  Get off our board and go exploit vindicator.  That was something at least you could do, with 60 people, before the buff stacking nerf, and without annoying everyone else on the server.<P>I cant believe it's come to this... I thought we were friends...<P>Tia

Thank you for reminding me I said that Annastacia. I apologized to Jezza last night after they totally proved me wrong. They agro'd Zland during their CR and got a lot of us killed. They offered to help buff us for our attempt on Zlandicar because of this. Jezza relayed my message on to HL in Guildchat, I'm not sure how they took it, but I didn't get any nasty tells from it. After last night I have a new found respect for HL. <P>P.S. Quit posting on our boards  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> The lies are just so apparent and so out in the open now. Every single sentence that comes out of your mouths is just digging you deeper and deeper, Not to mention complete and total bullshit. Are we posting on your boards? <P>No.<P>So leave, kk thx.<P>--------------------<P>Cobus<BR>60 Warder
