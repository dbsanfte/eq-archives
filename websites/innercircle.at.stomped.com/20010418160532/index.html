I'd rather see 1 white scale and 1 Dragon Hero Bracer and NOTHING else then see the crap junk that they keep dropping.

Gratz Mountain Giant on the Selo's Drum...Gratz Petrified Cock on a couple spells everyones had for 6 months.<br><br>Since LL got the scale, the next logical choice was to pickup some Trak Guts for him.  So we all ran down to this undead bard guy and spawned a WussTrak.  Poor lizard had no chance.  LL got guts, and we all gasped in awe as finally a paladin BP dropped for us.

No.  These guys needed to retire about 15 years ago...wish I had gone to hate instead.  Supposedly it was pretty fun, and Inno dropped fast and easy.  Svensk and Garosjax picked up Ogre Earrings.  Galan got a Barb Belt, and Gahzzzzzzirra grabbed an Icksar Cloak.  Also two Inno Eyes, which I guess are for Wizard epics.<br><br>Friday night: GW Verant<br>Well we had big plans for this night...slaughter like you couldn't imagine.  Instead, we couldn't login, or stay connected if we did.  Apparently, someone got drunk at the fanfaire and peed in the routers.<br>So the mobs were safe for a night.<br><br>Sunday Night:  Zlandicar<br>In my effort to become KOS with every faction in Norrath, we spent a day killing Paebala.  Picked up some silly looking weapons and some nice Shaman junk.  Then we met up with the rest of the guild and went to visit with Zlandicar.  Some dumbass ogre trained him on us the first try, but we picked up the pieces of that mess rather quickly and dropped him easily the next pass.<br>Mariaa picked up the haste cloak Talisman.  Taeil got the heart to help his liching ways.  Learic got some gloves of mortality, which is exactly what a bard needs, since they usually stay alive too long as it is.  Deedlitte picked up the Cracked Claw, which is almost impossible to see in his tiny gnome hands.  Zlands talisman will get turned into a ST key.<br><br>After Zland, we ran upstairs and smacked Neb around to pickup his head, which we'll turn into Zland for a key to meet Jhaled Dar.  Neb is a chump...Kenuvan finally got his head.  Too bad it was from a guy rat. :(</font></td></tr></table><BR><BR><BR><BR>
