We venture into Sleepers and MotG is up again...we've been dropping him quite frequently lately and he hasn't dropped jack, but today he was wielding a Primal Warsword.  I believe we had about 21 people there tonight, one of our larger turnouts, so we tried the sucker out.  Yes I know you're thinking 21 is overkill, but he is pretty tough avatared during the whole fight, flurrying every attack, etc.  So we pull, fight takes awhile, and he's at a sliver of health.  Everyones all happy and ecstatic that he's about to die..he starts running, then BAM, he warps back to his spawn point.  So he summons a few people, we run up, and the thing is full health.  We lose a few key people, but still continue fighting...after about 5 minutes he's very low again and finally falls.  So there we stand next to his corpse, after killing him twice technically, cheering that the fight was finally over.  <br><br>Anyhow enough of my rambling, he did drop a Primal Warsword.  Grats Kenuvan.  <br><br>Once Tawl fixes this screenshot section I can once again go back to daily updates but until then, no dice.</font></td></tr></table><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Veeshan's Peak was cleared for the first time on Xegony, and what a battle the final one was.  The leader of the Ring of Scale, Phara Dar, has to be one of the most awkward fights in the game.  First time trying her she showed us what she had and we got whiped out pretty good, but the second time she came around she did not return home.  Here's some pictures of the dead :<br><br><a href="http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/DeadPhara.jpg">Phara Dar</a><br><a href="http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/DeadPhara2.jpg">Another Phara Dar pic</a><br><br>Here's the winners of the loot off of Phara Dar :<br><br>Kilt walked away with a Sword of Rile, Nurok did as well.  Kenuvan got to remove Phara Dar's claw from her own arm, and Deafoe won the Robe of Azure Sky.  Congrats.<br><br>I'd like to personally thank Kenuvan for a wonderful job pulling there.  This place is definately a zone that takes precise planning and lots of patience.  You don't come by many great players like this one, I'm just very glad he's one of us.  /salute<br><br>Anyways, to end the clearing of VP we started Inner Circle's annual running of the Racnar.  This has to be one of the funniest moments in EQ ever, watching 30 odd people running for the zone, with 10-30 mobs tailing very closely and picking off a few people one by one.  This alone had me laughing for about a half an hour when I zoned out.  Heres a pic for your viewing enjoyment, I didn't get that many mobs because I'm only a druid, if I would have stuck around any longer I'd be paved into the ground.

Now he looks just like a wizard sporting that thing at the local portals.  What a shame :(.<br><br>Next on our list was Xygoz, thx to Kenuvan's l33tness we took him down easy.  Ever seen Learic(bard*_*) tank more then 1 mob in Sebilis?  That's about how fast Xygoz died.  Anyhow the winners were Zendak, Gonain, and Learic.  Zendak got some staff, don't recall the name.
