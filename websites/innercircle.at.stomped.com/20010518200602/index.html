Veeshan's Peak was cleared for the first time on Xegony, and what a battle the final one was.  The leader of the Ring of Scale, Phara Dar, has to be one of the most awkward fights in the game.  First time trying her she showed us what she had and we got whiped out pretty good, but the second time she came around she did not return home.  Here's some pictures of the dead :<br><br><a href="http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/DeadPhara.jpg">Phara Dar</a><br><a href="http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/DeadPhara2.jpg">Another Phara Dar pic</a><br><br>Here's the winners of the loot off of Phara Dar :<br><br>Kilt walked away with a Sword of Rile, Nurok did as well.  Kenuvan got to remove Phara Dar's claw from her own arm, and Deafoe won the Robe of Azure Sky.  Congrats.<br><br>I'd like to personally thank Kenuvan for a wonderful job pulling there.  This place is definately a zone that takes precise planning and lots of patience.  You don't come by many great players like this one, I'm just very glad he's one of us.  /salute<br><br>Anyways, to end the clearing of VP we started Inner Circle's annual running of the Racnar.  This has to be one of the funniest moments in EQ ever, watching 30 odd people running for the zone, with 10-30 mobs tailing very closely and picking off a few people one by one.  This alone had me laughing for about a half an hour when I zoned out.  Heres a pic for your viewing enjoyment, I didn't get that many mobs because I'm only a druid, if I would have stuck around any longer I'd be paved into the ground.

I can just hear the rangers whining more and more, something else to whine about.  Atleast it wont be the same 'ol 'My AC is too low!'.  Anyhow I guess I'll go ahead and announce the winners of the items dropped tonight.  <br><br>Redlance walked away with a Bo Staff of Trarsmang, very sexy!

Congrats to Deafoe on his Shissar Apothic Staff,  Arie on her Shissar Elementalist Cane, and Gonain on his Robe of Burning Rage.  Now he looks just like a wizard sporting that thing at the local portals.  What a shame :(.<br><br>Next on our list was Xygoz, thx to Kenuvan's l33tness we took him down easy.  Ever seen Learic(bard*_*) tank more then 1 mob in Sebilis?  That's about how fast Xygoz died.  Anyhow the winners were Zendak, Gonain, and Learic.  Zendak got some staff, don't recall the name.

Instead, we couldn't login, or stay connected if we did.

Picked up some silly looking weapons and some nice Shaman junk.  Then we met up with the rest of the guild and went to visit with Zlandicar.

Taeil got the heart to help his liching ways.  Learic got some gloves of mortality, which is exactly what a bard needs, since they usually stay alive too long as it is.  Deedlitte picked up the Cracked Claw, which is almost impossible to see in his tiny gnome hands.  Zlands talisman will get turned into a ST key.<br><br>After Zland, we ran upstairs and smacked Neb around to pickup his head, which we'll turn into Zland for a key to meet Jhaled Dar.

Perseverance was the key to this victory.  I can't remember one person who started this adventure and left before victory.  Took us three attempts to get him down.  The third attempt we brought in a few extra people, which surely made the differance.  What a fight oh what a grand fight it was.  Congrats to all winners of the auctions, and to all those that helped to take down the beast.  As always I set up a page with the crappy screenshots I got.  Sorry its hard to get good ones when your fighting for your life.  In the future I want to get screenshots off all the items as well.  Also as always if you want a shot posted then please send it to me.  Anyway great job all this was the first time we took this beast down but it won't be the last.  Kayani is supposed to be sending me a list of the groups, once I have it I'll post the names of people that were there.<br><br><a href="http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/zlandicar.html">http://www.madbbs.com/users/newmanj/zlandicar.html</a><br></font></td></tr></table><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Well there was Temple of veeshan, followed by killing dwarfs.  There was a fear clearing minus CT although we gave him a couple good fights.  Cunnan and Warlor call your isp's and tell them you have a game to play so they better get off there buts and upgrade so you don't go linkdead every fight.  Yesterday the guild helped the gimp midget karym kill the general.  All finally went smoothly this time thanks to the mad pulling skills of Tawl the monkey.  Grats karym on your Epic.  We are looking to take out a couple dragons tonight so with a good showing we will have some better news tomorrow.  No screenshots because I didn't get any good ones and all the people who I asked to send me some didn't, /sigh.
