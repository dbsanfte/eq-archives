Ok let me start this off by saying I honestly do like a lot of people in your guild.<BR>Kenuvan, Yeoman, Aeon, are just a few of many names that come to mind.<P>What I want to open up here first is a little history about me and IC.<P>EQ pre expanion:<P>I started playing this games Mar 16th (no beta) day one of EQ. I worked my way up thru<BR>the ranks of a guild called Aei'Desis. I frequently heard how this so called "Inner Circle"<BR>was this horrible Training, Ninja Looting, etc etc guild. I never really gave it much thought.<P>Then when everyone started hitting 46-50 people started going to Hate. In those days at first everyone pretty much went up there and played together. This is when I was first introduced to your guild.<P>The very first time I saw the guild it was during a Hate Raid, IC zoned in and set up right in front of the pickup raid and just started pulling stuff. Several people asked what was going on and the entire thing was a bitch fest and it was quite unfair that you guys just rolled in there and started pulling everything right there in front of us, it pretty much ended the Hate raid for everyone. I was pissed off that night and it takes a hell of a lot to piss me off, but I just blew it off.<P>During a few weeks span after this incident the world famous Ciny/Lerinya BP incident occured as well as a good RL friend in IS named Tull was also robbed of a bard hate BP. During this time it seemed that a server theme was everyone hated IC (and Destined) because they are blah blah whatever who cares. <P>Many moons passed after this and of course the theme was, if your not in IC you were an IC hater, if you were with them you were Uber and all was good, I guess.. I forgot about you guys.<P>Kunark came out:<P>We all were trying to reach higher levels and it was obvious no one was gonna do anything w/o a good guild. Guilds like Havenlight and CoG/Jux etc grew up and thier general goal (at least from what could see) was to try to catch up to IC w/o<BR>all the rudeness and general obnoxiousness.<P>At some point me and Nem were sitting in Chardok and she got an invite from IC to go on a Chardok Raid, which eventually led to me coming along. One thing led to another and I eventually found Nem, Myself, Fliplotar, Skagz, Durham, and a few other Aei'Desis members that started raiding Trakanon/Chardok with you guys. Aei'Desis leadership had major problems with this and it eventually led to us breaking off and forming a guild called Illuminati Sancti. Our former guild could not even stand the thought of us grouping with you.<P>Time went on and we raided Trak over and over, sometimes as many as 60 people. We were always quiet and was just along for the ride. Well at some point our new guild raided Trak w/o IC and then all hell broke lose. We were slammed with crap like "they used us for strategy" etc. Well the fact is IC never invited any of us along on any raid out of the goodness of thier heart. As cool as Kenuvan and Yeo are, IC as a guild was not just gonna let useless people come along on raids. We tried to get people to come along but to be honest any threat of an class that may need a Trak BP, was rejected, and quite rudely. Also any ELP person that WAS NOT in IC did not get equal chance to go do ELP events like VS, unless they were absolutely needed, like Deafoe and Skagz in the VS example. If it was a VS raid, only our wizes were invited.<P>Finally a breaking point came and after 3 or so IS Trak kills we got the boot from IC, our ELPS wiped. This is fact, People have tried to argue that shit with me but they did not get the absolute rude ass tells I did from IC... "Thanks a lot for using us and stealing our L33T Trak Strat asshole, have fun in your little wannnabe guild, you made the wrong choice" bullshit.<P>After that IS really started to grow.<P>Velious:<P>Vel came out and it looked as if IC was gonna bum rush the Expansion again and take over. We worked hard and recruited to our 60 person model and adopted an ELP system based on your own. A lot of stuff is different but I felt it was the best system to base a point system on at the time. Consider that a compliment because I did look at the DKP system Afterlife was using.<P>We set high standards and basically decided we were gonna be am honorable guild and not step all over people to get to the top. As thing turned out we got some really great players to add to our already tight crew with exceptional strategy minds like Gathu, Endar, Aamr, Annastacia, and the list goes on and on.<P>Suddenly you noticed that we were doing things that even you had never done. This enraged you and it led to them rejecting more people from thier ELP system. It was decided that you had to make a choice, IC or IS.<P>The rat race started and we killed uber mob after uber mob before anyone on Xegony. It started with Velk, then CT, Then Derakor, the Staue of Rallos Zek, Dain, Yellinak. Tempers flared as we raced for ST keys.<P>The Present:<P>AS of late the cheap shots are flying. Cobus started the whole "Well IS stacks buffs thats the only way they killed Derakor 20 times crap" He goes off and tells everyone and thier brother this in some weak ass attempt to make us look bad. If thats the best you can do then I am certain we did everything we ever set out do do as far as being honorable goes.<P>Then guys the rest chime in with well they have 20 clerics and 20 warriors and are aligned with Havenlight and all the other totally rediculus crap. FYI we have 4 full time warriors and 6 total warriors with 0 warrior twinks. WE have 10 clerics max ever and usually run with 6 - 8 on any raid, ever. So think what you want, I have no reason to lie. We have 59 active members and the best raid in our history was 50 people total, so whatever.<P>Sleepers:<P>All I cam say here is both sides obviuosly think they are right. All the tells you guys sent me about you must have lied to the GM and he didn't check the logs and "Learic is gonna Ghetto Train you gimps" just succeeded in pissing me off.<BR>It wasn't two seconds after the thing happened that you guys opened up with the "FUCK YOU" and such crap talk.<P>You guys came to us pitching an alliance a couple months ago only because your people were deguilding left and right. You would never give up anything for us out of respect and IC is WELL KNOWN for never negotiating.<P>Well tonight IS grew up. We are not going to back down and be submissive because you are IC, Kings of Kunrak.<P>If you want to tell me what the hell any of us or anyone on Xegony ever did to deserve the treatment we have gotten from you for 2 and 1/2 years then maybe we can talk about Spawn Sharing, an alliance is out of the question.<P>I have never seen you guys in a postion where you just did not take what you wanted despite fairness but for once tonight you got to reap what you sow.<P>I am a reasonable person but I have reached my limit with the bullshit to be honest. I have so much more to say but I am too tired to go on and I left out a lot of shit. You give me some reasons things have changed with IC, this is far from some prick KSed Emporer Krush from me 2 years ago.<P><BR>PS:<P>What you guys did to Gnost and Endar was FUCKED UP. If you wanna blame Endar with Sleepers tonight then you are barking up the wrong tree, you talk to ME.

Please take your lies elsewhere.  Everybody in IC knows what terrible wrong you guys committed today, and whether you believe it or not, rehashing the same lies to us that you and Nemeweh feed your guild will not suddenly make our members believe you.  Thanks.<P>~Abd

I'm done with eq and all it's bullshit. But please tell me which one of use blamed Endar. As we were busying fighting, we noticed that Endar wasn't fighting. Now, why would he sit away from you while you came over and attacked? Ahh, yes, maybe becuase he zoned in LAST and saw the whole picture more clearly. IC was in there first, made cleric corpses first, buffed up first, and killed the first mobs. Then IS moved up claiming MotG was theirs becuase we got the last two. What the hell is this? We don't demand the next Dain from you becuase you got the last two.<P>We don't want this bullshit here, please leave.

You once considered me one of the good people in IC.<P>What would you think if the only good people in IC were very disapointed in your actions.<P>Nothing at all probably, that shows how much you really respect or like us.<P>we pulled first, we engaged first apon entry to the zone, we cleared the first sentries, we pulled motg and your group did what it intended to do the whole time, take the kill, by mutual agreement or by force, whichever came first.<P>what you have done is the most dispicable of acts that you could have ever done to a friend.<P>Nemeweh had the cajones to say that you deserved this motg because you were as gracious as to LET us have the last one. If i recall you chose Dain, we chose sleepers, you didnt let us have shit.<P>I hope you are glad for what you have done.<P>If you see Kenuvan in game, it's not me because I am finished, after seeing how low you can stoop, i am disgusted to even log into the game.<P>cheers

It is regretable that things have come to this.  Derrick I understand you are angry but some of those things in your post really shouldn't have been dredged up, and I will also admit to spouting off a few things today that I said in anger as well.  Unfortunately, I am still angry but more so calm at this point.<P>I have always wanted IC and IS to play nice together.  Some of you guys helped me a lot in getting my epic and helped IC a lot back in the trak and general days of epic questing.  Those were much funner and better days.<P>Today we are now both in competing guilds, racing to get the most people into ST and accomplish the most in as little time as possible.  This can make the game both more exciting and miserable at the same time.  After Sleepers Tomb today, I fear that IC and IS will now be locked into a vicious cycle.  Yes, today you guys got your way and walked away with the loot, but tomorrow IC will get their way and walk away with the loot.  Then the day after that IS will get their way and walk away with the loot etc etc.  Of course much gloating will ensue by both parties and each IC/IS encounter will end in one group feeling shitty about their day in EQ and the other feeling like they just owned their life long enemy.  But every day the only thing that will remain true is how utterly retarded the whole thing is.<P>I sure do not want to see anymore stupidity come from any of this.  Both of our guilds are filled with its share of adults and we should be able to play nice together.  What happened today was not nice and I don't care who was wrong or who was right, neither guild should ever have to resort to kill stealing a mob to resolve a difference.<P>I am aware of how people are.  I'm sure your members were recieving some nasty, taunt filled tells and I know our members were as well.  Tempers were hot on both sides but we have to learn to keep things under control.  If we can't learn to work things out better than we did today then in the future anytime there is a possible dispute we need to bring in a GM to resolve it.  However we ought to be able to work something out.  I don't know what you guys think is fair on mobs or not but put together a team of people and we will put together a team of people and try to come up with some kind of agreement.  <P>If you think I am making this plea because I am afraid IS will beat us to everything and take all the mobs, you can think again.  You guys have a fire lit under you over this, and so do we and I can assure you when IC is lit up we have a great capacity for getting things done.  I am making this plea because I do not want to play this game as though we are all a bunch of lawless monkies (no offense monks).  We can behave better, but it seems good behavior takes more effort than bad.<P>So the sword is in your scabbard so to speak.  Keep it sheathed, use it against us or carve a better way with it.  Just do me a favor and let me know what you would prefer because I need to know how I should wield mine.<P>Cunnan

Of course, I have to start by noting that I wasn't present during tonight's debacle (thank goodness). But I did witness much of the consternation to which it led, and after reading Derrick's post, I guess I've heard both sides of the story (as if there are ever only two). <P>All I feel at the moment is an overwhelming sadness that the situation between two guilds of people who I like(d) and respect(ed) has degenerated to this state. <P>You know, when it comes down to it, cliche though it may be, it is the people who matter in this game, not the items. Today's treasure is tomorrow's bargain basement special in GFay, after all. I find it so difficult to believe that individuals in IS -- some of whom I genuinely consider(ed) friends -- would act in such a deliberately selfish, thoughtless way, solely out of some vague sense of 'entitlement' that has nursed a silent grudge against IC for what appears to be months. <P>Was it worth it? One primal doohickey: just pixels. Not even pixels; an entry in a database somewhere. <P>Yet for that intangible, you chose to behave in what appears to be a most underhanded, deliberately antagonistic fashion. You betrayed the high standards that you claim were the foundation for your guild; you resorted to behaviour that you *know* you would condemn were it used against yourselves, or someone else. It is, as I have said before, difficult to believe that individuals for whom I have, until now, had the utmost respect would do such a thing. What can I say; I'm a bit of a Pollyanna when it comes to people. I believe the best until I see the worst, but it comes as a shock when it wears a familiar face. <P>I don't doubt that you feel some justification for what you did; it's clear, from Derrick's post, that this represented some sort of rite of passage for your guild, rather than what it really was, the act of an antisocial group functioning purely on mob mentality. (No pun intended. I'm not in a punny mood.) <P>But I just couldn't help but post here, on the off chance that some amongst you might see this from my perspective. (And apologies to IC for using your board to prolong what is undoubtedly an unwelcome memory of a painful incident.) <P>"It's just a game," you say. "Why is she being such a drama queen?" <P>Well, perhaps you're right. But when I see my friends hurt -- some to the point that they finally throw down their mouse and /quit out for good -- when I see my friends so frustrated, so disappointed, so genuinely angry over a situation like this -- it seems like more. And that, again, is not about the 'phat loot.' It's about the people. Hell, I barely play anymore, but I still consider many of the people involved in this sorry affair my friends. <P>Anyway, I don't want to ramble, and it's doubtful that you will even read this, but I just couldn't let it pass without adding my comments. You may believe that you have come of age tonight, although why such an ugly event would represent some sort of apex remains a mystery to me. <P>But remember, there is no lasting glory in clawing your way to some arbitrary 'top' of the theoretical 'heap' that is the always undefineable and happily chaotic Xegony population at large. There is no prize for 'winning' this game, and when all is said and done, it's not going to be the loot that you remember when you think back on your EQ days. It's the time you spent playing a game you enjoyed, and it's the people you met -- and it's the feeling of quiet satisfaction that you get from knowing that you don't have to be ashamed of how you conducted yourself along the way. <P>What goes around comes around, <BR>And that is not a promise, nor a threat, but simply the way of the world. <P>Kady<BR>Semi-retired Enchanter Girl<BR>Disappointed.

first of all you cant kill fuckin motg without slow. without a bard puretoning and occlusioning you got no chance, especially since you cant use 7000 hp tanks anymore. seeing as how elumino never participated in the fight should be proof enough you guys had no business fighting our mob.  seeing as how endar wasnt healing, shows you had no business fighting our mob. seeing as how you all ran over to hit our mob and not vice versa should be proof you guys had no business fighting our mob.  derrick, i dont fucking care about your life story with aei'desis/ic.  i dont care what you did or how you got your guild to what it is today. there were members in IS id shave my right testicle off to give if you needed, bu tfuck that now.  you wont ally with ic, fine no problem.  you race ic to mobs, fine no problem.  when you run past us to pull shit and then ks, thats when you got issues.  big fucking GHETTO issues.  i aint saying im training, but you can be damn sure ill be exploring whenever you in st from now on bitch.  you fucked over the wrong black man on this one. i like to see zones and great fights like the next man, ill just make it a point to watch your strategies a lil more closer. maybe see if some friends in the zone want to watch your fight with me.  you got some audacity to come to ic public boards to make a post like this.  fuck you and your history.  your future starts with LL today, and its shitty. I hope sharfeer loves that primal weapon of his. its the last youll see easily if i got anything to do with it, you fuck me i take it personal.  we got members taking extended breaks for this fucking bitch move you pulled today, and for that i take it personal.  you coming here talking about the ghetto trains youre gonna get from me, when i only announced it in a private rant makes my privacy breached and for that i take it personal.  but what i do in eq here on out is strictly business, not personal.<P>LL

Wow, you must be watching the boards like a hawk Derrick to refute all we say!  I step off the IC page for a couple minutes and you are back.  Since you persist...<P>Now, I don't know why you deem yourself fit to stuff words into my mouth, but I never said that IC was perfect.  Being a human organization with humans in it, we will make mistakes from time to time.  Yes, our guild has made mistakes in the past.  But you see, people have this wonderful ability to *change*.  What one member did 18 months ago does not mean that the entire guild is evil and must be punished.  That holds true especially if the member in question regrets whatever he or she did wrong in a genuine fashion.  It is nice to know that you are incapable of forgiving and forgetting.<P>That said, I'll again return to the ST incident today.  I don't know what rulebook you play by, but when I last checked (and I could be wrong, someone correct me if I am), Vedan's ruling was that the people who arrive with a suitable force first and prepare to attack first receive the contested spawn.  Now, as for ST today, I don't see what "first" you guys had.  We had the first member in the zone today (As Nemeweh even admitted in tells to Arie), we had the first COMPLETE force there (sorry, telling us you are waiting for a rogue in WL and Fliplotar to return from linkdeath, whenever that would be, does not constitute a complete force), we buffed before you, we pulled the first two sentries before your members were ready, at which point you guys decided it would be cool to run past us.  You guys then attacked a sentry, and Nemeweh died, and the evil IC empire's cleric Syndi ressed her (because we thought maybe we could work this out peacefully and had some faith in your decency).  We then moved into the courtyard FIRST, and you guys followed us in. In an order I don't recall, both sides pulled the remaining wanderers necessary to pull the MotG.  At this point, you took Annastacia up to the MotG to check whether it had a piece of primal or not, and upon seeing that it had a Warsword, you guys decided that you deserved it.  At this point you reinforced your idea that you DESERVE this MotG because we got the last two (even though our two had no primal and yours did, and you guys lost the last one because you WILLINGLY CHOSE TO DO DAIN INSTEAD).  At this point, Cunnan attempted to negotiate with you guys, still on the assumption that you were decent human beings who would choose to do the right thing in the end, rather than be dirty thieves.  At this point, while you guys stalled Cunnan, you formed up a KS group of 3 rogues  to attack the MotG when we pulled him, knowing full well that your 3 rogues would be able to outdamage our 1 rogue (one instance where a zerg rush does ya good buddy).  The tension kept building, and eventually you guys threw down an ultimatum that we had 5 minutes to clear one roamer and pull the MotG or you "had rights to him."  Now, maybe I am ignorant, so help me out here...  If we had ALL OF THE FIRST EFFORTS NEEDED TO CLAIM THE ZONE, then why do you have the right to dictate terms to us?  No, wait, you don't.  You guys then proceeded to countdown for us, and Sitten (played by Gathu I'm sure) did a nice job counting from 5 minutes to 2 minutes remaining in the course of one minute.  Additionally, I'm sure you guys knew full well that 5 minutes was only a realistic figure if everybody was fully buffed and prepared to the fight -- while we indeed were, I don't doubt that you guys were banking on your "fair ultimatum" being unreasonable.  Nevertheless, Cunnan went to pull the MotG, at which point a roamer warped on to him that he did not see while pulling.  So he brought it down and died away from the two groups, and while the MotG went right home, the roamer continued to path over towards you guys and attack you (This is where you lie and say that Cunnan trained both the MotG AND The Progenitor on you!  Unbelievable!  Don't thank me, only trying to help out.).  Upon noticing that the roamer pathed over to you, we went over and helped you guys fight it (despite that it would waste mana on our closing "fair window of attack") because we knew that it was an accident, and because we don't play those dirty games (like you guys do!).  At this point, Cunnan went off to pull the MotG to us, so that we could rightfully take the MoB that we legally fought to.  However, you guys immediately engaged the mob with your KS group, allowing us to tank for you, while at the same time turning this fight into one nice mess.  Now, before you go on with the lies you fed the GM about how IC was unprepared for the MotG and you guys were ready to go, please explain to me how you planned to kill him with Sitten having the only defensive discipline up, and Fliplotar's and Stefanie's about 7 minutes away.  Added to this, your bard and one of your 3 clerics were refusing to participate in the MotG fight because they disagreed with IS's Operation:KillSteal.  The loss of Elumino and Endar, coupled with only *1* defensive discipline up, would make the fight impossible for you.  Yet, you still engaged after we did, claiming that Sharfeer had pulled the mob.  Well, couple problems with this.  Not only is it illogical to pull a mob you know you are incapable of killing (Please don't try and tell me you could handle him in the state you were in at the time, you know as well as everyone else here that you could NOT), but when the GM arrived, your stories were inconsistent.  At first, Sharfeer claimed that he attacked the MotG with a bow, was CoHed away, and then Cunnan came up and stole the pull.  Now, as I'm sure you masters of Everquest know, when the MotG has nobody on his hate list, and picks up his first person, he shouts "You will not pass this point."  As I'm sure we can all agree (Even though I wouldn't be surprised if you lie about this too), the MotG only shouted this message ONCE.  So, let us assume for a moment that Sharfeer did indeed attack the MotG first, and Cunnan did indeed try to steal it off him.  This would mean that the MotG would have given the "You shall not pass" message once for Sharfeer, and quite possibly a summoning SINCE YOU CLAIM HE ATTACKED WITH A BOW, and then when he got a CoH and was off the list, and then Cunnan ran up and attacked it, the message would have been given again.  Yet, he only said it once... Alright, so maybe Cunnan was on the list at the same time as Sharfeer was CoHed... Then please explain why you would CoH the puller?  Last time I checked, the purpose of a puller was to PULL a mob, not get attacked, spend a reagent and mana on a CoH, so that the warrior can then run up later and attack it at its home point...  So now you tell me that Sharfeer was gonna go up, shoot it, run back down (hoping he didn't do damage I guess?) and then get a CoH while Sitten pulled it off in the center of the courtyard... So then big bad Cunnan runs up to the MoB right as Sharfeer shoots it, and starts running back to us... But Cunnan was never summoned!  That means no damage was done... And if no damage was done, that means Cunnan had to have gotten close enough to taunt it... But what, that would mean he had to take damage, and he had not been hit by the time he arrived at our group!  Whoops, sounds more like your story has holes.  Which is probably why Sitten (Gathu) started yelling at Sharfeer to shut up when the GM arrived, and Sitten then changed the story TOTALLY to say that he had run up and pulled it himself, and Cunnan pulled it off... Explain then why the mob only went right, to our direction, and never for ONE SECOND went left to you?  Oh, probably because Cunnan was the first to initiate a pull.  Oh, and if you guys really did attack it first... Why did Sharfeer and Sitten have TOTALLY different stories to tell, and why did some of your members admit that Cunnan had the pull first?  Oops, probably because he did have the pull first.  So again Derrick, please take your lying elsewhere.  Everybody here knows what is up.  You don't fool any of our members.  I hope the Primal Warsword was worth it to you.  I hope the loss of your "friend" (Read, tool for "revenge" on IC) Endar is negated by the Primal Warsword that Sharfeer looted while the GM had not yet resolved this issue.  Then again, it probably is, becuase now Gathu can play the account without having to worry about Endar's ethical and moral standards, which are obviously worlds above yours.  You not only destroyed what respect IC had left for IS, but you managed to upset one of Xegony's nicest players into quitting because he couldn't believe what happened.<P>Now Derrick, I know this may be hard for you to grasp.  People do not always believe it when you lie.  The GM might have, but we don't.  We all know how much you hate Inner Circle, and we now know that you cling to a grudge worse than a kindergartener who lost his teddy bear.  In fact, I am willing to bet that your hatred of IC really stems from the time Bakk trained you in Sebilis at Gruplinort.  You know, THE ONE WHERE YOU STOLE HIS CAMP AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE GROUP THERE.  And while we're on the topic of your non ST related quirks, I'd like to question your denial of buff stacking and never having a raid attendance of over 50.  Yelinak is a really nice example of this.  Today we counted by hand the number of IS attacking Yelinak, and the count was 54.  This was before you charged, so it very well could have gone up.  Even though I know that you guys have stacked buffs illegally on your raids (If you don't want us to keep knowing this, telling Gathu to not brag about it would be a good idea), and even though I know you have had raids over 54 before, I'll pretend I don't know these things.  Please explain to me then why on your two Yelinak kills, BEFORE THE BUFF STACKING FIX, you guys killed him so easily, yet after it, you guys have now less 9 consecutive times?  More maybe, I'm sure we missed a wipe out somewhere.  So, if we know for a fact that you had at least 54 on your raids (plural!) today that wiped out, and Yelinak *still* lives, which is it Derrick?  Did the buff stacking fix make it too hard for you supposedly ALWAYS sub 50 raids, or did you just bring less people?  Are you used to killing Yelinak with 54, or do you bring 62-66 and zerg rush him, always nearly wiping out like I am told?  And since you're bringing only 54 now, he gives you a hard time?  Or are we making the usual fare of excuses, heals that don't land, bad seeded rolls for the ENTIRE raid!  /shrug<P>Oh, and by the way, contrary to what you think, VS did NOT give ELP points.  There was a reason for this, and that reason was because we didn't really need a well balaned army for him, just people who could riposte and wizards.  Thanks for playing though.<P>Lots of love,<BR>Abdazen<p>[ 06-03-2001: Message edited by: Abdazen Firecaller ]

What it really comes down to is this.<P>There have been several instances of both IC and IS going after the same mobs (most recently Klandicar twice).  Both guilds went for that mob, but in both cases, IC had more people in zone.  So, both times we stood down and chose something else.  <P>Now today, we decide to go to sleepers post patch.  We start zoning people in, and it starts out with two IC and one IS, then more poeple zone in, and IS obviously has more people (examples: IS 6 IC 3, then IS 10, IC 6, and so on til it was basically IS 15, IC 10).  In this scenario, had roles been reversed, IS would have backed down because IC had numbers.  But IC in no way would consider returning the respect we had given them in the past.  And charged ahead. <P>It should have never gotten to the point that both groups were in the motg room.  All we ask is that you return the same amount of respect to us, as we do to you.  I would hope that in the future, both IS and IC would be willing to do this, when numbers are as obvious as they were tonite (and were for both Klandicars).<P>Megdailie

No.<P>There's a difference between Klandicar and Motg. Motg is doable with 9 people, or less. We ourselves did him with 9.<P>Klandicar takes more people. When you came to us in WW we had nearly 3 full groups, you had one group just zoning in, unbuffed etc. You didn't back down and "get screwed," we just had what it took, and a lot more then you. You yourself said something like, "jeez, you guys must have camped here," becuase you were suprised at how many we has, and how fast we moved. Don't bend facts to make yourself look good. Yes, you did leave, but we were clearly there first and ready to go.<P>[edit] You had more numbers, but you didn't have the right classes. 10 warriors and 1 cleric can't kill MotG.<P>gnome   <IMG SRC="redface.gif" border="0"><p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Zendak ]

Kady, not all of us were out for vengence.  If we had had intents of rolling over anyone, we would not have taken over an hour and a half.<P>Abdazen, Thank you for providing the story from your side.  Though, some of your statements seem a bit foggy, I can understand that all the excitement kinda knocks memory around.  <P>Elumino saw MOTG agrod when we entered the room, the only thing I can assume from that is redlance kicking MOTG to see if it slashes.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">   Which only makes sense to do.<P>I did not go up and hit him until after cunnan had offed nem the next two motg's for this one.    Seemed kinda fishy.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Since you so openly admit to playing two characters that are not yours I will explain our difficulty at Yelinak the last (4, thank you) losses.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">   We have had 20 characters, or more, played by 10 people.  Wednesday and Thursday are down days for us.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">   We assure you he will be dead come monday night (our best turnout night) at the latest.  Your desire to make note of our people (48 guild were there when I logged on tonight, not sure if we had 6 non-guild or not :P) is appreciated.<P>As Meg stated, we have backed off before you have had suitable amounts to kill said mob twice in a row now, out of respect for our fellow guild.   Frankly, with the amount of damage you all had today vs a mob that flurries as much as he does (via having primal equipped), it would be arguable at best that he could be killed with 10 people.<P>I was not personally there for the latter half of the event today, and feel bad for both sides quite honestly.  No one can come out of this feeling good.   I am ashamed by the vengeful attitude displayed by some members, but frankly when you take a look at Learic's post I'm sure you can understand the defensive aggressive nature of a few of IS's members who have been 'wronged' more than others.<P>In other words, you may state that IC has moved on to becoming a gentler, more peaceful entity but 'I hope sharfeer loves that primal weapon of his. its the last youll see easily if i got anything to do with it, you fuck me i take it personal' and 'We don't KS from respectable guilds like BT   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> We do that shit to havenlight because we hate them' lead us to think otherwise.   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>I don't personally hold any grudges with people from IC.  Like I said, I was not there for the actual fight today, and told my friend to do whatever Nemeweh told him to do.   I am sad that some people have felt so poor about this situation that they feel like quitting.<P>Last but not least, camping one person in each of the major spots cannot claim you that spawn.   Coming up with an acceptable solution to this would benefit BOTH of our guilds.   In the past we have backed down because of a very few amount of people in a specific zone on your part, but you cannot honestly expect us to continue like that... or we will just do the same thing (and what is the fun of sitting and waiting for a mob to spawn -- then siting and waiting for a guild to spawn. :P)<P>p.s.  Kenuvan, have you ever fought MOTG with primal with 10?  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">   He's harder!  Flurry lots!<P>p.s.s.  10 warriors, 1 cleric?  derrr? :P<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Annastacia ]

Both guilds went for that mob, but in both cases, IC had more people in zone.  So, both times we stood down and chose something else.  <P>Now today, we decide to go to sleepers post patch.  We start zoning people in, and it starts out with two IC and one IS, then more poeple zone in, and IS obviously has more people (examples: IS 6 IC 3, then IS 10, IC 6, and so on til it was basically IS 15, IC 10).  In this scenario, had roles been reversed, IS would have backed down because IC had numbers.  But IC in no way would consider returning the respect we had given them in the past.  And charged ahead. <P>It should have never gotten to the point that both groups were in the motg room.  All we ask is that you return the same amount of respect to us, as we do to you.  I would hope that in the future, both IS and IC would be willing to do this, when numbers are as obvious as they were tonite (and were for both Klandicars).<P>Megdailie</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>megdailie, as much as ive chatted with you in the past and have been cordial with you, i regret to tell you to shut the fuck up.  go to the bard boards and request more information on how to kill yelinek now with no hp stacking buffs. if you havent been inside ST, you got no idea what the fuck youre talking bout, so please again shut the fuck up. know your role and sing manasong.  from now on itll always be 15 + 1 on your st raids.  that +1 is me in your rear view window. fuck you 13 bitches. *pause* shout out to my dog endar, and elumino for doing the right thing.<P>LL

Oh, and in case you didn't know, they botched the stacking patch.  Focus and Kragg are an incredibly buggy combo, and I still know of multiple ways to get them to stack - if I wanted to.<P>But we don't rely on that sort of thing, so that's nice and moot.<P>Oh!  As for the Yelinak thing...Abdazen, you did know Yelinak was upgraded a bit last patch?  His mana dot is far more potent now.  Methinks that mixed with far less actual people there had a bit more of an effect on us than a nerf to something we don't really use that didn't even actually nerf it?<P>You'd be amazed how many ways there are to stack focus and kragg...half the time, you can quite honestly do it by accident (lower level shaman does kraggs on priests, priests have certain other spells up, ask for focus because their elven asses are encumbered...boom, grats stack.  There's more than one buff that causes that to happen, and some of them are actually quite commonly used.)<P>What was nerfed was actually something I'm HAPPY to see go.  For those of you curious, though I'm sure this tangent has bored some of you to tears by now, it was malo being overwritten by endure fire, shielding (that's the one that some people exploited), and maybe DMF, have yet to test that, shrug.  Combined with the increase in potency of resist debuffs in pvp, and someone who duels as much as I do is actually happy with said change.=p<P>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Gathu ]<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Gathu ]

You are STILL avoiding the main points of my arguement.<P>Who blamed Endar, why did he not fight for you, hmm?<P>We never said we deserve MotG becuase I was the first one there. We said we deserved it because we 1) made cleric corpses first, 2) buffed first, 3) we attacked first sentries. Us having the first member there was just another 1st. You, on the other hand say you deserve it becuase we had the last two MotG.<P>You also say you we were ready to go, then why the hell did you sit around waiting if we were there, and you KNEW we wanted MotG too?<P>I'm sure you realized my 10 warrior 1 cleric example as an exageration, but realize what I meant before you make fun of it.<P>As for never fighting a MotG with primal, well we did today. We tanked him for you, we slowed him for you, all you did was sit on his back and proceed to get the kill. We sure as hell were ready to kill him with what we had. But you on the other hand, how many times did you fail killing him at first with over 12?

*watches gathu dig himself into a hole*.... <P>*smirk*<P>The fact of the matter is, our main tanks don't have room in their buffs for stacking.   Flat out.    I don't even know how he gets in an extra kragg on sitten, and frankly I don't know why.  When we kill a mob like dain with 38 or 40 people and lose 5 or 6, it is not 380 hp making a difference.<P>Lixie, on the other hand, is the exception.

"You, on the other hand say you deserve it becuase we had the last two MotG."<P>If Nem said that, take it up with her.  I don't believe that, and neither does the majority of people.  If anything it was a high emotion mistake.  As Abdazen said, we are all human here.<P>"You also say you we were ready to go, then why the hell did you sit around waiting if we were there, and you KNEW we wanted MotG too?"<P>We were ready to go before 5 CST (when i left).   Why didn't we?  Because we didn't want to run over people.   Damn is that too hard to get?   Trust me, we would have rather come to a conclusion than force one.  At least most of us would.<P>As for losing to him previously, Gathu said he was 100% mr... we had not killed him with slow. :P   We will now though, thanks.  Try him without slow next time, he hurts.  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>And the 10 warrior thing... I knew you were joking... so was I. :P<P>And for lurking here?  Why?  Cuz I care.  If none of us cared, including derrick, we would've said "fuck that... we got what we deserved bwhahwaha" and had been on with it.<P>Take it as you will.

You didn't want to run over people?? Then please explain what the hell happened when you ran ahead of us after we killed the first two sentries? What about your cleric corpse(s), those had not/just been made, how were your clerics totally ready? You ran ahead of us after Endar and Zipper zoned in too. Not wanting to run over us was the last thing in your mind, as Meg clearly pointed out.<P>And what about Sharfeer's change in story, soon as the GM got there he refused to say anything.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Zendak ]

woah, I tried, but I can't stay away from this one.  What is that bullshit about "just along for the ride" derrick?  When you all left Aes'whatever, Flip used to give me tells 24/7 about how a few of you finally realized that Allistair and Shitbag were assholes and they were the only reason you guys didn't hang out with us.  Then he goes on to tell me how you guys were gonna start your own guild and wanted to come to all our events whenever we needed people. blah blah blah whatever, you were basically on our dicks.  was all good though, flip was pretty cool guy, and i thought you were too derrick.  so anyway, time goes on and you and your 8 or so guildmates become locals at trak raids and epic quests.  then i guess it must have been greed or something that set in.  you decided you didn't want to wait for your trak loots, you decided you'd rather recruit a ton of people like some other guild that seems to have crumbled.  then you used the trak strategies that we taught you first hand and decided to go head to head on trak spawns against us.  you wonder why we would ever be upset or you would be wiped of ELPs?(not sure if this really happened, but i hope it did) as much as i would love to, i can't comment any further because that's about the time when i left this evil evil game.  it's good to see that all of your pleasant hellos and tells were all bullshit attempts at getting on raids with the future plan to fukk us over though, thanks bud.  just remember who took you to all the fun places when you were a pathetic little rabble.  i mean, i know i don't play the game anymore.... but wow   <IMG SRC="eek.gif" border="0"><p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Diggs ]<P>--------------------<P>the real diggs shadey

Cobus, that was in reply to Abdazen's post, mainly.  The heart of my reply was above that, which I then deleted because it was just a useless flame.  I guess I'll post my take on the issue.<P>Welp, here you go.<P>Finally, I'll tell you our side of the story straight up, leaving out all personal comments about people.<P>IC arrived in ST first with a negligable force (2 or so).  IS arrived soon after, and numbers remained roughly equal, with IS having a bit of an edge.  IS had the people to handle motg, and IC was currently at a dubious line (you guys fight with slow, so an avatar'd motg is harder...we don't, so can freely dispell).<P>IC pulled the first two ancient golems, and slowly killed them.  IC equated this with a claim to the zone, whereas we equated it with well...killing two ancient golems.<P>Both groups moved up, we pulled an ancient sentry which Nemeweh died to in the course of the fight.  Syndi was apparently kind enough to res her, which explains that to me now, heh. I was really wondering there, we had two other clerics present, neither of whom had did it.=p  Anyhow.<P>After that, both groups moved up to the foyer, IS on the left, IC on the right.  There was a long standoff, as tells were exchanged trying to work something out.  Cunnan made an offer of IS can have next two motgs if we let them have this one.<P>Sadly, this was interpreted as him trying to trick us, as soon as we found out motg was slashing.  There was a bit of anger at it.<P>Tells go back and forth, some polite, some not so polite.  People begin speculating that IC is just delaying to get more people, and can't do motg with who they have.  So after a few more minutes of tells, we give you guys 5 minutes to pull motg without our interference.<P>[Thu May 31 18:16:56 2001] Vaedar shouts, 'You guys have 5 mins to pull the mob'<BR>The warning.<BR>[Thu May 31 18:22:03 2001] Sharfeer tells the guild, 'pulling'<BR>Time up...we were actually timing it.<BR>[Thu May 31 18:23:47 2001] Master of the Guard shouts 'You will not pass this point <BR>Cunnan tries to pull after 6 minutes and 51 seconds.<BR>[Thu May 31 18:26:07 2001] an ancient sentry has been slain by Zipper!<BR>The add Cunnan aggro'd dies.<P>[Thu May 31 18:31:06 2001] Master of the Guard shouts 'You will not pass this point<BR>14 minutes and 10 seconds after said 5 minutes, Sharfeer pulls motg.   <BR>[Thu May 31 18:31:17 2001] Annastacia tells the guild, 'they stole'<BR>[Thu May 31 18:31:19 2001] Fliplotar tells the guild, 'cunnan has him'<BR>[Thu May 31 18:31:25 2001] Sharfeer tells the guild, 'WTF'<BR>[Thu May 31 18:31:25 2001] Annastacia tells the guild, 'take him?'<BR>[Thu May 31 18:31:27 2001] Sharfeer tells the guild, 'Ipulled'<BR>Cunnan aggros motg.<BR>[Thu May 31 18:34:06 2001] Master of the Guard has been slain by Vaedar!<BR>Motg dies.<P>After this, 15 minutes of talking to a guides goes on.  After another few minutes, Sharfeer is given permission by the guide to loot the primal, so that it doesn't rot.<P>A GM-Admin is called in, and after investigating the situation, declares the Sharfeer can keep the primal.  Sharfeer originally looted it with the knowledge that if it was unjustly looted, a GM-Admin COULD transfer it.<P>In summary...you killed the first couple sentries, we killed the next couple, we both tried to pull motg at the same time, and fought him at the same time.  We ended up getting the kill, and did NOT just ninja the thing.  We held the corpse there for ages with the primal just sitting on it before the guide gave Sharfeer the goahead to loot.<P>Both sides believed they were in the right.  It just so happens that in this case, the Guides and GMs believed we were in the right as well.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Gathu ]

Explain to me, Gathu, how MotG stayed on Cunnan the whole time, having a huge lead on him? Oh yeah, Sharfeer's was CoH'd, and THEN Cunnan pulled. Then why did MotG only shout once? Becuase he was only agro'd once, by Cunnan. <P>You also claim MotG is hard unslowed, yes he is, as is prog, but don't tell me you can kill him with only one defensive.

Defensive lasts around 3 minutes.  It takes us roughly 3 and a half minutes to kill him.  There are also ways to get around not having defensive, you know, just requires good aggro control.<P>I don't get where the CoH thing came from.  I think that was just someone saying something for no real reason...because to the best of my knowledge, Sharfeer was NOT CoH'd.  What I believe happened is Sharfeer aggro'd with bow, Cunnan aggro'd with proximity, Sharfeer headed towards us, expecting motg to be following him, but motg turned towards Cunnan, and Sharfeer went out of memory range (very easy to do while pulling in st due to the huge size of everything).<P>Oh, and if I am wrong, and he was CoH'd...then this still works.  Sharfeer aggros with bow, Cunnan with proximity, Sharfeer heads towards us and gets CoH'd.  Motg is never not aggro on someone, so doesn't reshout.  I don't think he got CoH'd, but if he did, it wouldn't really matter for that particular thing.<P>Oh, and to Abdazen I think it was who asked why he didn't summon...you have to do a fair bit of damage to make a mob summon.  More than one shot of a bow, at least.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Gathu ]

I wasnt there for 2 reasons: 1)no key and 2)I was working.  At this stage in the game I'm glad of both reasons.<P>I'm not gonna post my logic as to who should have 1st rights to MOTG or even the zone or any spawn for that matter because my opinion is based soley on RESPECT for other people where as it appears that the the general consensus is that the right to "claim" is based on numbers and strategy as opposed to decency.<P>The BS that was brought to this board, 90% of it having nothing to do with the issue at hand, saddens me.  I will never understand why people go out of thier way to intentionally hurt other people. I mean does it feel good to know that someone is leaving the game because they absolutely hate you?  Does it make you feel better about yourself and the hateful things you did today to bring up something that happened a year and a half ago and has long since been forgotten?<BR>Someone told me once that people emphasize other peoples faults to make themselves feel better about being insignifcant.<P>In closing, I wasnt there BUT, Im hurt to find out that what friends I do have in IS have no concern for how I might feel....this was displayed by the total lack of respect shown to my "family" tonight.  You hurt them you hurt me.<P>And btw, Ciny is an incredible person and an awesome friend and that was a really lame attempt at clouding the issues at her expense.  Congratulations you've earned the big fat FUCK OFF award!

Wow...  My small opinions...<P>a) whether or not sharfeer or cunnan pulled, since sharfeer admitted he got coh'd, that means he loses aggro.  Therefore Cunnan became the puller, and the IS team loses the rights to the pull.  If you wanted to have it legitimately, then you could have pulled it the way we do, thereby avoiding any aggro confusion.<P>b)  It is well known, and in this thread gathu admitted, that IS takes advantage of illegal buff stacking, coh'ing and mob parking techniques.  Fine and good for you.  WTG take advantage of shortcuts.  And no, IC has NEVER done buff stacking, except to figure out how YOU, IS, did it!<P>c)  regardless, IC had the force, got there, did the work and was ready.  AND for god sakes RES'D some of you people!  WTF is wrong with you?  IC helps you out and then you RUN OVER US?<P>That's basically it for me as far as IS is concerned.  I used to have some respect for you as a guild.  And this bit about you backing down before us is BS.  We've been far more polite to you over spawns than you have to us.  We even get along with HL better than you.<P>Aside from maybe 2 people in IS I will give you a blanket definitiion...<P>You bunch of arrogant selfish jerks obsessed with pixels with no respect for other human beings.<P>It means nothing here, and I wish you'd get off our board.  Nothing you can say will forgive what you did tonight.<P>Tia<P>--------------------<P> <IMG SRC="http://innercircle.at.stomped.com/images/tisig62.jpg">

If you're going to post logs, post all of them and indicate which prove your point, don't just cut the favorable ones, leaving out other info.<P>As for the pull itself, Cunnan was seen at the pull spot, and Sharfeer rushed up. What happened next is easily argued both ways, no real way to prove who actually agro'd. Cunnan was up there before Sharfeer, if Sharfeer didn't see this, or the rest of IS, they are blind. If Sharfeer really did pull it, I don't see how it took him 19 seconds to figure out he had lost agro, with guild tells telling him, and his knowledge of Cunnan's location. What is more likely is Cunnan pulled with agro, then Sharfeer shot with his bow, doing little dmg to get agro off Cunnan, or missing the shot completely. Again, this is very argueable for both sides, but what is clear is Cunnan was seen about to pull, and Sharfeer rushed up and tried to pull quickly. IS knew we were about to pull and they tried to gank it before we did.<P>And as for the 5 minutes, you yourself knew it isn't possible to pull the roamer, redo some buffs, get fm. It was a simple plot to try and rush us so we'd fuck up and die. The few parts of your logs that you showed, claim that Sharfeer pulled 14 minutes after. Cunnan was ready to pull, Sharfeer just ran up at the last minute when IS saw Cunnan in position. 5 minutes was simply a trap. No way you could meet it, it took you 10 minutes after it was supposed to be "your turn." You yourselves didn't meet your limit. <P>Fact is simple, you set an unfair time limit, which you yourself couldn't meet, why did you even get that option? You all saw Cunnan ready to pull and ran up there trying to steal it. You weren't ready, don't try and change that with "you can do this by doing so and so." 2/3 warriors had used defensive for sure, and God knows what mana or buffs you had.<P>Again, many gaps is logs, please post all of them.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Zendak ]

Oh, little delays, like say...Cunnan's pull attacking us while we were already fighting a mob, forcing our warriors to use their discs, and clerics to manadump?<P>It was accidental, sure, but we'd've been ready a good bit sooner without that cute little trained sentry.

Wow, the IC propaganda machine is working overtime on this one.  I especially like that post on xegony.net, good stuff lol.<P>But on to other things now.  First, Abdazen about that whole thing of shooting an arrow.  Do you understand that for a mob to summon a person, a person must either do a percentage or set amount of dmg to it for it to start to summon?  Last time I checked you could shoot an arrow at a summoning mob just fine and he won't summon you due to the small if any dmg you would do.  Second, you understand a lot of stuff has a proximity based agro correct?  For example the Drolvargs in Karnor Castle that many of us have come to love pulling since they do not like to follow the puller if someone gets close.  In this case Sharfeer shoots the MotG and hauls ass back to the group where Cunnan got close and he got agro of course  and then the MotG followed him to his group.  Simple to understand right?  Cunnan took Sharfs pull.<P>And all these posts saying how IC is so honorable, do most of you wear blinders at your raids?  Everytime you do something, whether it be KS or run past someone, I hear from friends that people in IC are saying they are sorry and think it was wrong of the guild to do yet you come here and talk all this bullshit about honor.  And in almost every single encounter with another guild, IC makes up their rules of how it should be handled to make it fit the situation in thier favor and if by god, it doesn't, all hell breaks lose as it did in ST.  You all should realize the world does not revolve around you, that when you are not right you should just deal with it and back off instead of making up all kinds of stories and lies.  And I really love how you always try to scare people with your threats of training them, that's just classic....oh, and very honorable too lol.<P>And lastly, instead of trying to make up reasons why other guilds can kill things that you can't, kill them yourself.<P>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Kumdar ]<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Kumdar ]

We aren't telling people that we're honary people. We don't go around doing that. IC has done some things in the past, but don't think IS are angels either. As for the shit on xeg.net, it may be one of us, it may be one of you. If you remember, TWB hounded IC for months, he posts one thing about you and you assume it's us. Look what you did tonight, I don't care what side you're on, it was a bad thing.<P>Oh, and Kumdar, don't comment on what you think actually happened in there, becuase you weren't there.<p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Zendak ]

See, that's the whole issue right there Zendak, because IC didn't get what they wanted they start spewing the lies and stories.  <P>But you are right about one thing, I wasn't there and I am without a doubt not in your league when it comes to making up stories.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR>Tiane - That's basically it for me as far as IS is concerned. I used to have some respect for you as a guild. And this bit about you backing down before us is BS. We've been far more polite to you over spawns than you have to us. We even get along with HL better than you.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I love this line.  First off, help me out here, when exactly did IC back off anyone?  Please, an example.  And the thing about HL, that's classic.  I don't think I can even recall how many times you ran them over or snuck by them and forced them out of a spawn.  Hum, an early trak raid long ago comes into mind.  We where making our way down to trak, was about to start pulling from beyond the door at jugs when guess who shows up, IC telling us to get outta the way.  Because you had a full force of 6 groups and we only had 3, as we usually did, then set up a quick CoH team to bring the rest down. You felt you could just run right by us.  And Kenuvan made the comment of how basically you had enough and we did not in his mind, so IC had every right to run us over.  So now, help me out here, how is this being polite, hum?<P>And is this how it works for IC?  If a group of people let's you run over them that you have respect for them?  Wake up,<I>Welcome to the real world.</I><p>[ 06-01-2001: Message edited by: Kumdar ]
