- Azeraphel</big></font><br>
<br>
10. You have ever been brutally killed by what they call &quot;yard trash&quot;.<font size="3"></p>

<p>9. When your friends buff you, you're the terror of the newbie zone.</p>

<p>8. When you ask to group with them, they say, &quot;Er... sure, we could use a
scout.&quot;</p>

<p>7. Duelling for fun is now an oxymoron.</p>

<p>6. You have EVER, even for a moment, resented your spouse/partner/child for taking up
possible EQ time with &quot;Quality&quot; time. ('fess up, lads.</p>

<p>5. You have nicknames based on your outdated equipment. (&quot;Fang&quot;,
&quot;Patch&quot;, &quot;Rusty&quot;)</p>

<p>4. Your position on &quot;twinking&quot; is becoming more lenient.</p>

<p>3. They wear platemail the color of your apprentice robe.</p>

<p>2. When they ask what you've been hunting lately, you reply &quot;Pie Tins&quot;.</p>

<p>And the most glaring hint that your friends are outleveling you is,</p>

<p>1. You get a postcard from Nagafen's Lair, with the message: &quot;Wish you were
here!&quot;<br>

<p>8. Wood Orc (Woody Allen + Orc)</p>

<p>7. Gnorf (Gnome + Dwarf)</p>

<p>6. Humaphant (Human + Elephant)</p>

<p>5. High Snake (High Elf + Snake)</p>

(Rathe)</big></font></p>

<p>10. Gnomes on stilts</p>

<p>9. Trolls/Ogres lighting farts</p>

<p>8. Troll/Ogre guards that don't kill you...they capture you. And hug you and squeeze
you and name you George and sit on you like a mother hen so you will never feel
rejected....</p>

<p>7. Food that when given to NPC's improves your faction with them (such as Cotton candy
and lollipops when given to Gnomes/Halflings)</p>

<p>6. Dark elf Females dual wielding whips with no armor of any kind</p>

<p>5. &quot;Tickle me&quot; Fippy Darkpaw dolls. Ok ok I know this isn't in EQ. But I
still think one would be cool. Sue me.</p>

<p>4. Biff the Flying Paladin</p>

<p>3. Trolls/Ogres smelling their fingers</p>

Into EverQuest Inconspicuously To Bring In More Money For Verant</big> - by Ellecil</font><br>
<br>
10. Mentos. A trailer will show a Half Elf in Crushbone, looking at his corpse surrounded
by a ton of orcs. Suddenly, he will grin stupidly and run over to a pool of mud, rolling
around in it. He then takes some pixie dust out of his backpack and puts it over all his
hair, turning it white. Then, while stupid music plays in the background, he'll walk
toward the orcs while brandishing a dagger. They wave at him, he loots his corpse, and
just as he finishes zoning, D'Vinn will walk by, and the audience will [Editor's note:
Mysteriously, number 10 ends here. Al Gore has been notified.]</p>

<p>9. Sure brand deodorant. A female wood elf waves at a barbarian male. The barbarian
male turns to start waving back, but then keeps his arm down and looks around sheepishly.
Suddenly, the message &quot;Are YOU Sure?&quot; will blare at you.<br>
<br>
8. Degree antiperspirant. While flashing random scenes of adventurers in Nagafen's Lair
taking off their top layer of clothing and shaking icky sweat everywhere, a narrative will
explain how it's body heat activated, yet, instead of showing body heat, it will show
things like buildings on fire and icebergs sliding into the ocean.</p>

<p>7. Werther's Original. A gnome will talk about how excited he was when his grandpa
first gave gim a chunk of solidified sugar in a shiny wrapper, then that gnome will give
one to his grandson, and warm music will play and everyone will feel all special.</p>

<p>6. Chia Pet. A troll will sit there, holding a rock, and grumble about how amazing the
Chia Rock is. He will then throw it into the swamp, wait a few weeks, and fish it out,
pointing out how amazing it is that the rock is now covered with green stuff that will die
a few hours after sprouting.</p>

<p>5. Sea Monkeys. This is a good time for Verant to make Kedge Keep more widely-known.</p>

<p>4. Pillsbury. That stupid glob of dough will be riding around his skateboard explaining
how this biscuit is really grand and really light and really fluffy and really bakes up
nice, and then an ogre will sit on him.</p>

<p>3. Dominos. They'll launch their new pizza-carrying device straight out of Neriak, the
Hatewave. And even though every other pizza delivery company uses the little red carrying
case, Dominos will rant on and on about how they use it as if THEY came up with something
clever.</p>

<p>2. Ads on the walls. Like at sports events; in Permafrost, for instance, huge posters
advertising Mountain Dew will be put up.</p>

<p>1. Ultima Online. In a nasty little way of poking the dying man with a stick, Verant
will agree to advertise for UO in EQ. Such things as seeing 'Ultima Online' stickers
slapped across ice goblins butts and the new slogan, &quot;You need food and drink thanks
to the ideas we got from Ultima Online&quot; are just a small sampling of what they have
in store.</p>

<p>0. This bonus number comes from a typo I just made. Since the UO guys screwed up
royally on the online game thing, they decided to switch to athletic equipment, with their
new &quot;Ultima Inline&quot; brand rollerblades.<br>

8. Coffee maker. &quot;Because the last one broke!&quot;<br>

6. Improving the game servers. The kind that bring them Jell-O cups while they're playing.<br>
<br>
5. Lawsuits against websites like The Cackling Klaknak.<br>

10. &quot;Tattooer&quot;. Inscribes stupid things like a demonic rat on his or others
bodies to boost their diminishing feeling of self-worth. For a time, the tattoo gives the
target bonuses (for instance, tattooing &quot;I LUV ORCS&quot; on one will temporarily
make all orcs amiable to that person). The downside is that after several Norrathian
years, the design becomes a colorful mass of sagging flesh and give Charisma penalties
unless they give all of their platinum to the tattooer, who then uses fancy lasers to blow
the d [editor's note: poster's missive strangely ends here].</p>

<p>9. &quot;GM&quot;. After the dismal amount of entries for the Guide Program
(Q:&quot;What is a Harvest Stone?&quot; A:&quot;Something old farmers have to wiz
out?&quot;), Verant will simply make being a guide a class option to avoid having to sift
through emails when they could be playing--uhm--improving the game.<br>
<br>
8. &quot;Ed Asner&quot;. Bigger, hairier, and stupider then ogres, with a meaner
disposition than Trolls. This class comes with a racial enemy, the Erudites (ok, I think I
just axed my chance of getting this list posted).<br>
<br>
7. &quot;Tree&quot;. This class simply stands in one spot all day. However, it is rumored
they have more fun than many of the current classes since they cannot be targeted by
morons like Skankcosby, and are immune to the blunders of Verant. Their only weakness is a
player named Nuramis.<br>
<br>
6. &quot;Newscaster&quot;. This class has it's own language which automatically converts
what they say into what the majority of players want to hear. They also have the
class-specific skill of &quot;Double Talk&quot; and &quot;Backpaddle&quot;. Their deity
and faction change depending on what the larget amount of players have chosen.<br>
<br>
5. &quot;Ogre&quot;. This class combines any race with an ogre. Note that many times the
smaller race is INSIDE the ogre, but they're still and Erudite Ogre, ok?<br>
<br>
4. &quot;Smoker&quot;. This class can instantly Poison, Disease or Kill anything in
Norrath just by being around it. Automatically causes enemies to flee in fear. Also, the
smoke clings to their garments, causing a DoT effect.<br>
<br>
3. &quot;Hunter&quot;. Goes around killing animals in Norrath, but only ones that he won't
gain anything from doing so and that he can hide away and snipe at. Suspeted to be a
derivative of the...<br>
<br>
2. &quot;Quaker&quot;. Once thought to be a religion, it is now a clan of bizarre
creatures who do not understand what the concept of &quot;eating&quot; and

the druid circle.<br>
<br>
1. &quot;Energizer Bunny&quot;. This class just keeps going, and going, and going, and

<p><font color="#800080">Top ten spells that never made it past beta&nbsp; - Benares of
Povar</font><br>
<br>
<big>1</big>.) Summon : Solusek Ro -- originally a cleric's spell, this gave the ability
to summon the evil god Sulosek Ro to fight for you. While the evil races enjoyed use of
this spell, seeing as how any good races attempting to use this spell were immediately
stepped on and eaten by the angry god, Verant felt this put too much power in the hands of
certain players (especially since the spell was available at lvl 16).</p>

<p>2.) The entire digestion line of spells (Constipation, Diarrhea, Abdominal Discomfort,
etc...) -- shamans across Norrath threw a small fit when this spell line was removed and
replaced with disease spells instead. While the disease spells such as Sicken had many of
the same penalties upon the target as the original versions, they lacked the amusing
effect of making the target stumble around in agony with their hands between their legs
while biting their lower lip.</p>

<p>3.) Summon : Money -- this spell, available to the enchanter class, granted the caster
the ability to summon platinum pieces. Although removed only a day after first being
tested, those few who were able to get the spell from vendors are currently making a small
fortune via Ebay.</p>

<p>4.) Illusion : GM -- casting this spell enabled the enchanter using it to have the text
over their name change to an aqua-green color and added the tag &quot;*Senior Guide*&quot;
to their name. Due to intense abuse of this ability, Verant removed it after a number of
newbies were informed that Castle Mistmoore and Lower Guk were being renovated to
accomodate levels 2-5.</p>

<p>5.) Cataclysm -- this spell was created in Everquest's infancy as the programmers used
Ultima as a reference for spell development. In the original Ultima series, Cataclysm
would kill everything on the planet that was native to it, which included everyone except
the player and Lord British. Needless to say many beta-testers were furious when thefirst
lvl 20 wizard found this spell and decided to try it out.</p>

<p>6.) Evacuate : Nagafen's Lair -- This was intended as a high-level escape spell, but
due to the fact no one at the time was high enough level to effectively go to the red
dragon's lair as a means of escaping from a greater threat this spell was tossed on the
sidelines; many wonder if this will become available again after the expansion is
released.</p>

<p>7.) Spirit of the Beggar -- casting this spell on someone gave them incredible begging
powers, enabling them to stand around in a set spot for days on end holding out their
hands and asking for coppers. This, as well its upgrade spell Spirit of the Madman (which
resulted in many newbies casting this on themselves to be killed for their water), were
scrapped due to lack of demand.</p>

<p>8.) Tank of Wrath -- this spell was eventually trimmed down to Hammer of Wrath after a
group of paladins and clerics used this spell to slaughter all the inhabitants of Neriak.</p>

<p>9.) Bard's Song : Busta Rhymes -- while many people enjoyed this spell (which gave a
combined effect of Haste and Charm), the requirement of this song was to type in rythmic
lyrics really fast on the keyboard to keep the spell going. Unfortunately, this resulted
in Verant spending a fortune in replacing player keyboards after many letter keys broke
and simply burnt out from over-working and the spell was dropped.</p>

<p>10.) Alter Plane : New Jersey -- one of the wizard's many transportation spells, this
teleported a group to a mystical dimension of unbreathable air and raw sewage. Aside from
the fact that anyone with the language filter couldn't talk with the locals, many players,
even seasoned beta-testers, were too intimdated to use this spell more than once. Toning
down the horrors of the area, Verant restructured this dimension into two smaller, less
threatening dimensions, which are now accessible via Alter Plane : Hate and Alter Plane :
Fear.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
