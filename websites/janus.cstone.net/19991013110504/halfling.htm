<p></font><font size="3">Q. How many Ogres does it take to change a lightbulb? </p>

<p>A. Two - one to eat the old lightbulb and one to barsh the new one into the socket. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Q. How many Gnomes does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>

<p>A. Just one, and you don't need a lightbulb - the glare off his head is bright enough
as it is. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Q. How many Trolls does it take to change a lightbulb? </p>

<p>A. Three. One to get stuck in the doorway, one to get KOS'ed by the lightbulb merchant,
and one to stand around and scratch his ass. Sure, the lightbulb never gets changed, but
no troll is gonna figure out that you have to flip the switch to get light out of the
thing. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Q. How many powergamers does it take to change a lightbulb? </p>

<p>A. Seventy-four. Four to change the lightbulb with a well-executed strategy, and
seventy to /shout obscenities across the zone because the lightbulb doesn't burn out often
enough. </font><font SIZE="2"><br>

<p></font><font size="3">Some engineers from Freeport were on a survey mission and found
that the Everfrost/Blackburrow border must be changed. They stopped to inform a barbarian

said, &quot;That's good. I couldn't take another one of these Everfrost winters.&quot;</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">A Ranger on vacation from Qeynos was visiting Grobb, and decided
she wanted to pick up some gator skin boots. After haggling with a troll merchant who
wanted over five platinum for a pair, the ranger finally exclaimed, &quot;Well maybe I'll
just go out into the swamp and get my own alligator so I can get some boots made at a
reasonable price!&quot; The merchant indicated that she was free to try, and that she
might even run into a pair of warriors who had the same idea earlier in the day. The
ranger heads into Innothule and comes upon a pair of burly barbarians standing waist deep
in the water, obviously the two warriors. Suddenly, a huge gator swims towards one of the
warriors, jaws agape. Just as it's about to attack, he grabs it with his bare hands and
chokes it to death. The two warriors pull the carcass onto shore and flip it onto its back
next to a huge pile of dead gators. One of the warriors exclaims, &quot;Damn it! This one
doesn't have any boots on either!&quot;<br>
