- by Rick</p>

<p align="left">The Log Beast is a 60+ level invisible MOB who, like Queen Klicknik, only
spawns in response to a certain event. This event varies, but it takes the form of a
player telling his group &quot;OK, just one more battle, then I'm logging off.&quot;
Rather than attacking the party directly, the Log Beast increases the spawn rate for
aggressive monsters in the immediate area, plus any aggressive monsters already in the
zone have their paths changed so that they intersect the location of the party. If the
party starts to gain the upper hand against the hordes, the Log Beast will then spawn a
Griffon or Hill Giant to assure the party's demise.</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p align="left"></font><font size="3">At the same time, the Log Beast will cast Fear on
all guards in the zone, and the chances of spells fizzling or being interrupted increases
ten-fold. As the party approaches a zone, the chances of being stunned increases
proportionally until it reaches 100% two steps from the zone border.</p>

<p align="left">Unlike other aggressive monsters, the Log Beast does not &quot;reset&quot;
after party death. Rather, it remains in the area, focused on the party for a period of no
less than an hour, typically it is two hours or more. As the party attempts to loot their
bodies, the monsters again descend and cause the party to now loot TWO bodies. This
pattern continues until a party member either loses a level or is reduced to exhausted
tears over the injustice of it all.</p>

<p align="left">Rumor has it that if you manage to kill the Log Beast, you gain the Staff
of Frustration, which casts a de-buff that causes attacks to miss, magic resistance to
fail, and armor to be completely useless. The sound this spell makes is Brad McQuaid's
maniacal laughter.</p>

<p align="left">I was attacked by this beast just last night:</p>

<p align="left">Announce intention to log off: 10:45PM</p>

<p align="left">Finally drag my drained ass to bed: 12:30AM</p>

<p align="left">This monster appears in every zone in Norrath.</font><font SIZE="2"><br>
<font color="#800080" size="6"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" size="6">The Sadist</font></p>

<p align="left"></font><font size="3">(Benares). Yes, that's right! Verant has pulled out
all the stops with the new Sadist monster! Sadists are extremely high level and appear to
be any class and race, usually powerful enough to take on Nagafen the Dragon one-on-one,
so it is only natural that their favorite prey is anything at least 20 to 50 levels below
them. They tend to spawn in areas where groups of players have been waiting for hours at
to get that &quot;special something&quot;, be it a weapon or piece of armor, usually off a
named NPC. The Sadist monster is unique in that it attacks PCs not DIRECTLY, but rather
casually meanders by and obliterates whatever NPC they were struggling to get to in a
single shot, loots the corpse for the item that meant something to the PCs but means
little more than a fancy door-stop to the Sadist, and then walks away. Players can tell of
incoming Sadist monsters by the sounds of &quot;Goddammit!&quot;, &quot;Lousy KS
bastard!&quot;, and &quot;Wow, look at all the stuff this guy's got!&quot;. When not
hunting named or important prey, Sadists can be found in front of Freeport casting Ice
Comet on Deathfist Pawns or near the entrance to Qeynos using Firey Avenger on rats.
Players are warned not to bother or talk to these fearsome beasts, as some can be so
tempermental that they'll follow the PC around for hours after that, demonstrating the
power of the latest lvl 49 earth elemental they can conjure up on anything the player
might need for experience or sustenance, be it a skeleton, sand giant or merchant. It is
rumored that Sadists are controlled by gods, large and smelly ones that haven't seen the
light of day in weeks and are destined to never know the touch of a woman. Walk with
trepedation, young adventurer!<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" size="6">The UO monsters</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="uo.gif" alt="uo.gif (3679 bytes)" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="56"></p>

<p></font><font size="3">The UO monsters are the most annoying opponents a Norrathian
could ever face. They claim to serve some sort of Dark Lord or demonic force which is
commonly referred to as OSI. Scholars throughout Norrath have been baffled by these
strange creatures. All UO monsters are humans, and they all seem to speak a strange
dialect which involves the use of a multitude of abbreviations. Examples include BRB, AFK,
LOL, ROTFL, FUK, and other things. Although information is limited, several of the most
outstanding scholars and adventurers have been able to capture and interrogate these
peculiar beings. They claim to have come from a land far across the sea, called UO, hence
their name. Most of them seem to be proficient swordsmen, archers, and mages. Some believe
that each of them has also mastered at least one trade skill. All of them carry around
halberds, have bone armor (certain ties between them and the ogres of the Karana plains
have been suggested,) and know strange magics. They have a universal battle cry they yell
before attacking someone: &quot;Crop Pore.&quot; What this means in their language is
unclear. They seem to divide themselves into three main groups, or &quot;Castes.&quot;</p>

<p>The first is known as the UO PK. They attack indiscriminately, usually attacking
newbies. They always attack in large groups, and teleport away whenever the odds turn
against them. The second group, which is sometimes referred to as a subgroup of the first,
is known as the &quot;UO Noto PK.&quot; These limit themselves to attacking people who may
have less than perfect reputations, such as rogues, necromancers, dark elves, ogres, and
trolls. Both of these groups rarely talk, and when they do is is usually some strange
expression, such as &quot;Kel Ort Port&quot; or something similar.</p>

<p>The third group is sometimes considered the &quot;royalty&quot; of the UO monsters.
These are known as the UO K3WL D3DZ. These, while lower in number than the other two
groups, are the most dangerous. They seem to weild uncanny abilites, an otherworldly magic
they call &quot;Xploits&quot; or &quot;bugs.&quot; They seem to have a particular grudge
against &quot;roll players.&quot; What exaclty defines a roll player is unknown, but the
K3WL D3DZ seem to be able to identify them. K3WL D3DZ always attack in extremely large
hordes, backed by PKs and Noto PKs. All three groups prefer to hunt near the entrances of
dungeons, particularly those which are visited by less skillful adventurers. They do have
one weakness, however: they sometimes fight amongst themselves. Why this is few can tell,
but apparently they are so bloodthirsty that they must keep killing to survive. A scholar
who captured a UO PK and locked him in a controlled environment saw that without anything
to kill, the pathetic being disappeared into thin air, cursing OSI! No one knows where
these strange creatures came from, but we MUST take up arms against this new threat to
Norrath, lest they overtake it like they overtook their homeland, UO!</font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080"><big><strong><big><big>The Lag Creatures - </big></big>by
Brendan G.</strong></big></font></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="3">Lag Creatures:</p>

<p>Ranging from lvl 1 to fifty, just so newbies can attack hard ones by accident, these
creatures will cause astounding lag to anyone inside their sight range. Here are the
types:</p>

<p>Decaying Lag Skeleton: This monster uses AOL and often seems to follow you around,
asking pointless questions about easy-to-figure-out things, keeping you near. Despite its
great lag, it seems to not be affected, only causing you the pain. Its attacks are, of
course, pitiful though, but you never get to see the fight happen.</p>

<p>Lag Zombie: A MOB running EQ on a slow computer at peak hours, no matter when you
encounter it, causes greater lag then the skeleton, and is around lvl 4-10. It hits for
around 10-20 dmg, and again, you don't get to see the battle happen, so no spells.</p>

<p>Lag Goblin: a little laggier then the zombies, theese are lvl 10-25 black goblins that
can cast shaman and wizard spells, meaning that by the time you realize the lag is gone
you'll either be rotted and dead, or see the goblin running. The new dungeon for these
creatures is &quot;The Cave Of RunnyToe, sister dungeon to RunnyEye&quot; with a lvl 40
king which could cast shaman spells, named John Murthough (a friend of mine that lags like
hell with AOL and a slow computer).</p>

<p>Orc Lagmen: Same power as the goblins, but on Faydwer, with a dungeon that replaces
Lesser Faydark (hey, there wasn't anything interesting there anyways, lol)</p>

<p>Lag Giants: lvl 40-45 giants around the Karanas. and Commonlands/Ro, which are to
replace hill/sand/ice giants, because the lag giants have a cooler graphic anyways. They
hit for around 50-200 dmg, and you must melee them, because of the lag they cause, you
can't cast spells.</p>

<p>Lag Daemons and Greater Lag Daemons: lvl 45/50 creatures that look cool, and cause
great lag to anyone in the zone. They are in any place people under lvl 30 would want to
hunt, because we at Verant feel that lower lvls need to learn how to survive outside. They
hit for around 200 dmg, and can cast all wizard spells forever. They take a long time to
kill, and kill ohers fast.&nbsp; Like any creature for high lvls, there will be almost no
rewards for killing these but a rusty weapon, if they're carrying them, and maybe daemon
wings, which look like bat wings, but are part of a quest we're making &quot;soon&quot;,
but sell for nothing, and weight 50 stones each. Daemons can also fly.</p>

<p>Da big lag PiMp: a large black dragon, who came over from UO after being banned, lvl
70. Spawns in a random newbie zone every 5 minutes, until they're all filled. It will take
multiple lvl 50 parties top kill them, so newbies will just have to watch out while
hunting now. It will help them learn how to survive. This monster can also cross zone
barriers, so don't expect to escape. Like the daemons, this monster causes lag to all
people in the zone. it has claws that do 500+ melee dmg, and a AE fireball that does
around 200 dmg.</p>

<p>These creatures don't have graphics yet, but they will the cool.The giant and
goblin/orc graphics are done, but we'll let ya wait. These creatures also have the perfect
AI that all our monsters have, and won't mindlessly walk into walls or trees, we promise.
Until then, the monsters will be huge barbarians like in beta, so run whenever you see
one, might be a monster. </p>
