</font><font size="4">Rich (Cyrica, Mad Monk of Galion)</font></font><font size="2"></p>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">

<p></font><font size="3" color="#000000">Well, my tale is about Cyrica, the mad monk.
Cyrica decides she wants to get &quot;netted gloves&quot; so she can hurt invulnerable
stuff! After shouting for 15 minutes, she found a generous dwarf who was nice enough to
lead her there (by the way she's level 5, hence the madness thing.) Cyrica ran across the
deserts of Ro by the shore, and took a deep swim hoping to avoid that really really really
big desert giant (I guess that's what it was called, I wasn't stupid enough to stand there
for a minute and CON him!!!) and hoped that those big fishys didn't try to eat me (to
monsters, monks are a beacon for some reason.) After skillfully avoiding the desert
raiders and things that go bump (or sound like a cho-cho train, hisses, and grunts) in the
night, the dwarf and Cyrica made it to the entrance to the Grobb area! Fook fook! Cyrica
was intent on beating up poor helpless little froggies and getting their magical treasure!
However the silly dwarf advised that these little froggies would tear her arms off and
beat her with them, and that they would have to rely on teamwork! &quot;Very well&quot;,
Cyrica muttered, as she followed the arrogant dwarf to the city of Grobb. It was there
that the dwarf and madmonk began to decimate the little froggies, but find no booty.
(meantime in real time I was gettin sleepy and the dwarf had to work in the morning so I
decided to risk it on my own) Not one, not two, but THREE froggies attacked Cyrica (let
this be a lesson to those who pick on little guys like tadpoles, they have brothers and
sisters) Cyrica fought valantly, but alas sucumbed to the hoarde of froggies.</font><font

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>

<p>*More food, and I'll take my backpack to get all my stuff I took for the two bodies*</p>

<p>After recovering the body, and running with the speed of a wolf, she reaches Grobb once
again. &quot;I will be sneaky and run along the RIGHT side instead of the leftside of the
place, and eventually reach my body near the city! Look! Tis a camp! And it appears a
troll is coming to greet me! Hail, Troll! How art th...&quot; The unfriendly troll then
ran off something about being a shadow knight to Cyrica and hit her many times in the head
until she became sleepy.</p>

<p>LOADING PLEASE WAIT...</p>

<p>(It's 3, and I'm becoming purturbed....)</p>
<font color="#000000">

<p>Cyrica is somewhat unpset at the turn of events, and growing weary of this. Cyrica ran
the mundane route (Using the wonderful teaching video from Monty Python's &quot;And Now
for Something Completly Different&quot; video on &quot;How NOT to be Seen&quot;) and ran
with the intent of getting her stuff! Past the Giant, past the shivled mummy, past the
desert madman who shot something magic up her arse... BUT NO MATTER! She was on a mission!
(AND IT WAS GETTING LATE! or early, rather....) She ran into Grobb to the right side and
recovered her body using an old monk Jeedi trick (Insert yoda music as body moves closer
to Cyrica) She then ran ALL the way around to the left side and recovered her other body!
Success! &quot;Tis dark, but I shall triumph in returning to my homela....&quot;</font></p>

<p>After Cyrica was finished wiping the tears from her eyes, she was willing to give it
one last shot (lest &quot;I&quot; became the insane one...) RUN! RUN! RUN! Back to Grobb!</font></p>

<p>Success! And now, to the desert! (Then the 5 min. discovery that desert madmen look so
much like PC's till they start nuking you... THANK GOD FOR ZONING!) After being sneaky,
Cyrica outsmarted the madman (waited for some other guy to come running past... he he
he...) And safely returned home to Freeport. Moral of the story? DON'T BE STUPID!</p>

working hard collecting a lot of money. Let me see now. I have several pieces of cloth

<p>Open inventory &#133;&#133;..</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm, 0 platinum, 82 gold, 202 silver, and 1345 copper &#133;&#133;&#133;</p>

<p>I can't believe how slow it is to get money in this game. All this looting and I still
have no platinum. I really need to find the bank in Halas, so I don't have to keep
carrying all this money. I remember reading that there is a bank in every city. Wonder why
I can't find the one here? I really should ask someone where the bank is. Oh well, I'll
get to it later.</p>

<p>Run back to Halas dodging several nasty creatures on the way&#133;&#133;&#133; (Heart

<p>Now lets go see Cindy she has all the nice leather stuff. Wow she has a lot of stuff
for sale. Hmmmmmmm, look at these nice leather tunics. Nice AC and I really need one of
these. Wonder how much they cost.</p>

<p>Click the leather tunic &#133;..</p>

<p>That will be <font face="Tahoma, Arial">3pp, 2gp, 5sp</font> for the leather tunic.</p>

<p>Wow, I don't have that much money. How can I buy anything in this stupid town if I
can't afford it. Hmmmm, I wonder what would happen if I clicked the purchase button
anyway?</p>

<p>Ching! &#133;&#133;&#133;..</p>

<p>You give Cindy 32gp, 5sp, 0cp for the leather tunic.</p>

<p>Wow, this is awsome, I got the leather tunic. But this does not make any sense. I have
no platinum. Yep there is some gold, and silver missing. Hmmmmmm, I bet this is a bug. I
wonder what will happen if I see it back to her.</p>

<p>Click the leather tunic in my inventory &#133;&#133;</p>

<p>I'll give you 2pp, 2gp, 2sp, 4cp, for the leather tunic&#133;&#133;</p>

<p>Wow, I can't believe that I'll actually get platinum. I must use this to my advantage
and get a bunch of money. Alright here we go. **grin**</p>

<p>Buy a bunch of leather tunics &#133;&#133;..</p>

<p>Inventory is full &#133;&#133;</p>

<p>Sell the tunics back to Cindy &#133;&#133;.</p>

<p>Woohooo, I have a bunch of platinum. This is great, if I keep this up I'll be rich. I
bet they have no idea this bug exists. Lucky for me I am the smart one. **big ear-to-ear
grin**</p>

<p>Buy more leather tunics &#133;&#133;</p>

<p>Inventory is full &#133;&#133;.</p>

<p>Sell the tunics back to Cindy &#133;..</p>

<p>(process continues until I get the message)</p>

<p>You can't afford the leather tunic &#133;&#133;</p>

<p>Huh! This makes no sense. My inventory is empty and I must have a lot of platinum.
What, I have 2platinum, some gold, some silver, and some copper. This can't be right let
me ask my good friend Drakkaenn. </p>

<p>Yada, yada, yada &#133;&#133;&#133;..</p>

<p>So you are saying that ten copper equals one silver, ten silver equals one gold, ten
gold equal one platinum and I can exchange the money in at the bank. Hmmmm, I had 82 gold
that equals 8 platinum and 2 gold. </p>

<p>DOH!</p>

Patrick S.</big></font></p>

<p>Well my stories are a little more unique than probally anyone has heard of. When I
first started playing the game, I was a little lost. My friends kept telling me to do the
tutorial before I played, but since I<br>
am a Man I decided I could find anything out on my own.. Well after I realized that once
you died you could loot your own corpse I was on the right track. Next thing I had to find
out was where my corpse was. My friends helpfully showed me how to find my corpse by using
the compass. 100... 300... 500... a little bit further and I will reach the same location
it told me. Ah Ha.. I found my corpse right at the same spot as the numbers were before.
When I went into work the next morning and revealed how smart I was for being able to find
my corpse, my friends starting dying laughing at what they had heard. It turns out I was
following not the compass but the lag meter instead. Well I got shit lucky. But felt
humiliated when I realized it.<br>
<br>
Second story goes like this. I had just gotten 5 level and starting hunting with a buddy
of mine. he was casting his new spells and I was medding. I saw one of the spells he had
was not the same as mine. So while I am medding I say to him &quot;what was that
spell&quot; he replied &quot;Holy Armor&quot; then I said &quot; Cool Hit Me &quot;<br>
<br>
&lt; A zombie hits YOU for 27 points of damage<br>

what a funny guy.</p>

One time while hunting in Tox Forest, I saw a skeleton so I pushed F8 to target it. Damn,
what the hell? It won't target. Oh well, I'll just click on it to manually target it. Look
at targetting window and it has<br>
a name, Kobarnl or something like that. Hmmmm, a skeleton with a name. Lets /con it. Ah,
an even fight, let's go for it! <br>

After I had expended my mana, a Necromancer (First one I had seen) came up behind me and

I was adventuring in Lake Rathe for the first time with friends. I arrived at the Lake in
the Dead of Night, the usual situation. And Swam out to the first southern isle to meet
with them and wack some Aviak Guards.<br>
<br>
The killing was both enjoyable and profitable. Then the group decided to go try Runneye
for a while. With a fresh SOW, my companions quickly jumped in the water and swam away
leaving me standing on the shore unsure of which way to go. Being a Ranger, I thought I
would simply hop into the water and start tracking them. Of course, it was pitch black
again.<br>
<br>
Well, tracking has its disadvantages. As they say, Ignorance is Bliss. I was so concerned
with avoiding all the Interesting yet Scary creatures on tracking that I neglected to
monitor my oxygen supply, so needless to say, the first NON-MELEE HIT was quite a shock.
No problem, I thought, I'll just start swimming up... up... up... up... LOADING!<br>
<br>
WHO KNEW THE LAKE WAS SO DEEP! As I had arrived and attempted leaving during the dead of
night, I had no idea the lake THAT deep. I was probably sinking like a stone the entire
time I was swimming.<br>

I can heal! Then I'm a god (idiot)!<br>

hunting in the East Commons for wisps (these were the good ole days when the evil
nosavelightstones where never heard of).</p>

<p>Being a 12th level half-elf ranger, I have a slight advantage in hunting a specific
creature, as I can track. A paladin whose name I can not remember ran up to me, did not
like my good fortune, here is the approximate dialog:</p>

<p>Paladin: &quot;Stop killing all the wisps you bastard! I am gonna tell a GM you are
camping!&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;I am not camping in fact. I am running around, tracking.&quot;</p>

<p>Paladin: &quot;Liar!&quot;</p>

<p>I went back to my business, and soon I found a wisp, as I engaged it, the paladin runs
up and starts whacking on it, and he gets the kill. We exchange a few words, and I run off
to my next wisp. Here comes the paladin again.</p>

<p>This happened about 5 times, then angrily I dueled him. He quickly accepted. Sadly, he
had been anonymous, and i had not conned him.</p>

<p>Paladin: &quot;HAHA! You idiot! I am gonna kill you, I am level 13!&quot;</p>

<p>Uhoh, dumb idea. Now what?</p>

<p>Hmm, this track skill is useful, and looky there, I see a kodiak on track.</p>

<p>Wow, there are 3 kodiaks there, hmm, wonder if he will fall for this. Afterall, a Human
paladin can't see well at night.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I run straight through the 3 kodys and this idiot followed me. It did not
take long for them to make short work of him.</p>

<p>I love being an animal lover!</font></p>

<p></font><font size="3">Our group was hunting in the mino caves near Ak'Anon one day. We
were all around level 10 or 11. The screen text went something like this:</p>

<p>Solleonidas hits a minotaur slaver for 16 points of damage.</p>

<p>A minotaur slaver has been slain by Solleonidas.</p>

<p>You recieve 6 silver, 5 copper as your share.</p>

<p>Solleonidas says: &quot;Good fight everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>Liin says: &quot;Aye. Good fight.&quot;</p>

<p>You say to your party: &quot;Must pray for strength from the Mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Solleonidas says: &quot;brb, ggp&quot;</p>

<p>You tell Liin: &quot;LOL, play along with me on something.&quot;</p>

<p>You tell Tolas: &quot;LOL, play along with me on something.&quot;</p>

<p>Linn tells you: &quot;k&quot;</p>

<p>Tolas tells you: &quot;k, what we doing?&quot;</p>

<p>You say to your party: &quot;RUN!&quot;</p>

<p>You say to your party: &quot;HERO!!!!! RUN!!!!!!</p>

<p>Tolas and Liin follow me out of the nearby entrance and climb up the side of the hill
to watch and wait. As we are settling in, </p>

<p>and waiting for Solleonidas to return, we see him come barreling out of the entrance
hell bent for the windmills. As he is </p>

<p>running along, we see:</p>

<p>Solleonidas tells the party: &quot;WHERE???&quot;</font></p>
