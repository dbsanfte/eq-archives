<p></font><font color="#800080"><big>Ogre Bard - by Ellecil</big></font></p>

<p>Almost like the Troll Bard, Mik Jagger (oy veys, here come the angry letters), the Ogre
Bard is an unlikely choice. But while Verant desperately tries to sift through all the
fricking whiny petitions, we have tacked this on, knowing Verant will just green-light it
because they're too busy with the petition to allow Trolls to Tinker (Krukuk make meet
tenderizur!).</p>

<p>The Ogre Bard's songs will be extra effective, and they don't need instruments. They
beat their chest for percussion, whistle for wind, floss their teeth for stringed, and
&lt;ahem&gt; release methane for brass. Also, they make everyone in a 50 mile radius run
faster, no matter which song they play. They also get a new instrument skill, Armpit.</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>The Programmer (Trolls Minor) - by Jenifer B.</big></font></p>

<p>Guilds are under bridges. Must have a flickering camp fire to stare into for hours on
end. Must also have caffeine, that is almost as important as having the campfire, without
they are sluggish and will attack unprovoked. Intelligence and wisdom bonuses, but major
charisma penalties.(who wants to hear about C programming?) Special skill : boredom. Works
like lull except it can have one of two effects, the creature being targeted as well as
anything within /say range will either be forced to sit(sleep), or will run in a random
direction.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>The Gnome Monk - by Mareth Cryoslinger</big></font></p>

<p>You know with the headbutt attack and nose parry/block. Flying kicks to the ankle. New
bite attack to the groin (lev 25 tho cause it's really powerful). Able to grow twice thier
size by feigning death. Gnome monks would be have a serious weakness for cotton candy and
lollipops. But have a strong resistance to knockdown/stun attacks (C'mon...how you gonna
knock someone down who's already 3/4 there?)</p>

<p><font color="#800080"><big>The Manager by Zadkiel Hopeseeker, Level 22 Monk, GM of
&lt;&lt;The Doom Guild&gt;, Xegony.</big></font></p>

<p>This class can be of any evil race, and his stats are all at 1, except Charisma which
is at 300.</p>

<p>Skills: Beg (level 1), Avoid Work (level 1), Delegation (level 3), Smarm (level 5),
Persuade (level 10), Charm (level 15) </p>

<p>The Manager gains experience by getting other people to do his work for him. If a
Manager completes a quest or kills a monster himself, he actually LOSES experience,
however every time he persuades another player to do the job for him, he gains double
experience and all the positive faction adjustments, while the player who did the job for
him receives all the negative ones.</p>

<p>If a Manager wants an item, he must send player after player to retrieve it for him,
and the more that die in the process the better. The Manager must never show any remorse
at the players deaths, or help<br>
them retrieve their corpses in any way. Once the Mob holding the item is slain, the
Manager is automatically teleported to its side, and is the only person able to loot the
corpse.</p>

<p>If the Manager buys an item, as long as he gets a receipt for it, he is refunded the
money when he takes the receipt to the 'expenses department', a monster filled dungeon in
the 'Plain of Hate'</p>

<p>At level 20, the Manager undergoes a change of class, and becomes a 'Director'. </p>

<p>Skills: Sleep (level 20), False Emotion (level 25), Seduce Secretary (level 30),
Interview (level 35), Intimidation (level 40)</p>

<p>The Director automatically receives 100pp a day in his bank account, and has to do
nothing to earn it.</p>

<p>The Director is unable to move from his home (unless summoned by a CEO, see later), and
must do all his work from there. He is only capable of speaking to Managers, who must
immediately organise other players to do what the Director asked him. The same limitation
on the Manager of not being able to do the job himself still applies, or he loses a level.
If the Manager fails to get other players to do the task the Director set him, no matter
how difficult it may be, then the Manager is automatically deleted.</p>

<p>There is no way for a Director to lose experience. Once he reaches this level, only
greater gains are possible.</p>

<p>&lt;bold&gt;At level 50, the Director becomes a Chief Executive Officer, or CEO. </p>

<p>Skills: Sack (level 50), Create Board Meeting (level 50)</p>

<p>The CEO instantly turns invisible permanently, has every player on the server added to
his 'ignore' list, and gets 1000pp a day in his bank account. A CEO has the added ability
of being able to announce a 'Board Meeting' to which every Director is automatically
summoned. They then talk in a strange language that no other class is able to understand
for several hours, and then the Directors go home and issue particularly ridiculous things
for all the Managers to do.</p>

<p>The CEO gains the 'Sack' Ability, with which he can instantly delete any player on the
server.</p>

by Ativannus</font></p>
<font size="3">

<p>This fighter/spellcaster hybrid class is available to all races.&nbsp; High attribute
scores in strength and endurance are essential, given the huge encumbrance factor this
class faces.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A Postman's sacred duty is to deliver important items throughout the
far-flung lands of Norrath.&nbsp; Whether it is icy glacier, searing desert, or steamy
jungle, the Postman always gets his package to the intended destination.&nbsp; His task
demands the full use of the following special skills:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Speed Walk:&nbsp; Posties are able to travel great distances at an
accelerated speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dodge Canine:&nbsp; They have an innate ability to dodge attacking
wolves, coyotes, and other canine animals.&nbsp; If dodging fails, then they can resort
to....</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Pepper Spray:&nbsp; A jet of noxious liquid is conjured.&nbsp; The
target is overcome with burning eyes and choking.&nbsp; If all else fails, then they
can.....</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Go Postal:&nbsp; The character goes into a berzerker rage, with +30
bonuses to strength, agility, endurance, and dexterity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, intelligence
drops by 60 points.&nbsp; Posties are liable to attack random targets, and seem to have a
tendency to choose taverns and other public places to use this skill.</font></p>
<font size="3">

<p>Riposte:&nbsp; This skill is commonly referred to as&nbsp;Return to Sender.</font></p>

Whiner - by Brendan G. </big></font><font color="#000000"><small><small>(photo by
YungJedi)</small></small></font></p>

<p>We've just gotton word from Bard about a new class in the works!!! This class is the
Whiner. They can be any race, class, and god, and have 50 points to spend. They are weak
until lvl 5, where they get the spell &quot;Beg Melee&quot; this spell, taking 1 Mana to
cast, and a casting time of .3 seconds, will repeatadly ask GMs for better melee skill
because their class sucks at it. This spell is any circle they want too, be it evoke or
alter, doesn't matter. At lvl 10 they get their 2nd beg spell &quot;beg speicial&quot;.
This spell acts like &quot;Beg Melee, but it will ask GMs for all skills their class
doesn't have, and 244+ of each of them. At Level 15, they get &quot;beg Magic&quot;, which
is the same as the first 2, but will fill their spellbooks with all spells in the game,
including the ones that were deleted, to balance out their class. At level 20, they get a
beg equipment, which gives them a set of green splinterd plate, a Firery Avenger, 3 rings
of their choice, and 20 times they also want. The lvl 25 spell adds +100 to all of their
stats, because they were too low to begin with. The lvl 30-50 spells do the same things,
but weaken other players classes because they are too powerful. They also have these new
skills :<br>
<br>
Whine: it repeatadly shouts over multiple zones about how they are sarting a petition,
used with the &quot;petition&quot; skill, anyone who doesn't resist gets their name put on
one.<br>
<br>
Petition: This skill will send 200 fake names to Verant, plus anyone who failed the save
against Whine.<br>
<br>
Invul: this skill will automaticly make them invulerable for 40 minutes<br>
<br>
Invis: same as invul with invisability<br>
<br>
They do have one drawback, if they fizzle a &quot;beg&quot; spell, their account in Perma
Banned, but they'll find a way to change that by the time this is put in.<br>
</p>

Beggar - by Nuramis</font></big></p>

<p><small><small><font color="#800080">(original screenshot provided by Venin)</font></small></small></p>
<font size="2">

<p></font><font size="3">They are masters of disguise, able to pretend to be any of the
other classes, and are not restricted to any one race. However, they do have 1 class trait
that allows a knowledgable person to be able to spot them, regardless of diguise: Beggars
can only speak in shouts, and can keep shouting for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>They are most often found prowling the gates to the more populated cities of Norrath.
To stay clear of them, citizens are encouraged to move quickly and quietly, not making eye
contact with anyone else in the vicinity of the city gates.</p>

<p>However, should one be forced to confront a beggar, deception is by far the best
weapon: They are easily distracted by shiny objects. A common tactic is to throw a flat
stone painted like money away from you. The beggar, believing the stone to be real money,
will quickly run off after it, leaving you free to go your way.</font><font size="2"></p>
</font>

<p><font size="3">[Editor's Note: Ok, we have all met these guys. Newbie shouts: &quot;Can
someone give me some patchwork armor? I am new and have no money.&quot;. Bah, there's some
moss snakes with you name on it, bud.]</font></p>
