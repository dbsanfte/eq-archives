      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kicking It Up A Notch</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><!-- Story -->I first wanted to begin this article by thanking Gasper
      and the UO Vault Staff for allowing me to express my ideas, opinions and advice regarding
      Ultima Online, but more importantly, the UO Community at large. Together with MoOk, I feel
      that we have much to offer everyone. With that all said, I shall continue with my article.<br>
      <br>
      It never ceases to amaze me. So many guilds popping up each day, all with a dream to
      become the greatest, the &quot;most feared&quot;, the largest, the best
      &quot;roleplayers&quot; and so on. Some fail, while others seem to do it effortlessly.
      What is the key to success? I am sure that this question is asked quite often, and not
      many people know the answer. Some guilds have strict rules that make their members stay in
      character at all times while in game. Other guilds demand that their members have the
      highest stats and ultra-precision PVP tactics. Extreme? Perhaps, but at least they know
      what they want and they are taking steps to achieve 'greatness'.<br>
      <br>
      In this article, I wanted to mention some equally important aspects of guild life. Some
      'ideas' to help spice up your membership, increase your friendships and bonds, and perhaps
      help you to break the current 'mold' that may be keeping you from expanding into other
      games, or simply keeping you from doing more with your up and coming guild.<br>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few years ago, I created a design for a t-shirt that
        would feature our guild on it, along with the names of all of our members. The task seemed
        huge, and I had no idea where to start. Picking up the phone book, I quickly found a place
        who did silk screens and within minutes, I knew what was needed from me to begin. Two
        months later, our guild sported shirts (about fifty of them) and thus began our REAL WORLD
        advertising. It was amazing. We were all so proud, and so eager to wear the stylish
        shirts. So far, we have had two designs, one each year... and a total of about 140
        'miniature ads' are walking around the world each day. Not bad, is it? </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I'll Buy THAT For a Dollar!</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Several months ago, I was thinking about how much I
        wanted to recruit new members who were located closer to my area (Pennsylvania). With all
        the &quot;real life&quot; gatherings we have, it would be great to have a ton of people
        from my area attending. While on my way home one day, I stopped in a fast food restaurant
        and noticed they were selling &quot;Shamrocks&quot; for a charity. For a dollar, you could
        write your name on it and they store would post this 'Shamrock' on their wall. Well, I
        paid my buck and wrote, &quot;www.lostorder.com - Online Gaming Guild&quot; on it. I never
        expected it to work, but I felt good about it nonetheless. Two weeks later, an application
        for membership came in from someone who, &quot;Saw the shamrock ad at the Subway
        shop&quot;. Amazing. So simple, and it only cost a buck. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Real Life Meetings and Furthering the Guild Unity</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Has your guild ever held a &quot;Real Life
        Gathering&quot; yet? If not, you are definately missing out. They take a little time to
        organize, but if handled properly, they usually come off without a hitch. You should begin
        with a survey to your guild, asking for the locations (city/state/country) of everyone who
        is a member. Next, select a region that is a good midpoint for everyone involved, if
        possible. At this time, it is really up in the air and you can have any 'theme' you want
        for this gathering. To name a few: Paintball, Bowling, Sky diving, Sight Seeing, hitting
        an arcade and grabbing some dinner, etc. Stepping away from the virtual world with your
        'virtual friends' is truly remarkable. If you think that you are good friends with someone
        now, and you only have known them from &quot;UO&quot;, I can speak truthfully when I say
        that meeting people in real life usually increases the closeness you have. If you plan a
        RL Gathering and need some help, just send me a message and maybe I can offer you some
        pointers.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Kindness and Giving During The Holidays</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I will end my first article with one last idea that will
        again tip the scales of &quot;Guild Unity&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot;. One of my biggest
        inspirations, Lord Stubby of Akalabeth, suggested that our guild donate REAL money to a
        charity. He organized the entire thing, providing the name of the Charity, the address to
        mail the cash/checks to, as well as taking pictures afterwards to show us the happiness of
        the children who will benefit from our offerings this Christmas. Three years ago, I never
        would have imagined a guild existance that exceeded all of my expectations. A group of
        people who didn't only play games and worry about the virtual world, but an
        &quot;Organization&quot; with so much more potential, that they could affect the REAL
        world as well. If you stop and think about it, it is truly a great force you all have at
        your beck and call. Guilds. Groups of people from all over the world, united 'virtually'
        for a common goal. Perhaps after you read this article, you will all step back and think
        about your next 'big hurdle'. After this article, what creative things will you do to <b>KICK
        IT UP A NOTCH</b> for your guild members?</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I hope that this inspires some of you... I truly do. If
      you do anything different with your organization as a result of this letter, please, let
      me know. In the future, I would LOVE to feature your guilds and organizations in follow up
      articles about the things you did to enhance your virtual bonds, or even your real life
      bonds.<br>
      <br>
      Humbly I remain,<br>
