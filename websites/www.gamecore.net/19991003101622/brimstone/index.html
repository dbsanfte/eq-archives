      slowly learning about Asheron's Call, but it will be awhile before I feel comfortable
      writing about EQ or AC 'specific' systems, ideas, etc. That is why I need you to offer
      your talents, thoughts and writing skills! In return, you will have a large amount of
      visibility as the months go by. I plan to make this site the leading edge, #1 source, for
      guildrelated tips, unity, community, and more. Being a part of this community will speak
      volumes about yourself, as well as your guild.</font></p>

    this Site:</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#F7D8B9" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
    size="2">For well over 2.5 years, I have been focusing on the leadership of communities,
    namely, guilds. I have written several articles on leadership, guild creation, organized
    warfare in games without &quot;warfare&quot; systems, roleplaying guides, and recently, an
    article about the reformation of the traditional, &quot;Player Killer&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#F7D8B9" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those
    who don't know me, I was one of the Founders of the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/">Lost
    Order of Akalabeth</a>. A guild that was my first, ever, inspired by the game: Ultima
    Online. From the day we set forth to create this guild, we wanted every single aspect to
    be flawless... and we strived for success. To this day, the Lost Order (LOA) lives on, and
    is doing quite well - despite our fair share of troubles and heartaches.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#F7D8B9" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
    size="2">I have long wanted to create a &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;Central&quot; source
    that EVERYONE from around the world could use as a guide when creating, or managing their
    guilds. A place where I could share my tips, as well as the tips and ideas from other
    well-reknowned guild leaders from around the globe. This is what I have come up with, and
    I hope you will bookmark it, embrace it, and add to this community.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#F7D8B9" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
    size="2">Prior to online gaming, I have played pen and paper RPGs for nearly all my life,
    at least 14 years before UO came along. Then I joined the United State Marine Corps, where
    I learned a lot about organization, respect, honor, discipline, etc. I truly believe that
    it is from my background and experiences that I have been able to come up with a
    successful recipe for online guilds and communities, as well as ideas that make online
    gaming much more fun. I spent 90% of my online experiences working on the political and
    managerial aspects of guilds, rather than the actual gameplay of Ultima Online, and now,
    EverQuest. To me, THAT is where the real fun lies.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#F7D8B9" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
    size="2">And with that all said, welcome to the site, I hope you enjoy all that you read
    and learn while visiting. I will try to make updates each week, as well as assigning
    various guild leaders to areas throughout this site. I am looking for forum guides, news
    agents, creative writers, etc. </font></p>

    my friends and fellow guildmates who have helped teach me many of the things I know about
    guilds. You can say that we learned much of it together, and as a team, we created a
    lasting guild community that we all love and cherish to this day. <font color="#9999FF">They
    are:</font> <font color="#FFFFFF">Freejack, Carnifex, Ralineth, Brewman, Ghoti and Zari.
    Of course, there are MANY others that I could mention, but it would truly take a long time
    to name them all. <font size="1" color="#9999FF">- Brimstone</font></font></font></font> </p>
