    making your guild the best it can be. <font color="#9999FF">- Brimstone</font></font></font></p>

      href="http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/?reg">Extreme Tracking:</a> If you want to track
      all aspects of the visitors who come to your guild site, you will NEED to setup
      &quot;Extreme Tracking&quot;. As a guild leader, this &quot;Free&quot; resource was
      extremely useful to me. It allowed me to track what ads were working for our guild. If I
      posted something catchy, I noticed that our daily hits were jumping up to 200+. Using this
      resource, I also noticed how many people use the 800x600 resolution, # of colors, browser
      type, county they are from, etc. With this data, I was able to ensure that the MOST amount
      of people could view my site without any problems whatsoever. (Rating: 10)</font></p>

      Boss:</a></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> The absolute greatest Guild Organizer in the world
      is the, &quot;Guild Boss&quot; application. This program has it all, and more... ;) - You
      can manage members (and all aspects of members), guild statistics, donations, fees, ranks,
      allies, enemies, etc. You can also share guild data files with your friends or allies, so
      that everyone involved has detailed information about each other. Other features include: <font
      color="#FFFF99">QuickMail:</font> send email to one or more recipients directly from
      Roster Pane grid, <font color="#FFFF99">QuickPage:</font> send ICQ
      &quot;EmailExpress&quot; pages to one or more recipients directly from Roster Pane grid, <font
      color="#FFFF99">Create and save pre-written boilerplate messages</font> and send them off
      with a click, <font color="#FFFF99">Dynamic web-page publishing:</font> Generate custom
      web reports on-the-fly: rosters, inventory, bounties, allies, etc.., <font color="#FFFF99">Pre-defined
      custom HTML formatting preferences</font> via the Web Report Setup window, <font
      color="#FFFF99">Insert reusable custom blocks of HTML</font> directly into your reports. A
      free demo is available that is quite useable, minus some key features you get when you
      register. <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 10)</font> </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><a href="http://sitepowerup.com">SitePowerup.com:</a></font><font
      color="#FFFF80"> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">If you need a message board and don't have a
      &quot;CGI&quot; guy to help you create one, then configure it to your needs... SitePowerUp
      is for you. They provide FREE (Unlimited) message boards that are easy to apply for, and
      configure. The only downside to this is that there are 1.) Add banners on all free message
      boards, 2.) Limited # of special 'codes' for forum admins and 3.) sometimes the speed of
      the boards isn't very good, but not usually. Other than those few gripes, &quot;Free is
      Free&quot;. I believe that SitePowerUp will soon be offering free &quot;Forms&quot; and
      &quot;Polls&quot; for its members. With this resource, no guild should be without a
      message board.<font color="#99CCFF"> (Rating: 10)</font></font></font></p>

      href="http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=free+counters">(Yahoo) Free Counters:</a> </font><font
      color="#FFFFFF">If Extreme Tracking isn't what you are looking for in a counter (ET's
      counter buried and found on the &quot;Summary&quot; page), you can head over to Yahoo:
      Free Counters and search for a solution that works for you. Some are java based, cgi,
      simple HTML script, etc. You simply have to look around and find something that is easy
      enough for you to setup, and trust me, they are out there! My personal Counter Page of
      Choice is: <font color="#66FFFF"><a href="http://www.counterguide.com/">Counter Guide</a><font
      color="#FFFFFF">. <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: N/A)</font></font></font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><a href="http://www.onelist.com/">OneList
      (Mailing List):</a> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">Every guild MUST have a mailing list,
      period. This type of service opens up the lines of communication and makes your community
      much more effective and &quot;In touch&quot; with the issues. Gone are the days of having
      to CC: a million members each time you wish to send mail. If you don't have access to a
      &quot;Real&quot; listserver or majordomo, OneList is for you! It is &quot;FREE&quot; and
      simple to use. Again, all guilds (organizations) should have a mailing list. The LOA uses
      5 different mailing lists, all focussed on a given guild concept (i.e. Council, Ultima,
      EverQuest, Initiates, Main, etc.) <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 10)</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><a href="http://gamecore.net/free/">Free
      Graphics from Brimstone:</a> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">Once in awhile, I make graphics
      that are called, &quot;Templates&quot;. They are designs that lack guild-specific text,
      thus being a good canvas for you and/or your artists to customize to your guilds liking. I
      have included menu images, guild banners and more. I try to add new images each week, but
      that isn't always the case. Anyway, again, free is great! <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating:

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><a
      href="http://uo.stratics.com/uojc/main.html">UO Journal Converter:</a></font><font
      color="#FFFFFF"> This resource is for UO only. Being in a guild, you will definately be
      faced with policitics in one way or another. I always believe in CYA, otherwise known as,
      &quot;Cover your ass.&quot; Keeping this in mind, as a guild leader, you should make it
      known to your members that recording a log and/or snapping a screenshot of 'difficult
      situations' could be in everyones best interests. The UO Journal Converter is a great tool
      that actually organizes and manages your Journal. It breaks the journal up into days, and
      allows you to customize all sorts of things. If you have the drive space available to save
      your logs, or at least portions of your logs, I would HIGHLY recommend this tool. <font
      color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 8)</font></font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#99CCFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><a
      href="http://www.hh.iij4u.or.jp/~kmatuoka/uosu/uosu133.zip">UO Screenshot:</a> This link
      leads to a &quot;Direct Download&quot;. As with all downloaded files, please make sure
      your anti-virus software is up to date. The UO Screenshot file is not hosted on an
      &quot;Official Site&quot;, so be cautious. With that said, UO Screenshot is simply an
      amazing tool that EVERYONE should have. So often, great things in game are lost forever
      because nobody knew how to snap a picture of it. Well, those days are gone! UO Screenshot
      allows you to snap images in a flash! They also save to your hard-drive in .jpg format, as
      opposed to .bmp. The old method was using Alt+PrintScreen. This method stored the data
      into memory, and you would then have to use a Graphics Program to take that data and put
      it into a file format, then save it, etc. (Rating: 10)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99CCFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC Chat
      Client:</a> Another must have for guilds! This program is a client that allows you to Chat
      on the internet, in real time, with everyone in your channel. You can have HUNDREDS of
      people in a chat room, and still be able to chat with little (or no) lag at all. I know
      that many of you use ICQ, and you love it... however, ICQ is more unstable when it comes
      to security, and ICQ takes up WAY MORE system resources. UO (or any game) will lag more if
      you have ICQ running, as opposed to running IRC. mIRC (and Internet Chat) takes some time
      to learn, but will lead to great guild communitation in REAL TIME, as opposed to being
      restricted to email and/or in game meetings. (Rating: 10)</font></p>
