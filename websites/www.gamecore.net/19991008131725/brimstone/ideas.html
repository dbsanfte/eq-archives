            Shadow Knights:</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
            This article pertains to EverQuest Shadowknights (your traditional 
            anti-paladins) and their brethren, the undead-summoning Necromancers.</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) 
              Race support. Chances are, if you're a guild of Shadowknights, your 
              guild will consist of trolls, ogres and dark elves, all of which 
              are inherently evil. Thus, by guiding, helping, and protecting your 
              own evil race, your guild will gain a sort of "good notoriety". 
              You will get support from your own people and they will look up 
              to the evil deeds you do and perhaps receive Brimstone's "WOW factor", 
              wanting to join. Support is always useful when...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) 
              Raids. A favorite past-time of evil guilds (especially shadowknights) 
              is the raiding of human and other good race's cities. This will 
              certainly draw the "WOW factor" from your race and a bit of respect 
              from the raided race if you do it maturely. Advice: don't loot the 
              corpses of your enemies, this will really make them like you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) 
              Blocks. Due to ogres and troll's large sizes (the two most popular 
              shadowknight races) you can block bridges, tunnels, dungeon entrances, 
              etc. and demand a toll or item for crossing. You can also ambush...<evil snicker> 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) 
              Necromancer's invisibility. Great for ambushes. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) 
              Recover the Dark Reaver, Fleshripper or other very high level Shadowknight 
              only swords and display them in your guild hall for all newbies 
              to see. Major "wow factor". </font></p>

            Guild:</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
            Your members select an imaginary god or relic, and that becomes the 
            focus of your members. You can hold rituals, sacrifices, events, etc... 
            all using that symbol to promote fun roleplay. Your can either be 
            a good aligned version of this, and heal fellow players, escort them 
            to safety, offer free things, etc. Or you can play the evil version 
            of this and harm people, steal them away (If they play along) and 
            perform dark rituals on them, etc. The &quot;Clerical&quot; guild 
            has SO MUCH to offer any RPG.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Knights 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Suits of plate mail, shiny weapons, 
            honor and codes of virtue, all play into this theme. Uniforms should 
            be strictly adhered to, roleplaying is essential, helping innocent 
            players and providing them with safety will be a great focus for the 
            good version of this guild. Of course, on the flip side, is the evil 
            version. The &quot;Anti Paladin&quot; or &quot;Evil Knight&quot;. 
            Endless possibilities on this one...</font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Barbarian 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rugged, mean-spirited, broken 
            english, savage warriors. The barbarian guild, in my opinion, should 
            consist primarily of &quot;Fighter-Types&quot;, with maybe an occasion 
            &quot;Shaman&quot; (aka Healer). Barbarians HATE magic, and therefore, 
            this should be a common element in the &quot;Barbarian Themed&quot; 
            guilds. Be creative when playing this guild type, there are SO many 
            fun things you can do as a mentally-challenged giant.</font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Sage 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ok, Sages are scholars, people 
            who take knowledge and wisdom VERY serious, it is simply the most 
            important aspect of their lives. If you seek to play a sage guild, 
            consider a Single-Theme for your Sages, or perhaps allow your Sages 
            the flexibility to be a master of any skill they wish. Sages 'rarely' 
            fight with weapons of any kind, save the occasional 'bash on the head' 
            from a staff or wand. The &quot;Sage&quot; would much rather battle 
            wits, or debate a given situation, as opposed to drawing blood and 
            risking death. You can of course have &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; 
            themed guilds based around this type.</font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Druidic 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ok, my favorite 'theme' is the 
            Druid. I love the idea of someone who is a master of the natural elements 
            - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, etc. The &quot;Keepers of the Forest&quot;, 
            has many fun possibilities for players. You could play your guild 
            many ways with this theme. Perhaps attacking players who litter, or 
            assisting players who are responsible in the wilderness. Granting 
            escort to players who seem lost in your woods, and have respected 
            their surroundings. Imagine a guild of 15 druids, all hidden (Invisible) 
            in a certain spot of the woods. Some 'lone' player enters the area, 
            unsuspecting... then at once you all emerge and bestow some honor 
            (or threat) upon him/her. You think that he/she would be impressed? 
            You can BET on it. Have fun..</font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Secretive 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Tons of themes can fit into this 
            guild-type. Assassin guild, &quot;Sage&quot; guild, Spy Guild, etc. 
            Find your edge, and stick to it. Perhaps SELL your secretive data 
            for in-game gold. Make mules to spy or blend in with various guild 
            communities, record all you hear, save logs, make them available on 
            web pages, etc. I think that THIS type of guild would be a TON of 
            fun... if done right. Use your imagination!</font></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFF80">Thieves 
            Guild:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> First of all, bank thieves that 
            abuse fellow players and the game engine are pathetic. Using exploits 
            to steal from another player is <b><font color="#FF3333">NOT</font></b> 
            cool, but more along the lines of ignorant, asinine, pathetic and 
            of course, DewDish. I would much rather be a 'mark' to someone who 
            sweet talks me, perhaps bumps into me and steals away with my things, 
            etc. Anything creative in an attempt to rob me is fine... so long 
            as it is honest (you know what I mean), mature, etc. I personally 
            think that you should NEVER exploit someone and leave them high and 
            dry. If you are going to steal, fine, enjoy it and be cool about it. 
            I think that if you wanted to be a 'respected' thief, one with style, 
            you would be quite responsible about it. Perhaps make a web page with 
            your latest 'marks' and details on it. Perhaps offer them a way to 
            get the stuff back, perhaps in exchange for some dark and devious 
            deed, or for gold payment, etc. One last thing: Don't be the kind 
            of guild that uses cheats to break into peoples secure homes... that 
            is 'dewdish' and really pathetic. Instead, stick to more 'social and 
            creative' ways to steal and earn a living.</font></font></p>

            For the most part, your traditional &quot;PK&quot; doesn't really 
            get to involved in &quot;roleplaying&quot;. So to say, &quot;Do one 
            of the above 'themes'&quot;, just wouldn't do. Therefor, I have a 
            suggestion (Based upon various feedback I received after writing the 
            &quot;Kinder PK&quot; article): </font></font></p>

              a &quot;Purpose&quot; and &quot;Trademark&quot;, then kill&nbsp; 
              your 'marks' based upon this criteria. One person told me that they 
              will only kill players who wear green or red clothing. They then 
              only steal items from the player that are &quot;Green&quot; or &quot;Red&quot;. 
              As you can see, without saying much of anything, the feel of &quot;Purpose&quot; 
              and &quot;Reason&quot;, as well as indirect &quot;Roleplaying&quot; 
              sets in. You don't even HAVE to roleplay...</font></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFF80" size="2">Another

              it. They returned just about ALL of the 'marks' belongings, and 
              really only wanted to keep the head. THIS was extremely cool, in
