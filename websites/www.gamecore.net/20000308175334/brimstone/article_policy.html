    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Overview: Sample Policy</b><br>
      To avoid chaos and to limit the amount of &quot;Political Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, you need to
      have a good policy and proceedures in place. If person 'x' does something against the
      policies, and if you have been looking for a reason to remove person 'x', you can always
      fall back on your rules. I always made it a rule of mine NOT to ever remove someone, just
      because I didn't like them. I had to have a reason, and it had to be a valid reason.
      Owning and running a guild should not be a &quot;Popularity Contest&quot;, you shouldn't
      recruit 'cookie cutter' members, and throw out those people who perhaps are different than
      you. I believe that the best guild is a diverse guild, as each person adds a flavor and
      value to your community. Also, if you get in the habit of ruling without any form of
      order,&nbsp; you will not only lose members, but you will never see any new ones either.
      Let me correct myself, you will get members, but they will be the antisocial types who
      didn't cut it in another guild that DID have good rules and enforced them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To help get you on your way, I would like to cut and
      paste the policies that the LOA created so long ago. This was a work in progress for
      MONTHS, and it evolved over time. We removed things that didn't work, and added things
      that needed to be enforced. On our application form, we specifically asked if the person
      applying read the rules and policies. This is to cover our butts should we later choose to
      remove him/her from the guild based on their actions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before moving on, I wanted to point something out. Our
      application form is located at the BOTTOM of our policies page. This is so that people
      HAVE to at least see the page before finding the link to join. :) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Sample Policy - Feel Free to Modify for Your Guild</b>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Lost Order of Akalabeth's Mission Statement:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Lost Order of Akalabeth is a Guild devoted to
        role-playing and ensuring the maximum enjoyment of Ultima Online for as many of the people
        within the Ultima multiverse as possible. We strive to uphold all the Virtues within the
        game, and keep ourselves above reproach. We are a Guild firmly rooted in the concept of
        &quot;Goodness&quot; for all that the term implies. We do not condone mindless player
        killing, and as such shun all those who participate in player killing, yet neither are we
        a Guild of bounty hunters or revenge extractors and do not require our members to
        participate in such activities. We see the Lost Order of Akalabeth as a large family, and
        actively encourage all members to assist each other where ever possible, within the
        constraints of the game and our policies.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Village Policies:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Lost Order of Akalabeth should maintain at least one
        series of buildings for the use of all members. The upkeep of these buildings will be the
        responsibility of the Guild Treasurer and the Guild Leader. A responsible member of the
        Platinum Enforcers unit will be designated to be in charge of the security of these
        buildings. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Guild Equipment:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All members of the Guild are encouraged to donate surplus
        equipment to the Guild. This surplus equipment will be catalogued and overseen by the
        Guild Quartermaster who is responsible for the distribution of this equipment to Guild
        members who require it. The Quartermaster will also be responsible for the furnishing of
        Guild owned buildings.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Policy on Player Killing and Murderers:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The unjustified killing of other players by members of
        the Guild is and will not be tolerated by the Guild, and conversely the Guild will not
        tolerate any other players who engage in this activity. While we believe that such crimes
        should not go unpunished, we as a Guild do not see ourselves as the Judge, Jury, nor
        Executioners in such matters. Because of this we do not enforce it upon our members to
        hunt player killers, and neither do we condemn those members who choose to do so. We see
        this matter as one of personal choice, and will do all within our power to see that the
        hunting of player killers remains so.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Policy on Looting (New):</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We simply ask that you exercise good judgement when you
        loot from a monster felled during a combined effort on the behalf of you and fellow
        members of our Order. It is good practice to give whatever you can to help your fellow
        brethren, this is a great sign of compassion and charity, and is highly valued in our
        Order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During Dungeon Campaigns, designated 'looters' will be
        assigned. If you join a Dungeon Crawl, you must abide by these rules. You are *not* to
        loot during this time. When you all return safely to our compound, the entire horde of
        treasure *will be* shared by all those who attending the mission. Excess equipment *should
        be* donated to the Ring of Merchants, or to a less fortunate member of our Order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This Order is rich in resources, the key to our success
        is sharing and making sure that everyone is taken care of. Thank you for adhering to this
        policy.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Becoming an Initiate of the Order:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before you become an Initiate of this Guild, many things
        must first take place. We need you to fill out the Application Form for our review. After
        that, we ask that you visit our IRC room, on DALnet (Instructions are including below). We
        want to meet you in that chat room, and see what your personality is like. Based on that,
        we will meet up with you IN game, and see how you behave/act when in different situations.
        This step can take days or weeks, that depends on the impression you make with our
        members.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We look for several characteristics in a person AND his
        online persona. To name just a few, we seek those who are loyal, dedicated, honorable,
        responsible, professional, caring, brave, honest, giving, and this list goes on and on. If
        you believe in these things, you are one step ahead of becoming a member to our Order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Pre-Initiation Phase takes as long as needed. It is
        really up to you. If you are IN game alot, and follow the policies, and strive to better
        the entire guild, you will find that the rewards are sweeter than you could have ever
        imagined. By giving your time and loyalty to our Order, you will find that our members
        will always be there for you, through thick and thin. If you do not put forth a strong
        effort to participate, we will drop you from the Initiate Phase, and say goodbye to you.
        The key to this stage is getting to know our members, and striving to show them that you
        are a team player. Also, make sure that you ask them to report your actions and deeds to
        the High Council - this helps us keep track of your good faith and participation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only way to become an Initiate, is when four (4)
        members of the Lost Order of Akalabeth finally vouch for you. People have been known to
        get vouched for in 3 days, others have taken 3 weeks. This method is one that we believe
        in, and it helps filter out people who are not responsible enough to wear the title of the
        Lost Order. Please, do not think that we are a conceited guild, I know that it may sound
        that way. Our members love the fact that they belong to a guild that takes pride in every
        aspect of the game and our following. When you enter our ranks, you will see that THIS
        guild is very different from the others. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the Initiate Phase, you will be treated as an
        equal. You are considered a member of our Order, but still need to polish up on Guild
        Training and your activeness within our Fold. Simply attend meetings, missions and
        constantly display the characteristics expected of our members. Within days, you will be
        assigned the Level One rank, and be removed from Initiate Status.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wish you good luck, friend! Maybe in time, you too will
        wear the title of the Lost Order. Until that day, I fare thee well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brimstone</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>After you are accepted:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you are accepted into our family, many things will
        take place. You will be granted higher security clearances in our Chat Room (Private
        Shrine on IRC), added to our mailing list, added to our Roster Pages, have the option for
        creating a character biography, and the private guild structures will be open to you. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Guild Uniform:</b><font color="#535353"> </font></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our guild uniform is flexible to meet the needs of many.
        Our primary colors are: Steel Blue and Burgundy. Maraxus Moor and several other members
        know the EXACT hue of the colors and will gladly help you get your uniform together.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wearing a uniform is mandatory for all members and
        prospective members. If on your own time, away from the guild, you wish to wear your own
        colors, that is fine. Wearing the guild colors is thought to be an honor and should be
        cherished and worn whenever possible.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Ring of Merchant Unit has a vendor stocked with
        uniforms. A complete uniform costs as little as 75gp. For details, contact ANY member of
        the ROM.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Participation is Key: </b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most important aspect of our guild and our survival,
        is Participation. We have created several methods for you to participate such as: IRC,
        ICQ, Guild Mailing List, Guild Events, Recuiting, Advertising, etc. If you make an attempt
        to meet others, IN and OUT of game, and show the Guild that you truly care - you will do
        just fine. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We realize that each person has there own amount of time
        that can be given towards our guild. Some can play for one hour per week, others have
        given four hours per day! You simply give what you can, and we will respect you for this. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you join the Lost Order of Akalabeth, you will be
        immersed in friendship, honor, dedication and motivation. We all have energy unmatched by
        any other guild, many say that it is the Shard of Light that casts it's warm, powerful
        glow on our hearts. I believe this to be true.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mandatory requirement for our members. When logged into
        Ultima Online, we ask that all members enter our Guild Room on DALnet so that we have
        instant access to each other at all times. IRC acts as our communication crystals, and we
        stress its importance to all members.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are unsure about using mIRC or registering your
        nickname under DALnet, simply contact one of our Shrine Guides found below, and definitely
        read over our <font color="#0000ff">IRC GUILD GUIDE</font>.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For our Wednesday night meetings, or emergency meetings,

        you must be granted permission to speak on a topic, this helps minimize channel traffic.
        ANY member can approach the podium and voice their thoughts, concerns, opinions, etc. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We believe that the only way our guild will be able to
        afford a village (i.e. citadel, castle, outhouse, etc.) is if we ALL participate in giving
        money to a trust fund - managed by Carnifex. I want to call this our &quot;Trust Tax&quot;
        because we will NOT set a percentage or a limitation. We ask that you GIVE as much as you
        can, knowing that it is for a good cause... Survival. If we notice that you NEVER give to
        our Trust Fund... eventually, this will creep up on you... </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We will set up awards and trophies for those of you who

      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We realize that Ultima Online has several classes to
        choose from, as well as the ability to have a MULTICLASS character. Well, I think that for
        our OUT OF GUILD roleplaying side of things, our character classes should be diverse. For
        instance, if you wish to be a FIGHTER/MAGE, wouldn't it be nice to call your class:
        WarMage. If you are a mage that really wants to focus on nature or druidic spell casting,
        instead of MAGE or DRUID, you could call yourself: Earth Mage or Elementalist. My point is
        this, just because Ultima Online provides a basic structure for classes, you can create a
        class other than those given. I think that it would be fun to give yourself a unique class
        - and roleplay this out within the game and in our meetings.</font></p>

      Missions Only!):</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o In any operation there should be one or two leaders who
        will issue orders and speak for the group. This includes any unplanned impromptu
        situations that may arise, some individual MUST take command in a moment's notice and
        everyone must recognize that person as the leader. People should be aware at all times,
        even if only standing around outside the house, what the chain of command is. In any sort
        of emergency situation, that individual must be deferred to. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o Everyone should remain quiet and pay attention to the
        operation leaders unconditionally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o If you MUST say something msg it to the leader in IRC.
        Do not be vocal in game it looks bad and confuses the situation. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o From now on, everyone should be in uniform at all
        times. Only the HC or your unit leader for a special op can dictate exceptions. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o All involved in the operation should be in the private
        channel (#GL-UOGuild) and will likely also be in operation specific channels. This means
        virtually NO communication in the public channel (#Akalabeth). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o If you have problems accessing the private IRC channels
        fix it yourself. It is your responsibility to know how to deal with IRC. If you cannot
        enter the private channel and will not be able to due to networking problems (frequent
        disconnection's, DALnet services not responding, etc.) you should separate yourself from
        the operation. Orders and intel will be conveyed through this channel and without access
        you would be without the information needed to participate. This isn't meant to alienate
        any individual, just a fact of life, you should respect the commanding officer if he/she
        asks you to detach from the operation. Additionally, if you have questions as to how to do
        an operation on DALnet, feel free to ask any ops questions, just don't do it during a
        &quot;situation&quot; or operation. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o Do not convey any operational intelligence to non-LOA
        unless it is an explicit joint operation, in which case a private channel will be arranged
        for all participants. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o There WILL BE respect for leaders. This includes any of
        the High Council, any Team Leaders, any Operational Leaders and anyone who assumes
        leadership position when no one else is of higher rank or able to assume leadership. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o Respect is demanded from ALL members, at all times,
        despite rank or current leadership position. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">o A character's POWER does not make him/her a leader.

        Council. At no stage should a member of the Guild make any promises to assist another
