    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Overview</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have talked with many people who are playing AC, and
      one of the dominant topics is the allegiance system. So many people like the concept,
      however, they just don't know where to start, or better yet, how to start. How do you
      prove your self-worth to others in an online environment that is devoid of real faces,
      real values, real personalities? How do maintain friendships and relationships that will
      last? Once you gain pledges of allegiance (Vassals), how do you keep them faithful to you?
      I hope to give you some pointers in this article, and open up an entire new realm of
      thought that may seem 'obvious' to some, yet completely foreign to others. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Honor, Maturity, Dedication, Professionalism,
      Creativity</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font class="newsFont"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is a fact of life that those
      who are energetic, creative, fun loving, etc. are like magnets in social circles. They
      attract us, draw us in, and make us want to be associated in one way or another with them.
      Oftentimes, people who are charismatic and fun to be around, are popular and never lacking
      friends. This rule does not only apply in real life, but it also crosses over into the
      virtual worlds we know and love. If you take time to speak with others, in mature and
      creative ways, you will definitely make an impression that will last. For instance, I know
      a person who goes by the name of &quot;Santiago&quot; (among many other personae), no
      matter what this player is doing (in any game), everything is an adventure to him. A
      simple trip to the bank can become an epic saga, an encounter with a PK can take a
      hilarious turn. When adventuring with Santiago, it seems that the whole world wants to get
      involved with our group, because we are having that much fun. Do you think that Santiago
      would have a problem with Vassals and Pledges? Not a chance. </font></p>
      <p><font class="newsFont"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I realize that some of you are
      evil beings... or murderous villains. Being &quot;nice&quot; may not be a part of your
      persona. Well, that is a great point, and you must be true to your &quot;roleplay
      persona&quot;, however, you need to realize that real world influences are equally
      important. Make sure that every so often, you step out of character and let people know
      just want kind of person you really are on the inside. You can easily jump back in
      character afterwards, and continue your evil-doing. So many times, I have met player
      killers who just didn't have a clue about maturity, professionalism,
      &quot;Creativity&quot;... they excused all their ignorant actions on the simple statement,
      &quot;Hey, I'm a PlAyErKiLLa, I can't be nice!&quot; - Guess what, that is a crock, pal!
      You are the player who will miserably fail in Asheron's Call and miss the point of the
      Allegiance System. Sure, you may have a bunch of wanna-be &quot;killas&quot; who cling to
      you because you are the strong man of the day, but this group will never last. Why?
      Because they are not interested in you for who you are as a person/character, they are
      only interested in you because of your PVP skill. Once a better ticket comes along, they
      will be history, and so will you. So, if you are playing the part of a 'bad guy/gal' in AC
      right now, you may want to reconsider your play style and make a few creative adjustments.
      </font></p>
      <p><font class="newsFont"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good or evil, you should still
      have <b>honor</b>, <b>compassion</b>, and <b>maturity</b>. Real people are playing behind
      the characters, ranging in ages from 13 to 55 years old. We all have one thing in common,
      we want to have a good time and enjoy the game. Remember that. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>In Game and Out Of Game</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As with any online game, you all realize how huge the
      community is. News sites are jumping, message boards are flying with posts, rants, tips,
      complaints, ideas and more. Guild/Clan sites spring up, often hundreds per week! All in
      all, there is no lack of friends, villain, allies, and even pledges and vassals! They are
      everywhere... it is a virtual meat market out there! So, what are some ways that you can
      secure some friendships, pledges and much desired fame? I will tell you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What you do in game is incredibly important. Whatever
      persona you have for your character, be professional about it. If you are evil, do it with
      pride and be creative. You don't need to be offensive, insulting, vulgar, etc. to emanate
      evil. If you are going to be good aligned, well, be really good. Help people out, guide
      newbies around town or to safety, when needed. Donate excess supplies to those who may
      need them. Train new players in minor fighting or spell techniques. Basically, show others
      how nice and helpful you are, and you will be amazed at how quickly your character name
      (and/or Guild Name) becomes well known in the lands. As a side note, if you run a guild,
      you should be extremely selective during your recruiting phase and bring in members who
      share this vision. If you recruit good and honest people, your guild will be known and
      trusted, beyond a shadow of a doubt. This fame will follow you for years to come, in all
      the games you may enter. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, there are huge opportunities for 'fame advancement'
      outside of the game. Just look around...message boards are everywhere! Use them!
      Everything you post publicly should have the same level of maturity and creativity that
      you have in game. Become a regular, if you can, and get to know the community surrounding
      the various AC News Sites. Crossroads of Dereth is a great place to start, as is AC
      Stratics. The communities are <i>huge</i>, and it won't take long before your nickname is
      known and your words appreciated. As people get to know you on the forums, it won't take
      long before you are bumping into those same people in the game. Instant trust and
      friendship, so long as you are a stand-up person. Also, you should get involved in
      player-quests that are mentioned on the news sites. Attend player weddings. Attend guild
      events. All of these things get you in touch with the community, and your personal
      awareness of the other players will increase each time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fame does not happen overnight. It takes weeks, months,
      even years before you become a household name. Of course, this isn't the rule for people
      who are immature, offensive, rude or basically out to ruin the game for others. Very
      quickly, their names are immortalized forever as being a &quot;Moron&quot;,
      &quot;Punk&quot;, &quot;Idiot&quot;. Not something that I would personally aim for in the
      expanding online game arena. I would much rather work hard and earn my fame, then to do
      something stupid and become known for how much of a jerk I am to others. Make sense? Now,
      there are exceptions to the rule when it comes to how long it may take to earn large fame
      in an online game. Some of these exceptions are: </font><ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">First to obtain a certain level in game. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">First guild to conquer 'Monster X' in game. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reporters and staff members of various news sites are
          usually respected and appreciated. (Hint) </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">People who are known to selflessly help others in game and
          on the forums usually rise to fame quickly. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">People who have comic sites (i.e. rants, real comics for
          the game, etc.) become famous rather quickly. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">People who create 3rd Party Utilities that help players
          with a certain game are often famous. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">People who have large and formidable guilds are usually
          famous. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you host many events that are mentioned on the game
          news sites, you will have your name remembered quite often, usually helping with fame. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you can see, there are many other things that can also
      lead to more public awareness of your character and/or guild. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This all leads to the final topic... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>How To Gain Pledges</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remember, I didn't say this was an overnight process. It
      takes time, skill, patience and lots of face-time with the communities of your game, in
      this case, Asheron's Call. Guilds (in my opinion) may have an easier time with finding
      people who serve as vassals. Especially guilds with solid rules, regulations and
      leadership structures out of game. (Side note: I cannot stress this enough, to be
      successful, you <i>must</i> have a solid leadership structure in place outside of the
      game. Do not use the in game system as the basis for your leadership structure.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some guilds are large, usually well over 100 members. In
      the case of my guild (Shameless plug: <a href="http://www.lostorder.com" target="_blanks">http://www.lostorder.com</a>),
      we have about 160+ members. As we enter new games, such as AC, we already have a good 30
      to 60 members playing that game. Once we announce a Game or Faction leader, our vassals
      know how to line up and who to swear allegiance to. Not everyone is as lucky as we are,
      and it does take time and lots of mistakes to finally succeed. If you are guildless, you
      should strongly consider joining a guild or trying to form your own (another article
      altogether!). You may start at the bottom, but at least that is a start. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you do not want to belong to a guild, but you still
      have visions of becoming famous and having vassals, all is not lost. Many players are out
      there who also do not want to be in a structured and politically explosive organization.
      They want to keep it simple, make a few friends, and enjoy the game. If you can meet up
      with people such as this in game, or on the forums, and if you can show them that you are
      someone to be trusted - you may be on your way to gaining an allegiance of your own. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One thing to remember: Never 'buy' your pledges from
      anyone. If you must pay for popularity, you will lose not only your money, but any chances
      of truly becoming famous in this game. If a player accepts your money and becomes your
      vassal, they don't respect you... they pity you and are only looking to make a quick
      fortune on your behalf. </font></p>
