    <blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><p><b>Overview: Voting Process</b><br>
      Once the applications start coming in, and trust me, they will, you will now be tasked
      with the fun job of monitoring their involvement, their behavior, their &quot;VALUE
      ADDED&quot; for your guild. You don't want to become the home for those players who are
      too 'kewl' for their own good and have been rejected from all the other guilds. This is
      your time to not only show off what your guild is all about, but it is also time for you
      to be selective and to hand pick who will move on to become full members of your guild. </p>
      <p><b>Initiation Process and Some Ideas</b><br>
      When someone petitions you for membership into your guild, you really know nothing about
      them, unless of course they are friends or family of your current members. So you have a
      right to be a little paranoid. Rather than opening the doors wide and allowing people to
      just be, &quot;IN&quot;, I have the following system to suggest to you. The LOA has been
      using this method for well over 6 months now, and it has taken us 2 years to develop, lots
      of trial and error. </p>
      <p>This method can be called, the &quot;Two Step Initiation Phase&quot;. </p>
      <p><font color="#800000">Step one</font>: The Commoner or Total Guild Newbie Phase. Feel
      free to change the names of these ranks to whatever best suits your guild theme or 'edge'.
      &quot;Commoner&quot; happened to fit well in the LOA 'village' community atmosphere. You
      may select names such as: Pawn, Scribe, Apprentice, Novitiate, etc. Have fun with it. </p>
      <p>During this phase, the outsider undergoes training and information gathering. In
      addition to learning your ways, your history, rituals, and all the personalities of your
      members, this will be YOUR time to really take notes and monitor this commoner's actions.
      Normally, thirty (30) days is a good amount of time to form opinions and know if this
      person is 'right' for your guild. </p>
      <p>Once the vote is held, using the method mentioned above (i.e. +1, +, o, -, -1) - you
      can decide if the person deserves full membership, needs more time (another 30 days), or
      should be asked to leave altogether. To reward those who do a good job, yet aren't ready
      for full membership, we have created a rank above Commoner called, Initiate of the Order.
      Still not a full member, but above the other Commoners. </p>
      <p><font color="#800000">Step two</font>: The Initiate of the Order phase. No longer a
      newbie to your guild, this person is now doing well within your framework. He/she has
      showed good activity, showed an interest in your 'theme' and has been learning your
      history and practices. I often consider the Initiates as &quot;Senior Commoners&quot;,
      only because they are excellent sources for our newest commoners to turn to for help. This
      rank should have 'some' nice little perks as well. In Ultima Online, we allowed the
      Initiates to wear the uniform worn by Full members, whereas, Commoners had a totally
      different uniform. Do whatever you can to recognize their achievements, awards and
      recognition are VERY important. </p>
      <p><b>Allowing all Full Members of your Guild the Chance to Vote</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Many guilds have a leader, and oftentimes, that leader calls all the shots. I know that
      when LOA was born, I took on way too many roles when I should have delegated some work to
      others. I was solely in charge of accepting new members, and I did this without much
      interaction from my fellow guildmates. That didn't last long, and the reason for that is
      simple:&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no right assuming that everyone in the guild is going to get
      along with whoever I bring in. I spend maybe one hour per day online, so if the person is
      an idiot, I normally won't see this. Therefor, allowing EVERYONE to vote and share their
      opinions, ensures that the candidate is truly GOOD for everyone, not just you. </p>
      <p>It is most important to allow ALL your members to have a voice in your guild. Seek
      their ideas, their concerns, and make sure you concider them all when making decisions. </p>
      <p>Brimstone, <br>
