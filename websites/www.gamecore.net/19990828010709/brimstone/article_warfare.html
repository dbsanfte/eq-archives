    <blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><p><b>Overview: Organized Guild Warfare System</b><br>
      One of the greatest things that two guilds can achieve with each other is TRUST.
      EVERYTHING that you do in guild warfare, requires trust. With some guilds, the estimate of
      participants can number anywhere from 15 to 200 people, and for the most part, guilds
      often have those one or two members who are 'trouble'. It happens, sometimes, someone will
      break rules and threaten all the hard work you have put into the relationship with another
      guild. This chapter will discuss ways for you to approach a guild for warfare, strengthen
      trust and friendships, and organize some very excellent guild wars. This chapter will
      focus on Ultima Online, however, it can apply to many other games that are being released
      soon. </p>
      <p><b>Your Guild's Image: Mature, Respected and Professional</b><br>
      If you want to be taken seriously, and if you wish to earn the trust of another guild, you
      simply MUST have members who will act maturely and respect the fellow players. Just one
      person can spoil the fun to be had, so you want to make sure that you have the right
      people in your guild, before you go arranging 'Organized Guild Warfare' (OGW). </p>
      <p>If you recruit the right people, and help them grow within your guild, you should be
      fine. Try to stress the importance of your policies, your relations with other
      guilds/players etc. Explain that breaking those rules can and will result in their loss of
      membership. For the most part, guilds who are actively looking to enhance the fun of the
      'game' and 'guild' experience, will have members who will NOT want to be 'banned' and
      removed from that fun. Being on the outside of something so great is NOT fun, and they
      will hopefully shape UP before being shipped out. </p>
      <p><b>Making Your Approach, Finding the Right Enemy!</b><br>
      In earlier chapters, I mentioned the importance of reading guild advertisements on the
      various message boards. There was a reason for that, and I will now go into a little more
      detail. Your guild has a mission, a theme, a reason for being an organization in whatever
      game you play. Everyone has enemies, and therefore, it is imperative that you find a good
      'match' for your guild. If you are the good guys, and perhaps you are a 'Paladin' guild of
      holy heroes, well, you may want to find a nice undead, evil-doing group of damned people.
      That way, right off the bat, you all have something to write about, and something to
      increase the 'RPG element' of your upcoming relationship and battles. </p>
      <p>Once you believe that you have found a match, you now must get to know their membership
      rules, their personalities, their 'goals', etc. If they are KewlDoodz, and if their
      vocabulary consists of 5 words, AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE. Odds are, they aren't
      interested in being fair, or at the very least, they will not help you achieve the high
      levels of role-playing you are looking for. This is an unfortunate stereotype, but one
      that is quite valid with online communities. </p>
      <p>Before you dive into wars, name calling and story telling, first focus on the
      friendship portion of this relationship. Have IRC meetings with them, and discuss your
      backgrounds. Perhaps introduce your real life persona, then introduce your &quot;in
      game&quot; persona. Talk about your guild's goals, morals, purpose, etc. Even discuss some
      combined RPG elements that your guilds will share in common. For instance, the good guys
      may have an artifact of power that grants its owner unlimited knowledge of the mystic
      arts. The opposing guild may be on a quest to remove that artifact from&nbsp; your
      possession, thus making a reason for your war. You have a gajillion reasons that your
      guilds may be at war, so use your imaginations and have fun with this. I promise that by
      the end of your meetings with this enemy guild, you will all truly admire each other and
      look forward to learning more about each other. </p>
      <p>With the seeds of friendship blooming, you can finally discuss bigger and brighter
      things. War. A fun thing that I encourage our members to do is to visit the enemies forums
      (i.e. message boards, chat rooms, etc.) and initiate role-playing confrontations. Keep it
      in game, and don't ever come across as if you are insulting the 'player', and not the
      'character'. Keep it fun. Write stories, perhaps telling tales of your guild winning some
      minor skirmishes, or one character overcoming another. An important thing to consider
      would be to write stories that not only GLAMORIZE your own guild, but also write a few
      that makes your enemy look good as well. This is a good show of faith, and will help
      promote similar actions from your new friends. This is RPG, you win some and you lose
      some, share the fun with everyone. After bombarding the forums of each side with 'War
      Teasers', it is time to organize the event that you have all been waiting for - the
      BATTLE!! </p>
      <p><b>Keeping the Sides Even and Some Rules</b><br>
      As you know, some guilds are larger than others. It is important that you allow the
      smaller guild to set the # of participants for each side. You may be able to put 30
      men/women into combat, whereas your enemy may only have 10. Keep this in mind, and make
      the best of it. Later, I will discuss how you can get ALL your members involved in the
      war, even if they weren't selected to fight against the enemy. After you set the # of
      participants for each side, it is now time to set the rules. </p>
      <p>I believe that looting sucks, and when having a war for fun, there is absolutely NO
      reason to loot and steal from your friends. As I said earlier, we are focusing on UO for
      this chapter, therefore, the rules will cater to UO rules: </p>
      <p><strong>Rule One:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Looting, ever. Unless it is to protect
      your friend/foes things from decaying or being thieved from a third party player. Then
      looting is by all means necessary. </p>
      <p><strong>Rule Two:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Deathrobe Killing. Once you foe is
      killed, allow them to resurrect and have faith that they will remain out of the battle
      until the war is over. Deathrobed players have an important part to play, they will now
      become &quot;Observers&quot;, and be assigned to resurrect other players, as well as to
      guard against 3rd Party Troublemakers. </p>
      <p><strong>Rule Three:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Town Killing. Unless your guilds enjoy
      town killing, and having a swarm of 3rd Party idiots stealing/looting your dead, I would
      simply avoid town wars altogether. It leads to unnecessary chaos. </p>
      <p><strong>Rule Four:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No insults or rudeness to your enemy. Hey,
      this is meant to be a fun event, but still things can get out of hand. If you are upset,
      do not take it out on your enemy. Wait until the war is over, and discuss your
      differences, maturely, with your guild and your enemy forces. Keep a cool head, you will
      be thankful you did later. </p>
      <p><strong>Rule Five:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect and Adhere to the Rules!! Don't
      break rules, bottom line. If you enjoy the wars you have setup, don't go screwing it up!
      Respect each other and respect the rules, always. </p>
      <p><b>The Observer Position</b><br>
      I told you I had a role for ALL your members to fill during the wars, and this is it. The
      Observer Role is a key for every battle. If you don't have enough Observers, I would avoid
      warring until a later time. The Observers must dress in a bright color, so as to stand out
      against the actual war participants. Each Observer is in charge of guarding the fallen
      bodies and loot, resurrecting and healing the dead, and engaging 3rd party idiots who are
      jealous and seek to ruin your events. Trust me, Observers are VERY needed, and this role
      can be quite fun! </p>
      <p>Observers should NEVER take ANY part in the actual battle. Healing participants who are
      fighting is a no-no. You simply are their to watch, protect and if you can, grab a few
      screenshots! </p>
      <p>Once a player has been killed in war, he must get his stuff and then keep his/her
      deathrobe ON. Do not remove it - this robe will set you apart from the other war
      participants. Every person who dies instantly become an Observer once resurrected. </p>
      <p><b>The &quot;Point System&quot; - Upgrading your Forces!</b><br>
      This is all new, and I created it weeks ago after a recent battle between the LOA and the
      OES. We had a hard time keeping the sides fair, while still allowing each side to have
      SOME element of surprise. To remedy this, I decided to take rules from other games and
      apply them to Ultima Online. Thus, the point system. When each guild sets a war, you can
      set the <strong># of human participants</strong>, then assign a <strong># of points</strong>
      for each guild to use as they see fit. This chart can be modified however you see fit, it
      is entirely up to your guilds. </p>

      </center></div><p>Feel free to modify the points according to how you feel they would best
      represent your guilds. We originally had 'Deadly Poison' on this chart, since it can
      seriously impact the war. After some discussion, we decided to remove this cost from the
      system. </p>
      <p>Armed with this table, you can now challenge a guild quite easily by setting the
      maximum points for the war, the time and place, and the number of participants for each
      side. </p>
      <p><strong>After the War</strong><br>
      Once the war is over, it is a good time to hold a mini-festival to celebrate the event
      that just took place. Good and evil, together, can put aside their differences and
      intoxicate their characters into oblivion. This further adds to the friendships that you
      seek to form. The winner of each war SHOULD have bragging rights, that is only right. They
      should be expected to write stories of their victory, posting them all over the known
      forums of man. In addition, it wouldn't hurt to have stories written by the losing side as
      well, as a 'gift' to your enemy, admitting defeat. </p>
      <p>Your stories, screenshots and success with these battles can literally become your KEY
      advertising methods. When you post to message boards about these wars, and display images
      of grand battles... don't you think that you will attract others who will be looking for
      some action? You can bet your arse that you will get applications. Successfully
      implementing guild warfare is a sign of a mature, dedicated, professional guild/leadership
      and members. If you've got it, FLAUNT IT! </p>
      <p><b>The Award for Victory!</b><br>
      The Lost Order of Akalabeth and Order of Ebon Skull haven't set up an award yet for out
      battles, but I think that we may do so soon. It would be nice to have a pot of gold
      (sitting in the bank) reserved for the winning side. Perhaps something like a Sword of
      Vanquishing, or perhaps a pot of 10,000gp, or maybe 2 or 3 full spellbooks, etc. That way,
      when you win, you know that SOMETHING is coming your way. You can set this up with the war
      notice, and simply say that the losing side must have something worth 'x' value to give to
      the winners. It should then be up to the losing side to come up with whatever they choose,
      so long as it all is worth the agreed upon value. It can be cotton, ale, boots, gold, etc.
      - perhaps a funny ending to a great battle! </p>
