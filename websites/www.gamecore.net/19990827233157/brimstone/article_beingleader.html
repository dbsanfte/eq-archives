    <blockquote>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><p><b>Overview: Being a Leader</b><br>
      Forming a guild, running a guild and being a great leader can be quite a task. It requires
      time, patience, humility, wisdom, maturity, and dedication, throw in a bottle of aspirin,
      too. It is cool to run off and make something grand, such as a thriving guild whos name is
      known throughout the lands. That is a wonderful feeling, and that is why so many people
      try to launch their 'own' guilds rather than join up with one that is already established.
      I truly admire the person who is ambitious enough to choose this path and create his/her
      OWN place in this online universe. With that said, let us now look at some of the things
      required to be a good and effective leader. </p>
      <p><b>Do I Like Playing the Game?</b><br>
      If you really enjoy PLAYING the game that your guild is involved with, you may want to
      reconsider being the guild leader. You will find that as your guild grows and grows, you
      are the 'heavy' or the person that everyone comes to. You will be bombarded with email,
      ICQs, private messages in IRC, phone calls, etc. - and you CANNOT blow them off. You must
      answer and respond to everything sent to you, or be labelled a failure by your peers. </p>
      <p>When you log on to the internet, and you are eagerly looking forward to playing the
      game with your friends, realize that a good 1 to 3 hours will be spent managing the
      issues.&nbsp; You have meetings to attend, allies to shmooze, enemies to threaten, new
      recruits knocking on your doors, frustrated members threatening to quit, and the list goes
      on and on. After you handle those jobs, then you can play, finally. </p>
      <p>When you finally DO get in game, consider the joy and pride that your members will have
      when they are with you. Everyone will want a piece of your time, and everyone will want to
      socialize, catch up on the issues, and show you their new weapons, skills, ideas,
      concerns, etc. So prepare to spend time in game, handling more leadership functions that
      are not about playing the &quot;game&quot;, but playing the &quot;leadership role&quot;. </p>
      <p><b>Am I a people person?</b><br>
      If you are not a people person, turn away from guild leadership now. RUN! If you cannot
      mask your frustration, hide your fears, conceal your annoyed feelings, etc., turn away. To
      be a GOOD leader, you need to set aside many of your opinions, many of your stereotypes,
      your own wants and needs and desires, and focus 100% on the people you are leading. They
      depend on you to make the right decisions, the hard decisions that will help push your
      guild in the right direction. </p>
      <p>Far too often, you will find that leaders take the easy road, and become
      &quot;Yes&quot; leaders. They like to be popular and favored, and often take the easy way
      out of decision-making, and go with the flow, for fear of becoming unpopular in front of
      his/her peers. The good leader will not crumble under pressure, and will not go for the
      easy way out. Oftentimes, being a good leader is making decisions that are best for the
      GUILD, and maybe not the individual person or person/s. This is SO hard to do, for you
      risk many things. Your popularity, perhaps members will quit, perhaps other guilds may
      consider you a coward, weak, etc. In my opinion, if you make the RIGHT decision, based on
      your guilds charter and policies, you should be respected. Sure, people may leave, or not
      find you as their 'chum', but they will not be able to deny that you are one to be
      respected. </p>
      <p>Many of the decisions made by the LOA High Council were not always the popular ones. We
      have lost many members, lost an alliance here or there, and we have felt the pressures of
      revolting members... that is life when running a guild. You win some and you lose some,
      and in the end, you learn and grow. Stick to your guns, respect your members and your
      guild policies, and do what is RIGHT, not what is popular and easy. </p>
      <p><b>Lead alone, or with a Council?</b><br>
      If you plan on running a tight-knit guild, with small numbers, go with the one leader
      scenario. You don't need to bog yourself down with too many chiefs. Leading alone has it's
      strong points, and it's bad points too. When leading alone, you often clash less with
      others. Your word, for the most part, is gospel. Unless you send your troops into certain
      death, or embarrass your guild due to horrible decisions, you should be fine. </p>
      <p>Councils are best when your guild becomes large, perhaps 30 or more members. It is very
      hard to do everything, and still remain active and functional. Delegating the work is an
      excellent way to run a tight-ship, keep things moving smoothly, and to give all your
      members access to leadership at almost all times. </p>
      <p>The LOA is large, about 90 members at this time, with about 20 recruits waiting for
      full members. I cannot do it all, and I realize this. Therefor, we have a large council,
      all with various roles and responsibilities. We are all viewed equally, and we respect and
      honor each other at all times. With my real life issues, I maybe get 2 hours a day online.
      I rely HEAVILY upon the other councilmen to do their jobs, and in some cases, help me
      handle my jobs as well. Without our good leaders, all doing their parts, the LOA would
      NEVER have survived. </p>
      <p>Whatever you do, make sure that your Council consists of mature, professional members.
      You need LEVEL-headed people, and if you get just ONE bad seed in the leadership, it can
      sink your ship in the end. Trust me. </p>
      <p><b>Focus On the Guild Entity</b><br>
      I think that it is important to be true to the 'guild entity', as opposed to individuals
      within the guild. If you spent a lot of time creating your guild history, your ideals,
      your objectives, your vision, etc. - don't go changing things for just one person, or a
      few. If you feel that people are bribing you to make changes, or they will quit, it may be
      a good thing to consider letting them go. Why? Because that is NO way for a member to make
      changes. If they are respectful, they will go about making change the correct way. Changes
      should be discussed in some details, perhaps reviewed by EVERYONE in the guild, and then
      voted on. Oftentimes, you will find that 'popular' members have a following of their own.
      They can influence MANY things, where others cannot. Disobeying the &quot;popular&quot;
      guy can lead to many problems, such as losing members, losing your own popularity, etc. So
      long as you stick to your guns, and handle such things collectively with the guild, you
      should be fine. </p>
      <p>I once stated long ago, that I would rather have 5 members who were dedicated and loyal
      to the Lost Order of Akalabeth ideals and concepts, than to have 200 members who did what
      they wanted, when they wanted, how they wanted, with little respect for the leadership.
      You must have guild unity and loyalty to survive.&nbsp; Be willing to let 'inner circles'
      move on to their own devices, if they are not willing to work together with the rest of
      the guild when making changes to your foundation. </p>
