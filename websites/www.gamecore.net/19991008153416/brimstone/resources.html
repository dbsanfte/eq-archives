            or how well it was written... it simply scores the resource as it

            &quot;Extreme Tracking&quot;. As a guild leader, this &quot;Free&quot; 
            resource was extremely useful to me. It allowed me to track what ads 
            were working for our guild. If I posted something catchy, I noticed 
            that our daily hits were jumping up to 200+. Using this resource, 
            I also noticed how many people use the 800x600 resolution, # of colors, 
            browser type, county they are from, etc. With this data, I was able 
            to ensure that the MOST amount of people could view my site without 
            any problems whatsoever. <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 10)</font></font></font></p>

            The absolute greatest Guild Organizer in the world is the, &quot;Guild 
            Boss&quot; application. This program has it all, and more... ;) - 
            You can manage members (and all aspects of members), guild statistics, 
            donations, fees, ranks, allies, enemies, etc. You can also share guild 
            data files with your friends or allies, so that everyone involved 
            has detailed information about each other. Other features include: 
            <font color="#FFFF99">QuickMail:</font> send email to one or more 
            recipients directly from Roster Pane grid, <font color="#FFFF99">QuickPage:</font> 
            send ICQ "EmailExpress" pages to one or more recipients directly from 
            Roster Pane grid, <font color="#FFFF99">Create and save pre-written 
            boilerplate messages</font> and send them off with a click, <font color="#FFFF99">Dynamic

            you need a message board and don't have a &quot;CGI&quot; guy to help 
            you create one, then configure it to your needs... SitePowerUp is 
            for you. They provide FREE (Unlimited) message boards that are easy 
            to apply for, and configure. The only downside to this is that there 
            are 1.) Add banners on all free message boards, 2.) Limited # of special 
            'codes' for forum admins and 3.) sometimes the speed of the boards 
            isn't very good, but not usually. Other than those few gripes, &quot;Free 
            is Free&quot;. I believe that SitePowerUp will soon be offering free 
            &quot;Forms&quot; and &quot;Polls&quot; for its members. With this 
            resource, no guild should be without a message board.<font color="#99CCFF">

            shameless plug, but I hope you will agree that it belongs on this 
            page. I created a service for creating graphics, html, cgi, creative 
            writing and more. The great part is that we accept either real money 
            (USA) or in-game gold (UO and/or EQ). Prices and conversion rates 
            are provided on our site, so take time to view what your best options 
            are. The Mind's Eye have been providing services to guilds and players 
            for well over 2 years now, and we have never had an unsatisfied customer, 
            ever. <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 10)</font></font></small></small></p>

            Extreme Tracking isn't what you are looking for in a counter (ET's 
            counter buried and found on the &quot;Summary&quot; page), you can 
            head over to Yahoo: Free Counters and search for a solution that works 
            for you. Some are java based, cgi, simple HTML script, etc. You simply 
            have to look around and find something that is easy enough for you 
            to setup, and trust me, they are out there! My personal Counter Page 
            of Choice is: <font color="#66FFFF"><a href="http://www.counterguide.com/">Counter

            (Mailing List):</a> </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Every 
            guild MUST have a mailing list, period. This type of service opens 
            up the lines of communication and makes your community much more effective 
            and &quot;In touch&quot; with the issues. Gone are the days of having 
            to CC: a million members each time you wish to send mail. If you don't 
            have access to a &quot;Real&quot; listserver or majordomo, OneList 
            is for you! It is &quot;FREE&quot; and simple to use. Again, all guilds 
            (organizations) should have a mailing list. The LOA uses 5 different 
            mailing lists, all focussed on a given guild concept (i.e. Council, 
            Ultima, EverQuest, Initiates, Main, etc.) <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating:

            in awhile, I make graphics that are called, &quot;Templates&quot;. 
            They are designs that lack guild-specific text, thus being a good 
            canvas for you and/or your artists to customize to your guilds liking. 
            I have included menu images, guild banners and more. I try to add 
            new images each week, but that isn't always the case. Anyway, again, 
            free is great! <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 7)</font></font></small></small></p>

            Journal Converter:</a></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
            This resource is for UO only. Being in a guild, you will definately 
            be faced with policitics in one way or another. I always believe in 
            CYA, otherwise known as, &quot;Cover your ass.&quot; Keeping this 
            in mind, as a guild leader, you should make it known to your members 
            that recording a log and/or snapping a screenshot of 'difficult situations' 
            could be in everyones best interests. The UO Journal Converter is 
            a great tool that actually organizes and manages your Journal. It 
            breaks the journal up into days, and allows you to customize all sorts 
            of things. If you have the drive space available to save your logs, 
            or at least portions of your logs, I would HIGHLY recommend this tool.

            Screenshot:</a> <font color="#FFFFFF">This link leads to a &quot;Direct 
            Download&quot;. As with all downloaded files, please make sure your 
            anti-virus software is up to date. The UO Screenshot file is not hosted 
            on an &quot;Official Site&quot;, so be cautious. With that said, UO 
            Screenshot is simply an amazing tool that EVERYONE should have. So 
            often, great things in game are lost forever because nobody knew how 
            to snap a picture of it. Well, those days are gone! UO Screenshot 
            allows you to snap images in a flash! They also save to your hard-drive 
            in .jpg format, as opposed to .bmp. The old method was using Alt+PrintScreen. 
            This method stored the data into memory, and you would then have to 
            use a Graphics Program to take that data and put it into a file format, 
            then save it, etc.<font color="#99CCFF"> (Rating: 10)</font></font></font></p>

            Chat Client:</a> <font color="#FFFFFF">Another must have for guilds! 
            This program is a client that allows you to Chat on the internet, 
            in real time, with everyone in your channel. You can have HUNDREDS 
            of people in a chat room, and still be able to chat with little (or 
            no) lag at all. I know that many of you use ICQ, and you love it... 
            however, ICQ is more unstable when it comes to security, and ICQ takes 
            up WAY MORE system resources. UO (or any game) will lag more if you 
            have ICQ running, as opposed to running IRC. mIRC (and Internet Chat) 
            takes some time to learn, but will lead to great guild communitation 
            in REAL TIME, as opposed to being restricted to email and/or in game 
            meetings. <font color="#99CCFF">(Rating: 10)</font></font></font></p>
