        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you haven't figured out how to successfully market
        your clan/guild/order yet, then you need to read this article. If you are famous, gaining
        new members each month, and aren't worried about your guilds future - then you can skip
        this one. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When it comes to advertising/marketing your 'guild', you
        must be energetic, creative, and aggressive - always looking for a way to get YOUR GUILD
        NAME and URL onto a high-traffic site. Period. Once you are in the limelight, the magic
        will begin. There are a few things that must be done to attract attention to yourself,
        your guild, your members, your stories, (you get the picture), etc. 1.) You must have
        something WORTH sharing with the community, 2.) You need to be creative and detailed with
        whatever it is you are sharing, 3.) You should make sure that you provide all the
        necessary information, 4.) If possible, you should make sure that your 'news article' is
        cleanly written, spell checked and perhaps &quot;HTML READY&quot;. I have learned from
        MANY news sites that the reporters LOVE IT when someone submits articles/news that already
        contains the correct HTML coding. They will love you, and they will usually post your news
        without a hitch.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Something Worth Sharing:</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">News sites aren't usually interested in the fact that
        your guild is, &quot;Now Recruiting!&quot; or &quot;Open for business!!&quot; - who cares.
        News sites want to know about events - both guild and game related, creativity involving
        the game - such as your tales of adventure or something wonderful that is worth sharing
        with the rest of the community. Also, news sites are very interested in your discoveries -
        such as new spells, game systems, artifacts, hidden levels and so on. If you can use this
        to 'structure' your news in a way that it appeals to any of those categories, you are
        almost in business. You see, if your guild is planning a nice event, you can either
        advertise on your guild page and attract a small audience (usually your own
        members/allies), or you can think big and have it appear on a news site, attracting
        hundreds (possibly thousands) of people. If your guild has created a guide, resource,
        program, map, spell listing, or some other 'useful' information that the community should
        see, that is also a GREAT way to indirectly advertise your guild and get THOUSANDS and
        thousands of visits (which will indirectly lead to people asking about membership into
        your guild/clan - trust me). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The hardest part about recruiting and growing your guild
        is becoming &quot;KNOWN&quot; to the community. Once people become familiar with your name
        and web address, the rest is pretty much easier. Your guild's management team (officers,
        council, 'whatever') should be aggressively seeking new places and methods to get guild
        related news posted to the community. Like the title of this article says, &quot;The
        Squeaky Guild Gets the Grease&quot;, meaning that if a guild is visible enough and
        creative enough, they will get the &quot;members&quot; and &quot;fame&quot;.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You Need to be Creative, Detailed &amp; Provide All
      the Information</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you draft your news article, keep in mind that you
        want to share this with several news sites for that game. You want the news to be clear,
        concise and very informative. If you have someone in your guild who is GOOD at writing,
        perhaps have him/her write up all your guild ads. If you have someone good at HTML, let
        them take that ad and make it LOOK nice for forums and news sites. Make sure your news
        items ALWAYS provide a link back to your guild's web site, contains an email address for a
        guild contact person, and always sign off with your guild's name written out (along with
        your guild's abbreviation). This will help with your visibility and the awareness that the
        community will have for your organization. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
        If planning an event, make sure you share the vital information: Time, Date, Location,
        Reason for the event, Possible prizes to be given away, various events/games that will be
        held, etc. If your event is &quot;ROLEPLAY ORIENTED&quot;, perhaps provide a mini-write-up
        for it, giving a taste of what it is all about. If you make it interesting enough and
        build the suspense, people WILL attend.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Spell Check and HTML Ready!</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you write your news item and reread it to yourself a
        few times to make sure it is accurate, you should then SPELLCHECK your writing and add the
        HTML to it. I usually add the HTML elements AFTER I write the news/article. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
        After the news is ready to go, I send a copy of it to myself via email, and then place
        that 'ad' in a folder called, &quot;Guild Ads&quot;. That way, if the event is recurring,
        I will have a copy on file. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Other Topics: Email Addresses for News Sites &amp;
      Guild Advertising</b> </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's say that you are playing Asheron's Call and
        everything you do as a guild revolves around that game. Your news will be for AC related
        sites, your guild advertising will be for AC players, etc. You should go out and find ALL
        of the PREMIUM news sites and keep a list of the email addresses used to submit news for
        each of them. Once you complete this task, email it to yourself (for a copy in your files)
        for future use. That way, when you have new news to announce, you won't have to VISIT each
        site to get the word out. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(<b>TIP:</b> Send INDIVIDUAL EMAILS to each news site. I
        think that as a news site staff member, it is a turn-off to see the names of '5' other
        news agencies on the same message. I realize this takes a little more time, but it will be
        well worth it.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throughout this article I focused on Guild Event/News
        Items, but didn't really mention anything about good, old fashioned &quot;Guild Ads&quot;.
        I love well written guild ads, they are VERY IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of things. As
        with other news that you will be writing, make sure you write the ad first, spell check
        it, add the HTML, then mail a copy to yourself for your files. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(<b>TIP #1:</b> Before going on your Guild Advertising
        Campaign and posting your newly written guild ad, make sure you first TEST IT on your own
        forum. You will save yourself some embarrassment should there be errors with your HTML.
        Once you SEE your ad looking good, go ahead and cut/paste it onto other forums.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(<b>Tip #2:</b> While visiting all of the &quot;GUILD
        ORIENTED&quot; forums, record the URL for those forums into an email message and send it
        to yourself - yep, for your files! In the future, it will save TONS OF TIME when you go to
        advertise again.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When advertising, please make sure you keep your guild
        ads to the 'Guild Forums'. If you don't, you will DEFINITELY upset the natives and your ad
        will lose it's effectiveness. Also, it is an embarrassment for your guild, trust me... I
        know firsthand. (The learning process can be SO difficult) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The nice thing about Guild Forums is that they are less
        traveled and posted on. That means that your ads will persist for days, weeks, even
        months! People tend to visit guild forums to have a look... read a few posts, then move
        on. I posted ads about 7 months ago for our EQ faction and I am STILL receiving site
        visits from that ad! Amazing... it goes to show you that your ads DO work, if you stick to
        the rules. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(<b>Tip #3:</b> Get tracking services right now for your
        site. I highly recommend &quot;Extreme Tracking&quot;, a free service that monitors your
        site and records information about visitors. It is what I use to find out where people are
        learning about our guild, or who is talking about us (and posting our URL). I love
        sneaking up on a guild message board and replying to a post someone made about me or the
        guild I am involved in. It makes me feel... well... KEWL. For the URL to Extreme Tracking,
        visit: <a href="http://www.gamecore.net/brimstone" target="_top">http://www.gamecore.net/brimstone</a>
        and click on the &quot;Resources&quot; link.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, it is all about being persistent and
        aggressive with your guild advertising. You must constantly be working on ways to get your
        NAME (guildname) onto a site that has a TON of traffic. If you aren't doing this, you will
        not grow as fast as you possibly can... nor will you attract some of the super-creative
        members of the gaming community. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(<b>Warning:</b> Once your guild is in the spotlight a
        few times and people are aware of your existence, DO expect to have ANTI-SOCIAL players
        applying for your guild/clan. It happens. Like leeches, they hop from one host to another
        looking out for themselves and nobody else. Avoid them like the plague and someday they
        will grow up and be QUALITY members of a guild.)</font></font></p>
