            <p><small><font face="Verdana" color="#99FFFF" size="2">Overview: 
              The WOW Factor</font></small></p>
            </b> 
            <p><small><font face="Verdana">If you belong to a guild that has gone 
              unnoticed for weeks, months or even years... it is truly a shame. 
              Unless of course you want to remain low-key, in which case, you 
              will not find much use in this particular article. What I will 'touch' 
              upon in this article is the use of &quot;Style&quot; that inevitably 
              leads to great events, creativity, 'shock' value, and the infamous, 
              &quot;Wow Factor&quot;! For years, I have worked hard (with my colleagues) 
              to perfect this 'concept', and I believe that we are quite good 
              at it now. It has helped us become somewhat famous, and now, I wish 
              to share some of these &quot;Trade&quot; secrets with other guilds. 
              Perhaps you too can earn some fame and recognition using these ideas 
              and methods.</font></small></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#99FFFF" size="2">What 
              is the &quot;WOW&quot; Factor?</font></b></font></p>
            <p><small><font face="Verdana">Simply put, the &quot;WOW&quot; factor 
              is anything that you (or your guild) does in game (or out) that 
              will make other players stop, take notice, feed their curiosities 
              and perhaps make them wonder who you are, what you are doing, why, 
              etc. The WOW factor should also inspire players, breed excitement 
              and wonder, and hopefully lead to players asking more and more questions 
              about the guild and/or organization responsible for the &quot;WOW&quot; 
              event. </font></small></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#99FFFF" size="2">Initiating 
              a WOW Event</font></b></font></p>
            <p><small><font face="Verdana">Once you understand the concept of 
              this article, you can start working on your &quot;WOW&quot; event. 
              Make sure your guild reads this as well, so that EVERYONE is on 
              the same page, and eager to join in on the action. As a team, you 
              can do amazing things and earn some fame for your guild in the process. 
              </font></small></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana" color="#99FFFF"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Step 
                one:</font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                Define an event that is on topic with your guild's theme or purpose. 
                If you are a good-aligned guild of healers, consider a 'wow' event 
                based on that. If you are evil murderers, then make sure your 
                event has that feel to it. No matter what your theme is, you need 
                to do this with STYLE above all else. <font color="#FF6666">Style, 
                imagination and mature gameplay</font> is <font color="#FF6666"><b>key</b></font>... 
                always. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" color="#99FFFF"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Step 
                two:</font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                Once your event is discussed and agreed upon, make sure that everyone 
                participating is motivated and serious about the event. To make 
                this believable, to capture your audience and make people rave 
                about what it is you are doing, you must stick to the gameplan. 
                If you have people involved who aren't seriously about it... they 
                are best off left at home. Also, try to gear the event at a time/date 
                that is best for the majority of your members, although I am sure 
                I didn't have to say that...</font></p>
            </div>
            <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF" size="2"><b>Step 
              three:</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              Advertising. If your event is something for the masses, make sure 
              you write up the announcement in a creative way. Good grammar, spelling, 
              etc. Make sure you send this notice to all the big 'news' sites 
              for that game, as they can make/break your big event. <font color="#FF9999">Examples 
              of the &quot;Big&quot; event would be: Grand Opening of a new Player-Run 
              Shop, War between two guilds, races, clans, etc., The beginning 
              of a player-run quest, joining of forces to conquer some VERY difficult 
              monster, etc. </font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              your event is low-key, then skip the advertising part. Sometimes, 
              you can repeat certain things, day to day, that are extremely 'WOW' 
              oriented and lead to excellent fame and notoriety among the other 
              players. <font color="#FF9999">Examples: You could perhaps guard 
              the miners everyday at 4pm EST, and help thwart the murderers and 
              looters. You could perhaps escort fallen victims from a certain 
              dungeon, everyday, like clockwork. You could donate new weapons 
              and armor to players who were killed by local murdering guilds. 
              </font>If you set something up that is repeated, and something creative 
              and/or respected by the community, expect some fame to come of this. 
              I could literally name thousands of things, simple things, that 
              could put you and your guild on the map, forever. More examples: 
              You could make daily visits to a given shrine, where free heals/resurrections 
              are given to players in need. You could guard 'known murdering zones' 
              and protect players from harm, if possible.<font color="#99FF99"> 
              If you are an evil player, you could do the opposite of all these 
              things: Haunt various graveyards, every day, making threats and 
              being creative about how you approach new victims. You could hide 
              in a dungeon room or corridor, with SEVERAL guild members, and perhaps 
              swarm onto an unsuspecting victim - perhaps &quot;Forcing&quot; 
              them to engage in some ritual, before you &quot;set them free&quot; 
              (Remember, you don't have to 'kill' your victims to come across 
              as being evil, feared and loathed). You could charge fees at a certain 
              crossroad, demanding payment from anyone who enters that area, failure 
              to pay could lead to harm and/or death.</font></font></div>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              I have said before, you MUST keep 'style' in mind for everything 
              you do. The &quot;WOW&quot; factor will not work if you aren't stylish 
              in your presentation. I also wanted to say that anyone can accomplish 
              this 'concept', that includes roleplayers, player killers and everyone 
              in-between. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#66FFFF">Closing 
              Statement about the WOW Factor</font></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Armed 
              with this information, I hope that you will work together with your 
              guildmates and come up with unique ideas that will 'wow' your audience, 
              and perhaps earn you some fame, some notoriety and hopefully, new 
              members and alliances. You don't have to make everything you do 
              a &quot;WOW&quot; oriented event, but your guild SHOULD try to do 
              things once in awhile that are indeed focussed on 'WOW'ing' the 
              players around you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              larger the guild, the easier it will be to implement your ideas 
              and events. With more players involved, it is easier to impress 
              other players. This poses a huge challenge to smaller guilds who 
              have less than 5 members.<font color="#FF9999"> For the smaller 
              guilds out there, I have some STRONG advice for you. 1.) Be organized. 
              2.) If playing Ultima Online, or any game like UO, wear the same 
              uniform. This makes a great impression and builds awareness of your 
              guild &amp; colors, 3.) Stick to a simple, repeated &quot;WOW&quot; 
              factor event until you grow in size. For example, make your guild 
              synonymous with perhaps a certain dungeon, or town, or shrine, etc. 
              Either help players, OFTEN... or become a known threat (with style, 
              always use style) to players in a given area/zone. Eventually, you 
              WILL become known and player will either join your cause, or rally 
              up against you. (If you have used style and respected your victims, 
              they won't &quot;hate&quot; you during their attacks against you, 
              it will be more of a mutually respect they have for you and thus, 
              wish to engage in PVP with you on a fair and honest level).</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              you are looking for some ideas or concepts, I don't mind helping 
              you and your guild. I cannot spend large amounts of time chatting 
              with anyone about the concepts in this article (or the others), 
              so I hope you will understand if I must cut our discussion short. 
              I am hoping that from this article, you were inspired to create 
              an event, or series of events, that will be implemented with style 
              and 'fun' gameplay in mind for all parties involved.</font></p>
