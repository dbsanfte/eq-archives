    <blockquote>
      <div><b><p><font color="#99FFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Overview: The WOW Factor</font></p>
      </b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you belong to a guild that has gone unnoticed for
      weeks, months or even years... it is truly a shame. Unless of course you want to remain
      low-key, in which case, you will not find much use in this particular article. What I will
      'touch' upon in this article is the use of &quot;Style&quot; that inevitably leads to
      great events, creativity, 'shock' value, and the infamous, &quot;Wow Factor&quot;! For
      years, I have worked hard (with my colleagues) to perfect this 'concept', and I believe
      that we are quite good at it now. It has helped us become somewhat famous, and now, I wish
      to share some of these &quot;Trade&quot; secrets with other guilds. Perhaps you too can
      earn some fame and recognition using these ideas and methods.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99FFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What is the &quot;WOW&quot; Factor?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Simply put, the &quot;WOW&quot; factor is anything that
      you (or your guild) does in game (or out) that will make other players stop, take notice,
      feed their curiosities and perhaps make them wonder who you are, what you are doing, why,
      etc. The WOW factor should also inspire players, breed excitement and wonder, and
      hopefully lead to players asking more and more questions about the guild and/or
      organization responsible for the &quot;WOW&quot; event. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#99FFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Initiating a WOW Event</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you understand the concept of this article, you can
      start working on your &quot;WOW&quot; event. Make sure your guild reads this as well, so
      that EVERYONE is on the same page, and eager to join in on the action. As a team, you can
      do amazing things and earn some fame for your guild in the process. </font></p>
      </div><blockquote>
        <div><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><b>Step one:</b></font> Define
        an event that is on topic with your guild's theme or purpose. If you are a good-aligned
        guild of healers, consider a 'wow' event based on that. If you are evil murderers, then
        make sure your event has that feel to it. No matter what your theme is, you need to do
        this with STYLE above all else. <font color="#FF6666">Style, imagination and mature
        gameplay</font> is <font color="#FF6666"><b>key</b></font>... always. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#99FFFF"><b>Step two:</b></font> Once your
        event is discussed and agreed upon, make sure that everyone participating is motivated and
        serious about the event. To make this believable, to capture your audience and make people
        rave about what it is you are doing, you must stick to the gameplan. If you have people
        involved who aren't seriously about it... they are best off left at home. Also, try to
        gear the event at a time/date that is best for the majority of your members, although I am
        sure I didn't have to say that...</font></p>
        </div><div><b><font color="#99FFFF"><p></font><font color="#99FFFF" face="Verdana"
        size="2">Step three:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Advertising. If your event
        is something for the masses, make sure you write up the announcement in a creative way.
        Good grammar, spelling, etc. Make sure you send this notice to all the big 'news' sites
        for that game, as they can make/break your big event. <font color="#FF9999">Examples of
        the &quot;Big&quot; event would be: Grand Opening of a new Player-Run Shop, War between
        two guilds, races, clans, etc., The beginning of a player-run quest, joining of forces to
        conquer some VERY difficult monster, etc. </font>If your event is low-key, then skip the
        advertising part. Sometimes, you can repeat certain things, day to day, that are extremely
        'WOW' oriented and lead to excellent fame and notoriety among the other players. <font
        color="#FF9999">Examples: You could perhaps guard the miners everyday at 4pm EST, and help
        thwart the murderers and looters. You could perhaps escort fallen victims from a certain
        dungeon, everyday, like clockwork. You could donate new weapons and armor to players who
        were killed by local murdering guilds. </font>If you set something up that is repeated,
        and something creative and/or respected by the community, expect some fame to come of
        this. I could literally name thousands of things, simple things, that could put you and
        your guild on the map, forever. More examples: You could make daily visits to a given
        shrine, where free heals/resurrections are given to players in need. You could guard
        'known murdering zones' and protect players from harm, if possible.<font color="#99FF99">
        If you are an evil player, you could do the opposite of all these things: Haunt various
        graveyards, every day, making threats and being creative about how you approach new
        victims. You could hide in a dungeon room or corridor, with SEVERAL guild members, and
        perhaps swarm onto an unsuspecting victim - perhaps &quot;Forcing&quot; them to engage in
        some ritual, before you &quot;set them free&quot; (Remember, you don't have to 'kill' your
        victims to come across as being evil, feared and loathed). You could charge fees at a
        certain crossroad, demanding payment from anyone who enters that area, failure to pay
        could lead to harm and/or death.</font></font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <div><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As I have said before, you MUST keep 'style' in mind
      for everything you do. The &quot;WOW&quot; factor will not work if you aren't stylish in
      your presentation. I also wanted to say that anyone can accomplish this 'concept', that
      includes roleplayers, player killers and everyone in-between. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#66FFFF" face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Closing Statement about the WOW Factor</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Armed with this information, I hope that you will work
      together with your guildmates and come up with unique ideas that will 'wow' your audience,
      and perhaps earn you some fame, some notoriety and hopefully, new members and alliances.
      You don't have to make everything you do a &quot;WOW&quot; oriented event, but your guild
      SHOULD try to do things once in awhile that are indeed focussed on 'WOW'ing' the players
      around you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The larger the guild, the easier it will be to implement
      your ideas and events. With more players involved, it is easier to impress other players.
      This poses a huge challenge to smaller guilds who have less than 5 members.<font
      color="#FF9999"> For the smaller guilds out there, I have some STRONG advice for you. 1.)
      Be organized. 2.) If playing Ultima Online, or any game like UO, wear the same uniform.
      This makes a great impression and builds awareness of your guild &amp; colors, 3.) Stick
      to a simple, repeated &quot;WOW&quot; factor event until you grow in size. For example,
      make your guild synonymous with perhaps a certain dungeon, or town, or shrine, etc. Either
      help players, OFTEN... or become a known threat (with style, always use style) to players
      in a given area/zone. Eventually, you WILL become known and player will either join your
      cause, or rally up against you. (If you have used style and respected your victims, they
      won't &quot;hate&quot; you during their attacks against you, it will be more of a mutually
      respect they have for you and thus, wish to engage in PVP with you on a fair and honest
      level).</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are looking for some ideas or concepts, I don't
      mind helping you and your guild. I cannot spend large amounts of time chatting with anyone
      about the concepts in this article (or the others), so I hope you will understand if I
      must cut our discussion short. I am hoping that from this article, you were inspired to
      create an event, or series of events, that will be implemented with style and 'fun'
      gameplay in mind for all parties involved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
