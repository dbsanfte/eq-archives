      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Overview: Voting Process</b><br>
      Once the applications start coming in, and trust me, they will, you will now be tasked
      with the fun job of monitoring their involvement, their behavior, their &quot;VALUE
      ADDED&quot; for your guild. You don't want to become the home for those players who are
      too 'kewl' for their own good and have been rejected from all the other guilds. This is
      your time to not only show off what your guild is all about, but it is also time for you
      to be selective and to hand pick who will move on to become full members of your guild. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Initiation Process and Some Ideas</b><br>
      When someone petitions you for membership into your guild, you really know nothing about
      them, unless of course they are friends or family of your current members. So you have a
      right to be a little paranoid. Rather than opening the doors wide and allowing people to
      just be, &quot;IN&quot;, I have the following system to suggest to you. The LOA has been
      using this method for well over 6 months now, and it has taken us 2 years to develop, lots
      of trial and error. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This method can be called, the &quot;Two Step Initiation
      Phase&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#800000">Step one</font>: The Commoner or
      Total Guild Newbie Phase. Feel free to change the names of these ranks to whatever best
      suits your guild theme or 'edge'. &quot;Commoner&quot; happened to fit well in the LOA
      'village' community atmosphere. You may select names such as: Pawn, Scribe, Apprentice,
      Novitiate, etc. Have fun with it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During this phase, the outsider undergoes training and
      information gathering. In addition to learning your ways, your history, rituals, and all
      the personalities of your members, this will be YOUR time to really take notes and monitor
      this commoner's actions. Normally, thirty (30) days is a good amount of time to form
      opinions and know if this person is 'right' for your guild. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once the vote is held, using the method mentioned above
      (i.e. +1, +, o, -, -1) - you can decide if the person deserves full membership, needs more
      time (another 30 days), or should be asked to leave altogether. To reward those who do a
      good job, yet aren't ready for full membership, we have created a rank above Commoner
      called, Initiate of the Order. Still not a full member, but above the other Commoners. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#800000">Step two</font>: The Initiate of
      the Order phase. No longer a newbie to your guild, this person is now doing well within
      your framework. He/she has showed good activity, showed an interest in your 'theme' and
      has been learning your history and practices. I often consider the Initiates as
      &quot;Senior Commoners&quot;, only because they are excellent sources for our newest
      commoners to turn to for help. This rank should have 'some' nice little perks as well. In
      Ultima Online, we allowed the Initiates to wear the uniform worn by Full members, whereas,
      Commoners had a totally different uniform. Do whatever you can to recognize their
      achievements, awards and recognition are VERY important. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Allowing all Full Members of your Guild the Chance to
      Vote</b><br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many guilds have a leader, and oftentimes, that leader
      calls all the shots. I know that when LOA was born, I took on way too many roles when I
      should have delegated some work to others. I was solely in charge of accepting new
      members, and I did this without much interaction from my fellow guildmates. That didn't
      last long, and the reason for that is simple:&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no right assuming that
      everyone in the guild is going to get along with whoever I bring in. I spend maybe one
      hour per day online, so if the person is an idiot, I normally won't see this. Therefor,
      allowing EVERYONE to vote and share their opinions, ensures that the candidate is truly
      GOOD for everyone, not just you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is most important to allow ALL your members to have a
      voice in your guild. Seek their ideas, their concerns, and make sure you concider them all
      when making decisions. </font></p>
