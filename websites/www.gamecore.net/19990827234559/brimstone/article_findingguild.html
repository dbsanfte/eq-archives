              are at the point in your online career that you wish to seek a guild, 
              a group of players who will hopefully enrich your online gaming 
              experiences and perhaps lead to many new friendships. Guilds come 
              in many flavors, such as roleplaying, PVP (or powergaming), or a 
              mixture of both RP and PVP. In addition to those flavors is the 
              age factor of guilds, some are a younger crowd while others are 
              older and a bit more reserved. Top this off with the fact that there 
              are literally thousands to choose from, and you have yourself a 
              heck of a task ahead of you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              this guide, I hope to answer some questions, provide some helpful 
              tips and hopefully point you in the right direction in your quest 
              for finding a home for you and your online character.</font></p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              you are guildless and looking, you are worth your weight in gold. 
              There is a guild out there right now looking for you, a guild that 
              has hopes and dreams of becoming large, famous, and prosperous. 
              That is a great feeling for you, the guildless. You have some power 
              in your hands, if used properly. You should take time and do your 
              homework, search around, interview guild members in game or in IRC/Message 
              Boards, ask around, etc. Don't JUMP into anything, it isn't worth 
              it. Once you find the right guild and you believe in this guild, 
              you truly should dedicate yourself to making THAT guild the very 
              best. You shouldn't expect a hand out, you shouldn't expect people 
              to pour all their time into you, and you shouldn't expect to have 
              your way with their hard-earned possessions in game. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stated 
              that you were needed and wanted in a guild out there, and this is 
              true. You deserve respect from your guild of choice, you deserve 
              some 'breaking in' time and some hands-on training in the guild 
              rules and goals. You do not however, deserve hand outs. Once you 
              join a guild, you become a part of that force and must contribute 
              equally to earn any forms of payment, rank, awards or wealth. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              a guild leader, I have always focused on the PERSON behind the character, 
              not the character. I focus on what the person is like, morally. 
              Does he/she worry about their share of loot? Or do they first worry 
              that everyone else is taken care of? If the person applying for 
              our guild is a truly nice person, giving and respectful, loyal and 
              hard working, they are THEN, and only then, worth their weight in 
              gold. I have witnessed players who sought to join a guild for one 
              purpose, mooching and leeching from our hard earned success, and 
              often not wanting to offer anything in return. Players like this 
              jump from one guild to the next, often unable to survive and persist 
              in ANY guild for more than a month or two.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DON'T 
            be that kind of guild member... </font></p>

            Do You Really Want?</font></b></font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 
              need to really think hard about what you want in a guild. Who are 
              you and what is your character going to be like when you play? Are 
              you evil? Are you good? Do you like the ocean? Are you aspiring 
              to tame dragons and use them to serve Justice? Do you see yourself 
              sacrificing innocents and praying to the dark gods of Sosaria/Norrath? 
              If you are joining a 'theme' guild, you will have to define your 
              character before applying or searching for a guild. Also, if your 
              heart lies in the roleplaying environment, please think hard before 
              joining a PVP oriented guild. This is a stereotype, but for the 
              most part, PVP guilds aren't too fond of roleplayers, and roleplayers 
              don't mix well with PVP oriented people/guilds. It is a fact, I 
              have seen this first hand. If you can find a guild that truly loves 
              both and has worked to mesh the two styles, then jump on that application 
              form and snatch it up fast!</font></p>

            Roleplaying Guild</font></b></font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
              because a guild says they roleplay, doesn't mean they REALLY roleplay 
              well. I have seen guilds claim to be RP oriented, yet they were 
              involved in major PVP, their RP skills, if used, were horrible and 
              crude, and they basically had a bad reputation. If a guild is active 
              and truly roleplays, you will see this quite clearly on their public 
              pages and forums. Their news will be written in a roleplay manner 
              (sometimes), their site will most likely have stories written in 
              RP, their message boards will usually have posts written in RP, 
              and their chat rooms will readily accept RPing within, and not look 
              at you like an idiot. Of course, if you meet this guild 'in game' 
              and they roleplay well, that is a huge bonus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              you wish to make a GREAT impression on a guild of this nature, prepare 
              a biography for your character and tell the guild a story about 
              your persona. Make them WANT to have you in their guild. Also, when 
              you fill out the application form, praise this guild and tell them 
              WHY you selected them to be your new home. Guilds love hearing this, 
              it helps pump up the motivation and also tells them indirectly that 
              they are doing SOMETHING right.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roleplaying 
              guilds and players are often stereotyped by PVP guilds as being 
              goofy, stupid, queer, too caught up in the game, etc. Depending 
              on how deep your guild-choice is involved in roleplaying, expect 
              SOME negative comments from PVP guilds who fall under the &quot;Immature&quot; 
              category. </font></p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              join a PVP guild, you pretty much need to know your stuff. You should 
              be well versed in the various skills in that game that are KEY to 
              fighting prowess. If archery is the new skill on the block, then 
              learn it fast and master it. Most PVP players also find comfort 
              in the use of 3rd party programs, this isn't a bad thing, it is 
              simply a necessity. Your enemies have these tools and if you plan 
              to survive and help a guild get the 'edge' over their enemies, you 
              need to have the proper tools of the trade. Period. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have 
              noticed that a lot of PVP players feel the need to brag a lot. This 
              isn't a blanket statement, and it certainly doesn't apply to every 
              player who PVPs, however, the majority that I have met does fall 
              into this category. I risk much by saying this, but I strongly believe 
              it to be true. If you can PVP well, that is a great thing and you 
              need to let the guild know. More importantly, you need to log in 
              and PROVE it. Get your hands dirty, kick some ass and take names. 
              Even if you die, at least you can make some form of impression on 
              the guild you wish to join. I think that if you can PVP well, and 
              NOT brag and become arrogant about it, you will be the very BEST 
              PVP-type player in game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have 
              noticed that there are two types of PVP guilds: <b><font color="#6666FF">Immature</font></b> 
              and <b><font color="#6666FF">Mature</font></b>. You will find that 
              many (not all) younger players fall into the Immature area, and 
              hey, that is normal. They are young, impressionable, and they readily 
              fit in to that crowd. I am not making fun of them here, simply making 
              an observation. Also, this younger crowd of PVPrs aren't too shabby, 
              they are effective at fighting styles. One of the major downfalls 
              of this crowd is their use of bad language, game exploiting, hacks, 
              cheats, abusive actions against other players, and last but not 
              least, the use of &quot;KeWlDuDe'ish&quot; typing. This form of 
              player seeks to not only hurt the characters in game, but seeks 
              to hurt the player behind the keyboard on an emotional level. As 
              you can see, this is my opinion and my guide, so take this with 
              a grain of salt and make of it what you will. I am sure I will get 
              lots of flak for this. To counter this statement, I can say that 
              I *have* met young players (13-14yr) who were every bit as mature 
              as the others in our guild.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              for the Mature PVP guild, they are quite simply the best to join. 
              They are respectful of the roleplaying guilds, and give them room 
              to breath. They are perfectionists at the art of PVPing, they often 
              use the 3rd party programs to further excel at PVP, and their members 
              refrain *usually* from the use of bad language, exploits, abusive 
              behavior, etc. Simply put, they love PVP and enjoy a good fight. 
              They aren't looking to hurt the PLAYER behind the character. If 
              you to join a good PVP guild that is worth anything and will make 
              you a better person, join the Mature PVP guild. They are out there.

            Mixed Guild of RP and PVP</font></b> </font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              exists, I swear. I happen to love this form of guild, and I should, 
              this is what I created long ago with the other LOA founding fathers. 
              It is a volatile mixture, that is for sure, and it takes time to 
              nurture and build. To this day, we still have some issues creep 
              up on us, and sometimes, it leads to revolts, members quitting, 
              hurt feelings and a drop in guild moral. A large price to pay for 
              a diversified guild. At any rate, if you can find a guild like this, 
              in the shard/server of your choice, strongly consider it. It gives 
              you access to creative playing styles, up to date information on 
              in-game plots and stories, as well as access to very competant PVP 
              players. If you join a guild like this, make sure you take your 
              time to get acquainted first, before jumping right in. Get to know 
              the members, the guild history, the mentality behind what is right 
              and wrong for that guild, etc. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
              that revolts and guild upsets are frequent in this form of group 
              because you have to very different 'goals' and 'mentality'. The 
              roleplayers aren't big on Anti- or Pking. The RPrs often feel that 
              3rd party programs are 'cheating', they feel that the PVPrs perhaps 
              earn all the fame and often considered the 'heroes' when they answer 
              a call for help, or lead a successful raid. There is also the &quot;Circle&quot; 
              effect that diverse guilds face. When you have two or three elements 
              in a guild, such as RP and PVP, you will see very defined 'circles' 
              of friendships taking place. The RP members bond together, and the 
              PVP members bond together, and then some members find friendships 
              in BOTH groups. So long as the member to member respect is healthy 
              and enforced, this situation will not blow up on you. If a highly 
              successful or famous player on the RP or the PVP circle comes under 
              'percieved' attack by the other members of the guild, or the Council 
              of the guild, expect the boat to rock. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              a player in a guild like this, expect moral issues to come into 
              play, it happens. If you still strongly believe in the leadership 
              and the ideals of the guild, be loyal and faithful to the GUILD 
              and the leadership, not the members who have personal issues with 
              the guild and leadership. I have seen people quit, thinking they 
              were making the right decision, only to ask for readmittance days 
              or weeks later. They got caught up in someone else's problems, and 
              left without thinking about how much happiness they truly found 
              in that guild. Luckily, our guild believes that members in good 
              standing should readily be allowed back into our fold, for they 
              made a mistake and learned from it. Other guilds aren't so forgiving, 
              so make sure you hold your tongue until you are 100% sure you wish 
              to go... </font></p>

              press (i.e. saving someone from a PK, being a ruthless killer, donating 
              gold to newbies, guiding someone to a shop they are looking for, 
              etc.), and you out-of-game actions ALSO can lead to good press (i.e. 
              Intelligent posts to public message boards, game resource pages 
              for players, leading a cause for the game you play, donating graphics

              great advertising for your guild. So do it, and let others know 
              why YOUR guild is the best.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              closing, here is a tip for ALL guild members, no matter WHAT form 
              of guild you are in. If you want to progress, get awards, get promotions, 
              become famous, earn respect, etc. - you need to make your deeds 
              and actions KNOWN to everyone in your guild. The best way to do 
              this is via a report. Simply write your report of your deed/s via 
              your guild mailing list, message board, icq, etc. and send it to 
              everyone who is in your guild. Do this, and be proud. :)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, 
              the LOA has found that the stories submitted (often in RP style) 
              were excellent sources for advertising our guild to the RP community. 
              In addition, getting screenshots of PVP battles and writing stories 
              in OOC also lead to great advertising to the PVP players out there. 
              Again, the members of the guild made a huge impact on our success.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope 
              that this helps all of you seeking to become a member of a guild, 
              or seeking to get noticed more in the guild you are in. There is 
              no reason why you should simply &quot;BE&quot; in a guild and not 
              contribute as much as possible. As a member of a guild, you can 
              make a humungous impact and lead your friends to great success and 
              fame. Don't hold back, be creative, be inventive, be involved and 
              be thankful.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, 
              if you feel that the leadership or the guild overall is no longer 
              as good as it used to be, make sure you mention this in meetings, 
              using tact, of course. As a member, you deserve the chance to share 
              your concerns and keep the leadership of that guild on track. Without 
              good leaders, a guild will most likely fail. If your leaders cannot 
              handle your 'tactful' comments, perhaps it is time to begin your 
              quest and search for another guild.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              very last thing I want to mention is... you are playing a game, 
              your guild is comprised of many different people, different ages, 
              different nationalities, and different moral codes. Don't get too 
              personally involved in anything that will make you an unhappy person. 
              Have FUN with the games you play and the guild you are in. I have 
              gone full circle now, and I know very well the 'personal' side of 
              being in a guild. I have lost sleep, I have lost friends I met online, 
              I have been depressed at times, etc. This is all part of being in 
              a guild and associated with people on a day to day basis. If you 
              know you cannot handle such things, avoid a guild altogether and 
              keep things simple.</font></p>
