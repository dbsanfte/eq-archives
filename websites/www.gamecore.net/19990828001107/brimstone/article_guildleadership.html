    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Overview<br>
      </strong><br>
      I wanted to write something that could help guilds get started, and give<br>
      them a checklist of things that they should do to get noticed, attract<br>
      their target market (recuits) and to thrive in whatever game they play.<br>
      I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to building online<br>
      communities, and keeping them from stagnating. Prior to building the<br>
      Lost Order of Akalabeth for Ultima Online, I worked with the mailing list<br>
      community called, &quot;Games-L&quot;. I basically took a mailing list of 900+ people,<br>
      and turned it into a web based community that shared technical knowledge of<br>
      games, hardware, software, etc. So what I am about to share with you is<br>
      4 years of trial and error, and tips and tricks that have made the LOA<br>
      succeed, as well as many other guilds who I have helped. <br>
      <br>
      I don't want to come across as arrogant, please, that is not my goal here.<br>
      I don't want to sound like I am Mr. Guildman, and I can do no wrong. I simply<br>
      want to share with you some of the things that have worked for us, and<br>
      continues to work to this day. Take what you like from this, and mend it<br>
      into whatever works for you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Guild Charter and your Edge</strong><br>
      <br>
      What is it that sets your guild apart from others? What do you plan to<br>
      do in the game you have selected to play in? Will you be good, evil, neutral?<br>
      Do you wish to be a large guild, or a small faction of players? Roleplay or<br>
      Powergamers? Perhaps both? <br>
      <br>
      Your guild charter and your 'edge' is one of the most important things<br>
      you can do for your guild. It will be duplicated on almost all your <br>
      advertisements, your web page, etc. If you do NOT have the writing skills<br>
      to come up with something well written, SEEK A WRITER either within your<br>
      guild, or outside of your guild, to help. You do not want to come across<br>
      as a guild of kewldudez, who cannot spell or speak properly. You want your<br>
      charter to be powerful, descriptive, concise, and to the point. If you need<br>
      help in this arena, you can visit our message board and ask for one of our<br>
      writers to help you out. They 'may' work for free, or perhaps charge you<br>
      either in game money, or real money. I doubt the latter will be asked for.<br>
      If this doesn't sound good to you, ask your fellow guildmates or your RL<br>
      friends to help out.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Webpage Presence<br>
      </strong><br>
      Before you go advertising all over the place, you want to make sure that<br>
      people who visit your site are WOWED when they get there. They took the<br>
      time to ACTUALLY click on your link, and learn more, last thing you want<br>
      is to display poorly designed graphics, design, or worse yet, a site that<br>
      is TOO BUSY and takes forever to load.<br>
      <br>
      Create a page that looks good, both the HTML design and the graphics. If<br>
      you need help, again, visit our message board and ask, or seek those who<br>
      you know in RL to assist you. If you are an evil guild, make the look dark<br>
      and foreboding. If you are a good guild, go with a lighter look and feel.<br>
      <br>
      Make sure that you have an easy to find a.) email addy for point of contact,<br>
      b.) message board, c.) news page. If you DO have a news page, KEEP IT<br>
      UPDATED EVERY DAY if possible. Nothing worse than visiting an inactive<br>
      guild. Your news in many cases becomes your HOOK. Show everyone how active<br>
      YOUR guild is. Show us WHY we should join or ally with you, as opposed<br>
      to the gajillion other guilds who are out there. Your news page should load<br>
      fast, be well written, and easy on the eyes. If you cannot do that, again,<br>
      seek help.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Policies, Rules, Procedures, Application Form<br>
      </strong><br>
      Ok, now we are at your site, and I like what I see. I want to learn more,<br>
      about your ethics, morals, rules, etc. I should be able to find this<br>
      EASILY from your main entry page. TAKE THE TIME to work on this information,<br>
      it is crucial. Make sure you specify the type of guild you will become.<br>
      If you don't want foul-mouthed freaks, say so. If you only want RPG'rs,<br>
      say so, if you are looking for excellent PVPrs, say so, etc. Don't worry<br>
      about hurting feelings, you are looking for the BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR 'YOUR'<br>
      guild. Trust me, you will be thankful later on when you grow to an enormous<br>
      size and the political mumbo-jumbo begins. <br>
      <br>
      I would recommend that you hold off on 'guild fees' and taxes just yet. <br>
      Instead, the LOA adapted a &quot;Trust Tax&quot; system. We wanted people to donate to <br>
      the guild if and when they could. This system worked well, and the LOA still<br>
      has about 1,000,000gp in the bank (Ultima Online) - a fully constructed<br>
      player-run village, etc. It works, and it is less intrusive.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Advertising your guild, finally!<br>
      </strong><br>
      With your foundation built, you can now start spreading the word about your<br>
      guild. Get a listing of ALL the EverQuest (or game your are playing) message<br>
      boards, all the EQ mailing lists, all the EQ newsgroups, and any other <br>
      RPG gaming resource forums and record them in an email message, addressed to <br>
      yourself (and guildmates). This will be your guide for future posts as well.<br>
      I normally write my advertisements in an email first, making sure everything<br>
      is spelled correctly, all the HTML tags work, and all the images are working.<br>
      I then cut and paste this massive message into memory, and start visiting all<br>
      the links from my EQ Forums Email Message I made. One by one, I post the<br>
      ad over and over again. Just once per forum - don't go pissing people off!<br>
      <br>
      Try to make each advertisement a mature, well written document. If you make<br>
      spelling errors, poor grammar, etc. in this message, people will flame you,<br>
      make fun of you, and ignore your posts from that point on. So take your time,<br>
      seek help if you need to. <br>
      <br>
      Try to make the TOPIC of this message count! Be descriptive so that people<br>
      know what they are going to be reading when the click on your link. Nobody<br>
      likes to waste time loading posts that are not what they wanted to see.<br>
      <br>
      Each post you make should include your ICQ #, your email address, your<br>
      guild URL (Make it clickable, if you know how to), your message board<br>
      URL, and your guild charter. Even if your message is a reply to another<br>
      persons post, you should include that information. Oftentimes, if you are<br>
      an intelligent poster, it can act as advertising and attract people to<br>
      learn more about you and your guild. I have witnessed this by posting<br>
      roleplaying stories to various lists, after reading the stories, people<br>
      joined our guild because they wanted to be a part of the magic. <br>
      <br>
      To end this topic, everything you say publicly should be well thought out,<br>
      IF YOU WANT to make that impression you are looking for. If you don't<br>
      care about guilds, or attracting friends and guildmates, <em>then don't worry<br>
      about what you say to the boards.</em><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Things that are good advertising for your guild:<br>
      </strong><br>
      a.) Roleplaying stories written about your guild, or about your day to day adventures.</small><big><br>
      </big><small>b.) Screenshots of interesting things your guild/members have done.</small><big><br>
      </big><small>c.) Utilities created by your guild and shared with everyone.</small><big><br>
      </big><small>d.) Sharing tips and tricks with everyone via forums.</small><big><br>
      </big><small>e.) HELPING PEOPLE 'just because'. When you give your time and help, people
      will tell their friends about you and your guild.</small><big><br>
      </big><small>f.) This list of things goes on and on. Advertising can be anything. We even
      have guild t-shirts with our logo/URL on them. :) That may be overkill, but it sure was
      fun!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Help Others Whenever Possible<br>
      </strong><br>
      Go out of your way to assist other guilds at all costs. Why? Because they <br>
      will become your friends, your allies, your 'rpg' enemies that you can<br>
      trust to play fair, etc. Also, in the future as guilds desolve, you may<br>
      find that people will join YOUR guild if/when theirs has been disbanded.<br>
      Everything you do now, will come back to you later. If you are a jerk now,<br>
      don't expect people to like you later. If you go out of your way to help<br>
      people with HTML, Java, Msg Boards, Graphics, etc - they may very well be<br>
      the people with tons of gold in EQ, a castle, a guild of 300+, etc. Basically,<br>
      the kind of person you WANT TO KNOW. <br>
      <br>
      I love helping people, and I know that when I do something for a guild now,<br>
      they will remember me later and help me out if/when they can. If you all do<br>
      this now, you can all appreciate and thrive together. Help those evil guilds<br>
      rise to power! You can RP a war with them down the road! <br>
      <br>
      <strong>EQ isn't out yet, but you can start the RP Wars Now!!</strong></small><br>
      <small><strong>If playing UO, do THIS to add more excitement to your guild:</strong><br>
      <br>
      If you can find a guild who is a race you hate, or a class you hate, <br>
      or whatever, approach them NOW and discuss some formal rules for <br>
      war. First via your message boards and stories, then later, in game.<br>
      The LOA and Order of the Ebon Skull (OES) started off this way. We didn't<br>
      trust each other at first, so we kept our war OUT of game and fought via<br>
      words on our message boards. In time, we grew to respect each other and<br>
      moved the war to the game. We now fight all the time, never loot from<br>
      each other, and after battles are over, we heal each other, drink together,<br>
      and then write stories in RP fashion about the battles we just had. In most<br>
      cases, the stories and message board wars are more fun than playing the GAME!!<br>
      Don't ignore the guild ads you see, read them, learn who else is out there,<br>
      and approach them NOW, while everyone has time on their hands to get involved<br>
      in this. You will NOT regret this later.<br>
      <br>
      For an example of this, visit the LOA and OES message board. You will SEE <br>
      what I mean. <br>

      <strong>Closing Words</strong><br>
      <br>
      I hope that you got something out of this message. Like I said, I am no expert,<br>
      but I do have a few good ideas up my sleeve. If you want to chat more about<br>
      some strategies to raise your guild awareness, let me know. I love doing this<br>
      stuff. If you hate what I said and think I am a fool, I am sorry to disappoint<br>
      you. <br>
      <br>
      I hope that in months down the road, I can hear from some of you and see if<br>
      this letter helped anyone out. I hope that you can print this document out, and<br>
      refer to it once in awhile. See if you are doing all that you can to succeed.<br>
      <br>
      Respectfully submitted,<br>
