      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><!-- Story -->Inspired by Aleph Aeirs, Founder of the Heralds of the
      Awakening, Atlantic Shard<br>
      <br>
      Just a few days ago, I called someone who I met online through UO. He is a dedicated,
      creative, inspirational 'rolemodel' for the Atlantic players. I called him to discuss
      various topics about our shard, including his new organization (HOA). During this
      conversation, the topic of &quot;Very famous/visible&quot; people came up, and we were
      soon discussing how some people handle fame within the UO (or really 'any' community).
      This brief discussion is what inspired me to write this column.<br>
      <br>
      As the years have gone by, I have gained some 'fame' (for what that is worth) in the
      online community. I can't say that I set out for that recognition, but it did come after a
      long time of building my guild, sharing our 'ideas and methods', as well as helping other
      guilds with web pages, graphics and more. We (the LOA) learned early on that sharing ideas
      and HELPING others really does pay in the long run. By making a small logo for a guild (15
      minutes of my time), for free (or for a minimal cost), that guild would no doubt remember
      my name (and the name of the guild I lead), and they would be quite responsive to our
      needs in the future. This is a lesson that many guilds and players will hopefully learn,
      eventually, as more and more 'virtual world-like' games are released. You get what you
      give, no more and no less.<br>
      <br>
      As more and more people learned about my 'alias', and as the fame of our guild continued
      to grow, we tried very hard to keep things in perspective. We didn't want to become
      conceited, 'too good to help others', 'too busy with ourselves to spend time with the
      community', and so on. In fact, to this day, we receive letters from players and guilds
      for all sorts of games, including Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron's Call and many others
      - all asking for tips/advice on how to 'run a guild effectively', 'how to advertise and
      become noticed', 'how to recruit quality people and not get caught up in quantity only'.
      We seldom turn aside requests for help/knowledge - and that has been such a great thing
      for our Order. I have enjoyed the last 3 years very much, so much in fact that helping
      build communities is one of my proudest achievements in life. That statement may have some
      of you laughing or shaking your heads, however, it goes further than that... the skills
      and lessons learned from the virtual communities has translated QUITE well into my real
      world job and duties. As we approach the year 2000 and beyond, our workplaces, social
      gathering places, family lives, etc. will become more and more about physical communites
      and virtual communities that share a common theme. I know, this is altogether another
      'topic' for another 'article'. <br>
      <br>
      So, how does this tie into the column 'Title', &quot;Leaving Your Egos at the Door&quot;?<br>
      <br>
      As you prosper in the community - be it UO, EQ, AC or even in the real life... don't get
      so caught up in yourself that you no longer have time to help those who truly need it. As
      you become famous, you also become a leader, indirectly. People see you and your
      accomplishments, and they want to either be a part of your magic, or learn from your
      lessons. Either way, you should do your best to either help them out, or nicely explain
      that you cannot assist them due to limited time. <br>
      <br>
      It is also important to know that despite how much fame and recognition you have earned to
      this date, it can very quickly come crashing down around you in a puff of smoke! If you
      carry your ego around with you, and if you talk down to others, or consider yourself above
      reproach, and think that what you say is 'gospel', and others should 'bow down before
      you', you will become a <b>&quot;has been&quot;</b>, and your name will turn to dust.
      (What a long sentence)<br>
      <br>
      My time is limited, moreso than ever... and I have had to step away from playing UO,
      leading the LOA (at a pace that I enjoyed), reading/sending email, reading/sending ICQ
      messages, and basically being a presence IN &quot;Sosaria&quot;. Real life has put the
      &quot;Smack Down&quot; on my virtual life, and there is nothing (at this time) that I can
      do about it. In the 1 to 3 hours I have, per week, to be 'online' - I still manage to
      answer those who come to me for advice, guidance, ideas or simply support. It may take a
      week or two (or three), but eventually... I will respond. I hope that there are many other
      people out there who freely give their time and wisdom to others who take the time to ask
      for help. As a matter of fact, if you know of such a person, I would like to know who they
      are, as well as a few words (from you) about their 'character', and how they have
      impressed you over time with their deeds/actions. Perhaps in a future column, I will
      simply highlight those people and their deeds, maybe inspiring yet others to do the same.<br>
      <br>
      Take care, friends... <br>
