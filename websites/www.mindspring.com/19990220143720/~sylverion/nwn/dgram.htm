Withstanding irregular forms, a plural is completed by "en" if it ends in a 
consonant or "n" if it ends in a vowel.

II. POSSESSIVE CASE
<P>
Coincidentally, the possessive case in the Drow language is very similar to
the Common Tongue used by most races.  The possessive case is completed with
"'s" except if the word ends in "s" where upon "'" is added.

III. VERBS
<P>
A verb has different forms depending on its number (singular or plural);
person (first, second, third); voice (active, passive); tense (present,
past, future, present perfect, past perfect, future perfect); and mood
(indicative, imperative, subjunctive).
<P>
NUMBER:  Withstanding irregular verbs, the singular form is completed with
"ar".

subjunctive moods.

V.   ADVERBS
<P>
Adverbs, like adjectives, have three forms: positive, comparative, and
