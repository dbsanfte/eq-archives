Located to the South of Vilnask, Crossergate is a small town that serves as a convenient resting place for weary travelers on their way to or back from Triboar.  In fact, resting and restocking in Crossergate is a necessity for travelers continuing on to Triboar since the Lost Hills must be crossed to reach Triboar.  To serve the needs of the numerous wandering adventurers that pass through the town, Crossergate has many shops and inns including the famed Western Weapon Shoppe and the Crossergate Curious Items Emporium.

Recently, the Lord Protector has reported unusual activity at night where caravans seem to disappear!  Fearing some dire plot, the Lord Protector has sought help from the mayor of Neverwinter, Lord Nasher.  Lord Nasher in turn has asked the help of various adventurers in solving this mystery.
