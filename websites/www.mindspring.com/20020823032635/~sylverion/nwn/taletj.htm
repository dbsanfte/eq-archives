Among the few possessions she took with her when she left her house is a tiny picture of her mother, illuminated with faerie fire.  Xeno doesn't leave it out on the shelf, where it would be a constant reminder of the childhood she detested, but instead keeps it at the bottom of one of his drawers.  His.  She still thinks of this cave as his, perhaps because she has so very few things still, so that she could probably still fit them all in her little bag.  She hasn't touched his decorations, she doesn't say a word about the rusty swords in the corner, the dust bullettes under the bed.  Besides, she wouldn't even know how to make it clean like her room in Lylyl or even her childhood room in Xorlarrin.  That was what the servants were for.<BR><BR>

She would take the picture out sometimes when she was alone, when she was already thinking about it.  She waits until he has some kind of important business, when she knows he will be gone for some time, and then she can think of these things.  She hates showing him her melancholy side, she hates to think of when she first knew him, when she feared for her life at every step, when she knew she couldn't travel alone, yet she had no one to travel with...<BR><BR>

She gets a light travelling bag, just enough for two nights, not even a change of clothes.  He is out on some errand and she searches everywhere, trying to find him.  She had told him when she would leave, and why she was going, although she wasn't even exactly clear on her motives herself.  She was hoping he would be here to see her off.  She found Zeus in the dining room and asked him.  "I dunno, he was just here..."<BR><BR>

"I wanted to say goodbye..."<BR><BR>

"You leaving?"<BR><BR>

She told him where she was going.  He wished her a safe trip... was that worry on his face?  She assured him she was well-prepared to handle any adversity she encountered.<BR><BR>

She went back to the cave she shared with Modalex and sat on the bed.  She picked up his pillow, inhaling his scent into her, wishing she could take him with her.  She wished she could make him understand how she felt, but she didn't think she ever could.  She scribbled a few words down on a scroll.<BR><BR>

My love...<BR><BR>

I miss you every moment we are apart.  I know I will not see you again for a few days, but know that I am dreaming of you each second.<BR><BR>

Yours forever,<BR><BR>
Xeno<BR><BR>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
She was sure that she could have written that better, but she hadn't.  She sighed and left it there on the crumpled bedclothes.  She looked at the mess she had left when she got her things together and wondered how he felt about her untidiness, about having to do so much for her.<BR><BR>

She went out, and travelled for some distance across the woods, through the cities, and then finally the sickening ride across the water.  She knew the exact spot there, her mother had taught it to her on their first trip to the surface, Xeno's tiny hand in her mother's larger one as she showed her how to find the secret door that would bring her to the portal directly into Rilauven, to the mushroom grove behind Xorlarrin.<BR><BR>

And she was home.  She stood silent, beneath one of the largest mushrooms, just listening to the few noises she could pick up.  She had to be careful here, she didn't want anyone to notice her presence and attack her, or even worse, invite her to tea.  She wasn't going to use any magic until she got there, to conserve her strength, to make sure she was strong enough to do it alone.  Yes... the way was clear...<BR><BR>

She slips out of the city without being detected, and moves a short distance through the winding tunnels.  There is a place just here... too narrow for males, so the patrols never pass through.  She crawls slowly, the sharp rocks in the walls tearing her dress slightly, grazing her elbows and knees every few feet, for what seems like hours.  She finally crawls out of the hole on a ledge, having to turn her body as she comes out so as not to fall off.  She lies there for many minutes, gently feeling her body for the bruises and abrasions that cover her, listening.  No healing, not with what lies ahead.  Slowly she looks out over the edge, scanning the walls.  Of course it is very quiet here, it always was.  She is the only creature here, for now.  She slowly stands, and inches her way down the ledge, until she can jump down to the next one.  Climbing, jumping down, she finally reaches the cavern floor, just inches from the edge of the water.<BR><BR>

She leans and looks into the inky pool.  The waters lie still, and it's not obvious just how deep it goes.  She sees her face in the water, unbroken by a single ripple.  She wonders if she can do it.<BR><BR>

Bringing a hand to the surface of the water, just touching it, barely breaking the surface.  The ripples move, her reflected face breaking into arc lines, and then settle again.<BR><BR>

She whispers and concentrates on the spell.  "Lady Midnight... Mother..."<BR><BR>

The water suddenly heats beneath her palm, and she sees bubbles rising, her face breaking up again and settling, until she sees it shifting, her features changing slightly.  She seems older.  She keeps her hand there, feeling the water burning, steam rising from it, and then the features shift again, and she sees the face, from her earliest memories, and also from the picture she keeps with her still.<BR><BR>

The faint voice echoes from the walls around her.  "Dalharil."  The face is stern.<BR><BR>

"I did it, you are here."<BR><BR>

"Xas, Xeno.  What do you want?"  A faint smile from her mother and Xeno feels the energy draining from her rapidly.  "We don't have long."<BR><BR>

"I want to know... you never told me so many things."  She tries to fight the emotion, not to cry.<BR><BR>

"I know, Xeno.  You have done well without me though.  You are stronger than I ever imagined.  I don't know about this bonding thing, it does not follow our customs."<BR><BR>

Xeno feels the heat rising through her palm, and has to fight to keep herself there, to keep the concentration, the energy, long enough to get the information she wants.<BR><BR>

"Does it follow our customs.for an ilharess to leave her house, her babies, with no word of where she is going?"  The bitterness rising in her throat....<BR><BR>

She sees the frown on her mother's face.  "You are stronger than you ever would have been, Xeno.  What do you want?"<BR><BR>

"You never told me..." she trails off, not sure how to bring it up.<BR><BR>

"Quickly, Xeno."<BR><BR>

"I mean you told me about him but you would never say his name.  Which one... who was it?"<BR><BR>

A smile curves her mother's lips.  Is that a lascivious look on her face? "You are among them now.  You can find that out for yourself quite easily. Is this what you brought me here for?"<BR><BR>

"You never said goodbye," Xeno whispers, and feels the tears coming unbidden.<BR><BR>

Her mother shakes her head, a sad look, and is gone suddenly.<BR><BR>

It is an effort then to tear herself from the pool, she feels the pull, stronger than she would have imagined.  Her muscles screaming as she forces herself back, up away, moving to the far wall, finally collapsing on the floor, exhausted.  She remembers the stern lecture on the dangers of being pulled in.  She curses herself for crying and breaking the spell.  All this way... to find out nothing.<BR><BR>

Almost too tired to untie her bag, to pull out the few rations she has stored there, to lay out the bed roll and crawl into it.  She struggles with the buttons on her dress but they are too tiny for her.  She wonders how he can undo them and do them up so easily, briefly smiles as she remembers them together, him laughing at her clumsily doing her buttons up wrong, and kissing her, buttoning them correctly without even looking.  She concentrates on her thoughts of him, imagines him holding her, tries to forget the warnings about relaxing here, especially after opening the portal, sleep rushing to claim her just as she recalls the last part of the lecture, something about dreams.<BR><BR>

She is awake and the journey back is long.  She is young again, much much younger, but she goes back to the cavern, dirty, still covered with cuts, limping slightly.  She knows her hair is a mess.  So tired.  She goes to his cave but it is empty, nothing, not her things, not his things.  She goes to see Zeus, thinking he will know.  He looks at her and laughs, she tries to say hello but he won't talk to her.  She goes to the kitchen and sees Del with his cookpot and opens her mouth to speak.  "No soup!  No soup for you, little girl!"  "But I don't want soup, just to know where he is."  He is still yelling "No soup!" and waving a ladle and she runs back out to the hall.  She sees him in the distance, his glowing blue hair giving him away, and she runs towards him as she sees him holding a strange drow woman she's never seen before to him, reaching down and kissing her... and she stops, thinking there must be some mistake, but then they look over at her and laugh.  She looks at Mod, waiting for him to explain, and all he does is shake his head and walk away from her, holding this other woman's hand...<BR><BR>

"No!" she is awake suddenly, sitting up in the darkness of the cave, her heart pounding.  She feels her dress sticking to her where the blood dried from the cuts she got crawling through the tunnel.<BR><BR>

Words suddenly remembered from long ago... [there is great danger after... they will use your worst fears to bring you to the brink, especially if you relax, and if you dream, you will most likely be lost.  Never sleep here.]<BR><BR>

Her heart pounding, she can feel them near still, in the pool perhaps or in the air above her head?  She can travel now, she is rested enough she supposes, taking a few sips from her flask, barely tasting the thick liquid, measuring the amount she needs for fortification, then eating more of her travel food, trying to decide whether or not it's better than Del's soup. Must get out.  She is ready then and she doesn't have to travel back the way she came, she can use her magic, and be on the surface very quickly...<BR><BR>

The journey back across the river is hard, she never liked boats, the rocking motion, and she is weak now from the long night.  Finally she is back in town, and she goes to the cheapest hotel in the waterfront district, knowing that no one she knows will ever find her there.  Limping the next morning still as she visits a tailor and buys some new clothes, she hadn't even brought another dress with her, and this one is all ripped, and she doesn't want him to ask her about it.  She loves buying dresses now in all different colors, not having to always show the colors of her house.<BR><BR>

She comes back to find him but she feels funny.  She so wanted it to be different, she wanted to jump on him and show him how much she missed him, but instead she sits quietly near him, not touching him, talking in a low voice about how she feels, about how she wishes her life was different, there were so many things she could have done differently.  He is so sweet as he strokes her hair, trying to make her feel better, giving her the advice he can.<BR><BR>

They are still speaking as Zeus comes hurtling into the room, jumps on her and starts hugging her.  "Xeno!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<BR><BR>

Her sadness leaving her despite herself as he pulls her hair and tells her how much they missed her.  She is glad to be with her family again.<BR><BR>
