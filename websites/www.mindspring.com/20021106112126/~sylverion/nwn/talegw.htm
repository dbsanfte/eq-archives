</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>     The drow of Bregan D'Aerth swept across the moonlit valley in a silent wave, picking up speed as they neared the KAAOS encampment near the gates of Neverwinter. The Second Great War among the guilds had come down to this battle, and there would be no quarter asked and none given.</P>
<P>     Stain was surprised to see that the KAAOS army was ready and waiting; he had hoped to catch the "gods" unaware, but it didn't matter now. The forces of both sides were committed, and the battle was joined.</P>
<P>     As soon as he entered the camp, Stain was surprised to see that his own squad of assassins had come face to face with Rellik's team. Stain eyed the KAAOS commander's group and quickly called together his fighting partners -- Glaeros, XO2 Zeus, and Modalex. They swarmed in on the KAAOS group, daggers flashing and spells sizzling. The fog and dust quickly obscured the fight, and confusion set in. Stain wondered if the so-called "gods" could even control the elements and cause such chaos. He heard Modalex shout that Slayve had been struck down, but then Stain saw Zeus stagger back and fall through the swirls of mist.</P>
<P>     And then he saw Rellik, somehow separated from the other KAAOS fighters, watching for an opening. Stain grabbed Glaeros as he was rushing by, whispered to him quickly, then grinned as Glaeros disappeared into the confusion. Stain advanced directly on Rellik, grinning widely and waving the daggers in each hand. Rellik spun and faced off against the Bregan leader, scowling from underneath his basilisk-horn helmet.</P>
<P>     "Wooooooo!!!! C'mon Rellik, it's time to start the party, ya freak!" Stain howled. "Get yer god-butt over here and let me pimp-slap that ugly grin off yer face!"</P>
<P>     Rellik growled and advanced, ready to strike with his legendary dagger. The two commanders squared off, both grinning evilly at this early chance encounter. But then, just as Rellik was about to lunge, his eyes flew open wide and he pitched forward. Glaeros was standing behind him holding a long dagger that was bloody to the hilt. Glaeros grinned, waved, and gave Stain a mock salute, then rushed away into the battle.</P>
<P>     Stain feigned a look of shock as he watched Rellik writhing on the ground, his side ripped open from Glaeros' deep slash. Stain grinned and held his arms wide, then shrugged. "Well Rellik ..." he said with mock disappointment, looking down at the loops of Rellik's entrails spilling out onto the ground. "I hate to leave you so early in the fight, but I don't think you have the stomach for it anymore. Pull yourself together and maybe you can get back in it later." Stain grinned once more at the growling KAAOS leader, then used his toe to kick dirt on the pile of entrails.</P>
<P>     "Um ... I think ya dropped something."</P>
<P>      Stain rushed back into the battle and saw that Glaeros and Modalex had dropped another KAAOS member and were circling the last one in the area. The three drow charged in from different angles and quickly put the "god" down. They then swept across the field and found another group of KAAOS'ers quietly preparing for battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>     Stain was surprised to see that Zeus had rejoined the partners, though he bore grievous wounds. However, he just scowled at the abbilen and advanced on the KAAOS team. Soon the four partners were again locked in battle with the howling KAAOS'ers.</P>
<P>     The battle raged back and forth, both sides giving and taking damage. Suddenly, Stain noticed that Hedron had moved away from his partners, and that Modalex was giving chase. Stain joined the chase, and soon the drow had cornered and killed the leering False Prophet. Rushing back to Glaeros and Zeus, they saw that the remaining KAAOS'ers had formed into a tight group. In unspoken agreement, the four drow began hurling charges from their Ice Storm Necklaces, inflicting heavy damage before the KAAOS'ers staggered in separate directions.</P>
<P>     Stain saw that Glaeros had cornered one of the enemy, and rushed to his side. He then gaped in amazement as he finally noticed the obscene size and girth of the grotesque Fat K1d. He quickly huddled with Glaeros, nodded, and the two drow clasped forearms and charged. They caught the behemoth squarely in the throat, and he staggered back, arms pinwheeling, but refused to fall. Stain and Glaeros glanced at each other, backed off, charged again, and clotheslined the monstrosity once more. Fat K1d teetered precipitously, but again refused to fall. One of his flailing, waving arms caught Stain in the head, sending him crashing headlong into a wall. A nearby griffin lunged at Stain, but Glaeros jumped in front and took the bite. Stain then saw flashing lights and passed out briefly.</P>
<P>     When he regained his senses a couple of seconds later, Stain looked up groggily and could scarcely believe his eyes. Glaeros was scaling the wall like a cat. He scampered to the top of the wall, struck an impressive pose with his arms wide, then leaped at Fat K1d a wailing howl. "AAAIIIIIIEEEE!!!!!" Glaeros caught the monster in a bulldog headlock, and drove him facefirst into the ground.</P>
<P>     The ground around the battlefield rattled and shook, and a huge dustcloud billowed up. When the dust cleared, the giant was lying still, and Glaeros was rushing back to help Modalex and Zeus finish off the remaining KAAOS'ers. Still dazed from the earlier blow, Stain could only watch. He noticed a gleam in Zeus' eyes, and saw him run to line up Kezinko and Sangdraxx. Glaeros saw the plan too, and rushed to the opposite end of the line. Then Zeus and Glaeros fired their lightning bolts from opposite directions, skewering the howling "gods" in a crackling crossfire. Modalex rushed in, daggers flying, and quickly chopped down the two stunned opponents.</P>
<P>     The four abbilen staggered back toward the rest of the battle and saw an almost surreal scene before them. There at the top of the last hill outside Neverwinter, the main forces of the two armies had met. Bodies of drow and "gods" were scattered all across the hill. On top of the hill, appearing to float among the wreckage in a sea of fog and mist, the final encounter was about to be waged.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>     Somehow, unbelievably, Rellik had reeled in his entrails and called together three comrades -- Slayve, Ego Prime and Kal Mirage -- for the deciding encounter. Before them stood Sagx, the commander Stain had chosen to lead the drow forces in the war. Sagx was frantically calling for reinforcements as the KAAOS'ers began to approach. Stain could hear him calling, but his wounds would not allow him to move. He tried to stand, but collapsed again under the pain of the wounds. He looked around desparately and grabbed his nearest abbil, Zeus.</P>
<P>     "I can't make it, bro. Go in my stead, and help Sagx put down these fools once and for all. This is the last fight ... end it."</P>
<P>     Zeus rushed up the hill in a fury, and Stain then saw in amazement that the final group to represent the Bregan had assembled. Sednablood and Xylot had been the quickest to answer Sagx's call. While he had every confidence in the group, Stain knew secretly that these drow had never fought together as a team and would have to coordinate as best they could manage.</P>
<P>     The forces rushed together, and Stain watched an even more amazing sight unfold. Sednablood, perhaps the most bizarre member of Bregan D'Aerth, was going into a frenzy among the KAAOS force. Whirling like a dervish, she was waving her tipless fingers in their faces, showering them with the ever-pumping bloodflow. Taunts, shrieks and bits of foolish song poured from her lips as she danced among the "gods." The KAAOS members howled and cursed as they turned crimson from the flowing blood -- some of it Sedna's and some of it their own, as her dagger flashed as quick as her wit.</P>
<P>     Kal Mirage shrieked in fury as Sedna began concentrating her dance and song of gibberish around him. He lunged at her with his sword, and the eccentric drowess assassin quickly pounced as she saw his defenses drop. She drove a dagger deep into his chest and Kal Mirage dropped like a stone.</P>
<P>     Stain the saw that both Slayve and Zeus had both been knocked senseless, though Xylot was trying desparately to rouse Zeus. He was slapping Zeus across the face and calling his name, but Zeus just muttered "Got milk?"</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Sagx and Sedna had lured a griffin to finish off Slayve, then turned their attention to Ego Prime. Xylot gave up trying to rouse Zeus and joined them. Rellik and Ego managed to blast Zeus into unconsciousness, but as they did so, the combined daggers of the drow put down Ego.</P>
<P>     So in the end, Rellik stood alone among the wreckage of KAAOS, clutching his ripped side and bleeding from a dozen wounds. The rest of the "gods" had all been thrown down, lying in pools of their own congealing blood. Rellik howled in fury and lunged, but the three drow were quicker. They struck as one as the fog and dust closed in, and Rellik's shrieks ended abruptly.</P>
<P>     And when the fog cleared, Sagx was standing at the top of the hill, holding aloft the scowling, dripping head of Rellik.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>    "Jabbuk? .... Jabbuk?"</P>
<P>     Stain shook his head groggily, trying to regain his senses. An overpowering smell, vaguely familiar, was being forced into his nose.</P>
<P>     "I's dun undastan it," he heard Rhul Vek say. "Da smell o' newberries al'lays wakes 'im. Da Jabbuk mus be some kinda shuk up."</P>
<P>     Stain opened his eyes and looked up into the concerned faces of all his abbilen. Rhul was frowning and concentrating on waving a batch of overripe newberries under his nose. Stain gagged and pushed the berries away, then sat up.</P>
<P>     A victorious cry went up among the drow, and they began drifting away to loot what was left of the defeated KAAOS army. Stain stood shakily and began wandering among the wreckage. All around him the victorious Bregan members celebrated. Stain knew they had all participated in the battle, but he had lost track of most of them as soon as it began. In the end their superior fighting skills had proven the difference, and they were now realizing the depth of their victory.</P>
<P>     Stain wandered up to the top of the hill, where Sagx was inspecting Rellik's headless body. Stain kicked aside the broken basilisk helmet and pulled up Rellik's head by the long, stringy hair. He struck a heroic pose, one hand on his hip, the other holding Rellik's head aloft. The members of Bregan D'Aerth stopped what they were doing and began to gather 'round. Mysteriously, a low, dramatic tune began wafting through the air. Someone in the back began to hum.</P>
<P>     Stain held Rellik's head high, and began to speak.</P>
<P>     "Alas, poor Rellik! I knew him, abbilen: a fellow of infinite boast, of most heinous fancy." He turned his face and addressed the head. "Where be your jibes now, your gambols, your salsa? Your flashes of trollweed that were wont to set the Hellhole on a roar?"</P>
<P>     The wings of a black raven suddenly rent the silence. The bird fluttered to a stop and landed easily on Stain's shoulder. Still holding the head high, Stain glanced over to the raven, then did a double-take as he recognized a glint in those shiny eyes.</P>
<P>     "Siltrin???"</P>
<P>     "SQUAWK!"</P>
<P>     Stain jumped in surprise and dropped Rellik's head, which rolled to a stop and wobbled back and forth. Suddenly Stain's face broke into a wide grin.</P>
<P>     "Siltrin, I want you to do something for me. Hop down there and fetch out Rellik's eyes, while I write a message I want you to deliver for me." Siltrin gave him a questioning look. "Go on now, it's OK. I know you can't eat them until you have permission. I just want you to deliver them as a present."</P>
<P>     Siltrin cocked his head in thought, squawked in agreement, and hopped over to Rellik's head. He used his beak to tug on an eye while Stain quickly wrote a note ...</P>
<P>     </P>
<P>     "Vendui' Malla Valsharess,</P>
<P>     Let these tokens borne by Siltrin signify the victory of the drow in Neverwinter. The Bregan D'Aerth has beaten down all who would resist, and the gates to the city are now open. Come forth at your leisure and we shall begin planning the conquest of the entire surface.</P>
<P>     Aluve'</P>
<P>     'Stain</P>
<P>      ~ Jabbuk, Bregan D'Aerth ~</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>     Siltrin hopped back to Stain's shoulder, struggling to hold the two eyes in his beak. Stain tied the note around the raven's neck, and lifted him into the air. Suddenly remembering something, Stain called out, "Oh, Siltrin! Ask Nedy if you can eat those after she's through with them. And I'll stay here and make sure Rellik keeps an eye out for ya!!!"</P>
<P>     Stain turned one last time to face the entire Bregan, gathered before him atop the hill. He reached back and untied his warrior's ponytail, letting his long white hair finally fly free in the wind. He threw his head back, raised his eyes and fists to the rising moon, and shouted ...</P>
<P>     "Bregan D'Aerth Ultrin!!!"</P>
