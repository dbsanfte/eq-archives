And the winner is. . . ::Drums go rolling by::<BR>
<BR>
In 3rd place and winning absolutely nothing but racking up 27 points is Glaeros.<BR>
<BR>
And in 2nd place and winning a free trip to Del's kitchen for his Boa is Modalex with 30 points.<BR>
<BR>
And finally in 1st place, with a comeback from the lead he always had, victory is the Soup Nazi Delracnid "The far too noisy assasin" Sarn. For being the master of "you're it", Del wins a fabulous lifetime supply, (assuming he CADs) of ice storms. Of course, in the BDA caves there is a delivery tax of 3 pearls, a prize tax of 4 pearls, and a sales tax of 3 more pearls. Please send check or pearl order made out to Kh0lari and allow 6 - 8 weeks for delivery.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you all had fun! And one last note, I NEVER GOT TAGGED. And I racked up 17 points for myself in the process ;p<BR>

Well, abbilen, it's time for some more fun and games within the ranks of the Bregan. It is time again for T.A.G. (The Assassination Game). At stake is a Necklace of Ice Storms. It will be awarded to the drow with the highest number of points at the end of the game.<BR>
<BR>
The fun starts immediately! From now until November 5th at Midnight, each member of the Bregan shall have a price tag on his or her head. The tag varies depending on one's status in the Bregan. The Inner Circle (Sagx, Sylverion, Delracnid, Darkuth, Abzzsta1n, and Pyuna) is worth 3 points each. Your Jabbuk is worth 5 points. All others are worth 1 point each. To collect points, all you have to do is send someone to the nearest gate.<BR>
<BR>
Attacks may occur at any time and in any region by anyone in the BDA (an official NW Event should not be interfered with, especially quads). If more than one BDA member is in a fight, the one that gets the killing blow in gets the kill. Fleeing from a fight is permitted. Feebs and DIRECT SILences ARE also allowed. CADding will not be permitted for any reason. Kills should be sent to Kh0lari and CC'ed to the tagged.<BR>
<BR>
ENJOY THE CHAOS ABBILEN AND GOOD HUNTING!<BR>
