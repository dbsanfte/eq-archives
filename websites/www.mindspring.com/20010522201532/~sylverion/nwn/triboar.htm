<P>
This small town is strategically located where the Long Road intersects Evermoor Way.  Gathered armies have often set forth from Triboar to meet orc hordes.  Triboar has two good smithies and Skulner Wainwright, a wagon maker famed throughout the North.  Skulner's latest project is the 
"rolling cog," a massive wagon that can double as a barge.  Triboar's name is thought to have come from a traveler's tale of slaying three boars here in a day.
