</I>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The Bregan D'Aerth's reputation and influence was slowly creeping to the farthest reaches of the Realms.  Their catch phrase was becoming "if you need something done, no matter how dastardly, call on the BDA."  It was under these auspices that Sylverion was once again contacted for his most devious of skills.  The drow had seen and done many things in his 300+ years of existence but nothing quite compared to killing rivvil in their own confines, the surface world.  This was not because of the long standing hatred by the drow of everything to do with the surface, but instead it was the adrenaline it created for the thrill craving drow.  Knowing that he had overcome the worst obstacle known to his race, the sun, and not only mastered the inbred fear but conquered it, created a rush beyond any he had know before.  Surely this would subside, but his pure enjoyment of killing and torture never would.</P>

<P>No one except the BDA members themselves knew where the headquarters was located, somewhere near Neverwinter was the only thing anyone not of the "inner circle" knew.  Agents, however, operated at will all over the realms, and it was through these agents that the BDA was contacted for missions.  The contact for this mission happened in Neverwinter itself, strange since the assignment was to occur fairly close to the city.  Perhaps the customer was tempting fate, ignorant of the ways of assassination or setting a trap, it was not clear but it did not matter.  The BDA worked in the utmost confidence and secrecy.  No violation of this would be tolerated or last very long.  The eyes and ears of the BDA had ways of finding out client and victim's confidential matters, whether they wanted them to or not.</P>

<P>Zarge was sitting in Mataga's Inn enjoying a round of Axepeak ale when the first contact was made.  The inn was crowded and noisy, making it a good meeting place for clandestine encounters.  A man from the crowd approached Zarge's table and asked, "Kind sir may I join you for a round?"  </P>

<P>"Certainly and well met!," came the warm reply from Zarge. 'I must remember to be nice to people here, that is the way of this place', thought Zarge to himself as he studied the man.  The man had totally nondescript features, medium height, weight and build.  Zarge prided himself on studying individuals and making judgment calls on them immediately.  This individual disturbed him though, he could not read this man at all.  It was like some veil hid his mien and demeanor from the rest of the world.  </P>

<P>In a hushed tone the man began, "I am Supmet and I am here for urgent business."  The veil was still not raised on this man and it was beginning to bother Zarge immensely.  His masters would be 'displeased' if he let on too much information to this man called Supmet.  And a displeased drow meant death and a horrible one at that for the BDA agent. </P>

<P>"Ahh, what business could be more urgent than enjoying a fine ale my new friend?"</P>

<P>"Do not trifle with me fool", came the whispered threat, "I know you are an agent of the Bregan D'Aerth.  I am here on urgent business which will be well paid for.  I must meet with a member of the 'inner circle'.  The mission I have is most dangerous and can only be accomplished by a professional."</P>

<P>Donning a confused looking disposition Zarge began, "Kind sir I know not of this Brogran Droth that you spee...."</P>

<P>"Mrimm dosst velve ulu dosst ogglin rath ulu xun velkyn elghinn", spit the one called Supmet.</P>

<P>The confused look instantly melted from Zarge's face and became one of calm knowing. This one had just spoken one of the secret code phrases and must be brought to the attention of his masters.  Rising from his chair Zarge whispered into the man's ear, "You will meet at the Neverwinter docks at 12:00 midnight sharp, tomorrow night."  Leaving the inn a tinge of cold foreboding raced through Zarge as he began to wonder what the one called Sylverion was going to think about this.</P>
</FONT>
<BR>
<I><P>Reporting In</P>
</I>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Zarge reluctantly made his way to the secret meeting place to report to Sylverion.  This was one part of the job that Zarge hated, actually meeting with the drow.  They paid very well but were so sadistic that he feared for his life just talking to them.   He often wondered if they were this way to each other also.  This line of thought was quickly cut off though, they had ways of reading your thoughts.  Drow were not the only dangerous creatures near this meeting place,  the Neverwinter woods was not exactly a playground for children.   Zarge had taken all of the required precautions however and made it to the meeting place as scheduled.  He met with Sylverion regularly at this spot to pass on any useful information and receive any new assignments.  Standing in the woods outside of this building made him nervous.  He was told never to go into the building because of the Beholders there.  Never one to tempt fate too much, he followed this advice whole heartedly.  'Where was Syl at?', he thought to himself.</P>

<P>"Here I am Zarge," came a whisper from behind him.  Spinning to look at the drow, he was still amazed at many things with this one.  His uncanny ability to slip into the meeting place undetected unnerved Zarge but the most sinister was the drow's attitude.  Murder and killing was common place for drow but Sylverion seemed to enjoy it too much.  Zarge often wondered if Syl actually fed off of the fear and dying screams of his victims like a wraith,  for Syl did indeed enjoy torturing his victims more than the actual kill.  If the victim didn't whimper and beg for mercy or wail in pain he was truly disappointed.  </P>

<P>"There has been contact made in Neverwinter," began Zarge.  The sooner he got this out the faster he could get back to Neverwinter and away from these woods and this drow. "A very strange man by the name of Supmet contacted me in the inn, Master.  He knew one of the code phrases." </P>

<P>"Did you take the time to find out any information on this person," Sylverion asked, a cold impassionate look on his face.</P>

<P>A cold chill went down Zarge's spine as he thought 'Will this be my last encounter with this drow.'  "Uhhh, no Master, I was so surprised by him knowing the phrase that I thought it more important to tell you.......ahhrggg."</P>

<P>The speed at which the kick was landed to Zarge's midsection was unbelievable.  Zarge's only comfort was that it was his master's boot and not his fabled longsword.</P>

<P>"You will not make that mistake again, right Zarge?  Information is how we prosper in this world, and I will not tolerate mistakes by you!"</P>

<P>Under a grunt of pain Zarge begins, "No Master, I will not..."</P>

<P>"Shut up Wael! The meeting is at 12 at the docks correct?"</P>

<P>"Yes Master," a puzzled look spread across Zarge's face. 'How does he know this information already?'  Zarge thought to himself.</P>

<P>With a slight giggle Sylverion replied, "Zarge my incompetent dobluth, I know EVERYTHING!"</P>

<BR>
<I><P>The Meeting</P>
</I>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Light from the full moons did not dispel the ominous feeling at the docks this eve.  The fog kept visibility low and combined with the shadows, created an eerie scene.  Even the most hardy of Neverwinter residents steered clear of the docks at night.  Sylverion still did not understand what kept the Neverwinter river so warm all year round, but one of the beneficial side effects was the fog it produced.  Anytime the wind was right the fog would blow in and cover the dock area in a thick blanket.  As such it was one of those nights.  Standing in the shadows of one of the many warehouses, along with the fog made the drow next to invisible.  ‘I should be completely invisible,’ he raged to himself.  The drow was still fuming over the loss of his piwafwi.  The sun completely destroyed his cloak and most of his other drow equipment when he first came to the surface.  It would take a long time to replace his gear with the surface equivalents, but he was slowing accomplishing this.</P>

<P>The man slowly walking down the dock fit the description told to him by Valorian. Sylverion grinned at remembering Zarge's surprised expression at knowing the meeting information beforehand.  ‘What was that rivvil expression?’ he thought.  'Don't put all of your chickens in a basket.'  Sylverion shrugged to himself, he still did not understand that expression even though he now, at least, knew what a chicken was.  Something indeed was strange about this man, Zarge and Valorian were not being paranoid.  He must find out more information about this individual.</P>

<P>"Vendui' Sylverion," came the greeting from the man.</P>

<P>"Vendui' Supmet, do not trifle with me as you did with my agent or your entrails will grease the docks for days to come."  The open threat did not seem to phase the man as Sylverion had intended, and was beginning to irritate the drow.  Even more irritating was the fact that his amulet of ESP was not working on this man.</P>

<P>"I have no intention of trifling with you assassin," said the man calmly. "I have a mission that is of utmost import that only one of your skills could even hope to accomplish."</P>

<P>Openly sneering at the man Sylverion continued, "What makes you believe that I would even entertain your delusions, wael? I do not work for pittance and you don't look like a rich rivvil."</P>

<P>"My masters have more than enough loot to satisfy the most greedy dwarf," countered the man, "plus we both know how much you love a challenge any way Syl, and this mission is a challenge."  An outstretched hand appeared from Supmet with a scroll. Upon passing it to Sylverion, the drow quickly glanced over the writing. Digesting the information contained in the scroll, Sylverion thought to himself,  'This indeed would be a dangerous mission.'</P>

<P>Though narrowed suspicious eyes the drow continued, "You presume a lot rivvil, but still you have said nothing that is of interest to me."  This whole meeting had gone on much too long for the drow, being about in Neverwinter was not safe for him.  Reaching down for the pommel of his sword, he intoned a simple mental command for the sword to perform a little magic.  'Yes Master,' came the simple message back from Z’ress Velve Del Elghinn. The sword was his greatest possession, plunder taken from the vaults of his fallen house.  His last days in Veldralias had presented an opportunity for the first son to escape the onslaught by the other houses not only with his life but this trinket as well.</P>

<P>To Supmet it looked like a simple nervous gesture, the hand on sword just in case of trouble, but to Sylverion it was much more.  The figure in front of him waver slightly under the onslaught of the swords magic.  True Sight was what the surface dwellers called it, Khaless Nau Uss by the drow.  Whatever the term the results were profound for the drow. 'Hmmm,' he thought to himself, sudden concern for his safety had all of his attention now.  Should he indicate that he knew who this individual was?  'No,' he thought, unless this is a trap, it could be very useful knowledge down the road.  It was not often that one of Nasher's own royal guard was connected with an assassination plot.  'And the name, Supmet, what an imbecile,' Sylverion thought to himself with a touch of mirth, 'his word games are as imaginative as an orc.'</P>

<P>"No need to get jumpy my friend," Supmet said in a mockingly reassuring way. "The payment for this deed will indeed be great and something that you need."</P>

<P>"I'm listening," was all that the drow would say.</P>

<P>"I have two items, one shall be up front payment and the other payment for the completed job.  The first is a Cloak of Elvenkind, the second is a spell book from the library of Khelban Blackstaff himself!"</P>

<P>The drow's impassionate outward expression was certainly not what Supmet was expecting.  But if he could see the internal avarice that was growing within Sylverion he would have know he had struck the mark.  Sylverion liked new spells as much as any mage, but the cloak was what really intrigued him at the moment.  Invisibility is one of the greatest advantages for one in his profession and was not to be taken lightly.  He would do this mission and if it was a trap, he would have a cloak and the souls of these individuals as well.</P>

<I><P>Bloody Coronation</P>
</I>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The journey to Helm’s Hold had been, for the most part, uneventful for Sylverion.  Invisibility garnered from the cloak had seen to a fast trip with few hostile encounters.  The overland journey had taken 2 days, giving Sylverion ample time to look over the mission notes and secret maps during rest. This information included Keep and town layouts as well as target descriptions.  The combination of his own arrogance and this information gave the drow confidence that the mission would be a success.  Not an easy mission by any stretch of the imagination, but achievable.  A simple assassination was one thing, but all of the royal blood except the youngest boy was pushing things a bit far.  The motives behind a job such as this were easy to read, someone wanted a puppet on the throne.  Whatever the reasoning, it mattered not to the evil drow, killing was killing, plus he was being well paid for it.  </P>

<P>Upon arrival in the town, Sylverion again donned the mask of disguise he so often used.  Drow were not common enough in this area for him to risk traveling in his true form, so the use of the mask to conceal his identity was a given.  The form of a typical male rivvil trader would do for now.  During the completion of the mission he would again assume his true form, he wanted his victims to see him with their dying breaths.  He made sure of this with almost everyone he killed. 'Wouldn't want anyone to forget me in the afterlife,' he often mused to himself. </P>

<P>The next 14 days in town were spent casing it.  The drow would leave nothing to chance and planned for all the contingencies he could think of.  Posing as a bloodstone gem merchant from far away Damara provided him with ample cover to find out much information about the town and the Keep specifically.  A few drinks here, some casual conversation there, afforded him the opportunity to find out the towns routine and if any festivals or other special events were going on.  None were planned which pleased the drow, no sense in having anything break the monotony of the Keep activities.  Observation of the Keep revealed guard patrol patterns and general day to day activities, all of which factored into his decision to what time to strike.  </P>

<P>On the evening of the 15th day in town, the drow took off his mask of disguise, donned his black garb and prepared the spells and items he would bring with him.  People were well off of the street by then and just beginning to fall asleep in their beds.  Slipping out of the inn in which he was staying took him to the walls of the Keep itself.  Sylverion was glad this lord was not a rich one, his keep was built of local stones not the more expensive imported granite.  This local stone work was not as smooth or well placed as granite would have been, and would afford the drow an easy entrance to the Keep over the walls.  Glancing upwards the drow had timed events well, the nearly moonless night made visibility almost nil except for the torches on the tops of the walls.  Routine was both a good and bad thing at castles. The monotonous routine of the Keep patrols made them careless and inattentive.  Sylverion would use this to his advantage for his mischief this eve. Climbing the wall near one of the corner towers was easy for the nimble drow, the guard had just passed through the open tower door and was checking things inside.  Upon reaching the top of the wall and climbing upon the parapet the drow opened a lead line sack at his belt.  This produced pebbles and dead silence which would be used extensively this eve. Glancing into the tower the drow could see that the guard was writing something in a ledger.  With a slight flick Sylverion tossed one of the pebbles behind the guard, drew his dagger and advanced. A little too late the guard began to wonder why the torch beside him ceased to crackle.  A swift kick to the back of the legs brought the guard to his knees.  Leaving no time for further reaction, Sylverion raised the dagger high and plunged the point down to where the skull joins the spine.  Instant death was laid upon the guard from a blow stronger than any drow should be able to make.  Looking down at his hands, Sylverion marveled at the strength that the gauntlets afforded him.  The carelessness of these guards also amazed Sylverion, this one wore no helmet or chain coif to protect himself.  'No matter he would be dead anyway,' prophesied Sylverion to himself.  Sliding the guards body out of sight into a corner, the drow reminded himself he needed to hurry.  Picking up the permanently silenced pebble, placing it back within the pouch and closing the pouch afforded sound back to the drow.  The next guard would be by in 45 minutes, the drow wanted to be nearly finished with the mission by then.  </P>

<P>Sliding down the backside of the wall into the actual compound of the keep, the drow mentally went over the next step in his plan. Looking around this part of the compound, the drow made sure no alarm was raised or guards had come.  Feeling confident that no one was aware of his presence, at least no one alive, Sylverion continued onward, towards the Keep’s living quarters.  </P>

<P>Moving towards the main building of the Keep, Sylverion glanced up at the window he knew would be open.  Someone inside the Keep was very indirectly helping him.  It must be the person who setup the whole job. After giving a glance about to make sure no one was watching him the drow slowly and quietly began to climb the outside of the Keeps living quarters.  Peering into the window the silent drow could make out what appeared to be an unused guest room.  Quickly the drow opened the window and slid into the room.  After closing the window Sylverion made his way across the room to the door into the rest of the building.  Mentally picturing the map of the building, Sylverion  recalled that the lord’s wife’s chambers were closest to this room and would therefore be the first of the royal victims this eve.</P>

<P>Sylverion slowly opened the door from the guest room and peered down the hallway leading away from the room.  The room was on the end of the hall and afforded an unobstructed view of the hallway.  Sensing no one in the hallway the drow crept out into the hall and slinked towards to the next door, the living suite of Shandril the Lord’s wife.  Opening the belt pouch again threw the drow into complete silence.  Reaching for the door the drow’s adrenaline was starting to flow fast, realizing that the first royal kill was seconds away.  With a quick twist of the knob the door was opened, allowing the drow to race inside.  The silent entrance of the drow into her bedchamber allowed Shandril no time to scream.  Racing across the room to divan at which she was sitting the drow drew back a fist and punched the surprised woman in the face as she turned.  The silence that accompanied the drow snuffed out the screams that Shandril was just trying to form.  Spit blood and teeth were immune to the silence however, as they flowed freely from her mouth. The look of abject terror on her face became one of pain when the drow kicked the woman’s legs out from under her.  Sylverion dove atop the woman pinning her to the floor under him.  Reaching into his belt pack the grinning drow retrieved a small vial that contained a green seaweed like substance.  A look of confusion mixed with terror appeared on Shandril’s face, she had no clue as to what was going to happen to her.  Unstopping the vial the drow held the vial over Shandril and offered it to her in a mock toast, then emptied the contents upon her bloodied face.  The pain accompanying the green slime was unbearable for Shandril.  Flesh upon her face was quickly being consumed by the slime as it ate into her skin, bone and eventually brain.  Her frantic thrusts almost threw the drow aside but he managed to hold her down and watch her agony.  Sylverion truly loved this type of torture, he did believe it a shame that know one would hear her screams.  </P>

<P>After the woman’s final death throw, Sylverion rose to get on with the rest of the nights festivities.  With her death the rivvil woman no longer held any interest to the drow at all.  Moving towards the door the drow recalled who was next on the hit list, the only daughter of Lord Dryton, Philisha.  Slipping into the hallway again, the drow noticed the flag pennants jutting from the walls bearing the Lord’s royal insignia.  Reaching up, the drow removed one from the wall.  It beared a striking resemblance to a smallish spear. ‘This may come in handy,’ smirked the drow to himself.  </P>

<P>Reaching the next doorway in the hall, Sylverion again reached for the knob to open the door.  Noticing no light under the door, the drow correctly assumed that the young woman was asleep.  Testing the knob he realized that this door too, was not locked. ‘What waels,’ he thought to himself. ‘They believe themselves secure here within their own walls, eh?’ With that thought an evil grin spread across Sylverions face. ‘They wont live through that mistake.’  Opening the door, Sylverion silently moved into the room.  His drow ultra vision came in handy in these situations, no light was necessary.  Upon seeing the young woman sleeping in her bed the drow bound across the room and jumped atop her.  The silent screams of terror flowed from Philisha’s mouth but would never be heard by the living.  Having pinned the woman beneath him, Sylverion caressed her smooth face. ‘Had I but more time my love,’ came the evil thoughts of the drow.  A quick flash brought the royal pennant in the depraved drow’s hand up and down through Philisha’s chest and heart, instantly killing her. ‘A most noble way to die,’ the drow quipped to himself.  </P>

<P>Rising from the carcass of the once lovely woman, Sylverion exited through the door and back into the hallway.  Slinking down the wall he came to the youngest son’s door next.  ‘Ahh little one, the gods smile upon you this night’ he mused to himself as he passed the door.  </P>

<P>‘Bruenhard,’ the drow thought to himself as he came to the next door in the hallway. The drow had heard rumors about this one in town.  Supposedly this young man was very good with the sword.  The drow truly wanted to test those rumors, he was very arrogant when it came to his own sword prowess. Sadly the drow believed that this would not happen, since Bruenhard needed to die quickly.  Still draped in silence the drow reached for the doorknob.  Opening the door and moving inside, the drow’s senses told him that something was wrong. ‘Iblith, no one is here,’ Sylverion fumed to himself, ‘Where could he be?’</P>

<P>Moving out of the room, Sylverion decided to keep going and find Bruenhard later.  At the end of the hallway was both Lord Dryton’s bedchambers and the spiral staircase down to the first floor.  Silently moving to Dryton’s door, Sylverion quickly opened the door and rushed into the room.  To his continued dismay the bedchamber was also empty. ‘Hmm lets try downstairs,’ thought the simmering drow.</P>

<P>Outside of the bedchamber and at the top of the spiral staircase the drow peered down.  At the bottom of the stairs was an entryway from the outside and a couple of doorways, one of which lead to the main hall.  In front of this door was stationed a guard who was apparently listening through the partially opened main hall door.  Pulling a throwing dagger out of his boot and looking at it the drow smiled to himself. ‘This would confuse most rivvil.’  He was referring to the claw like tongs on the pommel of the blade.  Their use was soon evident however when the drow retrieved one of the silence stones and clipped it in. Flicking the now balanced blade in his hand the grinning drow slipped down a few of the stairs, just enough to get a good shot at the lone guard. </P>

<P>The spinning dagger raced its way to the clueless guard’s exposed head.  The silenced thunk was heard by no one as the 5 inch blade penetrated his ear and brain, instantly killing him.  Sylverion smiled at the jester like action, as the guard’s body slowly tilted to the side and fell noiselessly to the stone floor.</P>

<P>Racing down the steps the drow expectantly peered through the door to see what was going on.  Much to his relief he saw Lord Dryton, Brunehard, someone who must be the court cleric and two soldiers who must be captains of the guard.  Quickly sizing up the situation the drow decided upon a plan of action.  Reaching into his pack to retrieve his handcrossbow and paralysis tipped darts the drow thought to himself, ‘I’m going to need some luck and trickery to get through this one.’  Having cocked the bow and placed the dart, the drow contemplated his next action. ‘Okay time to move!’ he thought to himself.</P>

<P>A drow bursting through the entrance to the main hall was the last thing that these experienced warriors were expecting.  So shocked were they that they could not react fast enough when the drow aimed the already raised crossbow at Lord Dryton.  As if in slow motion the warriors watched the tiny bolt sail across the room and pierce the arm of their beloved Lord.  </P>

<P>Having shot the crossbow Sylverion dropped it and turned to flee the room.  </P>

<P>&quot;Oloth Faer Quarthen!&quot; the drow intoned, no longer silent since he closed his pouch, and a magical globe of darkness appeared to mask his apparent retreat.  Diving into the darkness the drow tightly wrapped his cloak around him to provide invisibility and whispered the incantation to a levitation spell.  Rising to the rafters of the tall room the drow pulled himself along the rafters to get away from the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Foul Dark Elf!!,&quot; screamed the priest, &quot;After him, I will cure the Lords wounds. It will take more than that to kill him, stupid drow!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Lord!!&quot; wailed Bruenhard as he strode to help his wounded father.</P>

<P>&quot;Bruenhard, bar the door when the guards leave,&quot; commanded the priest.</P>

<P>The dark globe was quickly dispelled by the priest to allow the guards to advance safely.  Moving quickly out the door the guards noticed their fallen comrade.  The silence that had engulfed the guard had been dispelled however by the priest’s spell.  Running out into the hallway the guards screamed out to sound the general alarm for the keep, awakening all of the sleeping soldiers as well.  Baring the door from the inside, Bruenhard milled around the door and pulled out his longsword, wonder what he should do next.</P>

<P>&quot;Hang on Dryton it is merely poison,&quot; reassured the priest, &quot;I will have you cured soon.&quot;</P>

<P>Reaching for the holy symbol of Tyr on a lavish gold chain around his neck, the priest did not notice Sylverion moving through the rafters to position himself above.  Canceling out the levitation spells the drow began to fall straight for the priest.  Landing with both feet squarely in his back the drow knocked the priest to the castle floor with a loud thud.  Having stunned the priest, Sylverion quickly reached down and grabbed the holy symbol from behind and gave a forceful pull.  Collapsing the priest’s windpipe with his own holy symbol somehow seemed appropriate to the drow.</P>

<P>&quot;Choking on your own hot air are we priest?&quot; laughed Sylverion as he yanked the priest over on his back.  The drow wanted to make sure the priest was incapacitated before he moved on.  To his delight the priest was indeed suffocating.</P>

<P>&quot;Arrrggrrrr!!!&quot; came a scream from behind and Sylverion spun to see who was approaching.</P>

<P>&quot;Ahhh, Bruenhard, are you ready to die my young wael?  The rest of your pathetic family has fallen with the least bit of resistance.&quot;  Glancing back at the entrance to the room the drow could not repress a smile when he noticed that Bruenhard had failed to unbar the doorway.</P>

<P>The confusion and despair welled up in Bruenhard’s expression as he made the simple plea, &quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why!!?!!&quot; choked out the evil drow in a fit of laughter. &quot;Baahhaa you are indeed as stupid as you look boy.  Your family dies because I wish it, no more no less.  I enjoy snuffing out the insignificant lives of rivvil such as yourself, for no other reason that the pleasure of it.  Ahh enough talk, time for you to die,&quot; sneered the drow at the young man.</P>

<P>Z’ress Velve Del Elghinn slid effortlessly from Sylverion’s back sheath to menace Bruenhard.  The longsword was a magnificent piece of art and deadly in a skilled swordsman’s hand.  A faint greenish glow pulsed from deep within the sword giving an eerie ambiance to the already horror filled room. Sylverion advanced on the young Nobel who readied his longsword as well.  The opening thrusts, parries and general swordplay were dazzling.  Both men were well trained in swordplay and could handle themselves well in any normal fight.  This was no normal fight however but Bruenhard did not yet know this.  He had never fought drow before and could not conceive of the trickery that they always employed,  trickery that would ensure them victory at any cost.  </P>

<P>The sword battle raged on between the two for several minutes when swords locked high above each others heads.  Sylverion made a contorted body movement that caused a sinister effect, a blade had suddenly appeared jutting out from his waist belt.  Moving in close to Bruenhard and giving a quick body spin the drow suddenly leapt back from the melee and grinned wickedly at Bruenhard.  The pained and astonished look on the Nobel’s faced turned to one of pure horror as he looked down and saw what the belt blade had done to him.  With a loud clang Bruenhard’s longsword fell from his grasp as he desperately reached to his gut to try to hold in his bowels.  His world was swaying in front of him as he fell to his knees, his life-force slowly drifting to other realms.</P>

<P>Bending down and looking the dying Nobel in the eyes Sylverion mocked him, &quot;Heh no guts no glory eh Bruney? Well I guess no glory for you wael since your guts have so inconsiderately left you.&quot;  Sylverion had performed evicerations many times before and still enjoyed the effect it had on his victims.  This was a most painful and humiliating way to die since it took so long and there was nothing you could do about it.</P>

<P>Suddenly startled by a crying voice behind him, Sylverion spun around and smiled as he saw Kelven, Dryton’s youngest son, draped across his father’s still paralyzed body. Leaping across the room and grabbing the young boy by the collar, the drow picked up the boy and slammed him into the nearest chair.  Dazed and confused the boy gave no resistance as he was tied into the chair and spun to face his father.  Giving a momentary look towards the main entrance the drow heard axes pounding on the heavy oaken doors.</P>

<P>&quot;Guess I had better hurry,&quot; he said aloud while grabbing Dryton by the collar and dragging him in front of his terrified son.  The drow held the Lord in a position of being on his knees so his eyes were looking directly into his son’s.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, well now Kelven this is the day you have dreamed about all of your young life isn’t it?&quot;  the drow began.  </P>

<P>&quot;Whaaaa.....What do you mean?&quot; cried out the little boy a little too fast.</P>

<P>‘Had he touched on something the boy had dreamed about.  Probably something innocent, but which could easily be perverted to his needs.  A little mind torture for the young boy was just what he needed,’ Sylverion thought to himself.</P>

<P>&quot;You know Kel, your father leaving so you can rule in his stead?  Aww Kel you can be truthful with us this is what you wanted, come now don’t be such a coward in front of your father we all know you want him to die. I’m just doing as you wish.&quot;</P>

<P>Sobs and incoherent speech flooded from Kelven as he looked into his father’s eyes. &quot;Papa I didn’t want this to happen.....&quot; as his voice trailed off to be replaced with more sobs, Lord Dryton could only look on and wish he could tell his son it was not his fault and the drow was only playing mind games with him.  But that he could not do because of the paralysis poison still in his system.  He could only look into his boys eyes and see the despair there, and the utter destruction of the young boy’s world.  Dryton could only wonder if his only remaining son would live and what type of tortured existence that would be.</P>

<P>&quot;Kel!&quot; the depraved drow yelled to get the boys attention.  A slim dagger appeared in the drow’s hand and moved menacingly up to the Lord’s neck.  &quot;You know this is what you wanted.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Noooo!!!!!&quot; screamed the child as he strained uselessly against his bonds praying to the gods that this would end,  that he could save his father.</P>

<P>Sliding the dagger across Dryton’s throat produced a gush of blood and the loss of consciousness of Kelven.  Dropping Dryton’s fast chilling body to the ground, the smiling drow took a quick look around the room and chuckled to the incoherent young Kelven, &quot;your Assention to the throne is now complete.&quot; Raising his pulsing longsword in a mock ceremony,  &quot;I coronate and dub thee Sir Orphan!&quot;</P>

</I>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Using a tucked away teleportation scroll allowed Sylverion a quick escape from the confines of the Keep.  What would become of the young Kelven?  The drow really did not care the least, he had completed his mission successfully and had an immense amount of fun also. What more could he ask for?  Not much since he now also had his cloak and would soon have another spell book.  What would the curious drow do about &quot;Supmet&quot;? Nothing for now, that would be taken care of in the future.  For now the drow was content to bask in the successful mission and relish the deaths he had caused.</P>
