<P>
Located on the very edge of the mysterious Neverwinter Woods, Nightsedge is constantly in danger.  Recently, the danger has increased dramatically with orcs attacking the small town constantly.  The Lord Mayor is more than a little worried since these orcs aren't the rollmoor
Orcs that are usually found in this region but some other kind. 
<P>
Outnumbered, the Lord Mayor has pleaded with Lord Nasher to send any help.  Lord Nasher has responded by asking all adventurers to travel to Nightsedge to help the in the town's defense.
