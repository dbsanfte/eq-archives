Situated near a small cliff, Windycliffs is named for the fierce winds that constantly batter this small town. Populated mostly by merchants, Windycliffs serves as a convenient stop for travelers on their way to or back from Port Llast. Travelers and adventurers can fulfill all their needs by visiting the town's inn, stores, arms shop, and jewelers. Recently Windycliffs has been plagued by fierce monsters. The Lord Mayor claims that the pirate-tyrant captains of Luskan are responsible and has asked Lord Nasher of Neverwinter for aid in battling the creatures.
