<P>
This tiny agricultural village is home to the Harpell family that has produced a number of influential mages in the North (including Malchor Harpell who now splits his time between Longsaddle and Waterdeep).
<P>
The village Elder, Ardanac Harpell, dwells in the "Ivy Mansion," the Harpell's ancestral home, high on a hill, in the center of Longsaddle.
<P>
The village has a daily farmers' market, a way-stable, a stirrup maker and bellcaster, and The Gilded Horseshoe, an inn noted for its hospitality and its defensible wooden palisade.
<P>
Local stories say that griffins are bothering Longsaddle, preying upon cattle, horses and longriders who stay too far from local ranches.
<P>
Problems: Griffons living nearby have slain the residents of several farmholds.
