<B>A Childling's Wish---Prelude</B><BR><BR>
The Yule logs crackled in the Playroom's fireplace.  Nustled under lacey
comforters filled with feathers in her canopy bed of white and pink, lay a
little girl with tiny ringlet curls of gold  surrounding her face.  Her
petite lips are curled into a rosebud smile.  To any who look on, she appears
as delicate as a china doll.  In truth, she is the Princess Jaliycia,
daughter of the Kithain Queen, Ilysianna.  She is sleeping through the
night...waiting for the magic of Yuletide to occur.  <BR><BR>
The childling has spent the last few weeks researching any of the Yule
traditions she could find.  In the corner of the Playroom's outer Library,
there is an evergreen tree decorated with ribbons and tiny fearie fire
lights.  Near the door to the bedchamber, there is a wooden shoe.  A row of
candles in a special candlabra are lit in the window.  By the fireplace,
rests a glass of milk, a tray of cookies, and a bunch of carrots.  A stocking
hangs within reach of the treats.  A sprig of mistletoe hangs over her toy
castle.  Hollyberries and pine scent fills the air.  Her magic lute plays
traditional melodies as the princess sleeps with a large soldier nutcracker
tucked under her arm in a gentle embrace.  Her dreams are filled with colored
wrapping, bows, tiny bells and sugarplums.<BR><BR>

<B>A Childling's Wish. Granted</B><BR><BR>
As the Drow Mercenary, Xylot, drifted along the streets of Neverwinter, he
uncharacteristically paused to read the posting concerning the Princess.  At
first, a snicker appeared across his face.  But as he read, the snicker was
replaced by a look of disbelief.  The Princess was named Jaliycia, while his
own daughter, tragically taken from him a year earlier, he had named Jaliya.
He read and reread the details of the Princess' impossible hopes.<BR>
<BR>
As Xylot turned away, his mind uncontrollably returned to his daughter.  Less
than a year after his bonding to Jalen, the Gods had granted them a child.
He received much ribbing when Jaliya was born with curly blond locks instead
of the traditional snow white drow coloration.  Xylot and Jalen had no
further children and father and daughter were much closer than most drow men
allow themselves to be.  His stomach wrenched as he relived the horror of the
unusual malady that struck Jaliya just before her 5th birthday.  Despite the
efforts of the best drow acolytes, his daughters life was tragically cut
short.  Jalen had blamed Xylot for their daughters strange disease, feeling
he had brought it back from one of his far away travels as a mercenary.  Not
long after Jaliya's death, Jalen left without explanation.  Xylot felt a
strange attachment to Jaliycia, and set out to attempt the impossible.<BR>
<BR>
As Xylot paused to reflect, he opened his bag of holding and reminisced
fondly while staring at his daughters' favorite toy.  A crystal "snow dome"
housing a white unicorn prancing on a muti-colored bed of flowers.  A yellow
butterfly was lighting gently on the unicorn's pink horn.  Xylot had had the
"snow dome" specially crafted by one of Waterdeep's finest crafstmen for
Jaliya's 4th birthday.  He carefully tucked the dome away as his mind began
to race.<BR>
<BR>
The Seelie Castle was far away in a land where drow were not welcome.  His
Boots of Speed and Cloak of Elvenkind should provide safe passage to the
castle, but time was short.. it was already December 23rd !!  Xylot pondered
how a drow would have any hope of gaining entry into the castle as he headed
towards Groal's Emporium for provisions.  He was very pleased to learn that
Groal's did have one small pouch of "Dust of Disappearance" in stock.. but
the price was steep.  The apothecarist grinned slyly as Xylot handed his
Mirrored Shield +3  across the counter in exchange for the Dust.<BR>
<BR>
With time running short, Xylot made only a quick stop at his cavern, before
heading straight away to Seelie Castle.  The Boots made travel fast and 6
hours were behind him before he took his first rest.  There was no time for
sleep as the dawn of Christmas Eve was quickly breaking.  Despite no food and
little rest, the castle walls were in sight just before dusk.  As night began
to fall, Xylot stealthily scaled the castle walls and made his way outside
the heavily guarded palace entrance.  He waited til a delivery was being
accepted; then he pinched half of the "Dust of Disappearance" and sprinkled
it all over himself.  He proceeded unseen into the very heart of the palace.
The Princess' chamber was not hard to find. Entrance was soon gained and
Xylot began his work.  Just before dawn, the balance of "Dust" was used to
exit from the palace.  Xylot fell into a deep slumber in the neighboring
woods, a smile across his face.<BR>
<BR>
The King and Queen discussed how best to console their only daughter as they
headed down the hallway.  The little Princess had such high hopes.. that
would soon be dashed.  As they made their way into the Princess' chamber, a
'GASP' from the Queen, roused Jaliycia from her sleep.<BR>
<BR>
The little Princess shrieked in joy as she lept from her bed towards the
playroom:<BR>

As Jaliycia turned to her parents, beaming with pride, she notice a solitary
present under the Christmas tree.  A small object was wrapped in bright red
cloth and wrapped with a green ribbon.  As she carefully unwrapped the gift
from Santa a tear rolled down her eye.  Her favorite things in her favorite
colors.  A crystal "snow dome" housing a white unicorn prancing on a bed of
multi-colored flowers.  A yellow butterfly gently lighting on the pink horn
of the unicorn.  As she turned the dome upside down to make the snow fall...
she noticed the inscription:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>JAL I Love you !</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
The King and Queen sat in stunned disbelief as Jaliycia proclaimed.... SANTA
CLAUS IS REAL.. SEE. HE WILL COME... IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE !!!!!!<BR>
