<FONT SIZE=5>Sympathy for the Drow</FONT>
<BR><BR>
Once we dwelt under sun's  light<BR>
Just like our kin who live their still<BR>
But our spirits wilder, we craved  the fight<BR>
And revelled in our deadly skill<BR>
<BR>
Clad in skin of ebon hue<BR>
Crowned with hair of ivory-white<BR>
We are most beautiful to view<BR>
Imprisoned in eternal night<BR>

Through raid and war our race grew proud<BR>
Driven on by goddess cruel<BR>
Wrapped in malice like a shroud<BR>
The crack that flaws the perfect jewel<BR>
<BR>
With fear of us as common thought<BR>
Elves, dwarves and men together stood<BR>
Magic battles then we fought<BR>
That drove us down from sun and wood<BR>
<BR>
The underdark we made our home<BR>
We found we suit it, every way<BR>
The endless warrens which we roam<BR>
Hunting down unwary prey<BR>
<BR>
And now our goddess, crueler still<BR>
Demands that our powerful take a test<BR>
The failures of that divine will<BR>
Then with a drider's form are blessed<BR>
<BR>
Time passes, still we can't  forget<BR>
What was done in ancient years<BR>
The surface world shall be ours yet<BR>
This, we pray, our goddess hears<BR>
<BR>
We did not choose life as we are<BR>
With warlike ways and hardened hearts<BR>
Born beneath a different star<BR>
That gave our people killer's arts<BR>
<BR>
What we were given, we now use<BR>
As all things in the world do<BR>
Killing all things that we choose<BR>
(Sorry if that includes you!);><BR>
<BR>
So wonder not, when meeting Drow<BR>
How we can be so merciless<BR>
Our ancient hates from long ago<BR>
We're still attempting to redress<BR>
