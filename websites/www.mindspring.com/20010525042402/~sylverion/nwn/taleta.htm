Darkness surrounded her as she carefully picked her way along the path leading to the rivvil city of Westbridge.  There was virtually no moon in the sky tonight, to Richel's immense satisfaction. Details of the assignment were etched upon her mind.  She knew who her target was, and had been watching his every move.  He had kept to the same schedule night after night.  Chuckling softly to herself as she ducked behind a tree to wait, she couldn't help thinking what a fool this rivvil was.  It was almost a shame to take payment for a task so simple.  Yet this had been her livelihood for as long as she could remember.  <BR>
<BR>
She took her dagger from the sheath at her belt, fingering the blade thoughtfully.  She had learned her trade well, and news had traveled fast that she was an assassin worthy of hire.  Known for getting the job done inconspicuously and quietly, the requests had come regularly, bringing healthy payment for targets exterminated.  <BR>
<BR>
The door to the inn opened and her target stepped into the night, cloak wrapped over his blade arm.  Chuckling softly again, she watched him stumble onto the dark trail leading to his home.  The man was well known for his ability to consume great quantities of ale.  It would be his undoing this night.  <BR>
<BR>
Richel followed silently, keeping a good distance between them.  The man staggered, almost falling several times before reaching the main trail leading to Red Larch.  She shook her head, wondering why the fool never hired a carriage to take him home.  He certainly had the funds to do so.  He paused at a stream, as he had done every night for the past fortnight.  So predictable, and right on time.  Stepping further into the shadows and holding the dagger between her teeth, Richel quickly reached between her ankles, pulling the back of her skirts through to the front, pulling upward to tuck the hem into her belt, forming pantaloons of sorts.  From her place in the shadows, she observed the man drinking from the stream, almost losing his balance and falling in.  She smiled, grasping the dagger in her right hand and moved quietly from tree to tree, keeping to the shadows, ever watchful for intruders.  <BR>
<BR>
The night was silent except for the soft sounds of the forest surrounding them.  No sound did she make as she crept closer and closer to the rivvil.  He began to hum softly to himself as he teetered slightly, returning to his feet.  The cloak, again, was thrown carelessly over his blade arm. "Wael," she thought to herself.  The trail turned south just ahead, and she knew that several red dragons lived in that area.  They would have a small snack tonight, after her task was complete of course.  She allowed him to proceed onto the trail that would eventually lead him to the spot she had chosen.  Ducking through the trees, she intercepted the trail, hearing him stumbling and humming softly as he came toward her.  Her breathing was calm, heart beat steady as she waited.<BR>  
<BR>
Just as she was ready to move in for the kill, a pair of thieves burst from the trees to the rivvil's right.  Crying out in fear, he struggled free his blade arm from the cumbersome cloak.  Richel cursed softly, knowing that she would lose payment, if the man was not executed by plan.  "Oh for the love of Lloth," she whispered under her breath.  Now she had two more to dispose of, and ironically, she had to save her target, before she could kill him.  She mouthed spells to prepare herself for battle, dropping a spell of invisibility about her before stepping from the shadows.  They were maybe 100 paces ahead of her, taunting the man, pulling at his hair and tunic.  Within casting range now, she mouthed another spell, sending a lightening bolt through the one closest to her.  The man fell, writhing in agony, his screams echoing through the darkness.  Cursing softly again, she silenced him with a magic missile, landed directly in the center of his chest.  Her "target" had finally stopped his wailing, and looked at her wide eyed.  <BR>
<BR>
The remaining thief, turned and advanced on her menacingly.  He out weighed her by almost 75 stone, to her estimation, and he seemed to be agile enough.  The "target", having regained his senses attempted to flee into the woods surrounding them, but she got a fumble spell off just before he entered the wood line.  As if not already clumsy enough, the man feel flat on his face into the mud with a splat.  Each time he attempted to regain his footing, he fell again.  "That should keep him for a while," she thought to herself.  "Now to the task at hand."  <BR>
<BR>
Turning to the thief standing before her, she shifted her dagger in her hand, moving around him.  He wielded a stiletto, a bit longer than her blade, and he had the advantage of reach on her as well.  She studied him carefully, testing him a few times to try to assess his skill level. He moved well, light on his feet parrying her advances with mastery.  She moved gracefully, her proficiency apparent to her opponent.  She was patient, watching, waiting for an opening.  It wasn't long before the thief obliged her.  As he came forward, his blade aimed at her heart, she brought her arm up, meeting his blade in a roundhouse motion with a clink of steel.  Though all she had was a dagger, her strength was astonishing, and she caught the blade just above the hilt, twisting the dagger at the last moment to slice through the back of his hand.  The razor sharp blade parted the skin of his hand like a hot knife melting butter, and the thief cried out in rage, trying not to drop the blade.  Dropping her left hand to her side, she flicked her wrist slightly, triggering the release of the shadow dagger she kept there. The movement began even as the blade appeared in her hand. As her right hand followed through in the arc, she brought her left hand up burying the shadow dagger to the hilt in the soft flesh of his belly.  He looked at her in shock, and her face lit in an evil grin as she drove the blade upward into his heart.  A satisfying gurgling was all she heard as the man crumpled to the ground.  <BR>
<BR>
Richel bent and retrieved the blade from the dead man, and wiped it on his tunic.  "Splash two," she thought to herself as she spun around to look a her "target".  He stared at her wide eyed, having seen the thief fall.  She grinned, advancing slowly toward him.  "This is going to be a pleasure after all," she thought.  Stopping a few paces from him, she mouthed a spell and targeted the rivvil.  The air surrounding him glowed with a blue green aura momentarily as the effects of the fumble were dispelled.  Chuckling softly, she moved a step closer.  "On your feet wael!" she ordered.  He hesitated slightly, but was urged to move when her boot landed against the side of his face.  Falling sideways, he whimpered softly as he pulled his feet beneath him and stood. "Move!!" she ordered.  Stumbling forward, the "target" did as he was bid.  She led him through the woods, emerging after a bit in a small secluded clearing.  "Stop here," she said.<BR>
<BR>
The "target" stopped as he was told, shaking in fear, eyes flickering wildly looking for an escape.  Richel stopped behind him bringing her boot up again and slamming it into the side of his knee.  The rivvil crumpled to the ground in a heap, groaning in agony.  Richel circled around him, grinning.  "Dos are such a wael," she said, voice low.  "If the payment for dos was naut so generous, I would tie dos to a tree and leave dos to the wolves."  The man whimpered, eyes wide with fear.  Yawning dramatically, she continued, "Still, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing dos suffer."    An aura of magic permeated the air about them as she dropped a globe of darkness large enough to obscure them from the view of any who might happen their way.  She had had enough surprises for one night.  The rivvil whined for mercy, but she just laughed at him.  <BR>
<BR>
She pulled out the small scroll she had brought with her, lifting the wards protecting it, then breaking the seal.  Her first task was to read the information to her "target".  Her voice was low and even as she spoke.  Raising an eyebrow in surprise, she chuckled softly before continuing.  The wael had incurred the wrath of his own father.  Having seen his son for the worthless sot he was, the man had hired Richel to end his heartache.  She shook her head, the rivvil staring at her in disbelief.  The preliminaries complete, she ordered him onto his knees and bound his hands behind him with a leather thong.  Though the rivvil cried out in pain at being forced upon the knee she had injured earlier, Richel showed no mercy.  <BR>
<BR>
The dagger blade flashed as she waved it under his nose.  "My instructions are quite specific.  Dos are to be awake through this process."  She grinned at him. "Sooooo sorrrrrry."  Her eyes bright, she stepped close and grasped his earlobe, pulling hard so that he cried out.  "Number one...dos never learned to listen to the words your father spoke."  In a deft motion, she brought the blade up, slicing his ear from his head.  He screamed in pain as her laugh echoed within the globe surrounding them.  She placed the ear into the pouch at her waist.  She went through the process of obtaining several other items specifically requested by her client, in similar fashion.  Finally, the final task was upon her.  <BR>
<BR>
Taking a small pewter box from the pocket in her cloak, Richel set it aside on a tree stump and turned to the rivvil.  He lay quietly, apparently having passed out from pain and shock.  Cursing softly, she waved her hand above him, bringing him back to consciousness.  Eyes wide with fear, he teetered on the brink of senselessness again.  A swift kick sent him onto his back with a thud, and he stared up at her, begging her for mercy.  She just grinned down at him, kneeling at his side.  "Your father's final request, is your heart," she said.  Rolling her eyes melodramatically, she said, "Why do rivven always have to be sooooo dramatic?"  Reaching down, she grabbed his tunic, ripping it to his waist, exposing his chest.  With slow deliberate movements, she cut him, reaching into the wound and grasping the still beating heart as the rivvil screamed in agony.  Their eyes met, as her hand closed and she pulled the heart free of the muscles holding it in place.  Deafening silence surrounded her as she stood and placed the heart into the waiting pewter box.  <BR>
<BR>
She waved her hand absently to lift the globe, walking to the nearby stream to rinse her hands.  Pulling the hem of her dress free of her belt, she dropped the fabric, shaking out her skirts.  She stood, closing her eyes momentarily and said a few words aloud.  Turning back to the clearing, she picked up the pouch and box, placed them in her pocket moving silently toward the trail.  The sounds of giant wings beating the air and a terrible stench assailed her senses as she reached the wood line.  She knew the rivvil was no more than a small snack to the great beast, yet it touched her mind appreciatively, as the massive jaws consumed the now lifeless rivvil.<BR>
