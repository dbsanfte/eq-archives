<P>      It has been a long time since the Noisy Assassin has left the sanctity of his kitchen, but for some reason the night seemed to be calling to him. The stars stand in the sky with unseen eyes as Delracnid leaves the caverns and heads toward the surface.  Being somewhat unaccustomed to life outside the caverns as of late, the assassin was cautious in the steps he took.  His eyes dart from side to side and he holds his dagger with a welcome comfort. Every motion, every sound, every smell becomes part of Del's own senses. There would be no surprising this assassin, regardless how absent he has been.</P>
<P>       A sound struck his ears and Del smiled in its familiarity.  They were the sounds of battle and it has been sometime since the Noisy Assassin tasted its pleasure.  Coming up over a grassy rise soaked in newly spilled blood, Delracnid unsheaths his dagger and gazes upon the ensuing action.  Three men with skin the color of crimson were finishing off the last of a small band of cowardly merchants.  As the merchants began to fall Del notices one of the demons that seemed to be taking immense pleasure of the killing.  His taste seemed to be more so than the two others that were with him, for he attacked with reckless abandon and fearless perservation.  On the hilt of that demon's blade was inscribed the name Seminole.  Del almost chuckled at the sight as the three demons reveled in their victory over the "courageous" peasants.         </P>
<P>       Standing up, the dark one walks toward the battle site with a smile. As the demons begin to take their fill of the merchants wares a loud clapping could be heard from over their shoulder.  </P>
<P>       "Well done...well done," the Noisy Assassin stated with obvious sarcasm, "How do you do it? And I believe that third merchant even had a pair of trousers to defend himself.  Very impressive."  Delracnid stared into the faces of the three demons, but only Seminole stared back with mocked amusement.</P>
<P>        "You care to share in our good fortune darky?"  Seminole put forth with a crooked smile. "There is plenty here for all, but you're going to have to ask nicely...oh, and on your knees...definitely on your knees." </P>
<P>       The two looked at each other with an admired respect.  Not for each other, but for their assumed skills in handling the blade.  As Delracnid fingers the blade of his dagger one of the other demons rises and makes a move towards the assassin.  Deftly ducking under a clumsy strike, Del reaches and grabs the demon's ankle as he goes by, tripping him to the ground.  With a speed hardly seen Del flips back and buries his dagger in the man's exposed back while he is on the ground, then rolls over him and lifts his head thus gazing into his eyes as the demon's vision begins to blur.  When life has passed Del pushs the dead red's head into the dirt and looks up to face the other two.  Seminole stares almost appreciatively and seemed to enjoy the death of his companion as it had been artistically done.  The other demon gazes back blankly, but soon gains the false courage of a revengeful attacker.  Rushing forward the demon begins to yell thunderously as if he knew it was to be the last sound uttered from his mouth.  Swinging wildly, Del takes two steps back to avoid the precarious strikes.  In this pitiful attempt the assassin actually notices that the demon's eyes were closed and let out a sigh in disbelief.  Stepping around Delracnid reaches up from behind his victim and brings his blade to the man's throat.  The demon's eyes shoot open as he realizes his time is coming near.  Pleading for his life and sobbing for mercy the demon becomes devoid of muscle and Del has to hold him up to avoid dropping him to the ground.  Turning the man around to face Seminole, Delracnid smiles as he notices Sem hardly paying attention to what was going on.  He actually seemed bored to the point where he might have killed his companion himself.  </P>
<P>      Placing his cheek against his victims, Del dug his dagger deep into the man's neck and enjoyed the warmth of the blood that flowed freely from the wound.  Delracnid let the man fall to the ground in a disheveled lump and wiped his blade on the red lapel.  Then it was Delracnid's turn to be somewhat surprised as Seminole began to clap.  Smiling to himself the assassin moved cautiously forward with his blade tilted in a defensive position.  Seminole circled around and unsheathed his dagger coming in from the right at an odd angle.  Spinning to his left Delracnid barely escaped a mortal blow as Seminole's blade sliced the his arm above the shoulder.  As quickly as he moved the assassin was able to turn around and catch the wrist of the red's other hand as he prepared to strike again.  The two were locked in a grappling position, each fighting for a leverage that would end this confrontation.  Then it happened.  Smiling in the furvor of battle, Seminole's ankle gave way as he moved back against a discarded urn thrown from the merchant's wagon.  Crying in disbelief, Seminole fell backwards but managed to keep his grasp on the assassin's wrists.  Falling forward Delracnid brought his hands up and grasped Seminole under the chin.  When Sem struck the ground Delracnid added his combined force and pressure and slammed Seminole's head into the earth.  Dazed, Seminole could do nothing as the Noisy Assassin raised his dagger in the air and brought it down upon his head...hilt first.  Sighing in relief, Del lurches forward and sling the unconscious red over his shoulder.  With ideas racing through his head the assassin makes his was back to the caverns with his gift in tow...</P>
<P>       Delracnid's fellow assassin's come forward as he walks into the caves.  Excited thinking Del has brought home a new meal they soon change their expressions as the Noisy Assassin shoots them a look.  There will be no cooking this night.  With Seminole still over his shoulder, Del quickens his pace through the caverns until he comes upon a certain drow's dwelling.  Laying the demon down against the wall the assassin casually knocks on the dwelling's door.  As the door creaked open Del's eyes meet the figure of a female drow, heavily cloaked and shielded from what little light there was.  </P>
<P>       "Come in Delracnid," she says with obvious charm, "and bring that obstruction that you have placed by my door."</P>
<P>       Picking up Seminole from under the arms, Del drags him inside Pyuna's home and plops him down next to her desk.  </P>
<P>       "I wish to ask a favor of you sis and it's a big one." the assassin states. "I would like to try something, but I need your help, for quite frankly...I do not know what I'm doing."                      </P>
<P>"Oh?  You have never asked me for a favor before Delracnid.  What is it that you want?"</P>
<P>"I seek to make this demon a drow...for I think..." </P>
<P> </P>
<P>"What?!  Absolutely not!  Do you know the ramifications of what you ask?!"</P>
<P>"I do...and I accept them.  This is my decision Pyuna and I will seek another way to do this if you are not willing to help.  I would prefer to keep this ' in the family ' if you know what I mean."</P>
<P>       Looking on Del with wisdom attained through valuable years, Pyuna nods in agreement with one last warning. "If he dies and people hear about what we have done, the blame will fall on you.  I will have nothing to do with it."  Agreeing to her terms Delracnid walks over towards Sem, but is stopped by a hand placed firmly on his shoulder. "Not here," Pyuna states coldly, "Let's take him to the ritual chamber downstairs."  </P>
<P>       </P>
<P>       The ritual chamber's walls are painted with the blood of many a victim.  From the casual meal to the prisoners of war, if the chamber had a voice it would be a wailing of torment.  Placing Seminole on a raised platform in the middle of the room, Delracnid ties his arms and legs to the sides making sure he is securely fastened.  While he does this Pyuna starts to rummage through a collection of vials that she has brought along.  After a couple of minutes Pyuna holds up a strange dark liquid to meet the approval of the Noisy Assassin.  "As long as we are being unorthodox...there is something that I too want to try." she says mischievously. "I do not wish to subject this demon to the oloth derived from Lloth.  I believe it will be too powerful and his insatiable draw to the spider queen will be too much for him to handle.  Instead...I would like to try a Vhaeraun derivative.  Surely Vhaeraun would like to ' recruit ' in the same manner as the spider queen."  Nodding in agreement, Del looks once more at the demon tied to the platform.  Seminole begins to stir as Pyuna makes her way toward him.  Holding him in place, Delracnid looks into Sem's eyes and smiles.  "Say goodbye to what you are demon.  For today you start a new life of darkness."  Seminole looks back with barely a movement.  Either he is still weak from the blow he received or he has accepted his fate, Delracnid does not know.  Holding his head up, Pyuna pours the contents of the vial onto the lips and into the mouth of Seminole.  Standing back she grabs Del's arm and pulls him away from the demon.  "There is nothing to do now, but sit and wait."</P>
<P>       At first there is stillness and Pyuna looks on with intriguement.  Suddenly Seminole's eyes open wide and he let's out a scream that resonates throughout the cavern.  His arms and legs tighten against the restraints and his veins begin to bulge as the liquid enters his system.  As the demon's cell structure begins to change Sem's skin goes from crimson to an offshade of grey.  Convulsing and pulling on his bindings, the demon can do nothing as his skin again changes...this time from grey to a dark black that appears to be sporadically littered with infrequent flecks of red.</P>
<P>"It seems that his color will retain some red...pity." Pyuna states coldly.</P>
<P>       As the process carries on Del notices the demon's eyes begin to change color as well.  Going from a dark shade to that of lavender in the matter of seconds.  Then another scream bellows from the demon and the chamber seems to shake in delight.  The pain seems almost unbearable and Delracnid begins to wonder if Seminole will indeed survive.  The demon's mass starts to shrink and his frame becomes more slender.  This process seems to be the most painful so far as the demon rips his bindings in a fit of rage.  Stepping back, Pyuna and Del look on in anticipation.  Doubling over Seminole takes on a new appearance, much larger than a normal drow, but very much smaller than his original state as well as that of an average human.  As he lays on his side the last thing that seems to change is Seminole's hair.  Gradually fading it becomes a peculiar shade of offwhite.  Then there is stillness.  Seminole does not move and appears motionless on the platform, a sweaty mess, but drow in appearance.  Walking cautiously over, Delracnid peers at the figure hunched before him.  "He lives, but is weak sis," Delracnid observes.  Joining Del by Seminole's side Pyuna places her hand on the new drow's forehead.</P>
<P>       "He will need time to adjust to his new body, but the worst is over.  I believe we have added a new member to our family Del," Pyuna smiles, then leans down and whispers something in Seminole's ear.  When she has finished she turns around and walks out of the chamber with her head held with the confidence of a successful transformation.  Turning his head slightly, but still in pain, Seminole looks squarely into the Noisy Assassin's eyes and says one word before passing out.</P>
