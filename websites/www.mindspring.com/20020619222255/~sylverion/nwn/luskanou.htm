<P>
Founded by the Pirate-Captains of Luskan, the Luskan Outpost's purpose is to warn Luskan of any threats from the south and east.  At first the outpost was composed of only a watch tower, but later a small town gradually formed around the tower.  The residents of the outposts are mostly northern men and are hostile to those from the south such as Neverwinter.  As with any town, the outpost includes an arms dealer and an inn.  Rumors abound about some dark and sinister force living somewhere near the outpost.  Those who have gone looking for this malevolent force haven't been heard from since.
<P>
Game Notes:  Those who run the outpost couldn't care less about the safety of visitors to the outpost.  Adventurers should thus be wary of traveling near the outpost as attacks by monsters are very likely. (Non- PvP Region)
