The steel in your hand am I<BR>
The means by which your foes must die<BR>
Upon my edge rests sleep of death<BR>
Separating flesh from breath<BR>
<BR>
Born in fire and quenched in cold<BR>
An avatar of Death, behold!<BR>
I strike them down upon the field<BR>
Shearing mail and cleaving shield<BR>
<BR>
A thirst for blood I cannot slake<BR>
As long as there's a life to take<BR>
When all are dead my time is done<BR>
Only then, the battle won<BR>
<BR>
My kin and I are all the same<BR>
You're the pieces of our game<BR>
And when you die, still I will play<BR>
Another hand for which I'll slay<BR>
<BR>
So guard me well and I'll guard you<BR>
Trust in steel, hard and true<BR>
You'll win all battles, except the last<BR>
And on that day your life is past<BR>
<BR>
