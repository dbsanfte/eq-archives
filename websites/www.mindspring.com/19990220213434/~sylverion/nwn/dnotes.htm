Many of the Drow words and phrases appearing below are excerpts from "The 
Drow of the Underdark" by TSR, Inc., and other authorized AD&D sources.
Where applicable, these excerpts are displayed in capital letters.  The 
remaining Drow words and phrases have been developed by the Temple of
Lloth ("TOL").  This dictionary may be distributed through licensed TSR
sites and used in connection with any AD&D role-playing activity.  However, 
TOL requests that no alterations or additions be made to this dictionary 
for use in Neverwinter Nights ("NWN") without the consent of the TOL GM.
<P>
This dictionary has been prepared by the Sorcere for the use of the Drow 
in dealing with other races and as a guide for other races in the proper 
dealings with the Drow.  To facilitate such use, the majority of this 
Dictionary has been translated into Common.
<P>
Any Drow allowed contact with other races should have received training in
proper conduct elsewhere, thus no effort has been made to supplement such
training here.  Non-Drow are advised to pay heed to these Usage Notes.  Many
Drow societies welcome mutually profitable or pleasurable dealings with other
races or societies.  However, the Drow are a justly proud people and are
quick to take offense -- often fatal offense -- at what they perceive to be
insults or breaches of etiquette.

You have been warned.
