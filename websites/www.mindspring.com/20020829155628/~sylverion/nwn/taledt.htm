"What are we to do with him?" The girl's  voice was saying. As his fever slowly faded, Mournbane lay on his side and feigned sleep while he listened. <BR><BR>
"I am uncertain as yet," another voice, this one male, answered. "Only two things are sure in this matter, that he is a drow, and that the drow are evil. Still, we will await his waking and learn what we may, ere we finally make this choice." There was a moment of silence, then he said, "Whatever did this to him may still be in the area. I will seek for signs so that we may know what it is we face here. Even if he wakes soon enough he may lie to us."<BR><BR>
The sound of heavy footfalls faded away from Mournbane. He could still hear the sound of light breathing from nearby. The girl, he decided.Other sounds: the shifting of linked metal, the creaking of leather, made him realize she was also a warrior.  And she is watching me like a hunting spider, he thought. Iblith! he swore in the darkness of  his heart.<BR><BR>
The young drow tried not to move overmuch as he tested his body. Unfortunately, he was unprepared for the pain he stirred in himself, and could not suppress a wince. His muscles were stone-stiff and his hands were bound. His skin felt very tight and swollen. He stank of the kind of sweat a perilous fever brings, and his mouth tasted of bile. Blood pounded in his temples.  At least, he thought, my bones are whole still.<BR><BR>
"So, you're awake. Good," the female voice said to him, almost concerned. Mournbane opened his violet eyes. Those eyes had branded him as "lesser", and "tainted" among his kin. They were a throwback to some surface dalliance of an ancestor. Their effect on this rivvil female seemed different. She appeared startled.<BR><BR>
Raising his head was too much of an effort for the dark elf, so he cast about himself with his eyes.They were in a shallow tunnel. There was dim light here. It was much brighter than the underdark he knew, and it made him blink. The air was moved from time to time by gentle, wafting breezes. It made the girl's dark hair flutter a bit. She tied it back impatiently.<BR><BR>
 He tried to appraise her abilities from the quality of her gear. She was tall and well muscled, but she wore ordinary-looking  chainmail and her sword's grip looked unworn. She was young also. And in her eyes was a trace of khaless: foolish trust.<BR><BR>
She still  has faith that the world will not leave her broken and ruined, Mournbane thought. She will learn.    <BR><BR>
"We found you here, my companion Dellsen and I. My name is Surynra. We tied you and took your gear because we know enough not to trust you," she said. The tone of her voice was not as assured as her words, though. "You were bitten many times by some creature or creatures, and though the wounds were small, they appear to have been poisoned; but with a venom whose purpose is not to slay, or else you would certainly have perished. The amount of poison in your body has greatly sickened you even so."<BR><BR>
Mournbane remembered. It was anything but pleasant. He suppressed a shudder and asked,"Who tended me then? For I am put out of sorts by these unhappy chances and know not if I was spared only to be put to some crueler fate."<BR><BR>
"Some of your wounds were already bound when we found you," she said. "We thought you had done what you could for yourself and then fell, perhaps overcome by the venom. If this is not so, then someone wrapped some of your wounds in strong silk, while leaving others untended. Perhaps this unknown ally fled our approach." Mournbane thought he detected a mocking quality in her voice. Or maybe it was fear. He smiled.<BR><BR>
He found that by determined effort, he could sit up, and felt sweat break out on his brow for his struggles. His hands being bound almost thwarted him. But his discomfort was easing, slowly. He eased his back against the tunnel's earthen wall. He knew the effects of the poison he was suffering from. This was a venom designed to subdue swiftly: to paralyze prey. It was quick both in the onset of its effect, and in its purging.  <BR><BR>
Surynra studied him. "We weren't hunting for drow when we set forth. There is a hill cat somewhere nearby that has killed a child from our village. It now must needs be slain, for it shall not fear to do so again. If we had not happened on this tunnel, perhaps you would have never waked again." She looked both cautious and concerned. Whom the concern was for, the drow could not tell. She only said,"Dellsen will be back soon. Then we will decide what to do with you."<BR><BR>
Mournbane closed his eyes, and waited.<BR><BR>
The drow's rest was all too short, for the male rivvil returned only moments later. <BR><BR>
The man gave Mournbane a looking over and a parody of a smile. "Well met indeed," he said. <BR><BR>
"Vendui'," the dark elf returned.<BR><BR>
The male turned to Surynra. <BR><BR>
He said, "Of what did him ill, I found no trace. The hill cat that killed the child is no more. I found its tracks and soon the beast itself. I was loath to slay the creature, even for all it had done, but it gave me no choice. I killed it with arrows even as it sprang upon me." Surynra nodded. "It was well that you did so. Whatever you feel for animals, that one would have proved a terror, I think."<BR><BR>
This man is dangerous, Mournbane thought. He is resolute enough in purpose to slay that which he prizes. How much easier it would be for him to kill what he sees as having little worth. I must occupy them both while my strength returns. And, he thought grimly, without making them suspicious.<BR><BR>
The drow kept his face as steady and impassive as he may. Mournbane said, "If I understand rightly then, your primary duty has been achieved. It is unfortunate for me that I am now in the position reserved for the hunted beast, awaiting the wisdom of another as to whether I should live."<BR><BR>
Dellsen's jaw twitched. Surynra looked sharply at the dark elf. A warning, Mournbane thought. She believes he will kill me, every bit as wholly as I do. Alas that I must test that. I will give him the story he craves, and though he will believe it not, it will buy me time.<BR><BR> 
"Your pardon," Mournbane said. "I fear that my events to tell you are all of woe, and will do nothing but put the dread of deep things in your hearts, and this should not be, for there are fair things below. They are rare, yes, but it may be we cherish them the more for their rarity. Whatever you may decide, what I say now is truth."<BR><BR>
"Far down in the earth lies my once-home, Maerimydra; a place of darkling splendor with glows of many hues to delight the eye. The cavern is a world in itself, with columns and arches both natural and created, that give testimony to the skill of our craftsmen and artisans. It was in this fair land that I and my elder brother, Jeggred, grew to our adulthood in. He was but two years my senior, and in all ways we were alike, save that his eyes were red."<BR><BR>
"We had the natural facility with magic that our race has been blessed with, and both took to learning magery and warrior skills so as to better serve ourselves and our people. Among my kind, males are the lesser sex, but even the females recognize that we are by no means useless, and often employ male guards. So we thought to enhance our worth."<BR><BR>
Mournbane saw that both Dellsen and Surynra were focused on him. He let the bitterness he felt in his heart creep into his voice as he continued his tale.<BR><BR>
"As Jeggred was my senior in age, so he was in magical skill as well. I was just about to achieve the rank which he had just left when our dwelling received a visit from the priestesses of Lolth's temple. The goddess demands a test from among those that rise in power, you see, lest the "unfaithful" gain some control of their own lives. Jeggred did not fear to go and take the test, though. He felt, as I did, that by seeking to serve our people we were being faithful to the goddess. We were utterly wrong. Jeggred never came back. It was then I knew that I must flee or die in the attempt."<BR><BR>
The drow saw concern in Surynra's eyes again. Even Dellsen's expression had softened. Mournbane noticed the dim light was failing and his skin was not so tight as it was. He felt much better. He readied himself, and continued.<BR><BR>
"Escape is not so easy as it may seem. One does not simply walk away from the yathrins, the priestesses. Were I to take patrolled paths I would certainly be caught, invisible or not, for our captains are crafty and fell in their skills, and there are many traps laid for those who are unwary. I chose to flee on the wild paths." He sighed. "There no patrols watch. But it is also that there the driders are driven."<BR><BR>
"The failures of the test are not slain, they are transformed. They are warped into a form whose very existence is punishment. It is their bodies that change, though, not their minds, and they keep their memories bitterly, seeking death and to take as many drow with them as possible, and so end. They lay traps also, though I guessed not as cunningly, for they have not the materials. That thought gave me small comfort when, a few hours from the city, I tripped one of them."<BR><BR>
Mournbane felt the bonds on his wrists slip down over his hands; they were no longer swollen enough to hold the loops in place. He exulted within, but mastered his expression lest he betray himself. "My invisibilty was dispelled by the violence of the trap. It was my attempt to shield myself from it that was my undoing. No matter. <BR><BR>
Four driders emerged from the gloom, and locked me in place with powerful enchantments. I was ready to die. They began to feed on me, filling my body with paralytic venom even as they slowly, torturously, began to drain my blood. I felt myself swooning. I took only little physical damage, but so much venom filled me as to render me insensate. At the last, I dimly recall hearing a voice like unto my brother's. Then a rush of heat filled the air with a stench, and darkness swirled down upon my eyes. I know not what happened, or who saved me. I know only what my heart hopes; that Jeggred hath not forgotten his brother as I have not forgotten him."<BR><BR>
The humans looked upon him, unsuspecting that he was free. The cord now useless in the sand at his back. Mournbane filled his hands with that sand. He honestly thought he saw compassion on their faces. He knew he could not take that chance. He had no khaless in him. It had been burned away.<BR><BR>
"Do you have my gear?" Mournbane asked.  It was Dellsen who responded, "It's with our horses at the front of the tunnel. Listen to me dark elf. I..."<BR><BR>
Sand darted from the drow's hands; it was harmless, but it was blinding.<BR><BR>
<BR>
Dellsen managed to avoid most of it, Surynra got a mouthful in her surprise.<BR><BR>
Mournbane released the magic words his mind had held since before the venom-fever took him. Both humans were locked unmoving by the same magics the driders had used on him. He pitied them. He knew how much it hurt, to be helpless. Never again will I be so, he thought. I hope Vhaeraun would be kind enough to take my life first.<BR><BR>
Their eyes locked on him in horror, thinking he meant to slay them. That hurt the dark elf. Did these rivvil really think him a beast?<BR><BR>
Mournbane told them, "I did not lie to you. I do not lie now. I will not kill you. But I do not trust you any more than you did me, and I will not be in your power. I will rule my own fate."<BR><BR>
He drew Dellsen's sword from the human's scabbard.<BR><BR>
"I also will not have you tracking me as a beast. This will heal, but it will also delay you enough that you will never find my trail."<BR><BR>
The drow said,"steel yourself, for this will be painful."<BR><BR>
The man's eyes followed the blade as far as they could, then shut tightly. Mournbane drew the blade across Dellsen's ankles, cutting into, but not through, the thick tendon at the heel. He set the blade in the sandy floor.<BR><BR>
"The spell will pass soon, but I shall be long away from here. Seek me not. If we again cross paths it shall be an ill meeting."<BR><BR>
He stepped toward Surynra and said, "Alas that one of us is not other than we are, for with our differences so great we shall never have more than this."<BR><BR>
Mournbane brushed the sand away from her lips, and kissed her. Then he walked to the tunnel's front, and donned his gear.<BR><BR>
In a few brief seconds the drow had made himself invisible and vanished into the trackless forests of his new home.<BR><BR>
