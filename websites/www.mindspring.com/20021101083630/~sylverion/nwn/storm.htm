Leaning toward the five he had chosen, the man spoke softly once more, "You will take no rest, you will waste no time, Neverwinter will be mine before summer's end.  This is Our will, let it be done."  Those final words spoken, he tipped his goblet and smiled at the image as the blood red wine spilled across the map, tendrils reaching out to engulf the Sword Coast and Neverwinter City.

With the threat to Neverwinter increasing, the drow of the Bregan D'Aerth mobilize.  Althought they do not care what happens to the rivvil infested town, they are determined to make a profit off of whatever befalls the region.  To these ends Abzzcesse, Abzzsta1n, Delracnid, Drakhen, Goodygater, Injurdman, Jantyr, Kh0lari, Modalex, Sagx, Sylverion and others of the BDA have scoured the countryside looking for information.  From this information they have determined what is the cause of the turmoil and have decided to do something about it.  What will become of the beasts known as Rakshasa....

The lands around the town of Neverwinter are once again a quiet and tranquil place for the rivvil of the realms to live.  Some say the Bregan D'Aerth only helped save the city because of their greed.  That they actually played both sides against themselves to profit from the chaos.  While none except the BDA will know if this is true, it is obvious to all that guild Bregan D'Aerth was the most prosperous guild to take part in the Stormbringers saga.  Congratulations to the following members and their pearl hauls: Abzzsta1n-23, Abzzcesse-17, Delracnid-4, Drakhen-19, Goodygater-2, Injurdman-5, Jantyr-1, Kh0lari-16, Sagx-62 and Sylverion-17. (special mention to Modalex, who figured out the threat was Rakshasa before anyone)

Special recognition has to go to the man of the event, Sagx.  Not only did this drow participate in every quest event, but he won something in everyone of them. Congratulation to Sagx for owning, "Turmiols Edge", "Point of no Return", "Destiny's Sight" and the final event "Eye of the Tiger".
