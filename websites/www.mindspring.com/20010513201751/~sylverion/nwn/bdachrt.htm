<P>
The Bregan D'Aerth is a guild of drow merchants, mercenaries and assassins who have banded together for protection and profit.  We are an organization that no longer desires to live within the structure of the normal drow, female ruled, society.  While some members may still choose to follow Lloth, many others choose not to.  The gods and goddesses our members follow, and the beliefs they may have, will be accepted so that we may empower the entire drow race.  This empowerment will enable us to rise against the other lesser races, to subvert them to our will and take back that which is rightfully ours. Take back that which was stolen from us, the surface!!  Under these premises the Bregan D'Aerth was formed to promote PvP and roleplaying in the vicinity of Neverwinter.

<P>
Applicants wishing to join the Bregan D'Aerth need to contact any member of the guild with the request.  This request should then be forwarded to the Ultrin Zhaunil (guild scribe).  Applicants will be required to send via email their class, alignment, stats, exp with NWN, exp with PvP, knowledge of the drow race, as well as a brief note as to why they wish to join the guild.  (ie. for the RP'n or the PvP etc.)  Applicants should be aware that the Bregan D'Aerth standards for entry are high.  A thourough understanding of the Realms is a must for prospective members. All applicants requesting admission to the Bregan must be sponsored by a current member.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Guild Requirements -</FONT>
<P>
The BDA accepts any non-good alignment and has no class or sex restrictions.  Characters must roleplay their characters as a Drow however.  Cleric/ Magic Users are strongly advised due to the combative nature of the guild and most of its members. Membership will not, however, be denied on the basis of class.  All players submitting an application must have already maxed one character, this is done to insure the level of play within the guild is kept to the highest standards possible. Applicants must be sponsored by an existing member in good standing.
<P>
RP participation in the BDA folder is also an intrigal part of the membership.  New members/ those requesting membership need to post a short RP story concerning their coming to the caverns of the BDA and requesting membership.
<P>
Since BDA is a mix of drow from all corners of the realms, individuality is stressed, there are no specific guild colors.  All members are required to have a drow icon and add the surname "Bregan D'Aerth" to their character.  All members will be required to post within the Bregan D'Aerth folder at least once a week.  The nature of the post is solely up to the author.  They can be based on quests, PvP fights, adventures in the realms, or just some good story writing.  Members should be able to RP a drow while adventuring in the realms and are asked to RP/show equality not subserviance when interacting with female drow.  It is suggested that the members role-play their PC's as arrogant, and of course, very evil! 
<P>
It will be the responsibility of the general membership to adventure with, quest, and PvP with new members and make them feel welcome in our organization.  New members (as needed) will receive instruction from the "inner circle" both in RPing and PvPing.  General membership may also help in this instruction, but it will be the listed responsibility of the Streeaka Velve del Jabbuk's (AGM's) and/or the "Inner circle". 
<P>
All memebrs will go through a screening process to determine if they will be an asset to the Bregan D'Aerth.  The screening process will consist of answering a questionair and completing a one month probationary period.  During the screening,  members will be part of the "third circle".  Upon succesful completion of the screening process, the applicant will be required to sign a loyalty oath.  After the loyalty oath has been received the applicant will become a full member, and will enter the "second circle" or general membership of the BDA.  When a member enters the second circle, a member of the "inner circle" will post a story announcing the applicants full membership.
<P>
All members must conform to TOS regulations.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Positions -</FONT>
<P>
As mentioned briefly above, there are three circles within the guild.  The description of each circle is as followed:
<P>
-Third circle<BR>
All members within the third circle are still undergoing the one month screening/ probationary period.  These are the newest applicants and have yet to prove themselves to the BDA as a whole.
<P>
-Second circle<BR>
This is for the general members of the guild.  As a member of the second circle these members have shown they have the ability to survive within the surface realms and are already outstanding players in many respects.  Most members will remain in this circle for some time.
<P>
-Inner circle<BR>
Only members that have mastered the RP of a drow character, post regularly, have a proven their exp of the realms, contributed to the vaults, and have mastered the arts of PvP will be asked to join this circle.  Members of this circle will also be required to perform certain official guild duties (ie. assisting new members with their drow characters.)
