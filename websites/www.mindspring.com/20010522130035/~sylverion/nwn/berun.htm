<P>
This local landmark is a bare-topped, conical hill that commands a splendid view of the valley of the river Dessarin to the east.  This lookout has often been used in time of trouble to watch  for advancing orc or barbarian tribes coming down from the North and east.  It is named for the famous ranger Berun, who met his end here at the hands of such a horde.  He failed to stop the orcs, but slew over 300 single-handedly before he was overwhelmed.
<P>
Bandits watch here for the approach of likely victims.  Northern legend has it that a dwarven tomb lies under the hill, rich in golden armor treasures, but none has ever found it, and dwarves know nothing more of it than legend.
