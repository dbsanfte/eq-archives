Once upon a time there were three rivvils. There was Palamu rivvil, there was Rangmu rivvil, and there was Clam rivvil. They were brothers. They were happy. They got awful arrogant...and here is their story.<BR><BR>
Now it happened that these three rivvil wanted to settle down (as rivvil do) in little houses near to one another. And so it was that they each set about building their happy homes.
Palamu rivvil liked people a lot, so he built a little temple-house on the outskirts of a rivvil village. Unfortunately for Palamu, he gave all his money away, to his church and to the poor, so he had to build his house from straw. But he was happy.<BR><BR>
Rangmu rivvil liked animals a lot, so he built a little house in the forest. Rangmu decided to use wood, but only from trees that had died of natural causes. After much searching in the forest, he still needed one more tree. So, in his frustration, he cut one down. No one was looking...and he would plant two tomorrow. <BR><BR>
Clam rivvil liked to meditate and look at the stars a lot, so he decided to build his house in the hills. He made his home a tower, so he could see far away. He also liked to look down on people. He made his tower from stone, because he wanted to show off.<BR><BR>
The three rivvils were very happy...for a while....<BR><BR>
Now it happened that a drow warrior had been given a bachelor party by his abbils. And these friends thought it would be fun to play a joke on their unsuspecting comrade. So, when the groom-to-be was distracted, they spiked his drink with sleep poison, and waited for him to drink it. He did. Soon he was fast asleep.<BR><BR>
His friends grabbed his sleeping body and dimension-doored the way to the surface. They stopped only for a brief memorizing here and there, thinking that if their friend woke up, they would d-door out and let him walk home (they knew he didn't have the spell himself since he had asked for a scroll as a gift). But he slept on, soundly.<BR><BR>
At the surface, he was still sleeping, and the abbils began to worry that they had given him too much poison. "Nah," one said, "He just can't hold his toxins. Whatta lightweight!" 
"Aye," said another, "we should give his sorry backside to the rivvils!"<BR><BR>
The nineteen males looked upon one another's faces. As one, they grinned. As one, they nodded. Then they proceeded to take him to the rivvil village. But as they got near the village, their abbil started waking up. So they did not enter the village, instead they left him: in the middle of the night, in a flowerbed, on the side of a small, straw, house. <BR><BR>
"Iblith! my head...what was in that drink abbils?" said the lone male when he awoke. He sniffed, phew! flowers!?! Only then did he realize what his abbils had done. He laughed. Those guys...<BR><BR>
The drow looked at the straw house, went to the door, and knocked.<BR><BR>
Stirred from sleep inside the house, Palamu said, "Who is it? What do you want?"<BR><BR>
The warrior answered, "Pardon me rivvil, please let me in, I need your facilities to relieve myself in." <BR><BR>
Using bushes was so...dwarven. He just couldn't stoop that low.<BR><BR>
Palamu, recognizing the drow word for human, said, "Go away drow! I'll not let you in! Not by the beard that hangs from Tyr's chin!" <BR><BR>
The warrior said, "But you have my word, I just need to go. I'll be in and be gone and no one will know."<BR><BR>
And Palamu said, "The word of a dark elf! Ha! What a laugh. Now get out of here or I'll cut you in half!"<BR><BR>
Then the warrior drow became angry. He said, "Very well rivvil! You've pushed me too far. So stay in your darn house and I'll watch you char!"<BR><BR>
With those words, the drow released a fireball upon the straw house, which was not very fireproof. Soon, both it and Palamu were ashes.<BR><BR>
The drow then fled to the nearby forest, hoping to find a secluded enough spot so he could do his business without offending the Queen of Spiders. He didn't think she'd have him dridered just for a whizz...but you never know with her. She's like that.<BR><BR>
Just as he was about to give up hope, he spied a dim light through the trees. He decided to try again....<BR><BR>
Going up to the door of the little wood cabin, he knocked upon it.<BR><BR>
"Be not alarmed, O abbil inside. May I stop in quickly, before onward I stride?"<BR><BR>
And Rangmu, whose house this was, answered, "I know the word 'abbil', but your friend I am not. Be off with you! You dark-elven sot!"<BR><BR>
The drow then said, "I just want some privacy, a moment's I ask. Why must you insult so and take me to task?"<BR><BR>
Rangmu responded, "To you and your kind I've nothing to say. Get out of my forest and be on your way!"<BR><BR>
And the drow said, "Your forest? YOUR FOREST? Your deathbed you mean! A few hours hence and just black will be seen!"<BR><BR>
As before, the drow launched a fireball at the tiny dwelling. Unlike before, he threw another into the forest for good measure. As the flames consumed the forest, he ran toward the hills.<BR><BR>
Great, he thought. This is about as exposed as it gets: barren rock and earth, no proper facilities of carefully molded stones.... He wondered if his eyes were yellow yet. He must remember to have less ale next time.<BR><BR>
Then he saw a small, stone tower. It was just up the hillside from him. He smiled. Wizards understand the need for privacy.<BR><BR>
Approaching the tower, he was about to knock on the door when he saw a figure looking down on him from the roof.<BR><BR>
The drow called out, "Vendui' fellow magi. May I come in?"<BR><BR>
And the wizard said, "Not by the dimples that are on<BR><BR>
Mystra's...uh...chin!" He coughed, then said, "I have seen fires run rampant this night. First down in the village, now the forest burns bright."<BR><BR>
And the drow muttered, "With one after the other, these rivvils I'm cursed, and this fool in his tower is most likely the worst."  <BR><BR>
With that, the drow warrior took some of his manticore spines from his backpack and held them in his hand.<BR><BR>
The dark elf said, "I would have asked, almost pleaded, to just come inside. I crave relief so, I'd have swallowed my pride. But all of you rivvils, so full of yourselves, can't talk to us drow like you do other elves."<BR><BR>
And Clam on the tower said, "You claim to ask. What you do is demand! You and your kind from under the land. Go down to your tunnels and stay there for good! There's no place for you here, under sun and in wood."<BR><BR>
Clam then decided to put a globe of protection around himself, just in case. He started to cast it.<BR><BR>
The dark elf threw his six spines saying, "You treacherous rivvil! These spines in my hand, will end your spellcasting should one of them land."<BR><BR>
The spines flew upward. All of them missed. The globe shimmered into being. <BR><BR>
Clam said, "No fire for me, and no lightning too. Pity I can't say the same thing for you." He started casting again. He was happy. <BR><BR>
The drow had started casting too, just before Clam had. He finished his cast and said, "You rivvils find strange things in which to have mirth. Laugh this one off then, whatever it's worth."<BR><BR>
Up on the tower, Clam stopped. His features went slack and his eyes glazed. He drooled a lot. The drow made sure he wasn't under him, as Clam had been leaning forward to cast his spell...<BR><BR>
THUD!<BR><BR>
The warrior said, "I asked you rivvil, time and again, but your arrogance forced me to feeb your brain in."<BR><BR>
Looking through the cleric-mages' stuff, the drow found the key to the tower's door. Using it almost recklessly, he threw the door wide and raced for relief....<BR><BR>
When he entered the tunnels leading to the underdark a little while later, his abbils, who had waited for him, handed him a dimension door scroll. He grinned. They grinned back. Those guys....<BR><BR>
After a read magic spell, he scribed his prize into his spellbook. Then everybody memmed, and started dooring home.<BR><BR>
As for Palamu, Rangmu, and Clam...they all stayed happily dead ever after.<BR><BR>
