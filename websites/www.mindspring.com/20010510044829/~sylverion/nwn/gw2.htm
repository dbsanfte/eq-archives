<FONT SIZE=+2>The quest for glory of the Bregan D'Aerth is a path showered in accomplishment.  Our ascension from the Underdark into the sun cursed realms of Neverwinter was foretold eons ago in the pages of Chath Zhuan'ol.  What was the aim of the dark assassins known as the BDA?  No less than subjugation of the crown on the Sword Coast, Neverwinter.  Many stood in the way of this path of conquest, some for the protection of the innocents, some from jealousy and desire of the same jewel that is Neverwinter.  But the results were the same, death at the hands of the mighty BDA.  Last upon the battlements were the self proclaimed "gods" of KAAOS.  Their desire, the total annihilation of Neverwinter.  While the drow certainly have no love of the rivvil of Neverwinter, their goals were much more insidious and involved the capture and enslavement of the waelen. There could be no compromise between these two goals or with the beings from KAAOS.  Our goals were too dissimilar, conflict was inevitable.<BR><BR>
The two armies formed and proceeded to do battle in the mists of the night, the time most appropriate for the drow.  Fire, brimstone, lightning and poisonous clouds filled the night air, making even the most heroic cower under their covers in fear.  As the battle raged on, the tide flowed back and forth with first KAAOS taking the upper hand.  But the drow can never be taken for granted, their resilience is too great.  The battle came down to a final struggle, a struggle that would mean a taste of the very life blood of Neverwinter.  A titanic last ditch battle was raged between XO2 Zeus, Sednablood, Xylot and Sagx of the BDA against Sir Rellik, Slayve, Ego Prime and Kal Mirage of KAAOS.  Much blood was spilled throughout this battle and all previous battles, but standing on the rotting corpses of their enemies was the drow of the Bregan D'Aerth.  Neverwinter itself had just fallen to the black assassins known as the Bregan D'Aerth.
