Mournbane sat cross-legged on a carpet of fallen needles beneath the great boughs of a mighty pine tree. His back rested against its trunk; from which the long branches struck outward and downward, until their very tips swept the forest floor, some fourteen paces away. The canopy of green needles was thick and dense. The air had a scent of pine so overwhelming as to wipe all other scents away.  It was a perfect, natural hiding place, where the prey might find escape from the predator; or a drow might find sanctuary from the sun. <BR><BR>

Ten days had now passed since he had escaped the two humans who had found him, poisoned and unconscious, following his abandoning the underdark. He counted those ten days among the hardest of his life. He was hungry, for he was not yet able to forage the surface with much skill, and so ate of his rations sparingly. Ever and anon he was able to supplement his diet with a night bird he brought down by a magic missile, but never got more than one in a night, they were not trusting creatures. His skin was sloughing away in places  from the gentle caresses of sunlight. He found some small victory in that no other of his race would see him in this hideous condition. Also, he had water available from a stream nearby, and from the droplets that the twilight leaves behind, should  he not care for much movement. He was on the surface, alone, and he was alive, still.<BR><BR>

As he sheltered beneath the tree, Mournbane let his mind wander through the words of the old histories he had read. Things which he had risked life and limb and soul to understand--for the females guarded knowledge jealously--now seemed worthless. In the songs and writings which remembered glories of the drows' surface-dwelling days of times long past, there was no mention of how terrible and painful the touch of light could be. And why should there have been? he thought and shook his head ruefully, when the songs and tales were set down, their writers still remembered the descent; and the light before it. The surface was still their home then, if not in truth, then at least in desire. It had not yet become The Land of Awful Light.<BR><BR>

Now, it was more than common knowledge among the drow that the sun had become an anathema to them. Most drow hate and fear bright light. Yet, Mournbane had not feared the sun. His delving into ancient texts and verses had shaded his reasoning with the firm belief that the drow could, and would, take back the surface world. And his strong faith in his own abilitiy to survive caused him to underestimate his own susceptibilities. He knew daylight would play havok with his delicate eyes; as much as would any light spell. It would be unpleasant, and a hindrance. He would simply deal with it. Precautions could be taken against being blinded. To his mind, the true danger of light spells lay in their revealing their victim in a way that drew the attention and fire of their enemies. If not among enemies, then light was of no consequence save annoyance. So he thought.<BR><BR>

His experiences on the surface were showing him his error. Here, light was far more than that which lays bare a skulker, or banishes a shadow. Here, light was a weapon. It was, in equal parts, brightness and fire. He began to finally understand the expressions from among the rivvil slaves, bemoaning their loss of "night" and "day". It meant far more than simply, "star-half" or "sun-half", "rest time" or "work-time", as the yathrins -thrice cursed, iblith tongued priestesses!- had told him. To Mournbane, its meaning was become the difference between sight and blindness, coolness and heat, life and death.<BR><BR>

He recalled that drow merchants, slavers, and raiders often came to the surface at night, and they had no difficulties with the light of the moon and stars. There were some drow that could embrace the surface night illumination easily, while others among the dark elves required a few trips to the surface darkness to adjust to the differences of it: the even-white glow of moonlight, the faint silver radiance of starlight. The air was not as moist as below either, and there were odd scents here as well. All of these strangenesses combined to create confusion in those who must endure them for the first few times. Still, when those drow who were especially sensitive were given extended time for their eyes to toughen, they grew able to tolerate the brighter light.<BR><BR>

Alas, thought Mournbane, that Jeggred and I were born not to the merchant's caste, and so stayed below. We could have then learned of the surface ways at our leisure and with little risk to ourselves. Now, I must adjust to these things, and I determine that it must be quickly done. If I am blind, then I am potential prey for anything that wishes to make me so. I must learn by trial my limits. By small doses one may develop a resistance to poisons, I will attempt to apply the same ritual to my present situation. <BR><BR>

He comforted himself thinking how certain nobles of the drow routinely consumed small amounts of the more popular ingestible poisons so as to diminish any chance that they fell prey to treachery. But his optimism lessened then. For if there have been any among the underdark drow who have walked at will abroad on a sunny day, he knew them not. <BR><BR>

When first he fled from the tunnel where he awoke as a captive, it was into a clear, starry night, with a shard of silver-white moon still in the sky. He found that he could see well, though the moonlight was a very different light. It was a sharper, clearer, light than the faerie fires and phosphorescent glows he was accustomed to, but it brought with it no discomfort. Perhaps sunlight would be much the same; in type, if not in intensity. He felt confident that, with protection, and determination, he could face the radiance long since denied. He began his preparations excitedly, and sought out a place to await the dawn.<BR><BR>

The drow secreted himself within a copse of smallish pines. Their branches fairly obliterated the moonlight. He would rather have chosen a cave for himself. Then he could have simply started in the depths of the cave, and , as his eyes adjusted themselves to the surface light, slowly emerged until, at the last, he would exit the cave, and stand forth beneath the sun. <BR><BR>

If the rivvin chose to be waela -human foolishness was legendary among the drow- and did try and stalk him, they would scout out the caves and tunnel entrances. No, Mournbane thought, I have injured the man well enough to hinder him for some time. My kindred may prove more difficult to avoid, however. The other drow certainly would stalk the tunnels if they did not think him dead, or could simply stumble upon him accidentally if they did. He would not chance any of the occurences. So while the lone drow wished to avoid contact with any beings, he did not wish to hide so completely from the sun, lest he gain no resistance from lacking a significant dose of its light. He pondered that too much would, no doubt, be as undesirable as too little. But he fancied that the thicket should prove as shadowy as any cave if he should need to escape the light. He could always summon darkness to him. All drow had that ability, and on a whim. He gave a smirk. He would master the surface easily.<BR><BR>

The stars were slowly fading. A bright grayness was filling the sky. His eyes began to flicker of their own accord. <BR><BR>

He had cut a strip of cloth from his silken tunic sleeve, and, dismayed that this thicket was not quite the shadowy haven it had first appeared, now bound it about his eyes to help shield them. He pulled his piwafwi closer about himself, and its hood over his head, hoping that the cloak would provide some additional protection. He held the thin protective fabric around himself with both hands, and bowed his head slightly, so his hood would not slip. Fear and anticipation warred within him.<BR><BR>

Then the first rays of dawn stretched out across the realms, and smote him to the ground.<BR><BR>

The light cut through the cloth covering his eyes as lightning slashes through a spider web. His eyes slammed themselves shut. Tears flooded them. He put his head down in an attempt to avoid the awful brightness, but he feared to take his hands from holding his cloak to him, lest the brilliance consume him. The trees were no protection. He was lost amidst whiteness and pain.  And still the day brightened. He began to feel heat from somewhere. It was all about him. It was not painful, but then his cloak was protecting him. Minutes went by. It seemed he could see through the skin of his eyelids as though they were no more than a faint reddish haze. His eyes began to ache and throb. Reflexively, his palms came up to shield them. The cloak slipped a bit to one side. Just as the purple worm-skin gauntlets shut the rays away from eyes, he felt the skin on his arm, exposed as it was betwixt gauntlet and sleeve, burn as though it had been lashed by the dark fire of the yathrins. He fell to his knees. Desperately, he called upon his natural ability to summon darkness. It would not come. There was no escaping the ravages of the sun so long ago deserted. He wondered if he had avoided the  test after all. <BR><BR>

Then the pain lessened. He fought the fingers of one hand apart slightly, but kept the other closed. With the one eye, he looked about him, through his barely-split fingers, at once both thankful and wary. His eye remained a teary squint. He could see There was still much light, but as it was before the sun had attacked him. Mists played across the sky. He hoped they would last long enough for him to find a more secure refuge from his torment. Staggering to his feet, he plunged through the brush. The sun danced around the clouds. He fancied the orb was being spitefully fickle in its antics: half-joyful of the return of one of its children long unseen...half-mad with veangeance for its desertion.<BR><BR>

He sought shelter deeper within the wood. His eyes he shielded with his hands. Whenever there were clouds, he could move. Whenever the sun emerged, he was forced to halt or stumble blindly. His heart turned to his god. "Vhaeraun," he said, "if it be your will that I die here, then let that be so. But greater service could I do thee alive than I would as a shade. If you would have your people walk on the surface of Faerun again, do not let us die even as we achieve it." But if Vhaeraun heard him, He gave no sign.<BR><BR>

How long the dark elf wandered, he knew not, for pain dulled his sense of time passing. After what could have been minutes or a day, half-blinded and with blistered skin, he tripped over a low branch that his tortured eyes had not shown him, and fell forward and through the verdant canopy it was part of. The branches swished back into place above him. In the semi-darkness beneath the boughs, he glanced around as best he could. His skin felt scorched and his eyes swam with phantom-flashes of purple and red, and images of things no longer there. He shook his head and rubbed his eyes, but the images would not depart. He wondered briefly if he would ever see again. He reached about himself, his hands seeking what his eyes could not. Sensing the tree's trunk, he crawled to it, whispered thanks to Vhaeraun, and lay there. He had found safety, for now, at least.<BR><BR>
