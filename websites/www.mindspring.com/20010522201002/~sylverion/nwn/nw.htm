Called "The City of Skilled Hands", Neverwinter (pop.  17,000) is the largest town on the rugged coast north of Waterdeep.  As the headquarters for all adventurers in the area, it is your base of operations in the game.
<P>
Known for its skilled craftsmen and beautiful indoor gardens, Neverwinter derives its name from the Neverwinter River. This clear blue stream, which runs along the northern edge of the city, is warm year-round and doesn't freeze even in the harsh storms of the violent northern winters. No one knows the explanation of this phenomenon, and the river's source lies some where deep in Neverwinter Woods, which is shrouded in mystery and feared by all manner of beings.
<P>
Protected by the natural barrier of the Neverwinter River, the town's peaceful image belies its violent past. For centuries Neverwinter suffered with the rest of the Sword Coast under the waves of attacks by  orcs streaming through the mountains from the east. In recent times the town had been considered relatively safe except for an occasional attack by raiding parties from  the north.
