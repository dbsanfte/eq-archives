This could be the last issue of <em>The Lair.&nbsp; </em>I am very distraught over the
recent changes and have decided not to renew my account for another six months.&nbsp; I
changed it to a one month renewal and I am going to submit the petition to them on
September 30, 1999.&nbsp; I will update the page then to tell you that it has been
submitted and to post the answer to the questions from Geoff Zatkin.&nbsp; Beyond that
there will be no new features.&nbsp; I will give Verant 15 days to respond and if I &nbsp;
have not seen the changes I propose I will cancel the account and invest my hard earned
money elsewhere.&nbsp; The interviews have begun!&nbsp; Because of the major changes in
the patch, I held up sending the questions to Geoff Zatkin and he has yet to respond but
it has only been a few days.&nbsp; Hopefully my answers will be here before too long.
&nbsp; They might be busy dealing with the issues from the recent patch.&nbsp; We are
taking a look at many of the recent changes and where I see the class going.&nbsp; I am
extremely concerned about the direction the necro class is taking.&nbsp; <strong>The
Petition is ready for your signatures</strong>.&nbsp; With the help of <a href="http://www.bravenet.com">Bravenet.com</a>, I have set up a guestbook for you to
sign.&nbsp; This will mark your approval of the petition that I am going to forward to
Verant.&nbsp; </p>

<p>BRAD McQUAID - I spoke to Brad on the phone and he has decided that my questions will
be better answered by Geoff Zatkin, the individual responsible for all aspects of caster
balance and spells.&nbsp; Brad did give me a few comments on changes being tested and
changes to the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; Your questions are submitted and Geoff will be getting
back to me as soon as he returns from vacation.&nbsp; I was very impressed with the ease
of the discussion's with both Brad and Geoff.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT'S COMING</strong></p>

say that this section will be up next week.</p>
