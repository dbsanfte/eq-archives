<p align="center"><big><strong><em><font color="#800000">OUR PETITION</font></em></strong></big></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Dear Verant:</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000">We, The Dark Brotherhood, Necromancers
of Norrath, do hearby request the following changes to our class.&nbsp; We are not
attempting to become a super class but to merely stop the bleeding.&nbsp; Our class
continues to be a target of changes and as such has fallen out of balance with the other
pure casters.&nbsp; We feel these changes will better that balance and put us on an even
playing field.&nbsp; I will attempt to explain the logic behind these requests as I make
them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<strong>1)&nbsp; Research needs to be revamped</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;
Words for a rank of spells should be on monsters of the levels before that rank</strong>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000">Currently some of our most powerful spells are by
research only.&nbsp; Obviously our pet is our most powerful spell and at current few
necromancers have attained the Words for these pets.&nbsp; The other classes do not have
to research their most useful spells and Magicians can buy all of their pets to level 49.
&nbsp; We feel this places us at an extreme disadvantage.&nbsp; A quest has been added to
help us get our pet Words but to get level 44 quest components we must kill a level 49 NPC
and to get the level 49 quest components, we must enter the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; We feel
that once we have earned a level we should already have the words and a chance to do the
research.&nbsp; At current a Word has a chance to load on a NPC the level of the rank
though the level lower than the next rank (i.e. a L34 word could be on a NPC L34-38).
&nbsp; We propose that they should start having a chance to load the rank before (i.e. a
L34 word could be on a NPC L29-33).</font></p>

<p align="left"><strong><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">2)&nbsp; Our resistance's
should be the same as other casters.&nbsp; </font></small></strong></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Our
resistance level for our spells is entirely too high.&nbsp; Darkness resists more than a
third of the time (35%) and this is unacceptable.&nbsp; We propose a resistance of 18%
chance on equal NPC's.&nbsp; Less as the NPC's level gets lower and more as it gets higher
to a 100% resist at six levels the same as Wizard's.</font></small></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>3)</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Don't
touch our pets and make them available at vendors.&nbsp; </strong></font></small></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <small><font face="Bookman Old Style">We Necromancers have
faced the turmoil's of life in Norrath from our birth.&nbsp; We have paid the price in our
social &quot;stigma&quot; many times.&nbsp; Deaths due to NPC's that hate our class and
believe me there are a ton of them out there.&nbsp; The reward has always been raw power.
&nbsp; Well, I have seen the risk and the reward, I thought,&nbsp; was a tremendous pet at
levels 39, 44 and 49.&nbsp; Now that many of us are finishing the journey and have earned
the reward, the pet components for research are too rare and if we do get them they have
been weakened.&nbsp; If you have a problem with melee classes then strengthen them, do not
weaken our pet.&nbsp; We propose that you return the pets to their pre-patch level
immediately and either increase the load rate for research components (see request #1)
&nbsp; or make them available at vendors as magician pets are.</font></small></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>4)&nbsp; We should have the
gate spells.</strong>&nbsp;</font></small></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This only makes
sense based on the back story of Everquest.&nbsp; According to their own history the first
necromancer, Miragul, was both a Wizard and a Necromancer.&nbsp; If this is the case it
makes sense that he would have had full knowledge of all the Wizard spells.&nbsp; Since
others have been jealous of our power for the ages and seek to destroy us on sight, I know
our forefathers would have sought methods of safer travel.&nbsp; The gates are the
answer.&nbsp; Making us able to gate ourselves around Norrath would aid in our travels and
counter act the disadvantages we have to live with from our choice of class.&nbsp; Once
again I do not want to be a super class, these gates should be caster only and not group
portals.</font></small></p>

<p align="left"><strong><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">5)&nbsp; We need some Direct
Damage.</font></small></strong></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;&nbsp; Though we are a great
soloing class there is only so far you can go on your own.&nbsp; Our damage over time
spells work well in solo combats but aren't worth much in groups.&nbsp; You don't have 4
minutes to finish of a mad froglok in Lower Guk.&nbsp; We need a direct damage spell that
will make us more appealing to a group.&nbsp; I go into a dungeon and shout level 44
caster looking for a group and I get a ton of replies, I shout level 44 necromancer
looking for a group and it is silence. &nbsp;&nbsp; The dungeons are where our items and
research components are and we need to be made viable to groups that roam them.&nbsp; A
lot of you will say Ignite Bones is 495 points of direct damage and I say, wait to you
have it.&nbsp; It is resisted more than the darkness line.&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a more
dependable direct damage spell or to lower the effect time on Scourge, Boil Blood and
Heart Flutter.</font></small></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel these
changes will be effective in returning us to a viable class that will be sought after and
welcomed in groups throughout Norrath.&nbsp; </font></small></p>

<p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style">Thank You, </font></small></p>
