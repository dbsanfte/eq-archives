Level: 44<br>
Mana Cost: 210<br>
Research Only:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No - Available at the guilds.</small></p>

<p><small>Necromancer direct damage.&nbsp; We asked for it and we got it.&nbsp; This spell
dishes out 495 points of damage.&nbsp; It also stuns the target for three seconds and
turns them into a skeleton.&nbsp; A lot of people asked what the purpose of turning them
into a skeleton was, it gives the target those qualities.&nbsp; Like a skeleton, the
target has no magical resistance and no armor class.&nbsp; Now your pet can hit for max
damage and your spells get in.&nbsp; This power comes at a cost, it is slow casting and
highly resisted.&nbsp; I am not real sure what the exact rate is but it is up there.
&nbsp; It doesnt take but one resist for this spell to become a liability.&nbsp; Requiring
210 mana means that you will soon find yourself out of mana having done no damage with
just a few resists.&nbsp; I do not have exact data yet from Verant but the general feeling
is that the resist rate was lowered on the last patch.&nbsp; I myself have noticed that it
is sticking a lot more.&nbsp; I look forward to getting hard numbers from Verant soon so
we can know for sure.&nbsp; Even with the resists this is a great finishing spell when all
goes well.</small></p>

<a name="NULIFY MAGIC"><font color="#0000FF">Boil Blood</font></a><br>
Level: 29<br>
Mana Cost: 150<br>
Research Only:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No - Available at the guilds.</small></p>

<p><small>This is a necromancer staple spell.&nbsp; One of Lotar's must haves'.&nbsp; This
is a very mana efficient DoT that does aproximatel 500 points of damage for 150 mana.
&nbsp; 3.3/1 is a good ratio.&nbsp; It is also very stable, I very rarely see Boil Blood
resisted except in unique situatuions (i.e. the Kobalds in Solusek B seem to have a very
high resistance to fire.....imagine that).&nbsp; It also has a good duration, aprx. 90
secs which means it is condusive to group situations.&nbsp; An all around great spell, buy
your copy today.</small></p>

Level: 49<br>
Mana Cost: 300<br>

<p><small>The last in our Darkness line of spells.&nbsp; This one is worth the wait.
&nbsp; The slowing effect takes a NPC to below a walking speed.&nbsp; It's damage is 1600
and it has a good duration of 90 seconds.&nbsp; When I started looking at these kind of
numbers, I finally saw part of the reward for all the greif we have endured getting there.<br>
