It has been quite a while since there has been a new tale told.  This one will not be long remembered for its importance, but it does need to be told.<br>
It all started with two bored wizzies with a grand plan.  (This, I need not point out to you is always a dangerous thing.)<br>
Stumen and Katyia actually manage to convince Sin, Utenen and Bonecrusha to accompany them to the Plains of Justice for experience and grand adventure.  They also manage to pick up another unsuspecting tank named Tilin who had previously never had the pleasure of fighting with McMarrins.  Boy was he in for a treat.  Bonecrusha from the beginning was very distressed that we didn't have a cleric among us.  Katyia wisely points out that we have a druid and this plane isn't very difficult anyway, so we shouldn't have any major problems.  <br>
After sitting for about an hour trying to get the whole group to meet in the Graveyard, we are finally ready to fight something.  Now all we need is a spot.  The nervous tanks insist that first they must find the way out of the zone before we start anything.  We ask a couple of people hanging out in the zone if they can just show us the exit.  They stare at us unblinkingly and say nothing.  Finally someone goes to show them the way out.  Kat and one of the tanks stay behind while the rest go to seek an escape route.  The guide tells them to click on the door to get out, so they all click it and promtly end up back in PoT wondering how they got so far away.  Sin figures she should find KEI while she is out of the zone so goes off in search of it.  Stumen, never having made it to the exit door is wandering the halls of Justice lost.  None of us can go look for him because none of us know how to get around the zone.  Finally he gates out and makes his way back.  Sin (the druid)  finds KEI in the nexus and disbands for a while to get her crack.  Bonecrusha becomes very very confused.  He is wondering where she went.  The rest of us meet back in the graveyard and wait for Sin to get back, trying to explain to Bone where she went.  He begins again to worry that we don't have a cleric.  Kat reassures him not to worry, the druid is coming back.  He doesnt understand how a druid can join when the group is already full.  We again explain that the druid left to get crack and will be back shortly.  He begins to panic that we don't have room for the druid because the group is full.  The rest of us stare at him, confused.  The druid is coming back and then the group will be full.  Bonecrusha wonders why we have replaced Sin.  Someone quips that Bone has trouble counting to twenty-one without taking off his pants.  Once we explain that Sin *IS* the druid it all becomes clear.  For some reason he thought she was a wizzy.  Now we understand why he was freaking that we don't have a cleric.  So Sin comes back, Bone is happy and we are ready to fight something.  Sooo...where do we go.  This is a good question.  We stumble down the stairs to the halls where the mobs are and begin to wander aimlessly.  We decide to follow Utenen because he had been there once.  Utenen doesn't know where he is going.  We run up and down halls like a line of baby ducks following their mother.  We turn corners, we backtrack, we end up on the roof and figure seeing sky is not what we want.  Finally we kind of huddle near another group and a rat attacks us. FINALLY something to kill.  We valiantly kill the rat, but not the friends he brought.  Sin is lost in the fight.  Kat evacs and the group sits in the Graveyard again trying to find  a rez.  Kat helpfully points out that at least we got a rat but no one seems amused.  A nice cleric rezzes her, and after another aimless wander through the halls and an evac we are sitting in the graveyard again.  Stumen says he has to go (Kat figures he's just making his escape while the getting is good.)  Luckily a cleric LFG!  We excitedly pick up the cleric, Gailian and wait for him to lead us to a spot.  Gailian has also never been in the zone.  We begin to ask people if they can show us where to fight.  No response.  Bone has disbanded to do a transfer.  Again we attempt to battle and end up sitting in the graveyard.  Sin makes the discovery of the night: a shammy who knows the zone and who will join us until Bone returns.  Tilin has to log.  We bring up Grunntter and begin to tease the tanks.  Grunntter thinks we are picking on him but we cheerfully apologize and it's off to battle.  His spirits improve when he makes his first planar kill (YAY GRUNT!)  A couple of more rezzes later and we are actually killing things in a very dangerous spot.  We picked up some good exp and a hell of a lot of fun.  After one frenzied battle, an evac and a quick casting cleric who saved Bone's ass, we all emerge unscathed and the wizzy now about in heart failure realizes that it is 4am and time for bed.  <br>
That is the end of my tale.  To all those who's names I've mispelled I apologize.  We had a hell of a time, and we learned some things. *grin*  /CHEER MCMARRIN! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stumen>stumen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/03 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fmcmarrinfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pmlundmark.com/images/eyeball.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mcmarrins lost in the Plains of Justice</span><hr size=1> ah that was a wonderfull tail kat and i wish i could of stayed. but you got a cleric instead of a insane nuke happy gnome.<br>

Especially Kat telling it like everyone was scared and she was da coolest... haha.<br>
Good thing nobody shouted Boo in zone or you would have evaced an extra time =P<br>
Grats Grunt on killing in the planes.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you go to the planes... bring a slower and yes do not forget your cleric on the nightstand again.&quot;<br>
&quot;If all fails blame the Cleric&quot;<br>
&quot;if the cleric refuses to take the blame.. kick him out and blame the slower for not healing in time&quot;<br>
