Just thought I'd post it, hopefully you'll enjoy.<br><br>Background:<br>Deep inside the mountains surrounding what used to be Aberdeen Maryland rests the huge computer complex known as A.R.C.H.I.E.  This mega-complex is capable of producing robots and other forms of artificial life that are so sophisticated, they dwarf all human technology by at least 75 to 100 years.  One such creation of the super-computer was an experimental prototype known as the A-72 GARGOYLE.  This self-sufficient robot was meant to eventually replace the aging A-63 and A-64 designs.  It incorporated an advanced neural posi-tronic matrix processor as well as bio-nano technology (a technology that A.R.C.H.I.E. seldom employs).    The A-72 was capable of adapting its behavioral aspects and basically re-writing its own programming as need be.  In essence, this bot could learn!  The A-72 was designed to counter the ever increasing threat of dimensional beings, aliens, and the advances and advantages of new coalition technology (specifically the SAMA).  With the help of Hagen, this bot was to emulate the  mythological stories of a true gargoyle in that its primary function was to protect A.R.C.H.I.E. from any and all threats.  As a result, the A-72 sports an impressive array of advanced weaponry, targeting, electronic counter measures , survival, and intelligence gathering technology.  However only one was ever produced.  The saga of which is as follows…<br><br>Twas a bright sunny clear New England spring day.  The A-72 was transported to the Mckelvey proving gounds some 400 miles away.  This secluded valley is where the A-72 was to be put to the test.  Accompanied by numerous construct and technical drones as well as 25 A-63’s, 12 A-49’s, an A-64 master robot, robotic support vehicles, and an A-51 reconnaissance drone, it is obvious that Hagen and A.R.C.H.I.E didn’t want anything to happen to their prize creation.  The Master had deployed the A-63’s in a defensive posture and sent the A-49’s on a patrol of the surrounding area.  The A-51 was sent well in advance of the party to investigate a strange electro-magnetic anomaly detected the night before.  Everything seemed to be going as planned; the A-72 was attended to by the technical drones in preparation for a visual tracking display test sequence. Various wires, cords, and sensors linked the A-72 to the drones as 7 high speed hover discs were darting in and out of the forest about 100 meters away posing as  simulated targets.  However, the feed back from the A-72’s multiple tracking and targeting computer indicated 32 highspeed targets moving at various speeds, distances, and altitudes.  A possible error in the algorithmic functions of the A-72’s neural net?  The drones promptly executed a diagnostic program on the A-72’s sensory relays when suddenly out of the brush at the edge of the valley burst the A-51 running and sending information to the A-64 as well as Archie.  The Message: Multiple coalition SAMA’s moving in  from the southwest at multiple altitudes and approximate speed of 520 k.p.h -  priority 1 initiate defense program alpha omega 376115-009.exe.  <br>    <br>“Lone wolf 3, this is tiger 6… positive detect on multiple ground units app. 2 clicks NE of quadrant 27.  Bio-scan is a negative… over” <br>“ Ah… that’s a copy lone wolf.  I’ve got’em on my targeting HUD.  All systems functional, we have clearance from Chi-com. All units engage weapon systems and fall off on my mark. Lock and load baby we have a GO!! Units 2 &amp; 3 swing low and circle, unit 4 fly high and overwatch , the rest of you dumb bastards are with me.  Let’s not screw the pooch on this one!”.<br><br>Sweat formed on the brow of flight commander Scott as he suddenly realized how hot it was getting in his SAMA powered armor with after burners on max.  A sudden eagerness filled Scott in anticipation of combat; that combined with a nervous stomach and a hang-over that made it difficult to force back the bile that was unexpectedly rising in his throat, (Just another day at the office). “NOW!!”,  Barked Scott as units 1 &amp; 5 dove sharply into a squad of humanoid robots scurrying for cover on the ground below.  Cross-hairs magnified and homed in on his first target as he and his comrades unloaded a hail of rail-gun fire into the  surprised metallic creatures.  The ground erupted in a cacophony of dirt, metal, tracers, smoke, and parts of what used to be some kind of robots.  Red lights flickered in protest from the ground below as commander Scott saw his wing man spin out of control; smoke billowing from the face plate of the SAMA sending it to its deadly rendezvous with the ground.  As units 1 &amp; 5 pulled up from their dive, they narrowly missed units 2 &amp; 3 flying mere inches beneath them in the opposite direction rushing to continue the fray from an oblique angle.  As he climbed for another pass he could see Unit 4 hovering near a low cloud bank, their missiles and high explosives lit up the ground like a birthday cake for someone of unimaginable age.  Just then, more felt than heard, energy shots from what must have been some kind of particle cannon slammed into the backs of 3 SAMAS in unit 5 just off to his left.  Their bodies exploding into a red spray mixed with orange fire and black smoke that reminded Scott of a blooming rose seen through time-lapse photography.  He couldn’t help but admire the beauty of the red bursts of color against the pale blue sky.  Then, a feeling of guilt and shame overtook him.  He could hold back the bile and vomit any longer.<br><br>Within a nano-second, hundreds of commands, programs, and sub-programs were initiated by the A-64 master.  Some of the A-63’s were moving fast into cover while even more were running to engage and neutralize the threat.  The master had ordered the A-51 to also engage but it was quickly obvious that Archie had overridden the command as the A-51 disappeared into the forest behind them.  The master now had confirmation, telemetry, and weapons lock on almost half a dozen of the SAMAS… a second later, three confirmed kills.  He knew that most of the A-49’s were already destroyed and in a few moments the rest would be too.  He could see the main attack force of SAMAS preparing for another dive and calculated that they would finish the A-49’s and most of the A-63’s in 2.78 minutes while taking 60% casualties in the process.  He scanned the area and location of the forces he had at hand and determined that he would be terminated in 4.56 minutes. Then at the end of his peripheral scan he detected the A-72 still hooked up to half a dozen drones still running a diagnostic.  A sequence of binary and hexadecimal codes were processed at lightning speed--- roughly the computer equivalent of OH SHIT!!!  Statistically speaking, the A-72 had the capability to stomp a Kentucky mud-hole in anyone or anything’s ass but in order to bring it fully on-line and combat ready would require a cold boot of the main processor.  A calculated 4.73 minutes, too much time.  The A-64 could initiate a full retreat on any functioning bots if 1. He was afraid or had any concept of fear. Or 2. He possessed any kind of retreat programming.  Auditory sensor arrays picked up a group a SAMAS moving in low to the ground.  The A-64 quickly moved to offer whatever defense he could to the dormant A-72.  He then established a remote link to one of the technical drones and interfaced through the drone into the A-72’s sub-processing systems in an attempt to fire the Gargoyle’s weapons by remote.  The A-64’s main processor was met with a barrage of security codes, programs, and anti-theft safeguards that corrupted the A-64’s neural net and instantaneously activated its self-destruct sequence. The A-64 had .023 seconds to realize that it did not possess the static codes necessary for maintenance of such an advanced robot. The last thing to go through the A-64’s main processor was one of its legs…<br>  <br>“Tiger 6 to lone wolf 3 come in” mumbled commander Scott through the com-link, “ how we do’ in?  Lone wolf… come in!” &lt;static&gt;<br>“ Tiger 6… this is wolf 5… the sergeant is dead.  But we have secured the area and are encountering little resistance.”<br>Only 6 out of 25 SAMAS remained, most of them pretty bad off.  <br>“Tiger 6, this is falcon 1.  We’ve located something big, bad, and ugly over hear about half a click from your position.  I think you better come have a look. Over”.<br>“Copy that. I’m on my way. Out”<br><br>There in the clearing of Mckelvey proving grounds stood the A-72, still attached to half a dozen drones going about their business oblivious to their surroundings.  The 6 remaining SAMAS converged on the location in a matter of seconds.<br><br>“ What the hell is that sir”<br>“ I don’t know and I don’t wanna know.  If it moves though… kill it.”<br>The diagnostic program continued.  The appendage motor &amp; actuator test cycle began…<br>“ Fuck me runnin’. It’s moving!!!!”<br>“FIRE!!!”<br>“What ever it was, it ain’t no more.  Everyone get your shit together.  We’re leaving this God forsaken shit hole of a valley in 2 minutes.  Set your nav computers back to our original target zone.  We’ll sweep the area of the anomaly and return to base.  It’ll give me some time to figure out how to tell chi-com that I lost 19 SAMAS under my command and don’t have a goddamn thing to show for it.  Everybody remember… there were hundreds of ‘em.  You all got that!”<br><br> <p>Kwein Treewalker <BR>Druid of the 43rd Season <BR>Husband of Jesperia <BR>Member of the HOOD! <BR><BR>Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=250.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=250.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.threadControl?topicID=250.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=250.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=250.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub34.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm1">Welcome<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm22">Policies and Procedures<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm6">General Discussions<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm4">Epic and Quests<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm5">Equipment/Wish List<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm18">Role Playing Stories of your travels and Lives in Norrath<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm21">Daily Hunting Plans<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm11">Norrathian Brotherhood (Members only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm3">Events (Planned Happenings)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm15">The HOOD Bank<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm7">Recruitment (Officers Only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm8">Inner Council (Officers Only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm12">History (Closed Threads)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm23">Applicants<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm24">Alliances<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm25">Roll Call<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm26">Guild News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#0066ff>- </font><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bnorrathianbrotherhood>Norrathian Brotherhood</a><font color=#0066ff> - </font><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18>Role Playing Stories of your travels and Lives in Norrath</a><font color=#0066ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
