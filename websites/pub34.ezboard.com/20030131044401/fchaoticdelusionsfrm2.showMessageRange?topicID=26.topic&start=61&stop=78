I believe the right thing has been done. It doesnt beifit the guild but atleast its out of the way. Yes i believe Iizzard destroyed it because that is what he told me and i must trust in my friends and guild / familiy. I think Everyone has learned from this and nothing more can be gotten from it. I do believe that all the officers have endured there share of heartache over this. They may not have publicly stated otherwise but they will damn sure know better next time. And for next time, We will Further examine an item to its fullest Detail and Certain Use or uses to the Guild or said person.<br>
<br>
 For further Refrence this is what &quot;I Think&quot; should happen. Im sure there are lots that will Disagree but so be it.<br>
<br>
1. If an item drops and its a toy that will not benfit anyone and they know it. Do not roll on it. Give it to Funds that way we all Benifit. Iizzard wont have to pull out of his pocket for coffins or for getting sac stones and Az and Tok wont have to worry about Dots. Even if you get put into a random against your will you can say no i wont use it or if you win something you had no idea about you Can say no here guild fund person , get what you can for it. So please do so. Im not trying to knock anyone here. im just saying i think this is the way it should be done.<br>
<br>
2. If you obtain an item via a raid i think it is your item ,BUT if you refill this spot by something you got from a raid i think it should be given to someone else in the guild that could benifit them. That way we upgrade 2 people at once. Im not talking about guild groups (thats the persons on judgement what to do) or anything else. Im talking about guild raid gotten items. This does not mean the guild is letting you BORROW (i know i heard this once) an item. Its just the guild giveing YOU a chance to do the right thing and help your guild. As a guild / familiy we SHOULD want to better ourselves and the other members both thru equipment and friendship. We can make each othger better people or we can all screw each other. i know orgies sound fun but i dont wanna get my tooshi poked.<br>
<br>
3. If you so happen to take off an item that you Bought yourself and got replaced by something the guild got for you. OF COURSE this is your item that you bought and you should do with as you like (before anyone brings that up). Again im only talking about Guild Raid items.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
P.S. As for officers making all the decisions that is just well and fine, but i think somethings can be helped out from the members .

He should know how to deal with &quot;Uber Items&quot; as they must deal with them on a Frequent Basis. I too believe that he probably see's our guild as i see it. We are very up and coming Guild that HAS or if this continues HAD lots of potiential. <br>
<br>
He Suggested a point based attendance loot system. I mentioned this once and got an overwhelming No so i want press that issue. Im sure that works better for some people and for guilds that are completely hardcore. That is fine. But all officers should study zones and drops before we raid an area and predetermine who should and should not roll on a particular item and if its just a guild fund item. You as officers should do your homework on a zone for us silly little folk so we wont be tempted. In the same way i try to Dl maps and study monster patterns before i try and pull a zone. This way we all know what to expact and wont be suprised. A prepared Guild is a Better Guild.<br>
<br>
I also got an idea for GUILD FUND items. Whats wrong with having our own Internal auctions for these items where say a toy can be bought for a far smaller amount than he would find on the street. and the money would go to funds? this may just work but i can see someone buying somehting for 50 percent off and selling it for full price on the street. So maybe thats a bad idea unless we decide that the only way the person can get rid of it is to sell it back to the guild or sold for street price and the person is returned what they paid and deposit the rest into the guild funds. That way you all have a chance to buy some crappy status item for cheap and it helps the guild in the process.<br>
<br>

<br>
The first point, all rolls are NBG goes without saying.  This is where this entire mess has come from.  People rolled without having need, and are blaming me for it.<br>
<br>
The second point.  We decided for the time it is best to leave it on an individual basis whether or not they put the previously won item back into the guild circulation.  We wanted to avoid being able to call anyones particular equipment 'the guilds.'  We also decided as officers to condone the passing on of old equipment, but not require it.<br>
<br>
The third point is also exactly how we agreed upon.  If an item was obtained by a member themselves, there is no question that they can do whatever they wish with the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fumanjoo, your points are very valid.  They are already the guidelines we set in place, so all I can say is...you apparently agree with how we set it up.<br>
<br>
The officers also stated that a point system was not something we wanted in our guild.  We decided instead to implement the 55+ rule, and the 2 raids per month rule.  Based on the discussion I recall during the officer meeting it is doubtful any form of 'point system' would be passed.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to give you some further insight into what went on when we formed the rules we did.  Everything you are stating is how this was supposed to work, if I've understood you correctly.<br>

I'm going to try my best to explain why Enan and Az were removed. First off, it was a mutual decision among a majority of the officers. I wish this had never happened cause I lost 2 of my best ig friends over stupid @#%$ @#%$ loot. But in the end it was merely the straw that broke the camels back. Iizzard wasn't going to actually sell the amulet, they were pricechecking it from what I was told, which might be shitty but not grounds for all this by any means. <br>
<br>
Enantiomer was removed because he repeatedly misused his power as an officer. Beneg being the first case, no other officers were contacted before he removed ben, and there were officers on at the time. Secondly he moved this topic from the officers board to public guild forum before we had time to resolve the mater. The screenshots and dates made me think he planed this to cause discord in the guild, there were numerous times when we could have recalled the amulet for reroll or another solution to everyones satisfaction but instead he seemed to just throw more fuel on the fire. At no point in all his post did I ever actually see him attempt to resolve the issue, just stir up more trouble and place more blame.  I agree with him in that more care should have been taken when rolling the item, but he chose to roll it. He did the best he could which is all any of us would have done and I place no blame on him for how the loot was distributed. When I roll an item im just doing the best I know how with the information I have. The amulet is not the issue in my mind, but how the entire mater was handled. Az was removed after she said she was leaving but continued pressing the mater in guild chat stirring up more strife.<br>
<br>
This is not a flame against enan at all, a week ago I called him one of my best friends and I have nothing against him personally, but the situation, and the end decision needs to be explained. <br>
<br>
In the end it is the officers who decide everything. We decided loot rules, invite rules, we plan raids, we make decisions that effect everyone, and the right decision is not always as clear as we would like it to be, but we do our best to make decisions as fairly as we can to all involved. We always have the guild as a whole to worry about before any one person. Were not perfect, I don't claim to be. but as members you put your fate in our hands as it were. And ultimately we have to make the end decision and its not always to everyones liking, but were only human and we have your best interest in mind. If thats not enough for you perhaps you should seek a guild with a better way of doing things.  /shrug  We are always open to suggestions tho if anyone sees a better way of doing things don't hesitate to speak up, this is OUR guild and we can make it what we want it.<br>

The reason I'm leaving is because I have no confidence in the Officers as they stand.  I would suggest you all read through this thoroughly and carefully consider what staying in the guild will likely mean.<br>
<br>
NOTHING HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  Redawen simply decided to be god and thus made this decision.  Maybe Tokum voted, maybe not, but Redawen and Truely together are the only &quot;functional&quot; officers that &quot;voted&quot; on this course of action.<br>
<br>
Redawen never tried to work it out.  Read through all of the posts.  It is clear.  For some reason they have it out for Enantiomer.  I assume it's because they like Beneg more than Enantiomer.  I don't really care.<br>
<br>
I wish Redawen would have stayed in Magister when he up and jacked everyone and left.  If you stay in this guild there may be hope in the form of Danix (and I feel like there is still some glimmer in Truely when she isn't cow-towing to Reda).<br>
<br>
Redawen, you really usurped this guild from Enantiomer.  That is really, really lame.<br>
<br>
I am surprised you acted like you were Tokum IG for a while, but I'm glad you finally came out with it.  I'm sorry you can't get over yourself about the Enantiomer/Beneg situation.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have nothing against Beneg.  I really have nothing against you Redawen, I just think you are making a very bad choice.  And that's what it comes down to.<br>
<br>
I will leave these forums up for the indefinite future at this point I suppose.  I make no guarantee though.<br>
<br>
Maybe a spinoff guild will form out of this and it will be a fair guild in which officers don't buddy up to oust someone that they decide they hate or no longer consider their friend.  Realize that the reason you have a problem with Enantiomer is nothing more than the fact that you don't agree with him.<br>
<br>
You are always complaining about Enantiomer &quot;abusing power&quot; when in fact, YOU Redawen are committing the ultimate abuse.<br>
<br>
Say what you want about an officer vote.  All the cards are in your pocket so your &quot;vote&quot; is meaningless.  Your majority is bogus.<br>
<br>
That having been said, I really hope that I can group with you all sometimes and that you're more talk than action when it comes to the &quot;end of friendships&quot;.<br>
<br>
All of my efforts have been to try to find a way to work this out.  I honestly believed that Tokum was of the same belief from his last post.  If Redawen is telling the truth about the vote, Tokum, I guess you finally caved.  Its too bad.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your Alabama guild.<br>

I dont have all of the cards, but i will admit to having most of them, but its not by design its just how it worked out. We will add more officers (Fumanjoo and Beneg if they will accept) so the balence of power is more even. I havent ever used my power in a harmfull maner nor have i ever pulled rank using my officer status as levrage in a dispute, but in this case it had to be done. I have nothing but love for tok but hes not gona do it, and iizzard would but hes too deeply involved in the situation to do it so there was noone else.

Umm, you kicked us out.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Iizzard wasn't going to actually sell the amulet, they were pricechecking it from what I was told<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did you miss the point where he announced the amulet as sold prior to me starting any of this?  25 minutes before actually.  You've done nothing but avoid the simple facts, but lets admit...I kind of saw that this would happen.<br>
<br>
I did succeed in part, and I'm grateful.  Iizzard, if he truly did junk the item, no longer has it and that was my goal.  He didn't deserve it any more than anyone else in the guild on that raid.<br>
<br>
I posted in the beginning that bringing this into the open would probably mean I would be removed in the end.  I am not surprised.  Anyway, good luck with the guild.  <br>
<br>
I did post the links under rants/flames, I would sure hate for anyone to join this guild without knowing how it is ran.<br>

Iizzard takes joy in the harm done to the guild.  Iizzard gets Uber_Loot_01, sells it and makes all the profit.<br>
<br>
Iizzard reveals himself as a scammer.<br>
<br>
And the officers have covered it up for him (and may not even know it [at least i hope not])... You are quite the piece of work Iizz... <p>Thrasymachus Dawnwalker<hr>
