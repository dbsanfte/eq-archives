<br>
If you think you should be able to do something wrong and get away with it well you are totally crazy.  Enan said on the officers page that your response to what you were going to do with the amulet was unacceptable, you decided to respond with a big finger and say that you are gonna do what ever the hell you want with it.<br>
<br>
Well you know what Iizzard you are accountable to the guild for your actions.  You think that you are not and that is the whole problem.  <br>
<br>
Just as a side note I didn't intend to post anything when I saw Enantiomer's original thread in the general section.  It was only after the officers posted and I saw that they were obviously trying to cover your ass that I felt it was necessary.<br>

This is the EXACT time Iizzard originally posted on Emarr that the item was SOLD to Burning for 101k.<br>

This is the EXACT time, also on Ezboards, that I posted I was making a webpage with a link from General showing Iizzard's intention.<br>
<br>
This CLEARLY and with no possible way of proving wrong shows that Iizzard had stated the item was SOLD, 10 minutes BEFORE I made any posts revealing his scam.<br>
<br>
I'm interest now in how you will justify your remarks on this.<br>
Feel free to visit the Emarr Boards Item Bazaar and my post earlier in this thread to confirm the times.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Just wanted to point out that since declaring the item was sold and I brought all this out, he has edited his post so it now says it is no longer being sold.  He admits this on the Item Bazaar boards if you read down. <p>Enantiomer <br>

I spent this morning reading thru all the insanity, now Im going to post my opinion and defend myself since Enan decided to say things about me that are untrue.  <br>
<br>
First of all... It's a game, therefore none of this is as important as RL friendships or RL issues.<br>
<br>
Secondly...  Although some regular members may feel they need to have a say on all issues and that everyone should hear what is going on in guild politics, we shouldn't.  There's a reason that we have officers, if you don't trust your officers to decide what's best for the guild and to take care of the problems that arise then you need to find another guild with different officers.  Not every officer is perfect, they are just people.  None of you know why they didn't post on the officers page continually updating how they felt on this issue and what the plan was for handling it.  Some of this was being taken care of in RL (between Tokum and Iizzard) and some of it in the game (between Redawen, Tokum and Iizzard).  Perhaps Enan wasn't filled in on every single detail that was said about this in the few days after the raid but he was out of line to decide that he would &quot;save the guild from it's officers&quot; and fill everyone else in the world in on the halfass story he had so far and he was kind enough to fill in the HUGE blank spaces with his own words.  Thank you but I don't remember you being elected guild leader Enan, if you can't respect that officers are allowed time and PRIVACY to decide guild decisions then find another guild to be paranoid in.  Members, please remember when you choose to join a guild you are CHOOSING to trust the officers of that guild to decide the big sticky decisions for you.  If it was left up to the whole guild every time then this chaos would be the norm in every guild.<br>
<br>
Final point for my general opinion...  It's a piece of loot, not even something that uber or amazing.  What we went to fear for and what we did in fear is by far more important then a toy we got along the way.  It is a toy afterall, a novelty, an illusion... as an enchanter I get to play with this type of novelty all the time, if you were really sad cause you don't have one to play with then start an enchanter and go crazy (illusions don't even take much mana).  If you were upset because someone could have made money off an item and you might not have gotten a cut, then you should feel ashamed because that's called greed.  Other then the people who joined right before this raid, All of you have played with CD long enough to know that there is a general will to help others and that for the most part everyone trusts everyone else.  It's sad how quickly people can lose faith in each other as soon as someone points a finger at someone else.  Do me and yourselves a favor and realize this isn't a matter of people trying to screw others over but it's someone using everything in thier power to make sure that that paranoid delusion is spoon fed to everyone until we are all so disheartened by this that we don't trust our own officers and eventually lose interest in being a guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright, and this is just for Enantiomer because even though I'm normally a very nice woman I've had all I can take of you and your rightious temper tantrums.  I would not feel the need to defend myself or in any way attack you if you had not said certain things that I feel asked for a response from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enan - &quot;The guild members seem pretty happy to know the kind of @#%$ you guys are letting go on. &quot;<br>
<br>
if you could read all the posts without seeing everyone as trying to get you, you'd see that most of us are sad that this has gotten so blown up and would rather get back to playing and having fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enan - &quot;All I've done is post Iizzard's remarks and tells. It becomes a flame because he is blaming me for what happened. You guys know dam well I was't randoming it to 2 people to sell. I've never done an unfair thing in my life, and the fact that none of you IIZZARD AND DAYDREM, spoke up and said hey I won't really be using this shows that you redawen are as big of a loot whore as Iizzard.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Pardon me Enan, redawen and I are not the same person and he allows me to talk and loot for myself.  I did say in officers channel that I didn't need but I guess you weren't paying attention.  Maybe this is hard for you to understand since I'm thinking you might live in a world where if you don't have control of someone then they are your enemy.  And yes, you have done unfair things before, you kicked Beneg without valid reason or talking to the other officer (that was online just afk).  I was there when you kicked Beneg and he WAS talking to me when he asked if *I* would come to COM for jade reavers later that week.  YOU blew up first and caused that fight, hell even aziline was saying to me while it was happening, when Enan gets to a certain point there's no stopping him from blowing up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enan - &quot;Everyone knows that guild raids are NBG, if you roll on something you don't need you are a loot whore. Stop trying to blame your loot whoring ways on me because I tried to make sure an item with INT went to INT casters.&quot;<br>
<br>
You have played this game long enough to know that just because something says INT or WIS or another stat on it doesn't mean that it automatically gets rolled to those classes.  I think you also knew what the necklace did and that it's mostly a novelty item, yet you didn't take the time before you rolled a droppable item to make sure who would use it or not.  I'm not really even sure why YOU were rolling it... usually it's reda who does or tokum.  Maybe rolling an item is just a little too hard for you or too much responiblity for you to handle.  Really doesn't take a genius to notice that you don't usually NBG a toy but since you stated &quot;INT casters only please&quot; in officers channel and the officers just decided to let you have your way even tho I know reda and tokem both would have wanted to roll on it cause it's a fun toy to play with.  can't you see how maybe your rushed rolling of this item was the initial cause of this whole problem?<br>
<br>
Enan - &quot;When I shout send tells if you need 13int -100hp effect: illusion neck piece I expect tells from those who need. This was not the case. I received a tell from Daydrem and from Iizzard. Apparently neither were really going to use this item.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
This is you putting your foot in your mouth enan.  Does anyone else remember enan shouting to send tells?  no? oh that might be because he didn't, everyone there KNEW there were only 3 int casters there and he never got a tell from me because it was all done in the officers channel.  Could this be Enan saying untrue things to make his side of the story look more believeable?  Could he have said other untrue things like this?  lol, wow was that a bad thing to type on your part enan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enan - &quot;Tokum sent me a tell after the random saying I should have randomed it to everyone. I immediately asked on officer chat if Iizzard was in fact going to use it. He stated (oh god do I wish I had logs of all of this) that his intent was to use it and see if it worked out for him. I said if he decided not to use it then he should give it back to the guild for guild funds or give to Daydrem because she also said she needed it.&quot; <br>
<br>
I wish you had a log of it too Enan, because this is another time where what your saying happened didn't happen at all.  You never said he should give it back to the guild for guildfunds or give it to me if he didn't use it... maybe partly because I never said I needed it?  Please stop saying I said things when I never did, and certainly not if your going to make me into a liar to support your side of this @#%$.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enan - Stop making up lies that both said they wouldn't use it. Get real here, I limited to int caster to random on base of need. If I was indeed trying to scam this I would have made sure that either I or some of my RL friends were in the random. <br>
<br>
Honestly I don't think you were trying to scam anyone... I think either you were just stupid enough to not know that it was a toy that didn't need to be NBG rolled or you were just rushing through it because you had decided what was the right way to do it and god knows if Enan decides something is right then it's a real pain in the ass to try to tell him otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm done... I wasn't going to post but you irked me enuff to Enan.  Sorry if I offended anyone else and anything said after my 3 much calmer points above is really only out of my anger over Enan stepping over his rights and saying I said or didn't say things when it's not true.<br>
<br>
Anyway, see you all in game.. I'm so done with this batch of bullshit.  =p<br>

Daydrem the issue did not go straight to the General section,myself, Bik and Fuman did nothing in hopes that this would be resolved and nothing bad would come from it.  Dont give them that 'we dont know the reason Officers didnt post' crap because that is what it is plain and simple. The officers knew that they at least had 3 guild members (excluding Enantiomer) worried about the situation.  IF that doesnt warrent a minute of the officers time i dont know what does.   <br>
<br>
Now that it is here i sure as hell am not going to let you slander Enantiomer with all the @#%$ you are throwing up in the air to keep the guild members from seeing what really happened.<br>
<br>
Lastly you are all wrong and look retarded,  Iizzard was going to sell the item, we proved that beyond doubt and all you do is throw up more @#%$ hoping to hide it again.  Anyone that believes he isnt (didnt already) sell it is as retarded as myself and enantiomer in the beginning. <br>
<br>
GUILD MEMBERS YOU ARE BEING SCREWED BY OUR OFFICERS.  THEY DONT EVEN CARE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS.  I'm thinkin im not the only one that feels this way but everyone is afraid of the conquenses if they post,  IE. cant get in on the &quot;insider trading that occures in the guild.&quot;  You all dont scare me, this is total crap and you know it.  You should just grow up and admit that you were wrong about Iizzard.  I hold each one of the officers responsible (but enantiomer of course) personally  for what happened.<br>

<br>
As much as I try to just get people to stick to the facts, they detour off on how it is my fault because I did the random.<br>
<br>
Daydrem, you say that Redawen and Tokum would have liked this item, well why didn't they say something?  They are officers and as such hold just as much responsibility to make sure it is done correctly as I do.<br>
<br>
Holding me responsible for holding a random of an INT item to only INT casters proves nothing.  Let me go ahead and repeat this again, it proves nothing.  To think I can make randoms however I want is idiotic, the lack of the other officers to speak up at the time is their own fault.<br>
<br>
Your arguments are pety and not even within the bounds of where I keep trying to keep this discussion.  I have shown factual evidence of what Iizzard did, if you took a moment to read the first several posts of this thread...you would find that my suggestion was to rerandom to those present at the Fear raid.  Since you are obviously too lazy to do any sort of research I suppose I can do it for you.  Here goes...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Stop doin way stupid things, nothing good can come from that thing being sold, period. If you don't want it we can rerandom it to people there who aren't gonna sell it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was my suggestion as to what to do with it...Want to hear Iizzard's response that you refuse to believe?  Here it is<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> first off did i make the call as to who should b in the random? @#%$ no u did ,so u wanta talk bout something being BS then ask your self.....2ed NBG?

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> im over being a nice guy and doing the right thing and getn @#%$ in my ass for it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Tired of doing the right thing?  Good god if you are so blind as to ignore all the facts I've presented there is nothing else I can do.<br>
<br>
Daydrem you have joined in the flame war, I keep asking this to be kept to the facts.  Thus far nobody has disputed them, or even tried.  So do me a favor and be quiet until you bring something new to this thread.  We've been listening to the blame game since the beginning.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that Iizzard posted he sold the item before I did any of this.  Funny enough, a guild member pointed out to me his post saying it was sold was made prior to me posting any information.<br>
<br>
So, once again, stop throwing old crap up in the air.  Refute the given facts or be quiet.  <br>
<br>
I will state now, that I will no longer respond to any more posts that have no grammar, are typed in d00d talk, or contain the blame game crap.  Refute the facts or admit them, but stop trying to cloud this with negative rhetoric about me.  I'm still avoiding a straight out flame war here, despite the heavy flaming I'm getting.  If you want to flame, lets go to Emarr, I'll give out the facts and we can go at it.<br>

At that time i mentioned to you that it shoulda been done to all on the raid, i @#%$ up ill take the blame for iizzard getting it at the raid if thatll back every1 off. ill also take the blame for just assuming that even tho the necklace was something i always kinda wanted in the game i knew we'd see more and id make sure it didnt happen like that again, however at the time i wasnt gonna make iizz give it back &lt;maybe i was wrong in not doin so&gt; <br>
       Enan i hear what ur saying ill even go as far to say i believe iizzard said the things you posted. However, ive know iizzard since i was in the 9th grade, when he told me he would give it to me next time he saw me just he didnt have to deal with it, ur damn right i didnt ask another question or post another thing on the board, i felt i had handled it, im sick of getting told i dont do @#%$ and being made to feel worthless. This was a role i never asked for, cause i knew it would make me loose friends, i just wanna play a @#%$ game and have fun guys. Enan u have stated more then once that all the officers are a bunch of loot whoring asses. i want ur honest answer bro ive known u along time and uve been one of the coolest people i ever chilled with &lt;and he only started this post outta general concern for ppl he loved&gt; but bro uve known me for a long time, am i a loot whore too? u know better then that bro cause i dont give a @#%$ about this game<br>
<br>
i play for u Enan, all of u. i dont give a @#%$ iff iizz sells the amulet ruins his rep shits on a car or fucks a dog<br>
<br>
and i think for that same reason &lt;me not caring aslong as i have the friends&gt; i wont be the leader of CD anymore, im not leaving im not goin anywhere but lets be honest this was never my role ina guild and i feel i let u ALL down.<br>

Tokum, you really are one of the coolest people I think I've ever met.<br>
<br>
However, I have to say, I am shocked that Redawen and Iizzard are justifying what happened by accusing Enantiomer of messing up a random somehow.<br>
<br>
Not only that, you appear to acknowledge that you knew at the time that there was a problem with the random.  But it appears to me that because you would potentially benefit from it you said nothing.  That doesn't sound like Enantiomer's fault to me.<br>
<br>
I mean what sort of logic is that?  If you can con someone into something that makes it ok?!?<br>
<br>
Whether or not Enantiomer knew the value of the item, it appears that you did.  You kept it from him!  Talk about not being able to trust your fellow officers... sheesh.<br>
<br>
I think its lame that you are blaming Enantiomer, ESPECIALLY if you knew before hand.  ALL of the officers should accept responsibility for the screw up on the roll.  <br>
<br>
ALL of the officers should just say somthing like, &quot;look, the rule is simple and we messed it up.  Some items are NBG and some aren't.  NBG items are not to be sold because they are NBG.  Whoops.  We promise this won't happen again, all of us together as officers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because the officers don't seem to be willing to do that, I really don't see that Enantiomer had any choice but to do what he did.  <br>

<br>
You just tried once again to lay the blame on someone else for what you did.  It doesn't matter how you phrase it.<br>
<br>
And furthermore, this: &quot;someone just offered me 100k for this&quot; does NOT mean &quot;I plan to sell this item if I receive it in a random&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please, people, use some rational thought.<br>
<br>
And I feel I have to once again make this clear, Iizzard, I have always liked you and still do.  I feel like I'm dreaming when I actually get to play and have Tokum, Redawen, Iizzard, Truely, Wdar, Daydrem (btw congrats didn't know you were expecting), Enantiomer, Aziline, and all the rest of you there on a raid killing Uber_Monster_01.  <br>
<br>
I think you jacked Enantiomer on the whole non-support issue before, but I thought you guys had gotten over it.  Is this all really just about that?  I'm sorry dude, but Enantiomer would have supported you tossing ME out if I had canned on you like that...<br>
<br>
Honestly, why would I invest so much time in a stupid game if it wasn't fun and I didn't like the people I played with... <p>Thrasymachus Dawnwalker<hr>
