For one thing, I didn't call Wolfy a narcotic.  That would make no sence, why would i call her a drug?  I did on the other hand try to tell wolflight to quit bitching about Flonk and quit ragging on Timmla.<br>
<br>
Its a crappy time in Norrath when I have to see this...<br>
<br>
Timmla: Hi all, whats everyone up to?<br>
Flonk: Hey<br>
Aldamar: Hi, babe<br>
Barnebus: howdy<br>
Wolflight: (growl)<br>
<br>
And this isn't even the first time this immature character left our ranks, about a month ago she left for a short time after exploding at her clan mate Leinenkugel who was only trying to help her level.<br>
<br>
Running out of time here, but just one last insult in my defence.  I would rather have a no good beggar in the clan like Wordaorf than a stuck up little girl who can't let go of her anger towards her guildmates.<br>

<br>
Just wanted to put my 2 sense in(though most the time it gets me in trouble but hey who cares)...Wolflight i have considered you a good friend and have always been willin to help when i can but even i see that you are takin this Flonk and Timmla deal beyond words...i hope my standin up for Barnebus and anyone else who has told ya to chill out or calm down doesnt turn us into enemies..if it does then you are not the person i have grown to like and sometimes admire..but even i know you have gone to far..if you wont listen to your so called &quot;friends&quot; then there is nothin we can do but wait and see how things turn out..its a fact of life: you date someone and if they dont turn out to be the one you want then you dump them(for lack of a nicer term..my mind is very tired now) and get someone else no point in dwellin on it or even takin it to guild chat..where we shouldnt have to hear bout it to the extent you have taken it..its between you and the other person or person(i like this command if things dont turn out how you want or dont wanna hear it../ignore...or this /guildchatoff its that simple....<br>
<br>
well i have said my 2 sense though lookin back it it doesnt sound to um coherent for lack of a better term lol<br>
<br>
wish you luck in whatever ventures you decide to take(pls dont start sendin us bomb threats through tells..wouldnt want anyone to take it the wrong way(dont even ask have no clue where that came from lol)<br>
<br>
later all and be safe<br>

Many of us have said this before but you don't seem to listen...must be selective hearing. &lt;laugh&gt; You always have friends in the clan.

Not because we had so much fun in the guild or I'm gonna miss your bakery stuff.<br>
Just because I don't like to see some people in the same family not getting along.<br>
I do however want to give you some advice for you in your new family.<br>
Even roleplaying you do not like someone can be taken the wrong way if it's shown too much. If you do however hold a RL grudge against someone, don't show it, but ignore the person(s) involved.<br>
If Dahliah says she doesn't lie anyone, she tells the person involved that it's not true.<br>
If she ignores you, she doesn't like you. But gets on with it.<br>
<br>
As for your tirade towards Barnebus, I feel that I must say something in his defense. We all know Barnebus as a person who does most in the guilds interest, we all trust his judgement and I cannot argue with his views about (t)his guild.<br>
If you don't get along with one of the almost founders of this family you're probably better of with another guild.<br>
<br>
I do wish you all the best in your adventures roaming the world.<br>
<br>
And as a final hateful remark. Dahliah loves her newfound sister Timmla better.<br>

<br>
I havnt been to the website for a while.....<br>
<br>
I feel I was allways your friend even when you left me and I feel that I was never intentionally bad to you even when I had to leave you. You were a good friend Wolfie and I hope we can still chat in the future. As I see the reactions to your post I guess you leaving was a good decission and I bet you will find a group of people who will apreciate you more.<br>
You may have been a bit agressive in guildchat but you told everyone you were sorry in your other post, that was very good of you and I think that shows character. I guess we all have to learn sometime what to say in guildchat and what not to say.... I get confused about that sometimes too..hehe  <br>
Just also wanted to say I am sorry that I had to break up with you and that the timing must have been very bad for you to explode so badly Wolflight..... I guess Halflings are not known for their great timing. And they are not known for their great controll over their emotions either. I will miss you in guildchat for if anything you allways added color to the chat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Some people may not have liked the color...... but you did give it color.... hehe.<br>
<br>
Be good Wolffie !<br>
I will check up on you from time to time and I am sure you will be doing great when I do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
(remember that EQ and RL are two completely different things and you will be fine )<br>
Good Travels and Good Luck.<br>
