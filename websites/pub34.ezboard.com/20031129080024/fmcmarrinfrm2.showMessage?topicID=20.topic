I was born the son of a warrior of no great stature (to this day I have yet to hear bards sing about him).  The guild masters at the Pit of Doom never proclaimed him above the 30th season, and it is why I choose this time to tell you all about him and me.<br>
<br>
        My father's name was William Bloodletter.  When he wed Megan McManis, a son followed.  My mother was a very kind woman, and it was hard on her when my father was out on the paths that his sword took him.  I was, at that time, too young to understand the dangers that awaited a warrior on the path of good, so I just saw it as a happy time 'cause when my father came home he always bore gifts.<br>
<br>
        When he returned from one of his last adventures he brought back one of the greatest gifts I have ever been given, though I didn't know it at the time.  It was about 6 years before I would realize the value of his gift.<br>
<br>
        This time he brought home a young half elven girl.  He told me that he found her abandoned in the hills north of the human town of Qeynos.  Her name was Glorfindel.  My mother took young Glorfindel in and raised her well.  Me and Glorfindel (Glory for short) got along well, and when my father died at the hands of an Ice Giant that was roaming the frozen plains of Everfrost, we mourned his loss together.<br>
<br>
        In the coming years as I reach adulthood, I had made the choice not to leave my family to seek adventure. I had decided to be a fisherman. And when I came of age I decided to wed Glorfindel.  For the past year we had lived together, taking care of my sick mother, and that is When the bond we had been building for so long had been set.  My only regret is that I didn't realize this love sooner so my mother could have been around to see the wedding.<br>
<br>
        We, that is Glory and I, had a wonderful life together, my skill in fishing kept improving and she bore me a son, Noedo.  It was around this time that a man came into town from Qeynos.  He was seeking fish scales in great quantities, and I was fast becoming the best fisherman in Halas. He left me with an order for 100 fish scales and 60 fresh fish, and a back pack to put them in.<br>
<br>
        Having vowed never to leave my family behind while I adventure I grabbed my pack filled with fish, and my family and went strait to the shamen guild house in Halas. There I had a spell put on me and my family that would make is invisible to the creatures wondering Everfrost and set out.<br>
<br>
        We made it to the entrance to BlackBurrow, home of the most vile of beings in Norath, Gnolls.  Crossing into BlackBurrow the invisibility wore off and we were left to our own devices.  Fearing the return trip more than the shorter trip through BlackBurrow we pressed on. A choice that will haunt me through out all my days.<br>
<br>
       Making our way through BlackBurrow was looking easy, some adventurer's had killed all the Gnolls on the above ground level.  As we we making it to the border of the hateful home of these fowl creatures, I heard someone shout the one word that still haunts my nightmares at night to this day.<br>
<br>
      &quot;TRAIN&quot;<br>
<br>
      Before we could cross the boundary of there land we were overtaken buy Gnolls of a power I had only heard about in my fathers stories.  Elite Gnoll guards, and a strange looking variety call a Split Paw.  They killed my wife and my son in one quick motion and I was saved only by the casting of a spell by a cleric who saw our struggle. He was only seconds to late to save my wife and child, but he left me with hope he said to drag there bodies to a safe spot and wait for his return with a cleric of a higher order, who could then revive my family from deaths door.<br>
<br>
      Hiding in a cave behind an old hollowed out tree I waited. And waited. And waited till finally the cleric returned. he told me that no one could be found to bring them back and that now it was too late, to much time has past and death had them for good.<br>
<br>
      I spent the next few hours, maybe days, I'm not sure at this point, crying out to The Tribunal. Begging for them to give me back my Glory and Noedo or take me to join them in the afterlife. Neither request was granted.<br>
<br>
      The Cleric helped me carry the bodies of Glory and Noedo back to Halas for there proper funeral.  Before I could thank him though he turned and left.  I do not remember the name of the Cleric, but his deed is without a doubt the reason I am alive today instead of dead with my family in BlackBurrow.  Though at the time I wished I was.<br>
<br>
      At the funeral of my family I saw an old friend of my fathers. He had approached me shortly after my fathers death with a suggestion that I take up arms. At the time I politely turned him down. Now I was ready to listen, but he didn't tell me anything, never spoke a single word to me in fact. Obviously knowing my heart at the time all he did was hand me a tattered note with instructions to take it to the Pit Of Doom.<br>
<br>
Coming soon....How I came to be a McMarrin and the adventures that followed.<br>
