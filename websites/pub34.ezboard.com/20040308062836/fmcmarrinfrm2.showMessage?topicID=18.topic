He had a son, his sons name was Xalite Highshot. So as we go along with the story they were walking through the gates of Queynos. A woman screamed. It was Nerrissa Clothspinner. She screamed and yelled for help and as they looked around the guards were hanging from the towers with a rope. They asked what happened and she said &quot;can you help me, I have been in fear for along time that since our guards and military units have moved out to protect the plains of Karana from tragedies like this.&quot; Xealot said &quot;well what have you been in fear of?&quot; Nerrisa then said &quot;the shadow knights of the dark elves. When I was making a trade I was in a bar that allowed everyone in but was highly secure. I overheard the shadow knights talking about a raid that would happen very soon. I told Antious Bayle about this but he did not beleive me and he told me that there is nothing to fear because our guards are very strong, but I have seen them all day they just sit in the towers making jokes and drinking beer. Now they are here and I do not know waht to do! Please help me and all the people of Queynos.&quot; Xealot and Xalite set forth gather ing all their weapons and strength. They walked through the gate. Xealot asked &quot;why are they after us they have been after the halflings but why us.&quot; Xalite replied &quot;well how am I supposed to know they are evil they dont care who they go after.&quot; They walked and walked scared but strong there was blood everywhere and they constantly heard screams echoing through the cities gates. All of a sudden they heard a scream near bye. It was a scram of death and then they heard another one then another they were not screams they were shouts of the guards telling their men to fall back. Now they could see explosions from magic necro magic it wasnt only the shadow knights they were dealing with it was necromancers. Xealot and Xalite ran to the scene they saw nothing. A driip of blood dropped from the sky they looked up it was more guards hanging from towers. They ran seeing trails of blood like a line of blood coming from the tip of a sharp sword and found bodies of the Dark Elves lying on the floor with a stunned face. They were still alive. They said &quot;we shall defeat you humans for helping defend the Halflings.&quot; They ran, still following the trail of blood. They saw the Dark Elves and they saw them too. The Dark Elves had  an evil smile on their faces. The Dark Elves ran towards them but the necros staying in the back medding. Xealot drew out his trusty Clayore called the Valorc. With one slash form the sword it sliced traight through all of them at once. Xalite then said &quot;Now to deal with the Necros!&quot; Teh necros casted their spells but they were no use. They wondered why they were not affected. They looked behind them it  was a Magician their familiy friend Alarost he cast a spell at the same time as the necros that put a counter-attack on them. So the Necros were killed by their own magic. The City of Queynos was saved thanks to the great warrior Xealot, the great bard Xalite, and the great magician Alarost.<br>
