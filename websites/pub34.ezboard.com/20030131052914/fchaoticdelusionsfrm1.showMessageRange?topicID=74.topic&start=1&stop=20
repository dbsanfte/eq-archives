Since when is it not NBG on a raid??? It's bad enuf when people try to pull crap in exp grps but there's not much to be done about that...but in your own guild it is not acceptable. <br>
I really don't think that 30+ people get together to make one person rich...the purpose of raids (or so I thought) was to better equip your guildmates so that you can do bigger and better things...if your guildmates start rolling on items they aren't going to use and selling them (thereby screwing the ones who would USE the item) you aren't going to get anywhere as a guild. If NO ONE on the raid will USE the item then it should be sold for guild funds. <br>
<br>
My opinions.<br>
<br>
Being someone who just joined yesterday with a bunch of guildmates I'm very concerned about this...pls tell me what is being done about this? <p>Angelmyste Pathfinder - lvl 60 cleric -Emarr<BR>

<br>
This is complete and total BS.  Also, I think that if the officers punish Enantiomer in some way, that is complete and total BS.<br>
<br>
Guild members are supposed to trust that their officers are making sure that things happen fairly and justly.  They are supposed to be leaders, not friggin thieves of the efforts of the guild.<br>
<br>
It sounds like Iizzard is calling it quits and I find that an acceptable solution (even though I think he should really just give up the item and learn to play nice).<br>
<br>
Side note:  I am glad to see the guild growing, but it is very disturbing to hear the first words from a new member be along the lines of &quot;i just joined this guild, and, umm, wtf -- is this what I should expect&quot;?<br>
<br>
I met angel on the UP raid, and she seems really cool.  I don't think we should be doing stuff that makes cool people wonder what's up with us.  Especially officers.<br>
<br>
Further, there is no question as to what NBG means.  If you violate it, you should be subject to consequences.  I suggest that these consequences be somewhere in the range of being kicked out of guild to being put back on probationary status and not being allowed loot for like 60 days.  In this particular case, if I had any say, I would suggest that if Iizzard keeps playing, he be demoted from officer and not allowed loot for some period of time.<br>
<br>
If we don't have clear, visible consequences for wrongdoing, then things like this will just happen more and more often.<br>
<br>
Again, we are supposed to be able to put our trust in our officers.  If we guild members don't see this there will certainly be a mass exodus from our guild, just as we are realizing our potential.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer is right to bring this before the entire guild for consideration.  The officers should try harder to get a sense from the guild on most issues.<br>

<br>
It is bad enough when a guild member violates the NBG rule BUT when when a guild officer does it. GEEEZ!!!!!!. There should not be any debate on the matter. The item should be returned to the guild and rerolled to the members who can use it. <br>
<br>
For the record I want to state that I DO NOT go on raids to stuff money into other peoples pockets. I do it to get better equipment for my guildmates.<br>

<br>
But if he can't own up to his mistake and act like an adult, then he's a wuss and I'm glad he's gone.  I know he's your friend Tokum -- it sucks have a friend quit playing, so sorry.<br>
<br>
However, I can't find any sympathy for him since he is acting like this.  I'm sure he'll still sell the necklace for the 101K and give it to friends or whatever, so he still is being selfish.  Just because he is quitting doesn't exonerate him, in fact it makes him clearly that much more guilty.  And I doubt he'll truly quit.<br>
<br>
I don't think its right to infer blame on Enantiomer for bringing this up to the guild.  I mean, anyone who checks the Emarr items board can tell what Iizzard is doing...  If Iizzard (or anyone for that matter) thought this was a secret he's not too bright...<br>
<br>
Okay I've said more than my share now.<br>

<br>
I think you're awesome.  I really do.  I think you are cool headed and make a good guild leader cause you have a good way of dealing with people and they respect you.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer may get hot some times, but dammit he's fair.  <br>
<br>
Good example: Enan (who is my RL brother) didn't let me in on a roll for thurg leather bracer when I came late to raid even when I had been there for a couple hours.  He said he just didn't think it would be fair to let me in.  To be honest, I was a bit miffed, but I realized that people had been there five hours, broke the arena, etc.  So I decided to deal with it and hope for better luck on the next raid.  (Deldari won the roll.)<br>
<br>
Just cause Iizz is your friend doesn't give you the right to make exceptions for him even though you are leader.  Just cause he's an officer doesn't mean he gets special privileges... in fact it just means he has more responsibility and more headache in general.  (As I'm sure you know being the leader...)<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that if you all would have just worked it out with Enantiomer none of this would have happened.  It sure doesn't look like anyone tried to resolve this situation on the basis of what Enantiomer posted for us to see...<br>
<br>
My intent is not to make anyone mad.  I don't see why this couldn't have been resolved (or even STILL be resolved) and everyone just move forward.<br>
<br>
And just so people know, I don't give a damn about the necklace.  I do care about precedent though... and I think letting this just go would establish a horrible, HORRIBLE precedent.<br>
<br>
Flame me for caring if you must...<br>

<br>
Had this great post set up and everything, but too pissed now, so @#%$ it...<br>
<br>
ALL I HAVE TO SAY:<br>
<br>
enan: you should have looked at the item more carefully before decided where it goes....&lt;you @#%$ up&gt;<br>
<br>
enan: you should have found out first, WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A @#%$ DOUBT what iizzard was going to sell it<br>
<br>
enan: this is me asking...wait to make such drastic decissions about members &lt;5of them&gt; before booting them becasue they pissed you off, cause plain and simple, I dont trust you as an officer to make such decissions from emotion, I trust that you decissions are from reasoning and VOTING...<br>
<br>
enan: Try and remember tokum is leader of the guild, and let him make such a choice of FLAMING THE @#%$ OUT OF ANOTHER PERSON. chances are, it should go to such a extreme... just not kosur<br>
<br>
enan: suck my @#%$ nutts &lt;had to add that in&gt;<br>
<br>
guild: I like a great majority of everyone, I try and keep my mouth shut most of the time, and I have nothing against anyone Old or New... I greet you as friends, but this is built emothion towards one person... Pls bared with me, for I know not what I do at times...<br>
<br>
enan: your not the only officer , talk with the others, and find out what Should be done, not what you want to do ....<br>
<br>
a word to everyone in the game: Dont stab your friends in the back... tell them to their face what your going to do to them...  LIKE &quot;anyone who rants and flames about one of my Best of friends without the whole story/truth/and decission, should know, some day we might meet up in a allyway or darkend street corner, and as your lieing there bleeding and suffering from the bat across your head, know that it was I who hath Forsaken you to suffer...<br>
<br>
guild: again bare with me, not really happy, nothing against you... unless name was spoken of 8^)<br>
<br>
Guild Officers: *calmly speaking ... I really think that some kind of rule should have been made For items to be randomed after raid , so that Officers can Better choose the people they go to... things should be rushed in such a way... No drop items... they can be randomed at the time... but before the raid, go look at the items that COULD drop and choose then who should get them... but choose wisely and make it a group Decission...<br>
<br>
Guild Officers: Booting people should be group decussed and thought out, certain bootings &lt;5 of them&gt; were not discussed, they were Decided out of emotion and not reasoning... just becuase we might lose you over that  person... doesnt mean your UNexpenable... we might lose a lot more people because of the loss of that person... Measure the friends that will be lost<br>
<br>
A word to everyone: this is a @#%$ game, and basically if we got that item once, GUESS WHAT, we could prolly get it again, its not a @#%$ artifact...<br>
<br>
<br>
*sigh &quot;why cant we all get along&quot; &quot;because people are assholes thats why&quot;<br>
<br>
I really wish that people would just chill out and realize that we're all supposed to be friends here , why I joined the guild, my friends...<br>
<br>
*sigh, think what you want of me, just saying my peace... Decissions have been made and my post wont change that... just blowing off steam 8 )<br>

I like Gusgus and I like Redawen.  But if you are going to back up crap like what Iizzard did and what happened before when Enan got berated, then you are morons.  This guild will collapse if you support crap like that.<br>
<br>
Talk about bringing stuff up that should stay with just the officers... sheesh.<br>

Iizzard is the kind of guy that will give you the shirt off his back. Ever notice that he is the first to drop out of a group for someone else to get experience while he solos, pumping mana where needed? Ever notice he goes out of his way to make people feel at home. He laughs at your jokes, even the not funny ones so that you (and I) feel like someone is listening and appreciating what you say. So far as I can tell, he did nothing wrong. He thought about doing something that was questionable, but not wrong. If you win an item, is it yours? Or is it a loan? He did not actually do it. There is NOTHING greedy about Iizzard. <br>
<br>
Enan, you have been a good friend to me and mine. I love playing with you. You have a great family as well. You have done an incredible amount of work for the guild, and we are indebted to you for that. But you have a temper and a mean streak in you. You have a very pronounced feeling of what is right, but hold small regard for what others feel is right if you disagree. You attack with a violence that is disturbing when someone disagrees with you, or you make yourself anon and won't talk to anyone. These are not officer qualities. This post was unnecessary. It was designed to enflame and hurt our guild. Because of this  I also vote to at least remove you as an officer.  Knowing you, this will cause you to leave, along with your family.  <br>
<br>
For those of you new to the guild, the core of this guild was made up of three groups and their friends. The Florida group includes Iizzard and Tokum (and others), the Utah group includes Enantiomer, Aziline (and others), the Alabama group includes me, Truely, Redawen (and others). As you can see, the Alabama group is in the middle of this in a way, but at the same time, we are friends of all of them. Honesty and trust have been a very large part of what has made this guild work. If those break down, we have nothing. We do not wish to lose ANY of our friends over this. I can say I doubt the guild will be the same after this. I hope it can stay alive, since we have a really wonderful group of people that belong. The new people joining are, I think, a wonderful new asset to us, and hopefully we will be to them as well.<br>
<br>
On that note I finish. My heart is sad that this situation has come up.<br>
<br>
Wdar<br>
<br>
P.S. Just as I finished writing this, I found out that Enan also posted to Emarr the same link as above. This is absolutely a betrayal of all of us. If ever he had a thought he was in the right, he just blew it. I vote to remove Enantiomer from our guild. He can no longer be my friend.<br>

<br>
&quot;talking about stuff that should just stay with officers&quot;<br>
<br>
you not one... you chose to speak, so did I...<br>
<br>
Second: I dont defend I prosecute, did I say that I think I did... some where in that mass of pissed off writing<br>
<br>
are you supporting the bashing of people before the whole story comes out? seems that way...<br>
<br>
was it stated for a @#%$ fact that iizzard was going to sell it?.. he was checking it, do you know why?... cause before they even left Fear, he had so many offers for 100k for that items, he had me post to see what it COULD go for... never until AFTER his bashing and flaming did he decide to sell it, you know what, I would have done the same @#%$ thing , why because if I'm going to be flamed before I have a chance to give the item back or what not, you god damn right I'm going to sell that @#%$ thin , if I cant play then @#%$ it , I'm going to get some cash for all this @#%$ up Bullshit<br>
<br>
as for enan, he hasnt been bashed by me, never berated till now by me... I thinks its time for it to come out dont you?... bro I got nothing against you, but damn man... if only you knew ... what ever...<br>
<br>
Iizzard is my best friend and he didnt get the chance that he should have gotten before he was ROYALY @#%$ IN HIS ASS BY A SHORT MONKEY @#%$ SHEEP LICKING MOTHER @#%$<br>
<br>
I got nothing against no one in this guild not even if you decide with enan, its your choice... but really think about it, should someone have their whole fuckin eq rep screwed BEFORE the truth comes out... or his decission made...<br>
<br>
again, this Gusgus's opinion and ME fuckin ONLY... do not put me in the same room with anyone else unless they @#%$ agree with me...<br>

Tell me exactly what we all have a right to know..who decided this. If the big argument is between officers then why is it here? Only reason I can think to promote dissention. Well then it would seem to have been a success. Whatever happened with the damn necklace isn't worth all this, this all is a waste of time and space. Enan I love you, but you went too far and have now destroyed people..not items or loot..people. This is a shame, you overstepped yourself by making this all public to involve everyone and see what happpened. Look and see. <br>
<br>
    All because of loot, not any of this benefits anyone but you and your feelings of right and wrong. You hurt someone, that is not acceptable. You put out an issue that makes Iizzard look all wrong and you look all right. Well you are not now or ever have been all right. You have a temper, you blow up at people, you are judgemental and everyone knows it and deals with it. But this is too much this time...see what you have done?<br>
<br>
    You have made everyone mad and looks like you have ruined someones reputation..shame on you for that. you never have the right, never. I think you have other reasons for all this stuff, fine they are your reasons and your right. But this is not the place for it. You publicly embarrased someone over loot, cause them to leave the game because their reputation is ruined. You did it all, you are responsible and notice that no one has done the same to you in a public forum? <br>
<br>
     No class E, I thought you were better than this..I was sure you were. I was wrong and unlike you, my being right does not fill me with divine righteousness. You have embarrassed us all, when you started this post he hadn't sold it, but you went ahead and ruined him.<br>
<br>
     All this leaves me sad, friends I took real delight in are not my friends. people who were there to play and have fun with are not there anymore...<br>
<br>
<br>
     Is this what everyone has a right to know? Doesn't matter now, the whole world does.<br>
