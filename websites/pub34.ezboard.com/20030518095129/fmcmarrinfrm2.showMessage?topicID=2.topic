He came upon the guards to his city which were stirred into a great comotion with noise from their bellowing shouts and the troding of dwarven feet.<br>
<br>
It was at this point that I (Barnebus Goodfight) droped the skunk pelts which i had gathered and sought out my cousin, Doran, who was a member of the dwarven stormguard. Befor i could sort out who was who in all of the clatter Doran's strong hands clasped my shoulders.  &quot;cousin, where have you been? Thine kinsmen hath torn the hills asunder in search of ye!&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;What troubles ye my friend? Surely I am not important enough to illicit such a calamity of our home town of Kaladim?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Tis yer father Barnebus, he hath been injured in a cave in and the elders of Brell think his time draws ever so close to part with us mortals&quot;<br>
<br>
And so i went befor my father, the great Rudiger Goodfight, in order to tend to him in his time of most dire need.  However, when i came upon him in our small hovel he was less than the man I came to know, he had acepted death as his fate and the mood of his house was to be meloncoly.  Then he beckoned me to his deathbead, and I came with a tear cresting my cheek.<br>
No sooner had I felt the moisture on my face than a mighty and swift slap from the dying figure befor me struck it from me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aghh, don' a cry fer me ya wee dwarven hunterrr, i haven a time ta be berpin ya like a baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But father, you are all the kin i have and without you...&quot;<br>
<br>
I was cut off by a gaze from the elder dwarve, a gaze that was more powerful than the slap he had lain upon my face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aggh, there ye go bein' all the smart dwarf that ye thinks ye arrr.  Well, smarrty pants (cough) ye neverr asked me about yerr brotherrr.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wha ! how could I have a brother?  Is he out of his mind?  Is his condition causing him to dream up odd tales?<br>
<br>
&quot;Argg, I tell ye thee truth.(choke)I never wanted to tell ye about yer ma or yer twin brother since yee'd surely want to seek them out and I bein' too old and decrepit a dwarf can't stand to loose you to such a journey.(cough)&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then enlighten me father and I shall seek them out so that they know of Rudiger Goodfights charity and goodwork&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye son, twas after me and Beno had taken our army accross Antonica that we came ta this big ol town in the snowy mountains of everfrost.  Halas, they called it and twas there that i met yer mother, Boonie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Boonie, was the cuitest lass in the town of Halas and when the icy orcs threatend her town it was all i could do for the next few days to persuade Beno to use our regiment to atack the orcs, and that was just what we did.<br>
<br>
&quot;A mighty battle took place on the icy plane. and by the end the snow was turned red with the blood of orcs which was spewed forth by both dwarven axe and langsaxe. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;later i chose to stay with the fine people of Halas, in order to court your mother and that was just what i did.  After our marriage Bonnie decided that she wouldna raise not a family in the frozen tundra, so we migrated with a few other norseman to the western plains of Karana.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was there on the plains of Karana that our family grew and met it's demise. You see, shortly after the birth of you and your brother, Baxim, Bonnie and I were out on the eastern edge of our farm where we were trading with our neighbors when suddenly we were attacked by a band of hellish Ogres.  They were a mad sort, both casting strange magic and weilding mighty swords like warriors.  Befor I knew it four of the brutes had me bound and the others with their leader tortured and killed my beloved Bonnie.  I was powerless to stop em as they cheered on their leader, Goonda, as he broke your mother apart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They beat me and (cough)tortured me too, but i played as if i were dead and they left my meat for the wolves.  I was able to make my way back to our fishing village but i did so only to my own discontent.(sniffle)  The norseman were so angered they blamed my inability to protect my family for the outcome of the incident.  They took Baxim from me and they tossed your naked body to me that i might take the weaker son home to Kaladim to be raised like the dwarf he was.(hack, cough)&quot;<br>
<br>
A tear began to roll down the cheek of the elder dwarf.<br>
<br>
&quot;you see the only time i ever needed to win a battle i failed and it cost me more than any of the wars i had won.&quot;<br>
<br>
And those were the last words of the mighty Rudiger Goodfight.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will Avenge our misfortune father !!!  The name Goodfight will strike fear into the heart of every Ogre for the rest of time ! This I swear, I shall find my brother and together we shall call together our mighty name and our strength will be felt by many a breaking ogre skull.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus, I set out to find my brother whome I had not known.<br>
(I will continue this in a 2nd part to the story, I will also be thinking of adding in a story of &quot;the brothers meet Qwerk&quot; but only time will tell when i manage to post them all)<br>
