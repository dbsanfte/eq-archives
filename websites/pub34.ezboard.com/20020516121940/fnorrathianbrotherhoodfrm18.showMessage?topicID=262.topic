Their hollow eyes and sharp pointy teeth trying to rip at her skin.  &quot;no...no... leave me be&quot; she screams causing Silverbolt to come up out of a deep sleep to find his wife flaying around slapping at creatures only she can see and screaming at them. <br> &quot; Love wake up...wake up &quot; he croons as he tries to subdue her movements.  Her eyes wild with fright she does not see him and continues her urgernt battle.  Grabbing both her arms at last he uses a stern voice commanding her to look at him. <br>&quot;Fromstar look at me...its me Silverbolt. Theres nothing here to harm you love please wake up&quot;.  Her eyes finally focus and the glaze wild look disappates as she does finally see her husband.  Looking around she sees the destruction she as wrought on the bedclothes and grins sheepishly at her husband.<br>&quot;must have been some bad dream &quot; he comments.<br>&quot;aye love was most horrible and....&quot; she stops mid sentence and looks at Silver. All her senses are atuned to the air around her.  She is looking straight at him yet she does not see him.  He knows this look and sits quietly waiting...waiting for it to pass and then she will share the sight she saw with him.  As he looks into her eyes he knows she is not seeing him but something from afar. He still marvels at this gift she has.  He understood when he met her that being a druid she would have special gifts and a commune with nature more than the ordinary person.  What he didn't know was she also had the gift of sight.  Some would call it Psci others called it the work of the devil still others felt was a special gift from Tunare.<br>Whatever it was he had come to know it and respect it.  <br>  When they had left Surefall Glade several months earlier on a journey he had to make she had shared several visions with him that had saved them both from harm.  And he had come to trust the lady he had decided to make his own.  She had not been that easy to convince for she had learned not to trust.  But they shared many happy times in the short time they were together and he was always amazed how she would seem to know just what he was thinking or they would say the same thing together. They had stopped late one eve on their journey by the vast expanse of water in the Butcher Block Mountains.  They camped close on the beach and there he learned of her love of the water.  She swam for hours and the creatures of the water came to play with her as she froliced in the blue depts of the ocean.  He swam with her for a while then elected to lay on the cool ground and watch the moon beams play off her short blonde hair as she splashed and played a form of tag with the dolphins who had come to her.  He had taken out his lute and began to play a tune to match thier antics and soon creatures of the wood had ventured forth to listen to the sweet strains coming from him.  When she finally emerged from the water his heart had started slamming in his chest.  He had to find a way to make her see that she was meant to be with him always.  As she moved toward him droplets of water sparkled on her skin as they were caught by the beams of the bright moon. He began to speak poetry to her and it just seemed to flow from him  she was spell bound by the words he spoke.  Looking at him for the first time in a different light she saw the things she had been searching for right there at her hand. She did not know when it happened but she knew in her heart his words were true and that he was one she could trust.  And so as the moon rode high in the sky that night she opened her heart to the gentle bard and let him into the secret place where only one other had ever been.<br>As the dawn began to crest that morning they found a kindly cleric who agreed to marry them right then.  They spoke thier vows under the canopy of a giant tree and the critters of the wood were their witness.  Gentle sunlight filtered thru the massive braches of the tree and rays of light danced around the happy couple as if the gods were giving this union thier special blessing. After that they had moved on to accomplish his mission and then had come back to the glade to find them a home of their own.<br> &quot;we have to go now immediatly there is much trouble ...Jackii...Laeryna....and &quot; she stopped abruptly. Staring hard into his eyes he feels the fear and urgency she has felt and without another thought or word leaves the bed to prepare their pacs for the journey he knows is coming.<br>&quot;Pac light but bring the herbs we collected on our last journey . Oh Silver they are in so much trouble the help they have is good but time is against them.&quot; ever patient he contiunes the preperations knowing she will tell more when she is ready.<br>  Several hrs later finds the two on the road to MistMoore Silver's speed song moving them quickly along the path .  As they pass a small cottage of the road Fromstar sees her sister Jackii running at them at full speed.  Out of breath but determined she tells of what has happened and of the great thing she must ask Fromstar to do.<br>&quot;You want me to go to MistMoore &quot; Froms voice cracks and trembles a bit as she questioned Jackii.<br>&quot;you know I would never ask this of you unless it was absoulty necessary.  I know I saw him I will never forget him after all we shared...&quot;<br>&quot;I know what you shared&quot; From blerts out &quot;I need not be reminded&quot;  Jackii looks at her sister and feels the pain but it was before her time before she married him.<br>&quot;I know Jackii I know but what you ask is hard he is gone he passed thru the veil with Chamois how can you say you saw him. It must have been a trick on your mind you were hurt and &quot;<br>&quot;Stop it ...I know it was him he looked dead at me and he chased the creatures away with his powers and I know the mark on his chest. It was there in plain view again for them to see. Please From believe me and if there were any other way I would use it but I have not choice and neither do you&quot; .  Fromstar turns from her sister and looks out over the small pasture they stood in. <br>So the dream was more than a dream and the pain would be there again would she beable to stand it? What choice did she have her closest friend in all of Norrath was at risk of becoming one of the creatures of MistMoore. Looking back at Jackii she gives a small nod to her saying without words she would do what was asked of her.<br>  Silverbolt watched his wife closely he knew who she was going to see.  He felt a bit threatend but then thought of how close they had become and how atuned to each other they were.  It was his turn to trust he realized. Taking her hands in his he silenlty lent her his strenght knowing she  would need all the magic and power she could muster.  He drew her to him and held her briefly then kissed her gently . Stepping back he looked at Jackii and picked up thier pacs and stated &quot;lets move we have much to do before we can put all this into action.&quot;<br>&quot;you don't have to come Silver..&quot; Fromstar starts to object and he holds his hand up to silence her . &quot;our friend is in trouble...you have an old memory to face I suggest we get to it&quot; and with that he moved off down the path toward the gates of MistMoore....<br>to be continued <p>Jackii Lonewolfe rogue of the 46th season <BR> Do you wanna live forever?<BR>Dragons of Hope <BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/ujackiitherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jackii the Rogue</A> at: 5/2/02 5:21:22 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=262.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=262.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.threadControl?topicID=262.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=262.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=262.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub34.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm1">Welcome<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm22">Policies and Procedures<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm6">General Discussions<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm4">Epic and Quests<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm5">Equipment/Wish List<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm18">Role Playing Stories of your travels and Lives in Norrath<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm21">Daily Hunting Plans<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm11">Norrathian Brotherhood (Members only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm3">Events (Planned Happenings)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm15">The HOOD Bank<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm7">Recruitment (Officers Only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm8">Inner Council (Officers Only)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm12">History (Closed Threads)<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm23">Applicants<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm24">Alliances<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm25">Roll Call<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm26">Guild News<option value="norrathianbrotherhoodfrm27">Epic Day</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#0066ff>- </font><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bnorrathianbrotherhood>Norrathian Brotherhood</a><font color=#0066ff> - </font><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18>Role Playing Stories of your travels and Lives in Norrath</a><font color=#0066ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
