<br>
Tokum has already said in here that you shouldn't rely on him or the other officers to plan a raid you want.<br>
<br>
If you want to go to chardok, DN, some plane, kill an epic mob or whatever the hell you want, POST IT HERE!<br>
<br>
People need to respond to the posts as to whether or not they will be able to come and attend.  Sometimes there is a lackluster response (as with the first Chardok raid I tried).  But even those can be fun (as was the first Chardok raid).<br>
<br>
However, if you have something specific in mind, just freaking post it here.  I have become aware of a guild situation that has arisen simply because someone didn't take their own initiative and plan the raid they wanted on their own.<br>
<br>
Eventually we all will likely want our epics.  I know that I will eventually post that I need help with the various tough mobs for my epic.  I KNOW I will post here to arrange a time.<br>
<br>
Use the damn system people.  Don't rely on friggin officers for every little thing you want.  Show some freaking gumption and get what you want planned if you really want it.<br>
<br>
Dammit.  I'm so pissed off cause I freaking made these board for the guild to avoid the exact problem that arose.<br>
<br>
Members: use the damn system and tell other members to use the damn system.  Officers: please, tell members to use the damn system -- that need be your only reply in game.<br>
<br>
Once a raid is posted, people can comment.  You all have your own opinions as to what is important and what is not.  Let the guild decide whether or not they care about a proposed event through replies and posts to a proposed event.<br>

<br>
I know the situation you're talking about and although I won't get into specifics (in this case, I think the number of ppl needed would warrant a good sized raid and it might have been a good idea to post here), there's nothing wrong with setting up a small raid online, asking for help online, etc. As long as you don't expect people to drop what they are doing right then to go help your ad hoc raid. <br>
<br>
The other problem of course, is getting people to use the guild board more. I've been in other guilds where it was used all the time, and ones where it was not. Don't know why it works that way, but it's hard to force people to use it. You've done a nice job setting it up, and we should use it more. guildmotd is not enough info for planned events. If you see a guildmotd, you should come here to see the specifics.<br>
<br>
For the event last night, I'd like to make a comment. I was not there, do not know all the details, heard everything second-hand. So I am not going to point fingers. <br>
<br>
<br>
We have a great guild. For a while I was not sure we'd make it, seemed like we went so far and stopped. But with the leveling that people have done, and the influx of new people, we are now a force to be reckoned with. I would really hate to see that fall apart because of tempers flaring and things said that shouldn't be. There will always be some people that don't get along with each other, fact of life. The larger we get the more it will happen. You are responsible for your temper. You are responsible for your actions. You are responsible for controlling what you say in the heat of the moment. If you cannot control what you say or do, log off. Cool down. Think it over and decide what is really important. As it happens, the people involved last night I think highly of. It's always disturbing to have your friends fight<br>
<br>
The advantage we have in game is that we do NOT have to show our faces and reactions to things. As slow as I am at typing, I have time to think over what I'm saying as I type it. I find I delete sentences all the time before I hit enter because I realize what I am saying will not help or is not appropriate at the time.<br>
<br>
Make comments on the board. It gives you a chance to say more, read it over and think about it before you piss someone off. You may do it anyway. You may decide that that's what you want to do. Sometimes that's even the right thing to do.  But give yourself a chance to decide not to piss off others too.<br>

<br>
I am sorry if you think I'm trying to piss anyone off.  I absolutely do not have that intent.<br>
<br>
My point isn't that everything has to be on the board.  I personally just don't think we should pester officers IG with every little thing we want...  They have enough to deal with and have (to some extent) made a game a bit of a job w/ responsibilities etc.<br>
<br>
Maybe we are simply lacking a guild rule or something that would prevent this sort of trouble.<br>
<br>
I just think that this could all be avoided if people took their own initiative.  That's my point.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.  This is by far the best guild BECAUSE people get along well, DON'T have deeva fits frequently, DON'T abuse and berate others, DON'T expect too much, AREN'T selfish and ARE willing to help.<br>
<br>
Ok one last thing then I will honestly lay off for a bit.  This board is a great way to bypass (and garner) the opinions of others.  Example: if Truely doesn't like the raid I propose, she can post and say this is lame and decide not to come, but others might think Truely is wrong (doubtful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and will come anyway...<br>

No, I did not mean anything about you pissing ppl off at all. You certainly did not piss me off. I saw your post as an attempt to organize things better. I agree that stuff should be posted here first if at all possible, but not all things done by people in the guild have to involve officers at all, either here or IG. For people who want a guild raid: for epic, for a particular item or just to go someplace new, suggestions should be made here and the officers then decide which raids will be scheduled. For things that can be done with one group or so, no reason not to set it up in game without going through an officer, doing the planning themselves. I have a big problem with people that try to set things up and then guilt people into doing it, but a simple request for help is great, as it keeps things alive in guild.<br>
