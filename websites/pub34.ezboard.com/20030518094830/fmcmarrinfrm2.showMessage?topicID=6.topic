<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Growing up in Halas was a bitter sweet time for me.  The adventures of the cold frozen plains always kept things interesting. Yet, it always seemed as if I was a little out of place.  Especially, concerning things with family.  You see, I'm the adopted son of Brandyn and Heite McDonald, two of the hardest working and fairest merchants all of Antonica.  I had come to them a long time ago.  I have no recollection of this first meeting with my new family since I was far too young to remember.  They were great adoptive parents to me.  Taught me many things.  When I was at a young age, Brandyn and I would stock the daily goods, fish on the docks of Halas together, and sled with the dogs.  Mother Heite taught me the finer things, crafts that I would find useful but not until later  in life.  Sewing, pottery, and cooking to name a few.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Things were well at home.  But, yet I always thought myself  to be unlike the truest Halasman.  I could see signs of this every day.  Rumors swirled around Halas like the harshest northern winds.  Sometimes I would hear, “Oh.  He’s the poor fella that lost his kin to that terrible horde.” Or “Too bad about what happened to him and his kind.”  All of this innuendo but I was a little hurt just the same.  Being young, I really did not know what to make of this talk.  However, I knew the day would come for me to go out and find my past as well as make my future. <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Soon it came time for me to learn my way of life.  I tried all the forms of the Halasmen.  First, I went to Kylan O’ Danos the noblest and finest warrior trainer of all the continents.  He liked my moxie right away.  Although, I almost cut my own foot off when learning how to wield a short sword.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He laughed heartedly,   “Ho there young fighter!  You had best put that sword down before you get yourself or any innocent bystander hurt.”  I did this with disgust.  He then exclaimed, “Sorry brave one.  Being a warrior is not for ye.  Best of luck in finding you way!”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I took off saddened and a little embarrassed.  <br>
     Next I went to Dun McDowell a sneaky rogue that played cards behind the bank.  He took a liking to me also.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grinning, he spoke, “Ah, so ye want to learn the way of the rogue do ya?” He spoke through blood shot eyes, “Well, to join is an easy task.”  He put down his beer then produced a copper coin and placed it under his cap, “All ye have to do is snatch this from the top of my head.  It’s as easy as that.”  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I surely thought this a joke.  Although I was more than ready to try.  I told him I was ready and quickly grasped at his head.   With a smile he dodged my first advance. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Damn he’s fast!” I thought.  He seemed to know each of  my moves before I had begun them.  Each time I swung for the prize he would be swooping a counter move.  After about ten minutes of my feeble attempts.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sat down.  “Sorry son,” he said.  “Looks like you don’t have the makings of a true rogue.  I wish you better luck with your adventures.”  With that he patted me on the back and I was yet again on my way.  It was only later I found my money bag to be empty.<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The very next day I went to see Shamus Felligan.  The wisest shaman of all the lands.  He took me under his guidance right away, setting me out for some training.  We went to the outpost of Everfrost where he gave me a staff and taught me how to swing it with proper form.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lay into that wooly spiderling on yonder.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I took off like a shot hoping to prove myself well.  I waited for the innocent creature to pass before I struck suddenly from its rear.  WHAP!  A forceful hit and better yet  a success!  I had the creature confused and on the run.  Surely I would prevail.  I gave chase, but each time I closed the gap between us and rose my staff, the spiderling would abruptly change direction.  I stumbled to the ground a few times and became quite enraged at my failure to finish off the beast.  From a distance I could hear my master chuckling.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Quite quick the little insect is, eh?  Let me give you a hand.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that a mystic spell arose from his hands and suddenly the spider sunk into the ground making it immobile.  No longer flustered, I once again threw down a crushing blow towards the spider.  Crack!  I have slain a wooly spiderling!  My heart filled with pride as I trotted off to Shamus with some spiderling legs as my trophy.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah, congratulations to you young one.  But, you still have much to learn.  A true shaman must learn both the ways of a noble warrior and the way of the spirits.  Let us continue and battle some more.  Then I shall teach you the finer points of spell casting.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And this we did.  I slew hundreds of spiderlings, gnoll pups, Goblin whelps, and even a few strong polar bear cubs.  When Master Shamus thought the time was right, he took me back to the shaman guild and gave me a spell book of my very own.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Take this here.” My master said.  “Learn these spells wisely young lad.  They may save your life,  better yet, the life of you comrades some day.   Scribe these few spells here in the book and meet me again in Everfrost tomorrow morning.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, my master and good evening,” I said.  As I rambled on homeward thinking that I might have found my true calling.<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day, I met Master Shamus at the ramp leading to Everfrost.  As he asked of me the day before.  He sat me down and told me to open my book.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now, read the inner fire spell and let the words sink into your mind.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I let the words burn their way deep inside me.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Stand up!  Now recite those words and let your wisdom come forth!”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An incredible feeling overcame me as I started my chant.  A mystical feeling, starting from my chest slowly worked it’s way down to my finger tips.  When I couldn’t contain it any longer a surge of energy overtook me and I became filled with a brief aura.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Incredible!  Master I have done it!” I said, full of pride.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes.  This is one of the many steps in becoming a great and powerful shaman.  Now, just as you last did, try to memorize the burst of flame spell and target that young polar bear on yonder.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I did this quickly hoping to show Master Shamus my eagerness.  I stood up and began to cast my newest of spells.  Seeing the bear was a way off and moving farther out, I tried to hurry myself.  This was a mistake.  Instead of a magnificent burst of flame, all that came out of me was about fourteen fizzles.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Halt there young lad,” said my master.  “Your eagerness is appreciated but spell casting is only for the prepared and patient.  Sit ye down and try again.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I did as he wished and soon another bear cub came roaming by.  Relaxing this time, my spell cast went off like a charm.  The bear cub was soon singed by a bright ball of fire.  Hurt, but not giving up the beast turned on me striking my left leg with a great blow.  I hobbled  to my right and struck a blow with my staff.  Crack!  I had slain a polar bear cub!  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Injured are ye?”  said my master.  “Well, try that light healing spell in your book.  It shall cure what ails ye.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I sat down, memorized the spell and cast it upon myself.  As quickly as the spell was off my tongue, the wounds began to heal and again I was at full strength.  Master Shamus then came over to me and patted me on the back in congratulations.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “A fast learner you are.  One day you should make a great and mighty shaman.  We would be proud to call you brother,” he said.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Does this mean I passed the test?  Am I truly a shaman?”  I said gleefully.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye.  You can call yourself a shaman.  However, be patient young one.  Group up with others and practice your skills wisely.  When your skill has improved some, please come and see me.  I shall teach you more.  You still have much to learn.”  Spoke my master.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye sir.  I shall indeed and thank ye.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that he gave me a wink, cast a spell and disappeared from sight.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What a relief,” I thought.  I have finally found my true calling.<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With my new knowledge I adventured some in the weeks following my first lesson.  Making it to the realm of Blackburrow.  This was to be a proving ground to my young brethren and me.  Always staying closely together and fighting ferociously, my group had much success against the filthy gnoll menace.  I had seen Master Shamus many times after our raids in Blackburrow, he was always giving me advice and new spells to research.  A favorite spell of mine was the Spirit of Wolf that granted me great speed.  I was truly on the right path, becoming a great shaman.<br>
     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Soon, Blackburrow had become less of a challenge for me.  Even the gnoll commanders and his elite guards stood no match against my friends and me.  I spent more time trying to learn about my past from my adoptive parents.  But their tongues were always silent on this matter.  I believe it is their will to protect me from the unknown.<br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  One day, Father Brandyn came to me in need of some help.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Son, I need you to run some supplies out to your Aunt Megan near the South Tower,” he said.  “You mother has become ill and I cannot leave the store.  But, do this quickly and don’t dilly-dally for there are many dangers to be found in the Everfrost.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes sir!” I exclaimed as I hurriedly gathered the supplies and my trusty staff.  “I shall not be long,” I said, even though I was excited about seeing more of the frozen plains and wondering what adventures lied there.  I ran quickly to the entrance of Everfrost and cast the Spirit of Wolf on me.  Next, I made my way to the outpost where I stopped to say hello to the guards and pet Snowflake.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Be careful out there.  There has been report of many an orc sighted by the frozen river.”  Said a steadfast guard.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will.  They shall never see me,” I proclaimed as I picked up my pace and headed towards the tower.  In reality, I thought seeing an orc would be a great boon to me.  Never before had I seen one, let alone battled with.  Yet, I knew that I had a task at hand and must get the supplies to Aunt Megan.  Soon, I could see the top of the South Tower.  I could just make out the doorway which was the guarding post for my Aunt.  I crept closer becoming more aware of my surroundings   This was uncharted territory for me therefore caution was needed.  Thinking the coast was clear, I made my way to the doorway.  Alas, Aunt Megan was nowhere to be seen.  I set the supplies down in the proper place by the south corner.  I scanned around looking for signs of life.  Suddenly, Aunt Megan came running around the corner shouting.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  “On your feet boy!  I have an orc trooper on my arse!” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I scrambled to stand, when a rush of a hulking orc flew whizzing by.  Aunt Megan was battered  and bruised from head to toe.  She could barely keep the monster at bay.  I ran to her rescue, rising my staff high and charging the trooper from the rear.  I struck him squarely on the head.  But, instead of hearing a cracking noise.  It became more of a dull thud.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “By the Tribunal!  What you orcs  have in girth you sure lack in brains!”  I exclaimed.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The blow barely had an effect but did manage to turn his attack on me.  I dodged his first volley of blows and cast a Sicken Spell on him.  The foul creature started to retch and swung again catching me on the arm.  The pain was extreme.  However, I regained my balance and caught him on the nose with my staff.  Next, I cast a Tainted Breath Spell and the creature began to vomit as the poison started to run through his veins.  A backhand by the orc sent me reeling.  But I would have this fight!  I crashed down upon my foe again striking hard and fast.  The orc now was in great pain. He sensed the battle lost and started a slow trot away from me.  I continued the fight, until the once mighty trooper lay dead at my feet.  Totally exhausted in both body and mana I returned to Aunt Megan and began to aid her.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am fine child.  That trooped laid into me from behind, the coward.  Thanks for the assistance and supplies,”  she said.  “Now you must go, before the darkness sets and you get lost.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stood up again, gathered my things and spoke “Just glad I was here to help.  Good by Megan and may the Tribunal bless you.”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that I saluted her and began my way back to the guard outpost.  It really was getting late and darkness was overtaking the daylight.  I tried to continue my focus on getting back home, when off in the distance I saw a barbarian figure walking towards me.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Surely a traveler or lost hunter,” I thought, as I turned my direction straight at him.  A familiar face I would see, I had at least hoped.  But, this would be even worse than I could imagine.  Thru the shadows and into my range stepped an ominous figure of northman legend and his name was Martar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You barbarians are an affront to me and all I stand for!”  He snarled thru blackened teeth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Prepare to meet your death!”  With that he lunged toward me striking me quickly in the chest knocking me backward.  Stunned, I started to run.  Trying to put some distance between myself and my unbeatable foe, maybe I should be fortunate enough to make it to the safety of the guards.  Praise the Tribunal for my Spirit of Wolf.  With that thought my luck changed for the worse.  My SoW had begun to leave me with Martar still on me.  The fight with the orc trooper had left me both hurt and precariously low on mana.  As a fool, I hadn’t bothered to meditate some back into me.  Things looked bleak.  I stopped suddenly, trying to focus the will for another SoW spell but all that came was a weak fizzle.  Martar pounced at the opportunity, blasting me off my feet with a tremendous volley of punches.  I lay motionless, bleeding all over the new fallen snow.  This would be my last day I thought.  Resistance would be futile.  I summoned the strength to roll over so as to face my executioner.  Martar, not far off set a slow stride at my waiting, soon to be corpse.  He was only mere feet away when he stopped abruptly.  His look of hatred was now replaced by that of confusion.  It was now that I realized, he was stuck in his tracks!  Praise the Tribunal!  Help had come to the rescue.  Three ominous figures stepped from the shadows.  All barbarian brothers in arms.  The leader, without pause, began to cast a spell.  A great cleansing sensation overtook me, as my wounds and fatigue left me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Greetings young shaman.”  He spoke loudly.  “Seems we have stumbled upon a problem vexing you.  Do not worry, young lad.  We will help.”  With that he turned to his left and announced to another kinsman.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Slowed and rooted.  He’s all yours Hack.”  Hackzilla, the strongest of the bunch, smiled from ear to ear as he approached the menace Martar. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My hatred for you knows no equal.  Prepare to meet your death!”  He drew out what must have been the longest and most deadly sword in all of Norrath.  Then, with one swipe of his trusty blade, the severed head of Martar was on the ground.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ha!  Who’s your father now mangy cus?”  He insulted at the fallen dome. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I rose to my feet and strode over to acknowledge my saviors.  “Thank you all.”  I said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Everfrost is a dangerous place to be.  Especially in the night time hours.”  Spoke the caster.    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Excuse me but I think introductions are in order.  My name is Richerd of the clan McMarrin.  To my right is Faldadar and to the left is Hackzilla, both fellow McMarrin members.”  Said Richerd, as he inspected me.  “And whom might you be?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stammered.  “Baxim Goodfight of the clan McMarrin.  Sir!  I was ordered to deliver supplies to my aunt Megan at the south tower.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes.  We spoke to Megan just before we found you in trouble.  She asked for us to make sure you would make it safely back to Halas.”  Said Richerd.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Looks like we made it just in time for the party.  Hehe.”  Hackzilla observed loudly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yep.  If we spent any more time battling the Ice giants.  You would be a bloody red smear on this new snow.”  Said Faldadar.  “It would have been tough to locate enough of your remains for a proper burial.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmmm.  A fellow McMarrin brother you are, Baxim.  You say that you are a Goodfight also?”  Said Richerd.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Goodfight?  Was that not the same name of that odd little dwarf we had seen running off to rescue the slaves in Crushbone?”   Pondered Faldadar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What’s this?”  I spoke.  “Maybe a piece from my missing past!  Are ye sure he spoke of himself a Goodfight?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, and quite proudly in fact.”  Said Hackzilla.  “He has a warriors spirit in him.  I like that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I must go then to this Crushbone and seek him out.  Thank you all for helping me.  You don’t know what this means to me.”  I said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye.  Good journey to you then.  I am sure our paths will cross again.  Bring honor to the name McMarrin.”  Spoke Richerd.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I waved my last goodbye to the three heroes of Halas and ran as fast as I could back to my home.  I never spoke about what adventure I had that day to Brandyn or Heite.  Nor, that I had herd of a long lost relative.  I secretly packed some provisions and planned to set out early the next day.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My adventure, my past, and my future all set ahead of me.  I shall succeed. <br>
