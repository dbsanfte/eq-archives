Unfortunately my account was frozen for a breif period of about 5 months, then i played for 3 months and it was frozen again for about 10. I was friends with pipacakes and Cepe and a few others back in BCC. The reason I left the guild is because my best buddy Creap (who used to play a warrior named unload) got kicked out of the guild by Warclaw who was the guild leader at the time. At the time we were around level 20 or so, maybe even lower and the guild was still new. Now I am here to stay and I want to go back to my favorite guild of the past (although it has evolved into something way more powerful hehe). <br>
<br>
Now I was told that the level requirement is 60, but if there is any way I can get in sooner I would very much appreciate it, if not I will try to get to 60 ASAP.<br>
<br>
I have some resists gear as well as the HS and Seb key.<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read this long app )<br>
<br>

Desited to have a group with the mighty guild leader name Warclaw. then along come a nasty train of nasty mean sarnaks! from mean old lake of Ill omen*Shivers* the mighty leader died &lt;warclaw&gt; and the group swoops off to safety to FM, then 3 days later the mighty leader Warclaw went the the mighty wizzy of Xev and gave him a brain! Wooty woot! then this mighty brain told him when he said RUN! that ment for me to stay there and die, &lt;i was a smart noob&gt; so he got mad beacuse i ran away to safety with all the others, WHEN he was the only one that died, and desited to kick me from the mighty Blood cult clan =*(......Then after the mighty Unload got kicked out onto the scary Cabilis streets and he was forced by hunger to go out and order a pizza and get a life.

<br>
<br>
History<br>
<br>
Blood Cult Clan was formed when in the very begining of the World of Xev. The first Guild on Kunark, the first Iksar Guild on Xev, Blood Cult Clan has always been a Guild of Power, history, and respect. Started as a Guild of Ruthless Warriors, it has matured and grown into a Guild of Power, and Knowledge. Many come to join our ranks but few have what it takes to get in.<br>
<br>
                                                                                    Warclaw Bloodcult<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
<br>
1.) I am your leader, Warclaw Bloodcult. Above all you will respect me, and you will respect my officers. I chose them becuase they had what it takes to be a leader in this guild so all respect shall be given to them as well.<br>
<br>
2.) Your fellow guildmembers come before anyone else. If you have a problem with another outside the Guild, you discuss it with a guild and we will work to a solution, if you have a problem with the guild, it stays in the guild, and will be addressed by your Officers and I.<br>
<br>
3.) Never ever do anything that would bring discredit upon the guild, you will be instantly removed if your actions are found out to be trued or you will be sacrificed and your earthly possesions redistributed, or removed from the guild immediatly.<br>
<br>
4.) We are a Strong and Fearless guild. Never show fear. Even if your enemy is stronger than you, there is no excuse to back down ever. You must back up everything you say or die trying. Dueling is your way of life. You grow stronger with each battle and live for the thrill of combat. Enjoy each death and each death dealt.<br>
<br>
5.) Never beg, your guild will provide but is not obligated to provide. Begging will not be tolerated because it is demeaning and makes you look weak.If you feel neglected by your guildmembers bring it to an officers or my attention every member of BCC is important.<br>
<br>
6.) KNOW YOUR CLASS!!! Citizens of Norrath expect that a Blood Cult Clan member knows and is proficient in his class. It is every members responsibility to learn everything you can about your class.<br>
<br>
7.) Once you leave Blood Cult Clan, you will never be allowed back in. If you abandoned your guild once, you will do it again and you must be able to be depended on by your guildmembers. Each member trusts the other explicitly with their lives and anyone that jumps in a fit of anger can not be tolerated ever.<br>
