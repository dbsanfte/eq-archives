PUSSIES!!!!! <br>
<br>
 Ok i can understand being afraid to take a char threw a zone when the zones lvl 50 and your lvl 20. I can understand not wanting to port under wushi's nose when ya dont know your faction.<br>
<br>
What i can NOT understand are a few of the following <br>
<br>
Example #1... I died i asked if a rezer was on. Nothing unusual i usualy die. Whats wrong with this is there was a cleric ( alt ) on who could give me a small rez still a rez. wouldnt for 2 claimed reasons <br>
1. I was in GD and they where lvl 26 and afraid to come into zone and <br>
2 a 20% or so rez wasnt worth their time to run from SK <br>
  Whats wrong with this ? again <br>
1 When the @#%$ is it NOT worth it to go help a guildie no matter who? and <br>
2 this alt had a 50+ main WHY the @#%$ are they afraid of GD? especily when a PoP book is right there and the body can be dragged to? <br>
<br>
Example#2... ( i wasnt involved in this one but was relayed to me) Again a high lvl on as an alt. this high lvl was geting their mini BL PLed but afterward were afraid to run threw Oasis to get threw to the otherside this with a lvl 46 escort. <br>
   WTF why ? you die you dont loose any XP!!! This person has a 50+ main as well <br>
<br>
And just recently i was looking over Faemows shoulder and a 20+ individual asked how to get back to a zone he's been fighting in for a couple of days and every one had a port/PoP book path..It was 5 @#%$ zones away RUN FOREST @#%$ RUN!!!<br>
<br>
I loved this guild ive been in it since Kunark Launched THATS RIGHT nearly 3 years aside from the originals ive been in this guild for @#%$ ever and latly its gone down hill not becouse of the raids or not becouse of the quests but becouse ppl are &quot;Clicking&quot; like they are back in High school and becouse they are geting scared. It got to easy so now they are afraid or they bought in and never had to learn or @#%$ or ok. YES this is a rant and YES this is a @#%$ FLAME!!!<br>
<br>
Flame back go ahead bitch at me beet down GreyD's door and have him boot me from the guild if thats what gets you off. HE is still the @#%$ guild leader if ya didnt know.<br>
<br>
But no matter what bitch moan hate me call me names flame me ban me shun me or better yet Shut the @#%$ up and put your money where you mouth is! <br>
<br>
This guild used to have people with guts who DID NOT back down. who KNEW where they where going.<br>
<br>
Heres how you can show me im wrong heres how you can shut me up and shoot me down. Dont respond at my level and trash mouth but show me the kind of People i joined up to play with havnt all left or quit or totaly lost their heart.<br>
<br>

Leafdark Not going anywhere O'brian 41 Level Shadow Knight <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=katwinterstar>KatWinterstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/23/03 10:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fmcmarrinfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://24.222.31.99/Winterstar/eyes.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR!?!?!?!</span><hr size=1> Ok Leafdark bring it.<br>
My alt Qualla was the cleric who would not come to rez you in GD.  Here's the thing: Main reason I did not come to rez you: she was in a group.  A group of people in paw that definately needed their cleric.  I can not let those people down to leave for a long time to give you a pansy ass 20% rez.  Not to mention the fact that she likely would have been killed herself several times so the whole production probably would have taken an hour.  SUCK IT UP!  It's not worth it for 20%!!  I do not mind helping if I am not busy but come on.  It is incredibly selfish and rude of you to be so upset about that.  <br>
Second point: I am afraid of everything.  Everything. Got that?  When Kat ports into GD she always invises herself.  Therefore I am not about to take my level 27 cleric there.  <br>
Even if Katyia died I would not expect any of my clanmates to leave their present groups to come for a rez.  I would find my own rez.  That's how it works.  I like you, but JESUS!<br>
Not only, but you sure as hell weren't this upset when it happened and that was half a week ago.  You have a problem bring it to me.  You are making an unneccesary spectacle of yourself.<br>
Thirdly:  I can't believe you are bitching because poor Raidn asked for directions.  You, who are SO pissed off because guildies won't help.  (You're complaining because he wouldn't run through zones he didn't know and do it without help? Well then why couldn't you find your own rez??)   NOONE should EVER be penalized because they are asking a question.  I ask a hell of a lot of questions myself.  I do not pretend to know a lot about the game.  But do you know what?? It's a G A M E.  It's fun, not work.  You expect me to drop everything and come and help you  but whenever anyone asks for help you have a rude comment and a curse.  Is that the McMarrin you're striving for? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=katwinterstar>KatWinterstar</A> at: 2/23/03 11:22:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leafdark@mcmarrin>Leafdark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/24/03 8:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fmcmarrinfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR!?!?!?!</span><hr size=1> 10Pm CST Channel PRIDE Server to be announced thursday the 27th <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leafdark@mcmarrin>Leafdark</A> at: 2/24/03 8:19:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showUserPublicProfile?gid=froggiefae>froggiefae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/24/03 9:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fmcmarrinfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR!?!?!?!</span><hr size=1> Katyia this reply for you.  I was there the day you or Quella wouldn't or 'couldn't' help with a rez.  When you said that you said nothing about being in a group.  It would have been more understandable then, but you were just bitching that it is too long of a way to go for a @#%$ 20% rez, and that is all you said about that.  On the same note, I was in a group in KC and one of our guildmates died, whom I was grouped with, and a cleric (who was an alt of a guild member) left his group, which was mostly mcmarrins, to come and help us with a rez twice.  Granted they were just playing in DL, but the fact is they broke group twice to help out.<br>
<br>
Second: &quot;I am afraid of everything&quot; ok that is understandable because I fear certain zones too, but don't flaunt the fact that you could help and then so oh well i don't like that zone.  She was just advertising for help and until Farno stepped in to help no one said another thing to her.  I fear zones too, and @#%$ happens, and that is why we have a guild as our 'family' to help us out in the time of need.  Lately I have seen this 'family' crumble before my very eyes.  People are too conceded and worried about themselves and about lvling and about grouping with the same lvl rather then allowing a couple of lower leveled people into the groups.  The whole non existant 'chardok raid' still pisses me off for the mear fact that it was cancelled to go to a HIGHER lvl zone raid.  &quot;any 50+ alts can come join in this one, but the other is cancelled&quot;  That is utter @#%$ bullshit.  If anything it could have at least been attempted or here's a thing when having a guild raid, how about the guild members participate instead of building their own HIGH lvl groups in the planes and away from everyone else?????<br>
<br>
Third:  I think this whole run thing is awsome and needs to be done.  Everyone takes Luclin and PoP for granted and don't look at the geographical areas of this GAME.  No one even bothers to look at maps anymore, and if they do it doesn't show.  When I first started this game, we had maps printed out from eqatlas all over the desk, sometimes it was even hard to find the mouse because we were concentrated on getting through the zones we needed to to get to other places.  I still look at maps when at all possible.  People are just too dependent on others knowing things for them.  I am not against people asking for help or even directions, but people don't even know their way around the basic newbie zones anymore.  SO I say show your Mcmarrin pride and be on on the 27th or when ever it is, and do the run, if not just to win a race, but to prove to yourself that you know the game as well as you think or would like to know it.  Be there so you can actually say, &quot;YEAH I did it, and I didn't need to use the extra plesent expansions as zone jumping guides!&quot;<br>

Where do I start.<br>
Ok. It is perhaps possible I did not mention I was in a group the day Leafdark was asking for a rez.  I wasn't flaunting anything.  I can guarantee you that.  Honestly I figured I was joking.  I never thought she would want such a low level rez.  I know if I was playing Katyia, I wouldn't.  Also, it didn't seem that dire a problem.  She didn't seem to be in a bad mood, and we all know what Leaf is like in a bad mood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I just figured it was kind of a joke.  If I misunderstood, I apologize for that.<br>
The raid in Chardok was cancelled because we did not have enough people to do it.  We would have gotten wiped, plain and simple.  I don't understand the accusations that we fight in &quot;cliques&quot;.  I really don't.  We generally fight with people that are our own level.  It seems like a natural thing.  For example everything is green or little experience for me in DL so I move to a higher level zone.  There are lots of times I can't find a group either.  I'm a wizard --come ON!! Nobody likes wizards!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
What do you want us to do?  I would like to hear your solution because I'm puzzled.<br>
Anyone else sitting where I am? Would like to hear from you.<br>
Thanks, and take care,<br>

I mean that in the nicest way, for you know I like you and I can never be offended by you or your characters.<br>
You talk about the clan going down the drain and I don't know wheter that's true, I do know there are a lot of people in McMarrin I don't know and donnot know if they would help me out and all.<br>
Then i saw you were implying that Katyia would drag her ass over to GD and rez you. She wouldn't/couldn't and I can't blame her.<br>
What pisses me off is that you take it here to rant a person who is ALWAYS willing to help.<br>
I like grouping with Kat for a numer of reasons and one is that she never gets mad or pissed at the situatons or groups. She never is too lazy to Xloc people even out of group and she's scared of everything.<br>
She doesn't cast the most damaging spells, but the ones with the longest range.<br>
<br>
As for feeling that I'm not having the mcmarrin way, I don't bite. You guys know that you can cal me on my cell phone to help you guys out with a CR or anything else. And there are more like me who don't mind spending hours on a CR dieing multiple times. I even smile when I lose a level. (Not really) I like to help people out, and I know for sure that Kat does too.<br>
<br>
To make it easier for you. Ask for help, know who to ask, don't be disappointed if you get a &quot;NO&quot;. Even I wouldn't drop group get a port to GD and get your sorry dead ass a sliver of blue back.<br>
Tip number 2: When dead in GD drag your ass to Thurgadin waterfalls. Offer money for a 96%<br>
<br>
Can never make that run, how much i love to. But 10 pm CST time is like 5 am for me.<br>
Now bite me<br>

 As i said though if you want to take offence if you want to flame if you want to bitch or moan or grab your fork and pitch fork and burn me at the stake, well thats life. Though i find it flat out comic that people would instantly make it into another popularity contest. <br>
<br>
Its not and besides with my steller personailty and lack of clone like mentality i would never win <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Being a porter (before PoP) I have been asked numerous times for a port from A to B. If I am soloing or doing a quest I don't have the problem of doing the request straight away, either when asked in a direct tell or on guildsay. However when I am grouped it falls into a different category. If you want to leave your group you have to check if they can continue without you, if not arrange a replacement.(only if its really really urgent) Simple as that. Now I'm not saying Kat should have done that but its how I try to work things out with my guildies and my current group members. If I'm fighting in a place where they need an evaccer(Seb) you can understand I can't leave.<br>
<br>
On the Chardok thing I like to add that when you have 9-10 people in Chardok you be happy to survive the first few steps. Also we had no enchanter, rogue/monk and one cleric. That alone is suicide because of no CC and possible CR's. Our goal were the epic mobs, for that we needed atleast 3 full groups. Sorry to dissapoint you but EQ can be harsh, it's not a stroll tru a nice open area where everyone has space to escape. Chardok is a dungeon with tight places, no room to outrun the mob. A deathtrap.<br>
<br>
I hope we have more discussion like this and try to solve it in a civilised mannor.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Greyleef<br>

I tried to put it out of my mind completely.  Leafdark never mentioned names.  Everyone has a rant every once in a while.  There was no need for arguments to ensue.  Nobody probably would have ever known anything and continued to the secondary part of the message had there not been juicy replies attached.  However I am wondering if anyone at all read the second half of the message.  I have told Leaf that I may not completely agree with the points made but that's about the extent of it.  That was my opinion just as the rant was Leaf's.  We agree to disagree or whatever.  I even said that I didn't think the run would work but I planned on attending, but as I stated, this rant turned bash.  Everyone knows Leaf.  They know her volatile nature at times.  I personally get a kick out of it sometimes.  Everyone also knows that after she blows off steam in-game or out it's over.  That is the nature of most rants.  Get it off your chest and move on.<br>
<br>
I do believe that the run she had planned was a good idea, even though I knew participation would be 0.<br>
<br>
I have talked to Leaf and this rant was not really all about only these situations.  It is about the ongoing attitude that had/has been going on.  Everyone reaches a boiling point eventually.  This just happened to be what put it over the edge.  What happened in examples was not the core of the frustration.<br>
<br>
With all this said yes this is a game.  But to say this is JUST a game is not necessarily accurate.  I've heard MANY people say that they have met some of the best friends in EQ.  When you put that much heart into this and that much time it is actually more than just a game.  If you deny this and disagree then you are lying to yourself.  Of course not all put that much into it, some are only casual players.  I know who is casual and who is not in CM.  <br>
<br>
My goal with this message is this;  Don't discourage rants.  Rants are an effective way for some people to expell their frustrations.  As long as names are not mentioned in-guild and such.  If you have something to say, say it.  If someone else wants to state their opinion, state it.  I'm pretty sure most of us live in freedom of the press countries (with the exception of us US citizens who just like to THINK we do)  Just don't turn your rant, or response to a rant, into a personal attack.  Don't say this Shaman that this 50+ that's first name begins with an S and ends with an O was a meanie to me and sux ass.<br>
<br>
One thing I do agree on is that McMarrin is somewhat less than what it used to be.  To be honest I think there are some real assholes in.  There are also alot of the people I have enjoyed playing the game with the most in McMarrin.  Everyone knows that I will drop almost anything to come assist a fallen or needing guildy or neighbor.  However I have questioned lately whether I want to do this anymore.  There are quite a few people that I've helped that have given no resemblence of appreciation.  It seems that they are almost assumptive that Shamhoo is there to provide them a service.  Those that have done this are blacklisted from my assistance anymore and that saddens me to no end that I felt the need to do that.  I've never felt that way about anyone.  I've even assisted someone on a corpse run that hated me with a passion in-guild.  I saw no need for their anger with me to stop me from being who I like being and helping.  The funny thing is even that person that hated me thanked me.  I never ask for payment or held an &quot;I'll help you if you help me&quot; attitude.  The only thing I expect a thanks for my efforts.  People always laugh because I don't level any faster than I do and have no 60's chars.  Well that's because I've always enjoyed the game because I like to interact with people and help out those that need.  The way things are looking, I'll have more time to level I guess.<br>
<br>
Well this message has rambled on, but I had alot of stuff that has been bothering me lately.  So bash this message too if you want.  Don't matter.  These are just my opinions.  As they say opions are like assholes;  Everyone has one and most of them stink!<br>
