I have done my best to restrain myself from the officer section since I am not an officer.  But at this point I have read through it all and realize that the officers have been defunct for quite some time now.<br>
<br>
Nearly every officer post was junk or was Enantiomer saying, please someone help me deal with this, to which Iizzard would reply &quot;(swear word) man (swear word) this (swear word) that and (swear word) you all&quot;.  None of the other officers said much of anything.  I feel really bad for Enantiomer having to deal with that situation.  <br>
<br>
Danix is your one hope (and Fu if they officer him).<br>
<br>
I make no guarantees about anything on this board at this point.  In fact, it may be a good idea that one of you look into starting a new forum for this guild.  You never know when someday a person may just decide he doesn't want an active guild forum under his user when he is no longer in the guild.<br>
<br>
You should also know that Enantiomer has access to all portions of this forum at this point.  I will not be changing any passwords at this time.  If you all want to read the officer section and verify what I have said, I may even supply you with the password (I haven't decided whether I'll do that yet).<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you decided this couldn't be worked out Redawen and Truely.  I'm also sorry that Enantiomer felt so betrayed and that he had such a lack of support that he felt he had to take the actions that he did.  You did betray him too.  Just by your post offering Beneg a position of officer, it is clear to me that you had made your choice when the two of them started butting heads.  It is unfortunate that the guild didn't have more diversity in its officers at that time.<br>
<br>
You are now without an officer who is an &quot;enforcer&quot; as Fumanjoo once called Enantiomer.  I hope you find someone to replace him in his tenacious pursuit of fairness at any cost or you (both as a guild and as individual guild members) are going to get messed over at every turn.<br>
<br>
I part as a friend.  A disappointed friend but a friend nonetheless.  I don't know that any of you know how serious the consequences of this choice are for me.  Further, I'm not doing it solely because Enantiomer is my brother, I'm doing it because:<br>
<br>
1. Iizzard thought loot was more important that the guild.<br>
<br>
2. Enantiomer thought that was wrong and took aggressive action to stop it even when he thought it was too late.<br>
<br>
3. Redawen and Truely thought protecting Iizzard (and us all apparently) from the big bad Enantiomer was more important than anything else.<br>
<br>
4. Thus, I don't trust Redawen and Truely anymore when it comes to guild matters.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with them as people, they are simply not able to deal well with these sorts of situations and are poor management.  They are poor leaders.  They made their decision not based on facts or the future, they made it simply to spite someone that they were mad at.<br>
<br>
So, this is my final goodbye.  I've really had a good time.  In the past was worth it to me to put time in to managing these boards and trying to solicit use for the boards, but it won't be worth my time to keep them up any longer.<br>
<br>
Hope to see ya IG from time to time.<br>
<br>
And Truely, I apologize for any offense.  I really feel like you cut at me first, but I don't care.  I'd rather be your friend.  I wanted to tell you that IG but you weren't on when I looked.<br>
