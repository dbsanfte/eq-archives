I wonder what my brother is like?&quot; These were the thoughts that occupied Barnebus Goodfight's head as he marched down a small tunnel in the North side of Kaladim, home to the dwarves of Faydwer.<br>
<br>
The voice of Doran, warrior of the Stormguard as well as cousin of Barnebus, snapped Barnebus from his trance like state &quot;Halas be about a weeks journey west, gunna needs tah getcher self accross that ocean tah Antonica, an I wouldna recomend a young lad like you makin such a journey, heh prolly get eatin alive by some goblin or such only half way there!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;well I must try Doran.  I can't just wait for my brother to come to me, for all i know the people who raised my brother might not have told him I even exist, and besid...&quot; Barnebus was cut off as Doran slapped his back, sending him sprawling accross the cave floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;darn it, you do got a point there cuz, oh crud sorry bout that, see what i mean though ye'll gets yerself killed if ya try to go know.&quot; Doran's brows were furrowed in deep contemplation as he helped his cousin to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it Doran? have you thought of something that can help me, or are you just going to tell me how I'm bound to fail?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the best I can do is teach ya ta do a little bit a scrappin an a kickin.  Hell larges thing you ever killed was a damn skunk! but I tell ya what...&quot;  Doran looked down both sides of the tunnel as if to stress the secrecy of his next statement.  &quot;You can come with me into the faydark to attack those damn crushbone if you think you can handle it. An i might even have sumthin that could help ya, by the way what do you have to protect yer self?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;only the spear father made me and my bow and a few arrows&quot; Barnebus informed his cousin.<br>
<br>
They walked down the passageway for another 20 feet untill they came upon the small hut that served as Doran's home.  Inside doran set a kettle to boil and asked his cousin to sit for a while.  After Barnebus had finished his second cup of Kaladim Cafe he set his cup down on the old oak table at which he and Doran sat.<br>
<br>
&quot;well, I think you aught to have somethin I had a wanted ta give to yah for a while but yer dad said I shouldn't.&quot;  Doran got up from his seat at the table and opened a crate that sat next to the stone hearth.  Out of the box Doran pulled a large axe.  At the sight of the mighty weapon Barnebus' eyes began to glow with excitement.  <br>
<br>
&quot;where did ya get this thing?&quot; Barnebus asked as he hefted the mighty weapon.<br>
&quot;Took it from a minotaur last year when my unit was dispatched to help them gnomes down in the steamfont mountains&quot;  Doran explained  &quot;I thinks its a tad too heavy but I thought you could use a good war axe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what to say Doran, I can't thank you enough.  I just wish I had something that would keep me from gettin as many scars as father had.&quot;  <br>
&quot;well I been thinkin of that too, an i thinks i got a solution for you.  In all yer skunk huntin have ye ever comes accross some o' them scarab beetles?&quot; asked Doran.<br>
&quot;yeah, I tend to see plenty of those when I head to the Northwestern hills of the ButcherBlock mountains.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well then ye aught best ta talk to Vacto down there at the Hall of the Stormguard.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Barnebus wondered.<br>
&quot;Cuz, I know this sounds crazy, but some of the guys on the guard say that he can make armor outa them beetles, an heck if you got the armor an' that thar axe ye can join the Stormguard in three days to learn how to not only defend yerself but also how ta kill orcs.&quot;<br>
<br>
The following morning, after a short talk with Vacto Molunel, Barnebus set off to slay some of the Butcherblock mountains' numerous scarab beetles.<br>
Befor long barnebus was laying flat atop the crest of a hill, and looking down upon two large green insects.  &quot;hmmm, i bet i can whup these two little critters, after all they don't look all that fearsome.&quot; Barnebus thought to himself.  Finally, gripping his new axe tightly, Barnebus charged down the side of the hill and caught the two beetles completely by surprize.  <br>
After his first strike glanced off the shell of the first beetle the two reared up on their hind legs and aimed to catch Barnebus with their hideous looking pincers.<br>
Barnebus let a second chop loose, as sweat beeded on his mighty axe swinging arms. This massive blow met with great success, severing the first green insect's front left leg and sent it flying away from its previous owner.  Barnebus let a sly smile cross his face as the beetle attempted to hobble away from him, but befor he could savor his victory any longer a sharp pain shot straight up his body, momentarily stunning him.<br>
Barnebus looked down to see that the second beetle had clamped its pincers arround his right thigh and was rending the dwarven meat that he called his leg.<br>
With a grotesque scream Barnebus kicked as hard as he could, flinging the green terror ten feet away and causing it to land on its back.  With the second scarab imobalized Barnebus ignored the pain from his leg and charged the downed beetle as it struggled in vain to right itself.  Again the axe struck true, cleaving the center of the scarab and coating Barnebus in brown bug guts.<br>
It was then that Barnebus heard the most shrill and chilling noise he had ever heard in his whole life.  He turned to see the scarab he had previously wounded making shrill chittering noises, and worse yet being responded to by the most giant bug Barnebus had ever seen!  <br>
As if to say &quot;pick on someone your own size&quot; the giant scarab bowed its head towards the young dwarf and charged.<br>
It's mighty pincers slashed at Barnebus like scimitars but only found air where the dwarf had been.  Barnebus had managed to duck under the bugs pincers and struck a mighty gash accross its underbelly.  With a mighty squiel the bug lurched and kicked our hero with its hind legs sending him flying to the ground on his belly.<br>
Just as Barnebus had hit the dirt another sharp pain shot through his body only this time the pain eminated from his left arm.  &quot;Argh, did i break me arm from that one?&quot; Barnebus wondered.  Instead he glanced to see the smaller beetle's pincers locked down on his bicep. <br>
Spinning himself on the ground and switching his axe to his off hand, the young warrior not only managed to free himself from the beetle's grasp but did so by decapitating the green bug.  <br>
While Barnebus struggled to remove the head and pincers from its grasp on his arm he saw his giant green nemisis orient itself in his direction, obviously setting itself for another charge.<br>
For a moment the two combatants just stood there in the morning dew of the Butcherblock mountains staring each other down.  <br>
&quot;This is crazyness, ergh, aint no way I can take that ugly mother down&quot; Barnebus thought to himself.<br>
Fingering the raw hide covering of his axes handle he came to see his own death, here in his homeland, at the hands of an overwhelming foe.<br>
While trying to gather his strength Barnebus gritted his teeth and held his weapon high.<br>
The Beetle charged.<br>
Barnebus, startled at the agility of such a large beast did the first thing that came to his mind.<br>
He threw the heavy axe at his attacker and hunched down on his hands and knees, preparing to dodge the beetles pincers.<br>
<br>
His stubby little dwarf legs never had to spring.  <br>
<br>
As Barnebus looked down at the heap of dead bug that lie at his toes he was in awe of his own accomplishment.  He had thought his life was over not less than ten seconds ago and know his future looked long and promising.<br>
<br>
With a little elbo greese and the sharp blade of his axe Barnebus cleaned the entrails fromt he three green plates that were to serve him as armor, how?  He was unsure, but if Vacto's secret was as promising as Doran had led him to believe then Barnebus would gain a unique set of armor to say the least.<br>
<br>
<br>
TO BE CONTINUED...<br>
<br>
I will continue this in a third part, but it's getting late<br>
Goodnight my fellow McMarrin and Goodfight!<br>
