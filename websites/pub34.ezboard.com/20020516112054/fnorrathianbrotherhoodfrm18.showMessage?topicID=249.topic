The crisp green of the grass still sparkles with drops of dew and tiny lavendar flowers spring up reaching for the warm rays of the early sun. Rolling up her bedroll she notices an object hanging from her neck...&quot;where..what?&quot; she grasps the small gem swinging from a small cord around her neck. As the warmth of her hand touches it the gem begins to glow softly and prisims of light illuminate from it swirling around her. &quot;Where did this come from I dont' recall having such a necklace&quot; she contiues to stare at the soft glowing object. Removing it from her neck she is spell bound by its beauty and the peace that comes from it.<br>A crashing sound draws her attention back to the clearing and there standing in the clearing is a beautiful doe with her young fawn.  The long slender legs and white spots of the fawn brought a smile to her face. The doe's head was up and alert with ears perked forward watching her intently.<br>Talking in a very quiet soothing voice the rogue moves steatlhy forward toward the pair. &quot;such beauty is beyond words&quot; she thinks. Gently reaching out she softly lays her hand on the neck of the fawn.  Being of a very young age the deer does not pull back or react in fear as would most.<br>Running her hand gently down is soft brown fur the fawn turns its head into her hand nuzzling it. &quot;Your a pretty thing aren't you 'she coos to it. Raising her head to the doe she extends her other hand to it.<br>Large brown eyes stare into her silver ones as if looking into her soul. Barely breathing she waits for the deer to decide. Never taking its eyes from hers it moves slowly toward her extended hand. Ever so gently Jackii lays her hand on the doe's head and strokes it's sleek neck. &quot;what wonders to experience&quot; she marvels. Sitting cross legged with both around her she enjoys them as they eat of the crisp grass and lick the dew from the flowers. As they enjoy the peace of the clearing Jackii's senses come alert.  Looking around she senses someone or something watching her. Easing into a stand she moves back to her bedroll where her scimatars are sheathed. Removing them she searches the trees and the brush for who or what she feels. As she grabs the handle of the weapon the necklace glows softly again in her hand. Looking into the prisims she again feels the peace come over her. She places it back around her neck not understanding but not questioning. She vaguely recalls her dream of the night and follows her intution. Standing at the ready she again looks for what is there in the woods.  The doe's head also is lifted and sniffs the air for hints of danger. Then puts its head back down and contiunes to graze satisfied it is safe.<br><br>&quot;Well I did come out here to train so should get to it I guess&quot; she thinks. Looking around she spies a tree that looks like it has been used for target practice before the scared bark shows signs of being punctured though not deeply. &quot;forgive me my friend &quot; she communes to it &quot; I will not damage you but need practice a bit of throwing .&quot; with that she lets go of a barge of stars aimed for what looked to be an olds bullseye. Someone had been training here she could tell. the stars landed in a well placed circular pattern around the bulls eye. Feeling the muscles limber up in her arm she then proceeds to move thru a open hand kata taught to her by a very old sensi. Sweat rolls off her brow as she practices the movements repeatedly striving for the perfection that she recalled of the old sensi's movements.  As she goes thur the various motions of striking and feigning , twisting and rolling her mind clears . &quot; ok had fun at the inn last night with Race hmm and we were chased by the Militia like the old days. LOL was such fun. Hmmm I remember hiding in the usual spot but I do not recall getting this necklace. Frowning slightly she stumbles as she attemps a spinning back kick. &quot;grrrrr will never get it right&quot; she grumbles. <br>A burst of laughter interrupts her tirade.<br>&quot;come out I know that laugh&quot; she demands. &quot;how long have you been watching&quot; she further queired.<br>&quot;hmm well let me see you were ummm turning&quot; &quot;oh &quot; she lauches herself at Lumaxima as he steps into view. &quot;hey hey I was just passing by heard all the comotion and well&quot; <br>&quot;you heard? you heard me?&quot; she questions. Sitting down with a crestfallen look on her face she shakes her head. &quot;I have forgotten it all it would seem.&quot; she mumbles.<br>Sitting crosslegged across from her Lum laughs at her. &quot;no you haven't you are just a bit rusty is all&quot; he reasures her. &quot;But judging from the stars you have not lost your touch there. Hmmm how are you with the rest you learned.  What of the rangers ways &quot; he questions her.<br>Smiling evilly at Lum she quips &quot;wanna find out old friend&quot; <br>Standing swiftly she stands and challenges him to their traditional duel. Laughing he quickly joins her and they proceed to practice and hone thier skills with each other.<br>Several hrs later they are both exhausted and fall to the ground to rest a bit. <br>&quot;you have progressed far Jackii&quot; Lum compliments her. She shrugs in response. &quot; I did see you with the deer old friend you have not forgot anything believe me &quot;<br>&quot;Ahh so you were the one I sensed watching me&quot;<br>&quot;only for a bit I was further down the road when I heard you fall just wanted to be sure you were safe&quot; he explains.<br>Scowling she looks to the wood once again &quot; then who&quot; she asks softly. <br>&quot;I saw no sign as I came in &quot;he replied looking to the wood also.<br>&quot;its just a feeling Lum there is someone out there I can feel them. &quot;  looking back at her friend she shrugs and smiles &quot;well if they are looking for trouble they have found it &quot; she giggles. <br>&quot;well time for me to head out rogue take care and be safe&quot; lum stands to leave. <br>&quot;don't be such a stranger Lum just casue you love the woods is no reason to forget your friends&quot; she scolds the ranger as she gently kisses his cheek. &quot;Be well my friend&quot; she waves bye to him as he disappears down the path back toward town. Turning back to the small camp she has thoughts of a crisp cold swim to wash the dust and grime from her. If she only could remember where there was such a place here.<br>Wiping what she could from her she sits on her bedroll up against the old tree again and leans back. The soft vibrations of the acient tree eventually relax her body and she falls into a light sleep. The gem around her neck begins to softly glow again. <p>Jackii  <BR>Rogue on the loose <BR>Norrathian Brotherhood <BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/ujackiitherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jackii the Rogue</A> at: 3/14/02 6:08:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/ujackiitherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jackii the Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Member</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#0066ff>(3/28/02 3:44:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fnorrathianbrotherhoodfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mysteries</span><hr size=1> Another crashing sound wakes Jackii with a start.  Jumping up she stands ready for whatever is coming. There standing before her is a little scrawny man who was shaking and crying and pleading with someone to spare his life.  Silently she steps back into the shadows to assess what is going on. Her first impression is the man is on the run from something...then she hears the booming voice and understands now why he is scared and running.  She had heard of this small time crook in town and how he mistreated his family.  It takes all her will not to jump forward and finish what the man shouting at him started.<br>When she hears of the death of the beautiful doe tears stream down her face. How could this happen she just touched the wonderous creature. And what of the fawn? Her heart breaks at the thought of what this small time poacher had done. Quietly she slips further into the woods leaving the poacher to his fate with whomever it was chasing him.  As she draws deeper into the woods she hears the shattering of a tree and the voice boom out once more. <br><br>“ Do not make me hunt you as you have hunted Smeag!” comes the voice “ for I am Maleck Longbow protector of these woods and you shall not escape me!”<br><br>A shiver of fear courses thru her as she hears the threat.<br>Then a picture of the doe and her fawn flashes in her mind and the rage burns in her again.  Stealthly she slips closer to the Ranger Maleck curiousity drawing her closer .<br>As she peers out between some dense green foilage she gasps in surprise.  There standing before her is the same person who had found her hiding place in town and not revealed it to the militia...a slow smile spreads across her face as she watches the tall handsome ranger nock another arrow and let it fly...graceful in every move backed with power the arrow flew straight and true.  The resounding crash into the small tree casuing it to fall could be heard throughout the forest. The grim look on his chisled face showed his determination to fulfill his threat. Then with no warning his voice softly spoke.<br><br>&quot;Fear not Mlady you are in no danger from me&quot; A look of shok registers on her face. ok she is really upset how did he see her what has she forgotten to do that she is so easily seen. Sitting down rather hard she no longer cares if she is seen or heard. The soft chuckle she hears from him makes her fume all the more. How can she be about her work if every Tom Dick and Harry can see her...this is unacceptable to her. <br><br>&quot;what of the fawn Mlord &quot; she queries him.<br>&quot;did that foul man destroy it also?&quot; her voice is trembling as she awaits the answer.<br><br>&quot;It lives and I will tend to it shortly after I finish this buisness at hand&quot; he reasures her.<br><br>&quot;I would help if you don't mind it is so young and...&quot; tears clouded her throat and eyes again.<br><br>&quot;aye Mlady it is very young and will need much attention.&quot;<br>saying that he moved on in pursuit of Smeg.<br><br>Sitting in the dense foliage she collects her thoughts and begins the search for the motherless fawn. As she rises up the gem around her neck is glowing brightly and catches her eye. Still puzzled at where it came from she touches it and the warmth from it fills her. One more mystery added to her day ....but then she does love mysteries....ah well she begins to search the deep forest in earnest looking for the young fawn. Rays of sunlight filter thru the tall tree brances laying fanciful patternss on the forest floor. Squirrls scamper helter skelter gathering their acorns to take and stash away for the cold time.  The young ones play with each other turning sumersaults as they tackle each other and practice thier jumping from limb to tree.  The tall ferns on the forest floor give cover to small rabbits who have slipped out for a tasty treat of wild radish. &quot;These are the things I must become atuned with again&quot; she thinks as her mind slips back to another beautiful glade. One where the tall old oaks sheltered a small empty home now. Shaking her head a bit she concentrates at the task at hand and again searches for the fawn.  Then suddenly as if the gods willed it she spys the little fellow laying by a old tree  curled up with his head on the ground.  Fearing he was injured she slowly approaches down wind of him to asses his wounds.  As she nears him he raises his head and the large sorrowful eyes tell her all as he gazes directly into her eyes. Reaching out she gently touches his soft wet nose and he does not pull back. Sitting down next to him she gently takes him into her lap and sits and holds the young creature as it contiunes to tremble and tears fall from its large eyes. Holding him and softly petting his head and neck her eyes scan the area and come to rest on the horrible sight he had found.  His mothers skin lay on the ground near by and knowing her scent the young deer had come to its mother. Holding the deer close she promised the little one that if the ranger Maleck failed she would finish the poacher herself.  As the animal settled down and slept a bit Jackii found herself thinking of this ranger.  He was surprising in many ways and the desire to know more began to grow.  Finally standing she carried the young deer back to her camp and found some fresh greens for him and some clear water for him to drink.  Boy she was going to have to get busy and find out what little fawns ate.  Smiling to herself she tidied her small camp and humed a little tune. The fawn perkeds its ears then went back to eating as it sensed no danger.  Well now she had the little one to tend to for a while that would keep her busy for the time being.  And would allow time for her to puzzle out the mystery that had enterd her life.
