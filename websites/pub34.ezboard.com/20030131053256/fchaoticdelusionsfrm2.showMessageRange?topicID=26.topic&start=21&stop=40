You are blaming me that you allowed her to do this? Knowing full well she didn't need it?  You are an officer and have just as much responsibility as me to make sure that doesn't happen.  You should punish Daydrem for getting into a random where she didn't need the item, plain and simple.  You have admitted what she did, and say it is my fault.  <br>
<br>
Don't hold me responsible for the actions of others Redawen.  <br>
<br>
At this point it is clear that all the officers, with the exception of me, knew that those in the random weren't in it for NEED.  I assumed both Iizzard and Daydrem needed the item or hence I would not have gotten a tell from them for the random.  I will take the blame for assuming the intention was need, when in fact it was not.  <br>
<br>
My apologies once again to the guild for not realizing the greed of your officers when the random was done.  All I could do was right the wrong.  Stop trying to take away from the facts that we have, they are posted and linked in the General forums, you can find them at<br>

<br>
The facts at that page are at this point undisputed.  Those who have read it unbiased have stated how crappy it is.  This discussion is about the stated facts of Iizzard and his intent to sell the item.  Feel free to visit the Emarr boards Item Bazaar and see for yourself, it was sold to Burning.  If he has now in hind-sight changed his mind, then I have succeeded at least in part.   <p>Enantiomer <br>

However, you want to continue so here goes...<br>
<br>
Nobody in their right mind believes you sit in Kael all day farming stuff for the guild.  Your intention is to eventually get a silk robe to get your hands on that amulet.  You do good things for people, but your actual intentions foil it.<br>
<br>
As an example.  I know for a fact that while you were doing the other druids this great selfless act of farming armor in UP that your sole intention was to promote your sick internet-love relationship with Katanya.  I know that her name was being put into randoms when she wasn't even on.  Yes on the surface your deeds to appear to be great and wonderful.  However, once you get past the surface, you find that in the end it is all for selfish means.<br>
<br>
You have a rep?<br>
<br>
You guys all know dam well what would happen if I did in fact taken this to the Emarr boards.  You'd be getting flamed like crazy, read the first few posts people made on general and on the item bazaar.  You look like fools.  Anyway, this post is off the subject at hand.<br>
<br>
Don't forget the entire point here lies on the contents of the webpage, try to keep this on the subject at hand.  Beneg has something to say, well he is involved in the deliberate effort for that item to be sold.  That is the only reason I bring it up, he is involved in obtaining it, so his comments are duely biased.<br>
<br>
If this is to be turned into a flame war I'll gladly flame away with you guys, but not where all your friends are.  I'll let outsiders read whats going on, and you guys can do your own damage to your reps.  I really don't have to do anything except show people the truth.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I do hope that the members not involved directly with these events can see what is going on.  I clearly stated that in bringing this issue to light, my time as your officer was limited.  That has come to pass it seems as in some gross way all blame is being pointed towards me.  The other officers are accepting no blame for what happened yet they were there.  None of their posts thus far have contained any information that suggests anything I have shown you is untrue.  At some point in the next day or so, I will provide a comprehensive summary of what all your officers have said.  For the facts are currently undisputed, but they are trying to cover it up with slander about me.<br>

In the movie the ships Commander had issues with the crew. All issues got blown all out of proportion and his paranoia began to take over. Every issue was personal, every issue was an attack. He believed his was maligned, talked about and plotted against. His insanity started small, but in the end it was his undoing. <br>
     To me this whole episode is too close for comfort. For Christ sake give it up, leave the guild if this is too much for you to handle, any and all of you. Let it go, deal with it, get past it, and go on. Can't do it? Walk away. We all have invested time and effort in our characters and the guild, but there is no scoring system, no record is kept of every kindness, slight, mistake and embarrassment. God help you if you do keep track of every petty little thing that goes on in this game. if you do, stop now and maybe you can stop believing everyone is out to get you.  <br>
<br>
     What will be a satisfactory conclusion to all this? An apology? Fine..here's mine. I am sorry for whatever part I played in not being aware of the issue till it was out of hand. I read the board and saw the post about the necklace, but didn't think it was such a big deal. I was in Umbral and talked to Iizzard and it never came up. I didn't watch the roll in fear, I wasn't in and was basking in my tear and talking to rarazu about another tear dropping for him. Fu or Bik expressed a concern with &quot;internal&quot; things in the guild, I figured it must be the necklace and told him &quot;it would all work out&quot;. <br>

<br>
Umm...<br>
<br>
Truely... who are the ones calling names, swearing, cursing and getting emotional.  I am not the one talking about ending friendships.  I really don't see Enantiomer doing it either.<br>
<br>
How does it make joe blow guild member feel to know that their officers just want to &quot;blow this over&quot; and forget about it.  What the hell does that mean for the future?  Don't worry about drops... the officers will take them and then justify why they can just keep them to themselves.<br>
<br>
Sounds like one hell of a good deal for certain people in the guild at the expense of all the others.<br>
<br>
Iizzard just said he apologized so I feel bad posting this, but, again, the officers need to set a precedent to stop things like this.  To my knowledge that hasn't happened.<br>

 Please from the bottom of my heart lets just get past this. Nothing can come from this but heartache. You are all good people and are better than what has happened over the last few days. Let it End now and lets try to get back to the way it was before this. Everyone Please no more personal attacks and No more RL issues need to be brought up. I really wish i could turn back time as i would have not said nothing about any of this to anyone.<br>
<br>

P.S. <br>
I really think if possible that both Enan / Iizzard should come on the raid later and lets start to get thru this. Lets try it for old time sakes. We can get along and i think that all this can bring you 2 and all of us closer together as a guild.
