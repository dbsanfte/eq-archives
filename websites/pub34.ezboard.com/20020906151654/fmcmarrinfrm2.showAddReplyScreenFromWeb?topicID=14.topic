<br>
&quot;and she told thee, 'tis that what ya payin' with laddy. Best be bringin' me a lively one. Dis one ain't gonna last me long.' Haarr haarr, she took in the whelp, but what came out wasn't no less than used tattered armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;fish have no patience and nigh do I without more beer&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ya should have seen da bugger run. Ain't seen anyone ever try stealin' another pie from her again. Long as she carries dat pan o' hers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Music, dance and song accompanied the gathering for it was the end of summer. The end of summer's trading, hunting, and adventure. Ahead was a Northman's winter and the Clan celerbrated under a full moon.<br>
As the night progressed food was eaten, beer drunk, and the dancing finally slowed. For beer was drunk in large quantities by all. Then came a time when campfire tales were told. Heritage pass on, traditions carried foward, prayers sent to the pass elders, and toasts done for fallen comrades not returning from adventuring. Twas then that this story was told and now retold to all of you. I call this one 'Once around the apple tree'<br>
<br>
<br>
Twins were the both. Brothers in arms, brothers in blood. One had the hair of a lion. Wildly about and golden as a new dawn. He be named, Tharsus. His kith, being of an opposite nature, had silken raven color hair, his name being Gaelon. As children both were taught the arts of war by there da, Tullwain. And schooled by their dam, Rytha, in the arts of smithing and tailoring. Together under their da's and dam's tutelage the twins honed their skills. Practicing sword play by morn and working the smithy by mid-day.<br>
<br>
One afternoon while out on a hunt, the brothers found tracks unknown to them. Hunched over the foot print they looked at one another and shrugged simultaneously.<br>
&quot;Its got five toes, but look at the size of da nails,&quot; said Gaelon.<br>
&quot;Be that as it may, we best tell Da.&quot;<br>
With a nod an understanding was reached. Together the young warriors began running back to their home. All of the sudden Tharsus raised his fist and called fer a halt. Gaelon looked over Tharsus' shoulder for they were but a candlemark from home.<br>
&quot;Smoke,&quot; whispered Tharsus.<br>
&quot;Be lookin like it comin' nigh home,&quot; said Gaelon, &quot;listen. Do thy hear metal on metal, like swordplay?&quot;<br>
&quot;Let us be off quickly. I have a bad foreboding about me.&quot; said Tharsus.<br>
&quot;Aye, let us quicken our step, and not dilly dally about here.&quot;<br>
&quot;Wait!?!&quot; said Gaelon. &quot;Tis yon track not a kin to da one we left nigh?&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye, be that da same one. Hurry let us not waste another candlemark discussing tracks&quot;<br>
Together the twins raced down the hills to the glen and there home. As they crested the last hill they saw ruins where once was a sprawling farm spread. A shock of surprise welled up in their chests.<br>
&quot;Gone! Da farm be gone. Listen, mayhaps we be not too late,&quot; said Gaelon.<br>
&quot;Aye, brother. My ears detect faint clatter of shields and swords.&quot; Tharsus looked down to see his Da standing over Dam swinging an axe to fend off a doglike foe. &quot;Tis Da. He be needing our help. Come.&quot; Armed and armored, both descended battlecrys aloud.<br>
With the last of his waining strenght leavin' rapidly Tullwain made a final series of attacks, felling three foe in the effort. But three more took there places, and he knew all would be lost. He begain his death song as another foe tasted his axe falling at his feet. The last spasms of life coming to a close as Tullwain raised his axe high and brought down all his anger, all his greif into this one swing cleaving a dog monster in two.<br>
&quot;Aaarrgh!&quot; screamed Tullwain. For he was not as young as he used to be, and the other creature's saw the opportunity to strike. With a spear embedded in his side he turned to look down at his beloved. Turning only to see that she had been wounded and lay unconscious. Switching stances he stood over her body and prepared himself for the end.<br>
&quot;Love, love tis not lookin pretty now. I hope da lads find safety in thy woods,&quot; said Tullwain at his fallen life mate. <br>
&quot;Nigh be our last breathe upon Norrath,&quot; gasped Tullwain between gritted teeth. Blow after blow he blocked and countered only when an opprtunity presented itself. A dog charged in and impaled himself upon his axe allowing the rest of his pack the oppertunity to attack him. Tullwain now knew the end to be at hand, when he heard a battlecry.<br>
&quot;Rrraaaaghhh!!!&quot; the twain shouted. Tharsus blocked a mortal blow that would surely have slain his Da, while Gaelon swung in a long arc felling the wouldbe killer. Together they swung the tide of the battle leaving many a foe slain or wounded. Feeling overpowered and helpless against the pair the creatures of dark began fleein'. Tharsus started to chase wanting to avenge this wrong brought upon his family, but Gaelon shouted, &quot;Nay, ye help be needed here. Quickly before we lose our Dam. Revenge comes later, I assure thee. Their days are numbered.&quot;<br>
And so began the healing process. Gaelon ran off to get healer from town. Tharsus paced, paced and paced some more. All the while grippin' his pummel white knuckeled, curses under his breathe. Bah I should be followin' der tracks back while da tracking be good.<br>
&quot;Shush ya heart, 'n' quit ya pacin'. I'z ole 'n' wound'd, aye, senial soon if ya don't quit stompin' about.&quot; From the corner came Da's gruff voice. Tharsus whirled ta look da ole coot over and sheepishly took a stool near the fireplace. Wit da rod he stirred red coals and gazed within lost in his own thoughts.<br>
&quot;I've somethin' to tell thee and if ya quit ya pacin' I'll collect me thought and tell ya,&quot; said the ole man with a sigh and a shake of the head. &quot;Twas the twain the be lookin' fer, you and your blood. I thought we more time to prepare ya two, but no evil knows no patience. Hmmm, where to start?&quot;<br>
&quot;I thing the beginin' be a good spot,&quot; Tharsus replied as his brother returned with a tall elder named Brack Woodshifter. Brack carried a satchel of one shoulder and a walkin stick in the other. His greying hair flowing down past his waist, and his beard carefully trimmed covered his abdomen. He wore a faded green cloak covered in leaves of the fall season.<br>
&quot;Tull, ye be needin' me assistance or is this lad just playin' a prank. My, my ya do need me,&quot; proclaimed Brack as he hurried over to the cot where Rytha lay. &quot;Lad, had me a pail of water. And, start the fire I be needin' lots of boilin' water.&quot; Tharsus started outside as Gaelon followed with a small wooden pail. <br>
&quot;I got da wood fer da fire, ya go to the stream for the water.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sit and listen me lads,&quot; Tullwain said with a sigh, &quot;I have a tale to tell and ya be smart to listen well. First, both of ya not be our seed, we found ya both and raised ya like our own.&quot;<br>
&quot;What!?!&quot; the twain spoke in unison.<br>
&quot;Aye, Ya damman and me were walkin' da path back from town and lo' there be two babes in da path. No signs of thee real parents. We found these on ya...&quot; He walked to his bed and dug underneath to pull out his chest. As he began to rummage inside the boys looked at one another, stunned and awed. He returned with two items in his hand; a long tail feather of an eagle, and a short spear with a deep blue stone fer a point. He handed the feather to Gaelon and Tharsus received the spear which looked tiny in his big hands. Gaelon inspected his treasure and marveled at its beauty. With an upstroke he let a glide the air as he'd seen the birds do. Downstroke he felt his feet lift off the ground, if for just a second. Tullwain took his turn and stare in awe at his son, Tharsus looked at his spear and he like the blue tip. He raised it over his head and parried, swung an arc, spun and thrusted into an imaginary foe. Tullwain again was amazed for the spear began to grow in length, now it was the size perfect for Tharsus. As Tharsus stood and relaxed, the spear again became a short spear.<br>
&quot;LO! Outside the both of ya,&quot; Brack said with a hint of impatience. &quot;Tis ya ma I be workin' on and with all the commotion how do ya expect me to do my best. Now get get!&quot;<br>
Outside the three were chased. Da looked over his two sons and took a heavy breath. <br>
&quot;Follow.&quot;<br>
Down the path the three strode the twins behind their Da. Both heavy of heart for they knew not where this may lead them. Da stopped and turned off the path into the woods. He took no more that ten strides and stepped into a grassy clearing. Around the clearing stood four trees one east, a pine, one south, a cedar, one to the west, an aspen, and one to the north, this one the three could not place. It wasn't any tree they had seen before, its leaves the color of violet and its trunk a shade of grey. In the center of the clearing was a sapling of a tree.<br>
&quot;It be hear I found thee,&quot; he said with a sniffle. In his mind he recalled the babes one with raven hair and the other a blonde mane. Neither cried or complained, but contently babbled excitedly. *Care for these babes and shelter them. Treasure and cherish this gift, for they have a prophecy to fullfill...* Yes, the voice of the woods. It still scared him as it did that day. A voice that didn't seem to come from any one place but all around him. As I pick up the children, oh my. It was like someone lookin' inside my heart, my soul. I musta been worthy for I felt only warmth as I do now.<br>
&quot;I have brought them before ya,&quot; he said, &quot;They have questions to ask thee, will you answer them?&quot;<br>
*Aye...* said several voices at once.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Lookie me. Tis, someone elses turn at the fire.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bahh!!&quot; &quot;Shiester!&quot; &quot;Bugger me!!!&quot; &quot;Hurmph!&quot;<br>
&quot;Finish ya tale ya arse. Ya can't leave a tale unfinished&quot; <br>
&quot;Aye, but I can and will this time. We seem to have drank all the mead, eaten all the bears, and well some of us have women...Hahaha. I call this a night.&quot; As I stagger off to my bedroll. And with this I leave all wantin'... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/ubaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baeron</A> at: 11/15/01 1:31:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub34.ezboard.com/bmcmarrin.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wolflight>Wolflight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/14/01 6:27:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/fmcmarrinfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Campfire tale #2</span><hr size=1> OMG!!
