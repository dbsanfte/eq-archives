	Need to gain levels fast?  We all know about tinkering (getting
	a higher level character to heal you while you fight a high
	level monster), but here is another method sent in by
	Dark P-Chan :<P>
	<I>
	If a high level magic user casts root on something that cons blue to him then his low 
	level magic using friend can blast the monster away as the high level person keeps the 
	monster at bay.<P>
	Example: Mr. X is a level 12 wizard, he casts root on a rabid grizzly bear. 
	Then Mr.Z (a level 6 wizard) Blasts the grizzly away with his most powerful spells, 
	While Mr.X keeps the bear rooted to the ground. When Mr.Z has finaly unloaded his mana 
	about 3 times the grizzly bear will be dead and he will have deliverd ALL the physical 
	damage so he will get ALL the exp and gain levels SUPER fast!<P></I>
	Thanks for the update guys.<P>

	I have a large update this morning, which is some more information regarding
	the dupe bug found below, it's really long, so be patient :<P>
	<I>
	The crashed zone duping method does work just remember the following
	things :<P>

	1. Only Stackable Items and Money can be easily duped.<BR>
	2. Items have a unique ID so you can not have the same item in the same
	zone at the same time (One of the items will go poof)<P>
	Thats means one of four things if you wish to keep the item or profit
	from it:<P>

	1. Give the item to another one of YOUR characters so it doesn't go
	poof.<BR>
	2. Sell the item to a vendor and buy it back.  This clears the ID<BR>
	3. Sell it to another character and profit from it!  (Who cares if it
	poofs from their Inventory aftrer you've got your gold)<BR>
	4. Change the item in some way.<P>

	Instructions on how to dupe:<P>

	1. Find a buddy to help dupe with.<BR>
	2. Find a downed zone.<BR>
	3. Wait for a save.<BR>
	4. Have your buddy gate/zone to a up zone with the items you want duped.<BR>
	5. Zone to the crashed zone.<P>

	Poof you are back to your last save point with your items.<P>

	Tips:<P>
	1. Crossing a zone line saves your character<BR>
	2. Zones with more people take longer to shutdown (I prefer to use the
	West Commonlands / Highpass Hold zone line for scheduled duping)<P></I>

	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	
	<b><font color="ffc906">April 13th, 1999 -</b></font>
	I have a small update today, sent in by Omicron 2000, who says :<P>
	<I>
	 If you cast or someone casts 'bind affinity' on you, and you then cast 'gate' spell, you will appear at
	your OLD bind point! This holds true for at least the first time you cast gate, but after that (or when you
	change zones?) 'gate' spell will transfer you back to your new bind point.
	This 'feature' has some interesting possibilitys. For example, you can get binded at your favorite hunting
	spot, gate back to your 'home' for supplies, bind yourself to your home spot, then gate back to your hunting
	spot!
	</I>
	<P>
	I've also received word back regarding the dupe bug found below that it does indeed work, so
	if you are lucky enough to be near a crashed zone, go for it.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>


	<b><font color="ffc906">April 12th, 1999 -</b></font>
	Hmmm .. A possible working dupe bug?  I'll let you guys be the judge.<P>
	<I>
	You can dupe items if a zone is crashed.<P>

	1. Simply hand off the items you want dupe.<BR>
	2. Zone to the Crashed zone.<BR>
	3. You will appear at your last saved point with your all the items you
	had at you last save.<P></I>

	For those of you that don't know, there is a webpage out there that I do 
	believe is the best EQ site around, no, it's not the EQVault, not by a long
	shot, it's called the <A HREF="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">EQ'Lizer</A> and
	it has the best information dealing with Quests, Equipment and other things.
	So go ahead and check it out at <A HREF="http://www.gameznet.com/eq">
	http://www.gameznet.com/eq</A>.<P>
	One more thing, it looks like our pals over at Dr. TwisTers EQ bugpage
	have decided to close down.  I'll tell you one thing about EQ, it's not
	like UO as far as bugs go, the developement team really has it's shit 
	together, so I can understand why they decided to close up shop.<P>

	I'm a stinking bastard .. After sitting in the same chair since late Friday night
	I've finally gotten around to airing myself out and taking a shower ..<P>
	I do have a quick update sent in by 357, which is a quick easy way to max 
	skills, such as sense heading :<P>
	<I>
	You can bind multiple things to one key.  This can be used to automatically build certain abilities.  For example:  Put a shortcut to "sense heading" on the left "user defined" box.  These definitions can be bound to key's on the keyboard.  Go to options--keyboard and bind the "user defined x" (x being the user defined slot you put sense heading in) to one of your turn or move forward keys (if you use right and left arrows bind a right or left arrow to the user defined x).  Now, whenever you turn or move forward you practice sense heading.  
	</I>
	<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">April 8th, 1999 -</b></font>
	Looks like Verant is pretty serious about abusive users, according to EQVault, John happily
	banned several players for "blatant and repeated" bug abuse.  Heh .. Good thing they
	don't know my nick .. Suckerz ..<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">April 7th, 1999 -</b></font>
	This was sent in today by Itchy, who says :<P>
	<I>
	Its true that the one who dealt the most damage to a monster will get exp and loot. BUT the "damage counter" will be set to zero when:<P>
	- the character zones<br>
	- the character logs out<br>
	- the character dies<P>

	Now here's how to exploit this:
	Get a high level buddy and let him reduce a big monster's health to almost 0. Then he must zone (e.g. by casting gate) and let you deliver the final blow (preferrably by a spell because melee combat can still be dangerous). When you kill the monster both exp and loot are yours!
	</I>
	<p>
	As always, this information is never verified, so you guys will need to check it
	out for me.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">April 7th, 1999 -</b></font>
	It looks like the "Free and Easy experience" bug below doesn't
	work at all .. Sorry for the misinformation, but all of this
	information does come in via e-mail and I never verify it
	due to a busy schedule.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">April 6th, 1999 -</b></font>
	It seems a lot of people are getting banned using safe zones in the
	game.  For those of you that don't know what a safe zone is, go
	to <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/everquest/eq-indx.html">Dr. TwisTers</a> page
	and read about the tower bug.  Basically they will ban you if you
	start to whack on monsters from a area where the monsters can't
	get at you.<P>
	We do have this update sent in this morning sent in by Foolio, I myself
	don't think this actually works, but you guys can go ahead and give
	it a try and see what happens :<P>
	<I>
	Free and Easy experience: All you have to do is make a dummy character, drop the guild note in a safe
	place. Log out, then come back with the character you want to boost experience with, pick up the guild note
	and turn it in to the appropriate NPC. You'll get the nifty music along with free experience!! Do it as much
	as you like!!!

	I hope everyone had a great weekend .. I spent the weekend running my 
	little woodelf ass all the way from one end of the world to the other
	end and then back again .. They should put a little "Kal Ort Por" action
	into this game :)<P>
	I have a update send in by The Seeker, who says this :<P>
	<I>
	I learned this the other day when someone asked me... "do you want to learn 
	dwarf?" ... I said "sure" so he invited me into his group, and started 
	scrolling a LOT of text in dwarvish... within a couple of seconds I had 
	increased my skill.   (unfortunately my connection was bad that night so I 
	never got better ...)   an easy way to do this, is to re-define 6 of your 
	socials, as you can put in 6 commands (or sentances) in each one, invite the 
	person you want to teach into your group, switch your speech mode to "group" 
	and drag your 6 re-defined socials into your hot-key box.  then just hit "1 2 
	3 4 5 6" over and over again until  one or both of you are sick of seeing all 
	that text...
	</I>
	<P>
	Sounds easy to do .. As always, this information is never verfied so you guys
	will have to check it out for me.<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">April 3rd, 1999 -</b></font>
	I'm still here!  It's been awhile since I've last updated, I've been
	extremely busy in real life.<P>
	Here's a nice little update sent in by Urgit, who tells us this :<P>
	<I>
	Not really important but cam improve your vision... if it is raining and you find it hard to see leave
	the zone and come back it won't be raining anymore!</I><P>
	Thanks Urgit .. And we also have this sent in by The Seeker, which is
	a good use for the /quit bug below :<P>
	<I>
	If you get on top of the wall, or land form and you already
	have your combat skills up... you can use the "tower bug" in places 
	where there might not be any accessible towers.</I>
	<P>
	For those of you that don't know, the "tower bug" is basically when
	you are in a safe area up high, and attack creatures below using
	magic/arrows without them being able to get at you to cause you damage.
	This isn't really a good idea for newbies because your combat skills
	will not raise, so you can end up messing up your stats.  But as
	The Seeker says, this is a good thing to do if you already have
	your combat skills up to a respectable level.  It's also a easy
	way to make some quick cash.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>
	

	<b><font color="ffc906">March 31st, 1999 -</b></font>
	The following information was sent in to me by The Seeker, and
	is basically just a idea.  If anyone can think of how
	this information can be used any other way, please
	let us know :<P>
	<I>
	I have discovered
	an inherent flaw with the way that the servers save coordinate data when a
	player exits the game using the /quit command.  (it may happen with the /exit
	and camping too... but I've not tried)  anyway, it seems that the server
	rounds your x, y, and heading coordinates to make them integers before they
	are saved (probably to save on the amount of space needed to save all those
	peoples info)  now, when x or y are  positive, they will round fairly
	regularly, but when they are negative, they are rounded toward the origin at
	least one whole unit... now I'm sure you're asking "what does this mean to
	me?"  so I'll tell you.  it means, that if a wall, or an object is between you
	and the origin (if at least one of your coordinates is negative) and you use
	the /quit command while standing right next to it, you will  a) be put on top
	of the object or wall when you log back on.  b) (if the wall or object is as
	tall as the zone) be put INSIDE the wall or object when you log back on (don't
	worry you can walk right through the polys from the inside) or c) you will be
	very unfortunate, get clipped to the top of the zone, and fall to your death
	(very rare, but if you do it JUST right... it can happen [I know])  this
	allows you to get to interesting places, cast spells on things that can't find
	you (they will run around really confused like) and maybe do some other more
	useful stuff... who knows...</I><P>
	If anyone can think of a good way to use this information, I'm all ears.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	<b><font color="ffc906">March 31st, 1999 -</b></font>
	I have a update this morning about the /corpse bug,
	sent in by The Seeker :<P>
	<I>
	it is known by almost all that this is VERY useful for dragging your body out
	of dangerous places ... but how many of you knew that it does not affect
	invisibility spells?  that is to say, that it's MUCH easier to drag your
	corpse away from say, a orc encampment full of orcs, when they can't see you,
	and since you don't become visible when you use the /corpse command the only
	thing keeping some of you from an easy corpse retrieval is a lack of spell
	casting friends.  ;-)
	</I>
	<P>
	Thanks for the information, also if anyone is interested in writing a strategy 
	guide about their various race/class, please feel free to contact me

	For those of you that are looking for similar sites like this, I 
	encourage you to check out 
	<a href="http://www.drtwister.com/everquest/eq-indx.html">
	Dr. TwisTer's EverQuest's page</a>.  I'm sure most of the UO
	people that read this page will know who he is already.

	information, so we can get the information out to you,
	the user, more quicker and easier.<P>
	Once more thing, <b>I'm not the offical EverQuest site!</b>
	I get a buttload of e-mail's everyday from people who for some whacked
	out reason confuse me with the offical site.  I am seriously 
	confused on how they can even make that connection, but there's still
	a buttload of people that are doing it.  I saw the EQVault post something
	similar earlier this week regarding the same thing.  So for the last time,
	please go to <a href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a>
	to lodge your complaints.  Note to Verant : Every e-mail I get is always some
	pissed of customer of yours that can't connect, etc.  I'm forwarding these

	<I>
	If you corpse is in a dangerous place, and you need to drag it out while monsters
	are chasing you, you can set a hotkey for the /corpse command, run while

	A possible working dupe bug?  Well, you will have to find out for yourself, this was just
	sent in by King Killer, who says :<P>
	<I>
	This is a variation on the already stated non working dupe bug. It is 
	also not easy and require very good timing and patience.  this requires 
	four things a pet, a zone boarder, a buddy, and a guard. position 
	yourself near the zone boarder, item in hand, tell your pet to /pet 
	guard here. the pet will attack your buddy. the guard seeing this will 
	then come after your pet and then after you. while the guard is turning 
	your pet into paste drop your item on the ground. as soon as you see the
	guard headed your way, make haste into the zone boarder. Unlike spells 
	and swords of normal PC's the zone boarder does not restore you to 2 hp 
	after being killed in it and then drop you out the other side. a guard 
	is able to kill you while the server is loading. the server then resets 
	you to your last save point item in your inventory. (make sure you know 
	when the server makes it's game saves) </I>
	<P>
	Sounds like it might take some hard work to make it work, but you never
	know.  As always, this information is never verified, so you guys will

	<a href="http://www.eqvault.com/">EQVault</a> message board, almost everyone else
	is having the same problem.<P>
	But I do have another update today, sent in by a Anonymous reader, who says :<P>
	<I>
	While killing male lions if you constantly hit the auto attack key (A) while fighting
	them, you will take no damage and the lion will die faster.</I><P>
	As always, this information comes in second hand, so you guys will need to 
	verify this for me.<P>
	Later,<BR>

	I have a small update tonight, it seems a lot of bugs are based on the
	strafe movement key (ctrl for those who don't read the manual), 
	causing a few side effects such as this one sent in by a 
	Anonymous player :<P>
	<i>While using the sneak skill, you movement speed is supposed to be reduced
	to around 1/4th of running, but if you use the strafe key, you can move 
	at full speed while sneaking.</i><P>
	As always, try it out, and let me know if it works or not.  Also look for a full
	site makeover sometime this week or next.<P>
	Later,<BR>
	Baal<P>

	Want to walk around invisible without using magic?  Well according to
	GreyKnight you can do this if you have the hide skill, here's the
	scoop :<P>
	<i>First setup a hotkey for the hide skill, next, press that button twice
	in rapid succession, you should hide and then immediately unhide, now once the
	button cycles in again, hit it again twice.  If you did it quickly enough, you
	should be invisible and be able to move around without anyone seeing you.</i><P>
	Try it out, and let me know if it works.<P>
	Later,<BR>

	Another night, another non EverQuest night for me since I can't seem to connect.  
	But enough of me whining .. Here's some information passed on by Logos, 
	who has a few hints for a fun time being a little bastard :<P>

	<i>Even though it is possible to walk through players, there is a moment when
	contact results with some displacement of the character being struck.  This being
	said, it's sometimes possible to "push" a number of hapless Woodelfs off of their
	city platforms and elevators.  They must be standing near the edge, and make
	sure you nudge them with little speed, or else you'll just fly through.</i><P>

	How evil .. Well here's another little hint on having some more fun being
	a little bastard :<P>

	<i>If you lure a large or small group of NPC's (attach a camp, etc) and make sure
	you have a good distance between you and them, you can run them through an unsuspecting
	party of players, a lot of the times, since the distance between you and the attackers
	is so much, the NPC's will attack the group you've ran through.  It surprises the
	hell out of the people resting and mediating.</I><P>

	Anyways, it's not really a bug, but still a hell of a lot of fun to do.<P>

	Later,<br>

	Argh .. Again .. I can't seem to connect to the servers at all now, keeps saying
	'chat.everquest.com' is down.  Connectivity right now for me is great, so don't
	go saying that it is my ISP, since I am actually the man in charge of the network
	at my ISP.  The damn servers go down more than a porn star.<p>
	Anyways, if you want to here me rant, you can go <a href="rant.html">here</a>.<p>

	Argh .. The packet loss issue is really beginning to irritate me .. I understand that it
	is the first week and all, but as they say, you never get a second chance to make a good 
	first impression.<p>
	Anyways, I have a update on outrunning monsters and other assorted nasties, this was 
	sent in by Xeph :<P>
	<I>Since EverQuest resolves movement in full vector quantities.  The effect and
	usefulness of this is if you strafe while running, you run faster, and at a bit
	of a angle.  Another way of losing monsters is the tree'ing tactic.  You simply run
	a tight semi circle around a trunk as you are fleeing, and if you are lucky and leading
	them by a decent amount, they will run up the tree causing them to lose you.</I><P>
	Thanks for the info, and as always, this information always comes second hand and
	will need to be verified by you guys.<P>
	Later,<BR>

	<b><font color="ffc906">March 16th, 1999 -</b></font>
	Well it's finally here, the offical release date for EverQuest.  Starting today, things
	will hopefully pick up quickly.<P>
	Later,<br>
