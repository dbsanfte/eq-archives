    <b>Origins Cancelled!</b><br>
    <font size=1><b>Date:</b> Wednesday, March 21 @ 22:00:53 EST<br><b>Topic:</b> Announcements<br><br>

    From the Official Origin's <a href="http://boards.uo2.com/cgi-bin/showthreaded.pl?Cat=&Board=Discussions&Number=43261&page=0&view=expanded&sb=5">Message Board</a>
<p>

The news about ORIGIN's cancellation is true. I wish I could say this in a way that makes everyone suddenly understand the reasonings behind it, but that way doesn't exist, so I'll simply say I'm sorry. To all the fans who have been waiting for ORIGIN, I'm sorry.

    After taking a long hard look at where we are, and how much will still be needed to get us to the polished shape we would need to achieve for ship, we have come to the decision that, instead of putting those resources into a game that competes so closely with the still-growing Ultima Online, we need to dedicate everything we have to expanding and supporting UO. This will enable us to concentrate on supporting the 230,000 players who are already in UO, rather than dividing our resources between the game that is still growing and one that would run directly alongside. By pouring everything we have into UO, this opens up possibilities that UO has simply never had before now.
<p>
Again, I know this is a surprising move, and I know that some of you will understand that the gaming industry can be quite volatile. The UO2 community has been one of the brightest and passionate communities I've worked with, and I look forward to seeing many of you in UO.
