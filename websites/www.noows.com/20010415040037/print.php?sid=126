    I think you should tell us about you :)
Since your *g* quitting EQ now, what are you going to be doing, or once the suspensions over are you coming back to the game?<br><br><br>
    <br><br>
    I personally like pizza, I like playing that stupid addictive game called Gems too ;( I played it for too long and I have begun to think it's a mind control device by Verant and they are only getting you to play it so they can raise the rates to make up for all the people quitting... and no one will know because thier all addicted to /gems.  I think /gems is what inspired me to start writing you now and asking you about what you do, but I'm not sure.<br><br>

I've noticed you have alot of human's in your guild, and I must say that is the most uber race you really can be, personally, just as a question did you watch the lady human's swim when you we're in underwater zones? More importantly what is your feeling on gnomes?<br><br>

What do you do outside of EQ? I think everones curious to that, I also think people want a picture, yes I do!<br><br>

Now I bet you've read only the first paragraph and then if I'm lucky you went and scrolled down to now. and basically you don't have to reply on the message board but I EXPECT an e-mail mister! =o) or you can just write me off as some crazy drunk lady =o( that would work too.<br><br><br><br>
