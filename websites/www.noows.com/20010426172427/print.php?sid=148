I don't know if any of you have the time to sit and read these, and if not it's understandable, but let me tell you they are good articles in my opinion and state some of the feelings that I have toward Everquest and the way it's changing.  I've always been a skeptical person, and it was on my mind when I started playing this game that it wouldn't be around forever.<p>

    I don't know how old the members that come to this page, and play this game are in RL, I'm a mere 20 y/o, and I loved this game a lot when I started playing, and still loved it a lot as I grew and gained power, but seeing the way that things are going really makes me think twice about paying this money grubbing, corporate sack of shit company another dime, they DO NOT listen to their player base, they DO NOT offer any sort of "customer support", you tell them there is a problem, they get some annoying little prick named Gordon Wrinn to come along and piss you off, and make you blue in the face because you've seen first hand how things are changing for the worse, and all the while this guy who has no trust from the customers is telling that what you are seeing "isn't how it is...", he then procedes to argue with you, getting hot tempered, and making himself even MORE unlikable.<p>

I liked playing this game more when it was Everquest, not some idiots idea of "balance" who knows nearly nothing about the game itself.  I like being able to talk to my friends, and accomplish things with my friends in the game, but where is it all going?<p>

I think that severe changes need to be made to change things.  The game has lost what makes it a game, fun.  The most fun that I have now, is getting money with my main character and giving it to a newbie char that I just made and twinking him, I know there is still a lot in this game I have not see, and I know that there is a lot in this game that I will never see, but to me if Verant is just going to keep fucking over their customer base then I personally feel its time to move on to something bigger and better.<p>
