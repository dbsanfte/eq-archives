    Quick Background: Fighting in Western Wastes with some friends last week (Klandicar and Zlandicar), I died, had to log, missed my res opportunity. 
Couple days not playing, zone brought down in between then. Spent a good amount of time trying to get back there (P.S. - no-one in Velious is helpful, unless they need a res of course, then i gotta bend over backwards for them..NO MORE !). 
Anyway, the jist of this story: without the help of Jena, Miir, Moglit and Millie from FoH, my corpse would have faded and i would have been one pissed off Cleric =p.
<br><br>
/bow to the four of you
<br><br>
Just wanted to say thanx again and if there's anyway I can ever help out, dont hesitate to ask.
<br><br>
Cheerz,<br><br>
