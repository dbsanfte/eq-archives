    <b>So I said to the Dragon, What's in it for us?</b><br>

    <br>   There was a very cool concept that had a shot in "Scars of Velious". 3 dominant factions, 3 cities, 3 rulers, all at war and the player takes sides. Unfortunately, that's as far as the balance or serious thought on that idea got.<br><br>

<br><br>
    <br><br>
    Although the paths may be different, it is up to Verant to ensure that each path they 'promote' can enjoy the game equally no matter their play styles. Well sad to say even if we discount dwarves as being the starter faction. A blind monkey balanced the other two. I'm about to prove Dragon faction needs major overhaul and upgrade, Yes, UPGRADE. (verb. to enhance, to make better, to uberfy)<br><br>

Anyone who chooses not to go Giant allied after reading this or believes Verant will be able to come even close to balance in the next year will also really enjoy hunting Sirens Grotto. Cheers!.
<br><br>
The following, is a list of notable differences between the SoV factions. For most of the categories I will list points under pro-giant faction or pro-dragon/dwarf faction. I group dragon/dwarf together as they really have no effect on each other (dragon vs dwarf) and both together tends to be the anti-giant choice. These are all the reasons i have heard.. or can give.. to chose one faction or another. Before anyone else says it. Yes i'm jelouse, yes I could switch, that doesnt change a thing.
<br><br>
Broken down by rough category
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Convenience:
<br><br>
Normally, you’d send anyone who called EQ play convenient to the loony bin. But here's some reasons just for ease of play someone might choose for or against each faction.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Dwarf Faction<br>
- Default faction.. no real faction work necessary. <br>
- Not a bad city to work with near the early parts of Velious.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Giant Faction<br>
- Well laid out city, reasonably central to Velious. <br>
- Dragon circles more dangerous (wuoshi)(cobolt drakes)<br>
<br><br>
For those Allied with Dragon Faction<br>
- city spread out (huge) , spend a lot of time running between vendors and bank.<br>
- Travel is easier not having to worry about Wuoshi / WW dragons that see invis (other mobs still kos), <br>
- arguably less hunt competition (due to more people going giant at the moment).
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Armor 
<br><br>
I list Armor comparisons separate from other items due to armor being the most visible improvement a character can get and therefore often the most sought after for pride. A few starter points for the planar (PoH, PoF) comparable armor sets.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Giant Faction.<br>
- Planar level armor is available or improved on all across Velious (royal velium, sentry, guardian, dragonhide sets), <br>
- SoV is seen as an alternative to the planes armor for those people lvl 40+.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Dragon/Dwarf Faction. <br>
- No armor of this level exists. A person would have to discard one of the anti-giant alliances to hunt planar armor. The two obvious highest level factions are dragon / giant therefore becoming anti-dragon and anti-giant is not
really an option. Only royal velium out of the 4 sets is an option.
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Mid Level Armor
<br><br>
Points concerning mid level armor. For this discussion i consider mid level armor the kunark items as well as the drops in Plane of Growth or the Thurgadin armor quests.
<br><br>
Drop rates? While PoG and Thurg are both open to non-giant guilds, if using Thurg as an alternative to save PoG faction you’re definitely going to progress slower due to gems needed, and probably be forced anti-giant.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Giant Faction:<br>
- You go to PoG (druids / rangers out of luck).. or back to Kunark if you want mid level armor, <br>
- You can get Dragonhide which is close in some cases
<br><br>
For those Allied with Dragon/Dwarf faction:<br>
- Don’t have to ruin faction in PoG to get Thurg / kunark level armor. <br>
- Druids and rangers can actually get Thurg armor unlike PoG.
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Top Level armor.
<br><br>
Top level armor is the armor quested from pieces found either in the Halls of testing or in the West or North wings of the Temple of Veeshan. Or any better items.
<br><br>
Drop rates?? I personally don’t believe its significantly different between sides of ToV. Not a reason to choose one or the other. If you hunt any side regularly you’ll get the armor faster than you can find gems for it. (someone balance the drops per class that can use them though! ARGH LEATHER AGAIN!)
<br><br>
For those allied with Giant faction:<br>
- The Best melee armor, arguably the best priest armor too. (majority of classes)<br>
- Kael armor tends to be higher ac, higher hp, and usually better resists.<br>
- Ancient Wyvernhide available in ToV north
<br><br>
For those allied with Dragon faction:<br>
- The Best Intelligence caster armor, Want to talk about how much 'better' caster gear helps you or your guild? compared to say a warrior bracer?<br>
- Skyshrine armor tends to be higher primary stats, higher mana.
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Quests:
<br><br>
Quests comparisons are usually done by what the quest rewards. Not always by how tough they are (if people argue difficulty of quests, it means the items are closer to balanced.) To keep this short i didn’t want to discuss individual items but give a summary instead. This is one of the biggest reasons i hear people giving for choosing one faction or another. "The quests are better"
<br><br>
For those allied with Giant faction:<br>
- Wide range of quests in Kael, very nice items ( I don’t care to list them all, someone else might try), some of which can be killed for (frostbringer), (coldain skin gloves) but not most of the best, and in general, questing the items can be done quicker than trying for random drop.
<br><br>
For those allied with Dragon/Dwarf faction:<br>
- Coldain insignia ring. hammerfall bracer. Robe of benevolence, Bracer of benevolence.<br>
Not much else that isn’t equaled or bettered in Kael, or by an anti-dragon drop elsewhere.
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Hunting Content:
<br><br>
This comes under the heading of "What do you want to do tonight?". options, interesting kills, wanting loot from X mob. Places an allied guild can hunt without hurting their faction. (and in some cases improving faction)
<br><br>
For those allied with Giant faction:<br>
- Thurgadin (dain), Skyshrine (yelinak), <br>
- Western wastes (many wandering dragons, good drops),<br>
- Wuoshi, Kalorek'dar.<br>
- All areas of ToV are hunt-able for drops , Named drop exceptional items.
- PoM.
<br><br>
For those allied with Dragon/Dwarf faction:<br>
- Kael (tormax / statue… I don’t consider Avatar a killable benefit) - note kael drops the pog equivalent armor, no royal velium/sentry/guardian equivalent, not listing other specific drop comparisons.<br>
- No comparable hunting to the various scattered dragons <br>
- Sleepers is now available to CoV but with 2/3 less options for questing the key, <br>
- East wing of ToV only, east wing has quest drops only, no usable items, named drop one or two rare quest peices which no-one has finished yet. <br>
- PoM may be reachable without faction hits (but I’ve yet to see a decent idea how) 
<br><br>

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Faction gains:
<br><br>
This section discuses how easy is it to improve your faction with your allies, or the boss npc's in each faction. Aside from difficulty you also have to look at alternatives for faction gain. How many every-day activities for each faction will help your standing.
<br><br>
For those allied with Giant faction:<br>
- Thurgadin (kromrif), Skyshrine(kromzek), Cobolt Scar, West Wastes, wandering dragons, <br>
- Killing any ToV give + faction<br>
- How many options for + tormax? Someone who has tried to get +tormax without killing dain / yelinak will have to answer it. I do know killing in the forbidden halls of ToV has reported to give +Tormax.
<br><br>
For those allied with Dragon/Dwarf faction:<br>
- Kael only: sure, its nice to only have to hunt one place for faction. if you ignore the fact that there is only one place for faction. Options? A change of or scenery would be welcome.<br>
- greens in Great divide = not a very inspiring option.<br>
- ToV does not give + factions. <br>
- There are only 3 mobs that I know of that give +yelinak unless you can go behind Tormax to the quest area. (noo problem for the average guild? *sarcasm* ) Only finishing quests one person at a time seems to raise yelinak slowly.
<br><br>
The sad fact is, There are so many options for improving Tormax and Kromzek factions, giant allied guilds can quite easily kill dragon allied targets if they want and not seriously hurt their faction.  A dragon allied guild has to scrape for every crumb of faction unless they want to litteraly live in kael.
<br><br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Loot:
<br><br>
I add this section to compare loot only because I got so many comments that it was missing. I didn’t want to go into specific pieces but I will list here items people typically name as benefits of one faction or another.<br>
Will add more as people send them, I don’t feel qualified to build the list myself, i don’t keep track of loot very well..
<br><br>
For those Allied with Giants.<br>
- Belt of dwarf slaying<br>
- dragonhide armor<br>
- Guardian Leggings (everyone likes resists)<br>
- All Wuoshi drops<br>
- All Kelorek Dar drops<br>
- All north wing ToV drops.
<br><br>
For those Allied with Dragons/Dwarves.<br>
- Coldain insignia ring. <br>
- hammerfall bracer <br>
- Robe of Benevolence <br>
- Bracer of Benevolence<br>
(all quest items i might add. nobody has found an unmatched or bettered CoV allied only drop.)
<br><br>
End of The Comparisons
<br><br>
I'm sure there are inaccuracies.. I'd like to hear them / fix them. I can only tell you my view. 
<br><br>
I'd love to see I’m wrong and there is some redeeming reason to kill named mobs in ToV that drop quest items which take weeks to finish. INSTEAD a guild could just kill the dozen named dragons outside ToV, which are easier, spawn faster, have less than half the hp and drop equipment which is immediate upgrades, some of it amazing equipment! And at the same time receiving quest pieces for excellent kael quest items and improving factions with kael.
<br><br>
I rest my case.
