    I know this is stupid, but I still have to ask.What is the Best Team-Class Wise- for 6v6 PvP with ToT rules??  Heres what I think, of course this seems stupid.<br><b>
<br><br>
    <br><br>
    1xWarrior <br>
2xRogue<br>
1xCleric<br>
1xMage<br>
1xEnchanter<br>

Heres what I would think the strategy would be. Warrior would of course tank, while the rogues would be running around doing dmg with backstab and everything else.Cleric would of course heal those who are in trouble.Mage would do dmg, with either epic mage pet, or Greater Vorcation Earth Pet. Enchanter would be lowering enemies battle effiency and upping group members battle effiency, as well as stunning, lowering magic resist with winds of tashania and C2ing the mage and cleric, no pet of course, heh.  Now to go into more detail with my strategy.<br><br>

I won't go into detail about equip, because that would vary from team to team, and i dont wanna get flamed for putting up equip tactics that only uber guilds could get.<br><br>

For the Mage, the Epic pet would do more dmg of course than the earth pet, but heres why i would choose the earth pet.Earth pet has more hp than any other pet (except for epic pet, i think, lol) it is quite strong, and ROOT!Enchanter of course would have to WoT (Wind of Tashania) the targets first, even though the enchanter would be low on mana, they got clarity 2 on so it should grow back pretty fast =).But the mage could sic the pet on the person attacking the cleric, or whoever, and while the cleric runs, the pet would root it, and at the same time attack it.Before the target can turn around to attack the pet, do /pet back off so it comes back to the mage, and this could cause some trouble =).Of course, the magic resists may be SUPER high on these people, so they might resist it, so take out the bard, if there is one, first.Dont forget that Enchanter and Mage have root too, not very good though.The warriors and rogues are causing dmg all around, and cleric is healing.Enchanter could debuff the enemy, and stun an cleric hater chasing down the cleric.While the warrior and rogues use the "Rotate around the enemy so they cant attack or see you" tactic the battle should be over in a little while.These are just my ideas, and im sure that im an idiot so dont tell me that when your flaming me =).<br><br>
