    In what can only be described as another VI Customer Service first, I had my account suspended today for inappropriate behavior (no doubt some posts I made on whineplay a week ago). Normally, I wouldn't think much of something like this... but the circumstances in which I was suspended are grounds for mental illness from the people in charge of CS.

<br><br>
    <br><br>
    Now, some background on this suspension. I made some posts roughly FIVE days ago on whineplay. I used a few 'shits,' and I beleive one or two 'suck my dicks,' (directed at some trolls, mind you, not any of the VI Messiahs). Anyhow, after I made those posts I didn't log in for FIVE days. My account was active the ENTIRE time.<br><br>

Fast forward to today...<br><br>

I log in today to finally Cancel my account. I log on, run to Kael, take care of some business and log off. I go work out, give the dog a bath, come back home and log in to finish up some business  and LO AND BEHOLD - Your account has been temporarily suspended for inappropriate behavior, blah blah blah blah... <br><br>

The SICK fucker behind this actually waited (yes folks as in STALKED) FIVE days for me to actually LOG on before he would stamp the suspension on the account.<br><br>

Now believe me, I got as good a laugh out of this as anyone reading this post right now, but I also was a bit frightened to think that some stalker at Verant waited for me for FIVE days before he would suspend me.<br><br>

What is the world coming to when a man can't even 'cancel' his account in peace?<br><br>

Brad, I suggest you find the man responsible and have the people at the funny farm come and take him away on a 5150. He could be extremely dangerous, and is more than likely flamingly homosexual and enjoys sex with donkeys.<br><br>
