    From Alan on the new Server Side Filtering *Now on Test*<p>
Let me try to explain the whole 'server side filtering' thing. Bear with me, I don't fully understand how it will work yet. I'll probably get some of this wrong and I'll be back to update later with corrections. 
<br><br>
    <br><br>
    <p>
Chat channels are just text. Filtering them out server-side is not critical, and might not have too much of an effect on bandwidth usage. 
<p>
The important stuff that is sent to the client are damage messages and such. 
<p>
There is a standard update to all clients every six seconds on hit points for group members and NPCs. But you also get an update from the server when you get a damage message. So if I'm attacking an Orc I'm going to get an update on the Orc's hit points every six seconds. But if I hit the Orc with my sword I also get a message saying something like "Absor hits the Orc for 3 points of melee damage". That message also updates the client. If one of my group members takes a hit from the Orc, the message "Bob takes 4 points of damage" is also an update for my client so that I can see a reduction of Bob's hit point bar on my client. 
<p>
Turning off Other's Hits, for example, as a server-side function would mean that I wouldn't see that update. So when my pal Bob hits the Orc for 2 points of damage, my client will not know this right away. It will get updated when the next standard update is sent (as much as six seconds later). Filtering NPC hits would have the same effect on updates to the hit points for your party members. Basically, filtering this stuff server-side means as much as a six second delay (in a perfect lagless Internet) in updates to your client for data that some classes might consider critical. 
<p>
We have options to improve this, however. 
<p>
Obviously NOT turning certain filters on solves the problem on an individual basis. Of course, if people are not filtering stuff then moving filters server-side isn't going to do too much good. 
<p>
We might decrease the time between the basic updates, but this would increase bandwidth dramatically for everyone and could defeat the whole purpose of the project. 
<p>
We might have the servers update certain items more frequently, such as the hit points of whatever you have targeted, or the hit points of your group members. 
<p>
Or some combination of these or other options. 
<p>
But here is the most important point. We MUST introduce this in stages. There is no way that our Test server can be a good test bed for something like this. One server can't match the data output of 30. And we obviously don't want this server-side filtering to suddenly cause people to drop off servers all over the place. So we need to be very cautious with this implementation. 
<p>
The first stages are in the works on Test now, as you know. When we move this live we will be doing so in a way that will give us the best savings on bandwidth. This means that when it goes live turning on certain filters will reduce the updates on certain things to those six-second general updates. So if you want to reduce the data flowing to your computer, expect to see fewer updates on NPC hit points and group hit points. That's as planned. 
<p>
Once we have an idea how much bandwidth server-side filtering is saving us, then we can start to add features. But we'll be doing so very slowly so that we can judge the affects. When it's all over, we think this should be a boon for those in high traffic situations or those that don't have the best connections to our servers (already on Test we're hearing from people that could never hang in on a raid that don't get dropped all night with these changes). But you'll have to bear with us while we move this into production. 
<p>
