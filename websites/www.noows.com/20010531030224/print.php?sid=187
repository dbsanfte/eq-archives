    </center><font size=2>
    This weeks Shadowbane.com update is here, again it's not the beta journal we were told to expect soon almost two months ago.  There is some good stuff, tho.  For those people who don't know much about SB, there's a new/updated official <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/alchemy/faq/index.shtml">FAQ</a> out.  There's four new additions to the <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/divination/bestiary/index.shtml">bestiary</a> section, along with some updates of older models.  There's a new <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/alchemy/poll.shtml">poll</a> which askes "What Race do you think your first Shadowbane Character will be?".  And lastly, there's the <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/divination/races/elves_lore.shtml">lore of the elves</a>, which I guess is cool if you're an RPer.  So all in all, a shitty ass update if you're a diehard SB fan, but good stuff for wussy RPers and people new to SB.<br><br>
