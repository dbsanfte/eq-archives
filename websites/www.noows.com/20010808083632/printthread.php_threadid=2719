<p><b> Put a Fork in Her.... Mother of All = done...</b></p>

<p>I had always KNOWN how gay PoG was, but that didn't stop the nagging voice in the back of my head: "Must kill slutty HO'" "Must kill SLUTTY HO!" <br />
<br />
It was getting louder and louder, every damned day. Well, today, the voice stopped. The Mother-of-All gracefully bowed down to the combined forces of FoH and CD. Loot? Well, it sucked.... For the ridiculously retarded effort we had to put in (clearing the zone) to kill her, and the fifteen+ minute fight of a flurrying 925quadding slut... IT REALLY SUCKED.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, here's the lewtz.<br />
<br />
Not ONE, but TWO, Plane of Growth Necromancer Robes! And a Sword, this sword:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. For you newbies, Mother-of-All is Tunare, goddess of the gay, prancing, singing, sissy Elves...<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p><b> I WARNED YOU ALL</b></p>

<p>Tunare would OWN us in the end!  12 hours of mind-numbing clearing, an almost 20 minute fight complete with the 'In Battle Ressing!(tm)', stupid warping adds, and super high resists, and the result?  The same loot that drops off of the crap at the zone in.  WHO was right?  Tunare had the last laugh!<br />

I just spent the last month trying to convince people on my server to give Tunare a go for the fun of trying to do an EQ first, but it was becoming such an ordeal trying to convince people she was doable that it was just a headache.  Glad that is over now.  At least my point is proven, and now I don't have to bother with the raid...<br />
<br />
Gratz to FoH/CD on a great EQ first! Crappy as that loot was, I bet FoH/CD will be the only guilds for a long while to have slain that wretched, horrid, ugly bish.<br />

I'm glad my guild didn't let me organize another worthless Tunare raid.   It was probably the largest collective waste of time ever on the Rodcet Nife server, and were it not for the fact that we had some satisfaction knowing no one else had tried her before, half my guild would have probably disbanded for having to spend a day in that worthless zone.</p>

<p>Who knows... maybe VI thought that nobody would ever *seriously* take a shot at Tunare and thus they just put some old pos loot on her. Perhaps they'll upgrade the loot soon? or maybe that was just the shitiest part of her loot table? Only time will tell.....<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p>Gratz on killing Tunare.<br />
<br />
I think you should kill her again.<br />
<br />
If it is only a 20 minute battle to actually kill Tuanre, then perhaps letting someone else clear the zone first?<br />
<br />
I know that to a lot of guilds, getting PoG loot is still a lot better then anything else they can get, its kinda like being stuck in a position between Hate and high end dragon loot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps letting some poor saps clear most of the zone for you, then moving in, might take some of the tedium out of killing her.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think that she must have a larger loot table then just that sword and two robes. Oh god i hope so anyway.</p>

<p>Its sad that a 20 minute fight gets you nothing anymore. Its sad that her loot sucked that much ass though, but then again its Verant the people that bring you such things as "its a feature not a bug" and "those aren't tactics, that's exploiting". I would kill her one more time just to see if for the love of god she has any jesus like loot.<br />

<p><b> Maybe she was supposed to be unkillable...</b></p>

<p>I think I agree with the above post, that they never actually figured anyone would put the effort into killing her, but put SOME Loot on her just in-case.  If you're this upset about the fact that she got crappy loot(I would be too) imagine how bad it would be if she dropped NOTHING.  However, like some others have said, you may have just gotten really unlucky, and gotten like, her super-ass end of the loot table.<br />
<br />
On a side-note, I've seen a couple posts about how someone killed AoW, anyone got a link to that guild's website?</p>

<p>I'll agree, the long fight compare to what you got... the effort/risk vs reward, it was out of wack.<br />
<br />
However, I once attended a Nagafen raid.  6 groups of people levels 40 to 49.  And we got the uber loot of 4 Prayers of Life.  Sometimes you get unlucky.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't call it a total loss unless you've seen the same crap loot more than once.<br />
<br />
But thats just my opinion, I could be wrong.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

Geez, you would think someone at VI would eventually get a clue.  This is just another fine example of the people at VI having no "Vision" or any customer service skills.  If so, they would have planned for this contingency and made it the positive experience that it should have been.  <br />
<br />
Since they seem to only have their eyes focused on your wallet and their balance sheet, it is doubtful any of them will wake up.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

i'm sure after getting shit loot off uber mobs for a while, the big guilds dont really expect good loot.  In some history class i remember hearing about adventerers (sp?) that were out for God, Glory, and Gold.  I'm not even gonna get into the God issue.... but all i got to say is Glory > Gold.</p>

<p>Not that it's any excuse, but we have to remember that Tunare was itemized before tov upgrades, before kael/skyshrine armor got better, and before CT was upgraded to drop uber robe.  So at the time pog class bps would have been half decent.  It's classic verant, it sucks.<br />

<p>Yeah very cool kill, Tunare is a beotch as we've found out, but for the love of god PoG Necro robes!!!

Anyway, grats on the kill, least you can have the satisfaction that you killed her, and be pissed off when verant actually itemizes her :P<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p>i was having enough of a hard time drumming up interest when it was still possibly an EQ first and when the mystery of her untold riches was enticing, but you really think people are going to show up now to get a pog robe and an ass sword in the unlikely event of victory?<br />
<br />
nah.  tunare can go back down the aggro list to about spot #20.</p>

<p>Is everything about loot? You should just be glad you killed her and move on, roleplay a little, she was a god of very little possesion, she was happy with her creatures blah blah blah, I dont see what bitching about it will do. Gratz though.</p>

<p><b> Who really won?</b></p>

<p>This kind of thing is why doing things 'first' in Verant-world is almost asking to be made a fool of.<br />
<br />
Yes, FoH defeated a tough monster for the first time, congratulations on that, but it almost seems like the monster really won in the end if that's all you got for your troubles.<br />
<br />
Think about it, 12 hours of mind-numbing clearing of POG, for loot that no one wants (in FoH or CD, I'm sure they all have better) to kill a monster that drops ordinary stuff.<br />
<br />
My gawd. Thanks Risk vs. Reward. /flush balance<br />
<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>I dont think <i>'Risk -vs- Reward'</i> is really applicable when your talking about places like Plane of Growth, and Fear perhaps.<br />
<br />
What exactly is the risk involved, at least at the level of play we and many others are at? A 20 minute CR? A zone does not pose a significant risk when the repop time is 12 hours. ToV presents a measure of risk not seen in PoG. If you screw up a pull you are looking at a possible reclearing of the area every 80 minutes or so untill you get it right. A raid can go nowhere fast when you cant drag the pull teams corpses out, and have to summon them back at the zone-in.<br />
<br />
Perhaps in Verrant's eyes, the reward is equal to the risk involved for Tunare. On the other hand, <i>Effort -vs- Reward</i> should be a focus for itemizing this NPC and other comparable NPC's. 12 hours for one drop is not going to happen again.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p><b> hmm</b></p>

<p>Yes everything is about loot. The game is based on loot.. You can't deny this. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make myself look like a greedy loot whore here, I'm just saying the game revolves around it is all. If it wasn't there, most people wouldn't play there. A lot of the fun factor that comes from mobs is at the end when you here what kind of awesome loot it has, and watch your friends equip it and bust some ass with their new toys.. that is fun.<br />
<br />

<p><b> actually no</b></p>

<p>i could be wrong, but judging from FoH's track record, their first priority has always been the thrill of pioneering and the glory it brings.  they do that, and get that, and have nothing to complain about in that regard, so they may as well focus their attention on the aspects of the game that do need improving.  things like risk v reward, class balance and other game imbalances like 1H v 2H etc.<br />
<br />
if foh were just driven by loot, why would they pass up warders and cazic thules and dains to focus on pioneering ntov w/o knowing if the loot would be equivalent to early veeshan's peak loot?<br />
<br />
don't get the fact that foh makes a lot of noise about loot confused with being driven by it.<br />
<br />
again i may be wrong, but that is my observation.<br />

<p>I know everyone will jump all over saying 'that's what the game revolves around!' and 'it's quake with swords!' and  all that other tired crap, but maybe she wasn't meant to be killed? I mean, just because something can BE killed doesn't mean it's MEANT to be. Congrats on the kill, it was a cool first. Perhaps along the lines of a lesser guild killing the PoD tho. Not so much for the loot and more just for the sake of killing it. btw, I go away from eq for a little bit, come back and Tunare, AoW and 4th Warder down! 0_0. Fun news update. lol</p>

<p>You know, I am 100% certain that if VI wished to make mobs unkillable, they could do so.<br />
<br />
*Obviously* Tunare is just another mob you can farm if you want to. (But why would you?)<br />
<br />
I don't think there are many mobs that you can call "unkillable" really. <br />
<br />
Someone may say "Sirran" but he was killed once. In his current state is unkillable.<br />
<br />
How about 100% MR, PR, DR, CR, FR. AC = 8000. HP = 3.14 Billion and it quads for 2054, casts an AE silence and 1000 point DD. Also rampages, flurries, enrages. Lvl 75. <br />
<br />
That's a pretty easy mob for VI to make if they wanted to make something REALLY unkillable.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

And how exactly would you go about kiting that?  It's 100% MR/PR/DR/FR/CR and would kill anything that touched it before they could move out of melee range.<br />

Ranged items you say?  Summon, I retort.  And to dispell a myth, you don't have to actually inflict damage to be summoned, just be on hate list.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p>A mob has to have a certain amount of dmg done to it before it wil summon, BUT that doesnt mean you have to do dmg to it to actually be summoned.  Just be at top of the list; for example war does xx amount of dmg to mob and now its summoning then shaman slows it and goes to top of hate list and get summoned.  Shaman didnt actually do any dmg and got summoned but at the same time a mob cant summon without a certain amount of dmg inflicted upon it.</p>

<p>i always believed this too, but the other day unless i am crazy my wife got summoned without doing any damage.  she ran out of thurg, had the 2 guards (who were just sitting there happily) there chase her (as a cleric, i don't think she riposted heh) and ran all the way to the portal with jboot speed, basically trying to outrun aggro range.  as soon as she got to the portal and sat down, bam got summoned over and over til dead.  i know for a fact she did no damage to the guard, shrug.</p>
