The event was to find and slay the mythical Great Brown Drake which was rumored to be in the dangerous Pennine Mountains. The 23 screenshots along with the story show each step taken, from the staging and preparing, to fighting different beasts, to finally accomplishing our goal along with the aftermath that it caused.
