    <b>Beating the Sleeper's zone-wide DT.</b><br>

    Now this is just an idea.  I am not sure if all the things I am saying are true (except for the tiger claw part and the death touches causing damage not death)

Harm touches use the Tiger Claw as its skill, since it doesnt go into the category of the magic skills (alteration, abjuration, etc).  I assume Death Touches use the same variable.  Harm Touches are resistable, so I guess Death Touches are resistable too right?  right!<br>
<br><br>
    <br><br>
    So I think that if you were to beef up your magic resistance enough you could beat it.  Break out all the magic resistance equipment cuz yer gunna need it hehe.
<br><br>
Oh and to all of you who plan on flaming me by saying that Death Touches cant be resistable because they are instant deaths, this isnt entirely true.  Yes if you get hit by a death touch you will be killed.  But a Death Touch doesnt put you on the ground immediatly, it causes a very high amount of hp damage (10000 usually).  Simply put, death touches cause damage, not death.
<br><br>
So with this in mind, if I am correct that death touches are resistable, the Sleeper shouldnt be TOO much of a problem hehe.....
<br><br>
DISCLAIMER:  As stated before, I am not sure if death touches are resistable, its just an idea.
<br><br>
But you can all take into consideration that this mob is unkillable, or is he?  Personally, I think that when Kerafyrm is patched up and his epic quest is finished he will start a rampage all over norrath and it will take the power of everyone in the world to beat him.
<br><br>
Allow me to explain his epic quest:
<br><br>
What was SUPPOSED to happen was that when the Sleeper was awoken he was supposed to start popping in other zones and raping everyone.  What DID happen was FoH and Dakor killed the wardens and awoken the sleeper before his script was completed.  The sleeper is back in his spot now on all servers.  
<br><br>
Now what Furor said about it having 2.14 billion hp was obviously an exageration.  What REALLY happened was when the sleeper woke up, FoH poured everything they had at him, more than they had ever poured at one mob at one time, and after 30 seconds the whole guild was dead.  The funny thing is, after all the damage they had dealt (most likely over 20k damage) his hp bar didnt move.  It didnt slide at all, not one pixel.
<br><br>
Now its time for my personal belief.  I think the Sleeper is invinsible.  I dont think he has hp, I think he has an unbeatable defense.  Only time will tell, but I think Verant has finally caught on that we want some epic quests where the whole world can participate, and I thikn Verant has something up their sleeve which should be fun for everyone.  This is good coming from me, since I am normally anti-verant :)
<br><br>
Oh btw, plz save yourself the trouble in flaming me about some of this stuff.  If you plan on saying that Harm Touches dont use Tiger Claw and that I'm a moron, read up about the schematics of EQ a bit and you'll see what I mean.  To you who dont like my resistable DT idea....I dont see any of you thinking of battle strategies for this guy.  Well, thats all, I am gunna read up on him a bit more and see if I can think of anything else.
<br><br>
PS:The spell that guy was talking about on everlore is infact a real spell.  It does 2000 points of damage to all dragons, the spell is called Dragonsbane.  Jus thought I'd let you all in on that :)<br><br>
