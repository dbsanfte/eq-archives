    <b>Is velious raids possible with a single race?</b><br>

    We are having a discussion on VZ about this. And I was just wondering if you guys think it is possible to kill velious mobs with all one race? (i.e. all elves, shorties, evils, or humans). Also, are velious mobs killable without shamans/monks? And could a group do it without rogues? Some seem to think its impossible without the high damage output of rogues, the debuffs or buffs of shamans, or the pulling of monks, however I feel that since EQ is based off mainly cleric/warrior combo, that every mob could be taken down with the correct number of clerics/warriors, and adding in other classes are there just to make it more efficient? Lemme hear your thought on this one.<br><br>
