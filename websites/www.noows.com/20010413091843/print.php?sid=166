    <b>Incardine BP nerf, BAH!</b><br>

    <p>I don't have the energy to repeat my rant but check <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/071669.html">here</a> for the whineplay post.</p>

<p>I absolutely loved my incardine bp.  I traded away what I considered to be guild loots with no shame to get one after eight months of shit luck whenever I went to chardok.   I am totally fucking disgusted with EQ right now.. not the "I quit" kind of thing but just too upset to enjoy it.  I can't really describe the value this item held for me, but ever since the very first one dropped for Furor way back when I've wanted it, and eight months later those dipshits retroactively nerf it.  Morons.  I am NOT going back to having to jerk around for a half hour to use my druid to transfer invis potions so I can blow six of the fucking things to get from kael to veeshan's temple.   Fuck that.</p>

<p>Anyway, support the thread if you care.  Stay the hell away if you don't.</p><br><br>
