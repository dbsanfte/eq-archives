<th colspan="2" valign="top">Beginner's Guide to Scouts</th>
<tr><td><table width="85%" align="center">
<tr><td width="85%"><span class="postbody">Starting out in EverQuest 2 is pretty easy and straightforward but there are a few things to be careful of early on.  When you first create your character there are two settings. One is to choose the good side and to the live in Qeynos.  The other is to choose the path of evil and take up residence in Freeport. Some races like the Human or Half Elf are neutral and can choose either city.  For the neutral races its important to make sure you choose the right alignment since they display under both good or evil or else you can find yourself going to the wrong city once you are finished on the isle.<p>

Once you have a race picked out, it’s just a matter of choosing an appearance, server and character name and then you are ready to get started.  You begin your life in EverQuest 2 aboard the Far Journey.  This is basically just the main tutorial phase of the game.  As part of the tutorial, Captain Varlos will have you help out and talk to the crew.  Along the way you will learn basic movement, camera views, questing and the basics of combat.<p>

Once you are done with the tutorial on the Far Journey, you are placed on the isle of refuge.  Not far from the dock is Garven Tralk who will ask you for your name and profession.  As an aspiring scout you will want to choose the one with scout as the profession to continue.  Garven will then describe the scout class to you and ask if you can handle becoming a scout.  Once you say yes to Garven you are assigned to help out with goblins.  So follow Garven’s instructions and kill a goblin or two and report back for a reward.  Garven then instruct you to seek out Vladiminn the ratonga who helps out with scouts.  You can find Vladiminn by a tent near what appears to be an archery range.  Vladiminn will give you several quests to help out the Far Seas Trading Company around the isle.  They culminate with killing the orc leader Grimgash that is a sample of the instanced encounters you will see throughout the game.  Every step of Vladiminn’s quests help to equip you so it is highly recommended you complete these steps before heading to the city.  There are many other quests on the island so you might want to put in the extra time and explore since the items are very worthwhile as a newbie. You can be working on a large number of quests at any time and the game will keep track of your progress for each quest.  If you need to look at the quest details while adventuring you can just press “J” to bring up your journal.  If you get lost on the island at any time you can press “M” to display the map.   The small red dot displayed on the map corresponds to your current location, which can be used to help you navigate the island.<p>

Every member of the scout archetype get the dual wield ability as soon as they make their archetype choice with Garven.  One thing to note though is that there are different designations for different weapons. The three weapon types are one handed, dual wield and two handed.  A one-handed sword or dagger is designed be used alone or with a shield and not with another weapon.  To dual wield which is recommended you will need to save up some silver and buy daggers that are designated for dual wield. To tell if a weapon is dual wieldable right click on it and choose examine.  In the box that pops up you will see the weapon type listed under wield style. The dwarf merchant by sells dual wield style daggers pretty cheap and a really nice one drops somewhere on the island but you need to discover where that drops.<p>

Once you feel ready to leave the island you can talk to your ambassador for directions on leaving.  The ambassadors can be found along the beach near Captain Varlos.  Once you are ready you then just click on the bell at the end of the docks to go to your new hometown.  Once you are in town speak with the NPC at the docks who will introduce you to the city and send you to the inn for your apartment.  Your apartment costs 5 silver per week in upkeep but don’t worry about that now since the first week is free.  The landlord will start you on your quest for citizenship so follow his directions as well as the ones supplied in your quest journal. You will end up needing to gather 5 coins from a nearby zone.  The zones can either be found connecting to that part of town or by taking the bell on the docks.  Maps work in town if you get lost and you can just press “M” to bring it up. Before leaving town for your coins you might want to stop and upgrade your combat arts at the trainer.  You can find the trainer by the book icon on your map.  It is recommended that you at least get the apprentice 2 scrolls for sneak, sneak attack and quick strike before venturing out.<p>

While gathering your coins you can either group up or get them solo.  Soloing as a scout takes a bit of practice since you are better from the side or behind a mob with sneak attack.  If you solo you will want to learn to combine cheap shot and sneak attack together.  Cheap shot stuns the mob for five seconds which gives you time to move to the side and use sneak attack for damage.  Heroic opportunities are good for a scout too since they give a small buff or direct damage with the right combination. To trigger the scout heroic opportunity chain you need to use your Lucky Break skill followed by evade and then quick strike.  For the solo scout the chain is Lucky Break, followed by a “coin” art and then a “dagger” art.  Early on your coin arts are limited to evade and cheap shot but you will get a quick 10 second refresh coin art with dirty tricks at level 9 which means you will be able to perform a heroic opportunity every 10 seconds for extra damage while soloing.<p>

Once you get your 5 coins you can now go back to town to finish up your citizenship quest.  Just go click on the sign where you got your application earlier and you will be ported into an instanced zone.  Here you will need to fight several npcs but don’t worry they aren’t too hard to beat by yourself.  Once you kill them you become a citizen of your town and just need to follow the prompts to exit.  As a citizen of the city you can now go to all the different areas and you also get a gate spell to your home district.  From here you will want to go around and find quests by talking to everyone including merchants.  The quests vary in rewards from a small amount of coin to some nice weapons but all do give a nice amount of experience so they are worth the time to get and complete. Also as you visit new areas in town you might discover different spots that give you experience which makes exploring the town fun.<p>

Once you are loaded up on quests you can go around to the various zones and complete the tasks you need to progress on.  Once you get to level 9 you will get a hallmark quest to choose a scout profession.  You will need to speak with either Emissary Millia in North Freeport or Counselor Vemerik in North Qeynos to begin the quest. You will need to do several errands that first prove your worth as a scout and then help to describe the three classes that make up the scout archetype: rogue, bard and predator.  Once you finish these errands it is time to choose a class and then do one last task.  Each quest is slightly different and very challenging but you can not level past 9 until the quest is complete.<p>

Once the quest is completed you are then on your way to becoming your desired scout profession.  You should have gotten a nice reward and then when you get to level 10 you will get your first class related combat art for the predators and rogues or song for bards.  So from here keep exploring, doing quests and most importantly enjoying the game.</span>
