							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Ashling closed her eyes and took a deep breath.  Shutting out the rest of the world, she focused her mind on the task at hand, mentally running over her mission again and all the details she had scouted.  Her prey was sleeping, barricaded in the guard tower of this remote outpost.  When she had first received her mission, she had inwardly doubted that the Ogre would measure up to his reputation, but from what she had seen the stories were, if anything, modest in their appraisal of this warrior.  Surviving the treacheries of Freeport had taught him caution, and he had always had enough brawn to give his opponents pause, but in the process of betraying his city to join the ranks of honor serving Qeynos, he had shown a fierce dedication and refusal to submit to defeat that was rare indeed.  Still her master had decided that his defection was unacceptable and had given her the opportunity of taking care of the matter personally.  Tracking Crookfang to this abandoned location had been remarkably easy.  The guard of Qeynos had tasked Crookfang with the job of securing the outpost until a regiment of guards arrived in a few days, which left Ashling plenty of time to get her job done and depart.
<br />

<br />
	Staring at the guard tower, her thoughts returned to the present.  The tower itself was only two stories, more of a lookout post than a true tower.  Though the door was shut and barred, and she was sure that Crookfang would have similarly secured the trapdoor to the roof, there were barred windows in the upper floor to enable the occupants to fire arrows in the case of attack.  Ashling double checked her gear before throwing the padded hook up.  The prongs caught on the roof almost silently and Ashling waited a few seconds but there was no change in the snores from within.  Propping her feet against the wall, she began to climb, taking care to set each foot carefully and without making a sound.  Soon she was level with the window, and peering in she saw Crookfang fast asleep on the bed, his sword sheathed next to him.  Checking the window for loose debris, she carefully squeezed between the bars, once again grateful for her lithe form.  
<br />

<br />
	Crouching in the shadows under the window, she paused for a second, etching each detail into her mind, before creeping towards the bed.  Slipping a specially made awl out of her belt, she carefully removed its cap.  Checking to make sure it was clean and ready for use, she delicately pulled the blanket aside, moving as she had been taught, so slowly as to be unnoticed.  Luckily he was wearing simple linen bedclothes, and it was a simple matter to puncture them with her device and just prick the skin underneath where his skin was the least sensitive.  For a split second she feared he would roll over onto his back, but he simply stirred a bit in his sleep then settled down again.  Ashling steadied her device in one hand, and gently squeezed the end with the other, the soft bulb forcing the powerful nerve-toxin into his bloodstream.  She removed the awl from his rear and quickly re-capped it and slipped it back into her belt pouch then settled back to wait for the toxin to do its work.  
<br />

<br />
	In less than a minute, his snoring stopped and his body became rigid, barely moving with shallow breath.  She waited a few more seconds to make sure that he was in full paralysis before moving to the head of the bed.  His eyes were wide open in terror, but he couldn’t even turn them towards her.  Still she wanted him to see her as she watched his life fade, so she climbed on top of him before using one hand to keep his mouth shut and the other to pinch his nose shut.  She could almost feel the fear and hatred pour out of him, but he couldn’t so much as shake underneath her.  “Shhh…” she whispered, “soon it will all be over.  You should have known betraying Lucan was the biggest gamble you ever took.  Unfortunately for you, this one didn’t pay off.”  She looked him straight in the eye for the full ten minutes it took for her toxin to fade, and by the time his body went limp she knew he was beyond recovery.  Climbing down off the bed, she closed his eyes and pulled the blanket back over him.  
<br />

<br />
	Quickly scanning the room, she made sure there were no other indications that anyone else had been in here.  She knew there would be no mark where she injected the toxin, and had not had to exert enough pressure on his face to smother him to leave so much as a bruise.  She slid out through the bars and climbed her rope all the way to the top of the tower.  Pulling it up and stowing it in her back, she made sure there was no mark where the padded hook had grabbed the edge of the wall.  Knowing she could easily make the jump down, she gracefully leaped over the edge and landed on the ground below.  Making sure to erase any footprints, she backed away from the outpost and faded off into the woods.  
<br />

<br />
	After returning to Freeport, she pulled out a copper coin she had clipped in her personal pattern of notches and while passing by a mangy looking Ratonga beggar, she tossed the coin into his hand.  Without a word she continued on to her house, knowing her master would get the message that her mission had been completed.  Once home, she re-kindled her fire and changed out of her traveling clothes.  She then removed all her tools from her bag and thoroughly cleaned each one, refilling her special awl and making sure nothing needed repairs.  After she had repacked her kit, she sat before the crackling flames and closed her eyes, replaying the whole encounter in her mind until each detail was etched in her memory.  Though her master often praised her ability to carry out her assignments with cold detachment, in truth she savored the feeling of the kill and relived each death over and over in her mind.  As always, her thoughts traveled back to her first meeting with him.
<br />

<br />
                                                 *******
<br />

<br />
	Even as a child Ashling had been detached from the rest of the Gnomes.  She had a quiet intensity to her that set her apart from all the other children.  Although she played with them, and at times seemed no different than any other gnome child, she would get lost in thought and sit for hours in the shadows.  She often found herself pondering death, especially after listening to the tales of the great adventurer Thalina, wizard to the ancient guild Shattered Moon.  Though she thought Thalina had wasted her life, doing so much for others, she found a strange calling towards her, much more than she felt to any of her other ancestors.  But the stories made her wonder.  Everything she had been taught as a child told her that killing was wrong and that everyone should work together and help each other whenever they could.  And yet what she heard when she listened to the tales of Thalina was completely the opposite.  Thalina seemed to do nothing but kill, and even went after the incarnations of the Gods themselves.  And many of the stories told of bands of adventures competing against each other not helping each other.  And yet whenever she asked about it, she was told that Thalina was a good gnome and a great adventurer and to slander her good name was unthinkable.  But something deep down inside of her told her that there was more to this story than was told.  
<br />

<br />
	Since she couldn’t get a straight answer out of anyone in her village, she decided she had to read the ancient histories herself.  But she knew she would never be allowed to read them, or that she would only be shown the ones that said nothing but what she had grown up hearing.  So she began to plan a way to break into the sage’s library and read them for herself.  She spent months studying the habits of the adults in her village, drawing completely away from the other children.  Soon she knew their patterns and had a good idea of the best time to break into the library.  She knew the best time to break into the library and get where she thought the scrolls were kept.  But she realized she had made a mistake.  Spending as much time as she had observing the adults had not gone unnoticed, and now she was being watched like a hawk.  Her parents especially were concerned that she was troubled and tried to spend more time with her.  Ashling felt like she was being cornered, and grew more stubborn and resentful each day.  Just when she thought she was going to go crazy, a hooded figure stepped out of the shadows in her room late one night.  Startled, she was about to call for her parents when he spoke.
<br />

<br />
	“Listen well, young one, for I can teach you all you wish to know.  Yours is a soul that is foretold in prophesy.  The very scrolls you are searching for speak of your coming.  I can teach you the ways of stealth and larceny so you can get them and read them for yourself.”  She listened with rapt attention as he taught her how to hide herself in the shadows and circumvent any locks or traps.  He told her to consider this a trial and promised to teach her more if she passed.  She planned meticulously, and found that it was much easier than she’d expected (although it didn’t occur to her at the time that her kin were very trusting and so there weren’t many precautions against theft).  As she read the histories and the prophesy contained within, she felt something stir inside of her.  It was like she was coming home again, that same feeling of familiarity.  Somehow she knew that the person who talked to her was the same prophet in the history who had given the original Shattered Moon the ritual that had driven them underground.  She could already picture in her mind the treasures and glory that would be hers if she followed the role set up for her in the prophesy.  She grinned to herself and looked forward with her next meeting with the stranger who would change her life.

<br />
	Ashling worked hard for the next couple of years, honing her skills until she could walk unseen and handle most locks.  She learned to spot many kinds of traps and disable them.  He master also taught her the art of assassination and soon she became his prized pupil.  When the earthquake came that destroyed her village, she was picked up by a ship that was searching for survivors and chose to seek refuge in the city of Freeport where she somehow knew she would not only find her master but also realize her destiny.  As she served her city, she kept her eyes peeled for others like her, others she knew she would find soon enough.
