----------------------------------------------------------
<br />
Off in the distance the pounding of war drums could be heard. The dark elves of Neriak were preparing the city for war. Neriak would suffer, as the prophecy of The Dead had foretold. Times of great peril had come to the world of Norrath, and now was beating at the doorsteps of Neriak.
<br />

<br />
"Do you hear that, it is the sound of the Rallosian army" Raykuan said to his companion Hiletroy.
<br />

<br />
"Yes."replied Hiletroy.
<br />

<br />
"I fear we cannot win this war, we have grown to relaxed over the past few years, we are not prepared." Raykuan said in a soft voice so only his ally could hear him.
<br />

<br />
"We must preserve this city." Hiletroy said.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan turned and looked into the heart of Neriak Foreign Quarters. Merchants were packing up their goods. The townspeople were closing their doors and locking their windows. The streets were filled with guards, passing out dull swords and beaten shields. Animated skeletons were being commanded and positioned in front of their masters.
<br />

<br />
Neriak, a city in a mountain side, was a decaying city. Her people, known as the Dark elves were an organized and profound people. Although over the years the leadership had diminished, the great soldiers had left to seek greater glory. The sages had grown in power.However, that power had consumed them to use their power to learn more about Luclin and the Planes of the gods. Now that the spires seemed to have lost all effect they were trapped on the moon, or in the Planes searching for a way to get back to Norrath. Neriak was vulnerable.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan walked to the top of the pathway leading into the mountainous city."Teir'dal of Neriak, hear me" Raykuan shouted."We must strike the enemy in the forests of Nektulos. We must ambush them. Gather bows and arrows we will strike from the trees. We must stop them before they reach the city."
<br />

<br />
"Your plan will fail Raykuan, we cannot win this war, our path has been written by the prophecy of the dead" A dark shrouded figure stepped forward from the crowd, it was a women, a women Raykuan knew all to well. Tsara, the leader of the dead, she was a very powerful Necromancer, whom some say had the ability to foresee ones death."We must seal the entrance to our city, it is the only way to ensure our survival" Tsara explained in a calm voice.
<br />

<br />
The crowd began to mutter with chatter and concern. Raykuan could see the panic on the peoples faces.
<br />

<br />
"I will not lock myself in these caves and cower to my enemies!" Raykuan bolstered. "I will fight to my death if needed to protect this city, I will take only volunteers, those of you who wish to remain here can. Anyone who wants to fight with me, we leave in an hour, get prepared."
<br />

<br />
Raykuan turned to Hiletroy, "Lets prepare for War my friend. Go to the clerics guild and tell Drocsel to meet me in my house. Gather any food and provisions we may need."
<br />

<br />
Hiletroy looked at Raykuan with a confused look and then slapped Raykuan on the back of the head. "Do you forget I am a cleric, I can summon all the food we need" Hiletroy reminded Raykuan.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan just smiled at his companion and walked off to prepare.
<br />

<br />
Drocsel always looked up to Hiletroy, he was his mentor. Drocsel was a considerably young in the dark elf standard, a man of only 24 years. He had a childlike face, but he had hair of white just like his father. The only son of Raykuan, Drocsel was brought up on battle tactics and necromantic arts. He wasn't like his father however, as a young boy he wanted to learn more about healing wounds rather than inflicting them. He began learning from Hiletroy in his spare time, shortly after he told his father he wanted to discontinue his study of the necromantic arts and become a cleric. His father was quite upset however with Hiletroy's influence, Raykuan decided to inform Tsara that Drocsel would no longer be studying the necromantic arts and he was going to pursue the art of healing.
<br />

<br />
Hiletroy found Drocsel in the clerics guild working on his studies. Drocsel greeted Hiletroys arrival with a smile, but Hiletroy did not smile this time.
<br />

<br />
"Why the sad face Exarch?" Drocsel questioned Hiletroy.
<br />

<br />
"It is beginning. Your father wants to see you" Hiletroy said without expression.
<br />

<br />
"What are we going to do? I am ready to fight Exarch, I have learned a great deal, I can help." Drocsel pleaded.
<br />

<br />
"Go see your father Drocsel." Hiletroy responded knowing that Raykuan would not let him fight in this battle.
<br />

<br />
"Yes, exarch." Drocsel replied with a disappointed voice.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan was sharpening his dagger when Drocsel walked in. Weapons lied out across the table, the smell of sulfur and smoke filled the house. Raykuan was wearing a full suit of plate armor. He was preparing for battle.
<br />

<br />
"You wished to see me father.?" Drocsel asked.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan said as he continued to sharpen his blade. A few moments of silence passed until Raykuan lay his sharpening stone down and slid the blade into a sheath on his belt. He opened up a chest and grabbed two backpacks and a small pouch from inside. He then turned to his son.
<br />

<br />
"Drocsel, I want you to take this." Raykuan said as he handed him the bags and the pouch."I want you to flee the city, take the western trial toward Lavastorm Mountains and then follow the mountain side to the river in Nektulos Forest. Remember the spot on Nektulos Lake I took you fishing so many times? I want you to go there, make a camp in the forest. Stay out of sight for awhile. In the bags are enough food and drink to last you a week or two, in the pouch is gold pieces in case you should need them." Raykuan then walked over to his bed and reached underneath and pulled another chest from beneath the bed.
<br />

<br />
"But, father, I can fight! I am rea.."
<br />

<br />
"Enough!!" Raykuan cut Drocsel off before he could finish."This is not a discussion, this is unlike anything we have ever faced before, it is very likely we will lose this war. The Rallosian army shows no mercy, they will kill every man women and child if they so have the chance.You must survive, Drocsel. If we lose this battle Tsara and the sages are going to seal the entrance to Neriak. I will need you in the mountains, after we ambush the army we will retreat and prepare a second attack, and a third and as many are necessary until we kill them all or they kill us. We are out numbered ten to one, we can't fight them head on. In order to stand a chance we must be stealthy, and use the trees and knowledge of the forest to our advantage. I need you to be hidden in the forest by the lake. I want you to carve arrows like I taught you, make weapons, hunt the black bears. We will need food and a base to retreat too. If we don't make it I want you to stay out of harms way and stay alive." There was no negotiation in Raykuan's face.
<br />

<br />
"Yes father." Drocsel replied with mild hesitation.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan opened the chest and handed Drocsel a bow, two quivers of arrows and a spiked club. 
<br />

<br />
"Take this, and my horse.Take your armor, extra food for the horse, a compass, some flint and anything else you may need and can carry. I want you to be ready to leave within the hour." Raykuan said as he walked toward his son. Raykuan reached his arms out and grabbed hold of Drocsel and hugged him tightly. "Since your mother died, your all I have left. Be careful son."
<br />

<br />
That was the first time in years Drocsel remembers his father calling him son. He had always felt that somehow his father was angry at him for his mothers death. He knew very little of his mother, but he did know her name, Shelina.

Raykuan and Hiletroy stood just outside the entrance to Neriak. The entrance to Neriak was hidden well in the mountainside. Raykuan watched as fighters, sages, priests and even commoners gathered outside the city. He had not expected this many to fight.
<br />

<br />
"I want you to be by my side throughout all this Hiletroy, I will need your guidance. We will position ourselves in the trees on the east and west side of the bridge, we will ambush from there first. The bridge is narrow, they will not be able to cross in full force. We can position our men in the trees and behind any cover we can find. We will remain hidden until they begin crossing the bridge, as soon as they begin crossing we will strike with bows, and spells from the distance. Get with the sages and tell there wizards and magicians to prepare spells to destroy the bridge. If they start getting across order them to blow the bridge, that will slow them down awhile."Raykuan explained to Hiletroy.
<br />

<br />
"I'm on it." Hiletroy responded as he set off to gather the sages.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan was looking through the crowds of men, getting an idea of their numbers, and also looking for Drocsel. He had expected a hundred or so, but already there were at least double that. In the crowd he saw three familiar faces approaching. He greeted his friends with salutes.
<br />

<br />
"Scantos, Shaithes, Vumelin. I did not expect to see you here, when did you arrive in town?." Raykuan was starting to feel better about the situation at hand. Things were coming together.
<br />

<br />
"We arrived just moments ago, we heard about the Rallosian army, they have conquered everything south of Freeport. We figured they would be on the move north. May Neriak not serve the same fate as Gukta." Vumelin explained.
<br />

<br />
"The guild of the dead is planning on destroying the entrance and locking themselves in the caves should we fail to stop the assault. You don't have to fight, our scouts indicate we are out numbered ten to one. This might be a battle we cannot win." Raykuan assessed.
<br />

<br />
"Not fight? Ha!" Scantos laughed."What? And let you have all the glory."
<br />

<br />
Raykuan managed a smile. "I am glad you are here my friends, I will fill you in on the details of our plans momentarily, first I must attend to something." Raykuan finished, with a salute he walked away.
<br />

<br />
"Drocsel." Raykuan yelled out as he approached his son.
<br />

<br />
Drocsel turned and looked at his father."I don't like this idea father, we should flee Neriak and head to the Lavastorm mountains, we can hide there."
<br />

<br />
"We cannot hide forever, and I believe the people of Neriak would be more willing to hide within our city here in the mountains rather than flee. Don't worry yourself about such things You have a mission to accomplish. Focus on the mission. I know Hiletroy has taught you that much, with all the long hours you spend meditating." Raykuan said sarcastically trying to calm his son. 
<br />

<br />
Hiletroy approached Raykuan and Drocsel. "The sages have been told about our plan. Drocsel, Nalddar will be coming with you, he is a good warrior. He can assist you if any problems shall arise." Hiletroy stated.
<br />

<br />
"I will see you in a few days, remember what I told you. Stay out of sight. Now go!" Raykuan demanded.
<br />

<br />
Drocsel hopped on his horse and rode over to Nalddar. Nalddar the son of Hiletroy was a seasoned warrior, even if his age didn't let on. He had trained with Raykuan and Hiletroy on many occasions in the Dungeons of Nagafen, known as the Solusek's lairs, in the heart of the Lavastorm Mountains. He was young at the age of thirty, but well versed in combat.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan and Hiletroy watched as the two rode off toward Lava Storm mountains. Hiletroy noticed Raykuan had a concerned look on his face.
<br />

<br />
"What is it Raykuan? I have fought by your side since Innoruuk knows when, I have not seen you so troubled." Hiletroy said with concern.
<br />

<br />
"I fear the worst is yet to come for our way of life Hiletroy. The gods have abandoned us, our people are scared, and we may lose this war. If this mission does not succeed, what will become of our race?" Raykuan questioned.
<br />

<br />
"Well then, lets not fail. Lets get to work." Hiletroy said with charisma.
<br />

<br />
"Your right, time to let all of Norrath know who we are." Raykuan said with a new found confidence."Gather the army."
<br />

<br />
Raykuan saw Tsara standing at the entrance to the city looking over the crowd of Dark elves gathered to battle. She had a smile upon her face as she met Raykuan's eye. Hiletroy saw the look on Raykuans face lose its confidence as he stared at Tsara.
<br />

<br />
"You know, just because she says she knows what is to come, does not mean she does." Hiletroy said and then walked off to gather the men.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan walked up to Tsara." If our mission doesn't succeed I want you to seal this entrance so no one can get in." Raykuan ordered Tsara.
<br />

<br />
"Oh I planned on it, you will not succeed, I have for seen your death Raykuan I'xion. You will die like the fool you are." Tsara threatened Raykuan.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan grabbed Tsara and pulled out his sword meeting her face with the tip. A trickle of blood dripped down her face. "I could kill you right now, did you foresee that?" Raykuan said with deep anger.
<br />

<br />
Tsara laughed and pushed the sword away from her face. She wiped the blood from her cheek and licked it off her finger."I am not going to die today Raykuan, and either are you. But mark my words. This pathetic army of yours will not triumph over our enemies." Tsara smirked evilly and turned and walked back into the city.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan turned and noticed all the men looking up at him. He quickly gathered himself and met his men with stearn eyes, the crowd was silent, waiting for his orders.
<br />

<br />
Raykuan began."Dark elves of Neriak!" He barked. "It has been long since we have put the fear in the races of Norrath, too long. But today marks the dawn of a new era. Today we will make the orcs, and the ogres and whoever else wants to challenge us cower to our feet like the rats they are!" Raykuan yelled as the crowd cheered. "Now is our time! Some may ask, why have the gods abandoned us. They are testing us. Let us prove to them we are worthy, for today we will strike fear into the world again." Raykuan shouted as the crowd cheered louder than before.
