							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">In terms of concentration use, I have always been a buffing (vs debuffing) dirge. All five of my concentration points have been used by buffs. Anytime I have tried the opposite, replacing some or all with concentration using debuffs, I have noticed little/no/negative improvement.
<br />

<br />
However, with my play style (often long fights against near even or higher con mobs--often small groups) I have found the lvl 41 Bria's finally has an important spot in the mix. I am using it more often to keep from going oop.
<br />

<br />
That said, I now have a spare conc. point to throw around. I have been experimenting with mitigation debuff, slow, decrease str/agi. I think I have an answer, but I wondered if anyone else has any insights? Of course if you feel dropping Har's and doing all 3 debuffs is better, feel free to state your case.
<br />

<br />
(I mit debuff on single mobs, slow large groups, str/agi debuff late in the fight on groups of 2 or more).<br />_________________<br />Krescendo, 44 Kerran Dirge--Faydark

Bria's because you have an extra spot.

JMoA, unless you are really sweeting the 7 more to a stat.

Proc song, because it isn't broken anymore.

Drop Bria's for Resists if a noxious mob that actually hurts.

If under 45, drop proc for Clara's.

<br />
Raid/Kite, drop least needed remaining buff for level 40 training option Selo's.

<br />

<br />
Now, level is everything... in your 20s, you just do what you can do.  In your 30s, this means more, you really can turn the fight and your choices affect the outcome of the group.  In part, this extended a little bit into the 40s.
<br />

<br />
In your late 40s, you could turn off all your buffs, put someone on autofollow, leave autoattack off, and go watch TV and no one would notice.
<br />

<br />
In fact, true story... several people would comment on how much your buffs help, and the tank would comment on your high caliber of play that night... since you did not grab aggro once.<br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sonsi Carns

							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Steppy, I guess I just need to experiment more. It is probably partially because  I am often the main dps guy in my groups (thats a pally/dirge/cleric only). I am just not noticing the difference. In addition, my party buffs never get resisted...on mobs a level or two higher and especially 50+ raid mobs (im 43 at the moment) sticking debuffs is sometimes difficult to darn near impossible.
<br />

<br />
Maybe I'm just lazy and looking for an excuse to leave the group buffs up and just run my specials routine. I am gonna play around some more.  I know the type groups I am in affect my perceptions. The tuff encounters for me seem more like hanging in there till the mob(s) is oop, then kicking the crap out of him.  
<br />

<br />
Debuffing mobs have taught me there is some value to going in full group buffs, then swapping to mob debuffs when they are lop/oop. Maybe switching on purpose might give me some insights.
<br />

<br />
Mog... being 43 I haven't really noticed a falloff yet, other than, perhaps the mobs health bard not dropping as much on my specials.
<br />

<br />
I wonder....could it be like EQI where we would hit the level wall, stat buffs would push past the "soft cap" making the increments we are adding nearly useless? I suppose a similar situation could exist for our debuffs as well...the mobs keep scaling but we are capped.
<br />

<br />
Maybe the coming expansion will help, maybe they'll balance a bit. I for one appreciate those who push the limits and find the flaws. I can't help but benefit the rest of us...hang in there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WARNING: HAPPY PLAYERS DO NOT READ HERE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br />

<br />
We rock, completely rock, the lower levels because once we get all our skills by the late 20s, we have all the tools we need to make our groups GOOD.  It does not take much to push an average level 30 into extrodinary.  A few stats, a few skills, and bit more damage per hit... boom, our group becomes the best night of everyone's careers.
<br />

<br />
We increase group DPS some much that we are the undisputed kings of DPS.
<br />
We increase tanking ability so much that it can be argued that we are equal to the tank we work our miracles through.
<br />
We make healing both more powerful, and less needed.  We even have a little ability in replacing the power needed to heal.
<br />

<br />
After having been a bard, I cannot fathom trying to survive in the 20s and 30s without a bard in the group.  I mean, is it even possible?  Our power is unquestioned.  Groups we decide to join should build shrines in our honor.
<br />

<br />
However, the game grows exponentially and our skills grow linearly.  Our trivial yet useful buffs like Bria's become drop in the ocean.  Our awesome abilities like Skills and Clara's become as trivial as the 2 points a tick Bria's was.
<br />

<br />
Players also get better gear, since they aren't going to outlevel it.  They have thier full spell lines.  They have gear which returns 4 times as much power as your Bria's.  They have traditions and items and other classes buffs which overpower your own skill buff.  Haste is virtually meaningless... with the amount of power regen they have, they never fall to autoattack only.  The only class that gets most of its damage from autoattack is, ironically, the bard.  Our proc song is half that of what is found on the most common of weapons.  Our stat buffs meant a lot more when they added up as much as the combined stats of the player's gear.  At 50, they add against 2 pieces of gear... and sometimes come up short.
<br />

<br />
Disconte never really meant all that much.  That is the diplomatic answer.  The real answer is that the spell has never once done a single thing as no one really believes MOBS even have attribute stats.  If they do, the formula does not make use of them.
<br />

<br />
Our slow fails to affect MOB CAs, which are the primary source of MOB damage.  This is to be considered unimportant, as there is a common hex doll that lets every player in the game cast a slow 1% less than our own.
<br />

<br />
Clara's for the longest time, was the ultimate saving grace of the Dirge.  It increased the group's DPS by about 20%.... HUGE.  Sadly, this spell is last upgraded at the end of the 30s, early 40s, I do not recall it has been so long.  I think it is 30s... it is blue on my bar, and I never have to locate the lower version when I mentor.  Sadly, it is tuned to those late 30s mobs.  The more powerful low 40s mobs aren't taking 20% more damage, but it is still acceptable.  Then, in the late 40s-50s... it just doesn't do much of anything at all.  Yes, if you parse it, it will still make the group do a LITTLE bit more damage.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, the obvious answer is, yes... we do in fact still stack with all these other things.  Having us in the group should still make the other 5 players even better than without us.  However, that is only surface deep.
<br />

<br />
Your buffs are trivial in impact.  The gear that makes them so uber now is accounted for in Mob Ability.  Your buffs and debuffs no longer move the scale past the bump... they barely move the scale at all.
<br />

<br />
So now you turn to your DPS as an equalizer.  While never something to write home about, your DPS was never laughable.  However, you will now find your personal DPS beaten not by just DPS classes... you are now in an unfamiliar realm, fighting the Priests and enchanters to stay out of last place.
<br />

<br />
Evac, the grand power of the scout, is now on every class and their brother.  Damn you cruel fates, as the ultimate power of the bard made evac almost unnessacary before... but now when we reach for you, we find it gone.  Disarming traps is hardly the danger it was before.  Safe Fall?  Pathfinding?  Nothing there.  JMoA got your guild JBoots... 10 levels ago.  They don't even wear the boots anymore...
<br />

<br />
Wait, we got something.... rez!  We got an awesome in combat rez, better than what preists get... we can rez those that fall while the priest never stop healing!!!  Except in most cases, once someone falls, its over.  Either you can rez and evac, or wipe.  Then an FD class pops up, rezzes the healer, and the raid pops back up.  Hardly an ability to build a case over at 44... would have been really welcome about 24.
<br />

<br />
SIX spots, total, in the group.  Add it up.  You no longer bring enough to the table.  Your personal DPS is lower than the broken summoner pet classes pets.  Your utility is about as high.
<br />

<br />
My guild still likes grouping with me.  Maybe they are remembering the old times.  Maybe they don't know that they are uber and I am not.  Maybe they are just being nice.  Maybe I am wrong.
<br />

<br />
What I do know is that they no longer have to hold off an event if the bard is not there.  They have a higher rate of success or an easier time on the same mobs when I am not present.  And when I look at the numbers, I feel like a total leech, like I have someone better's spot.
<br />

<br />
That feeling is making me have no fun.  They are supposedly adding my race to the game this week.  If they had locked an elf, riots would have broken out.  Lock the frog and barely a whimper.
<br />

<br />
The issue is there is absolutely no chance that i will be making a scout of any type.  My entire decisionmaking is between Warden and Warlock.
<br />

<br />
Is there anyone out there planning on making a dirge or troub on Befallen some time this week?  I would really hate to level to 40 without one.<br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sonsi Carns

As long as you are getting groups and having fun does it really matter that we aren't quite fixed at the higest end atm?  Yes I've heard from you here and from other Dirges from other boards about how the higher end game breaks us.  But all of them say the same thing.  I still get groups all the time without any issue and they all ask if it's because people are just being nice.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps it's because we aren't as broke (yes we do have issues though I easily admit) as you feel we are?  Perhaps we are, I'm just saying there must be a reason why I have had to turn down invites for mid 40s areas already when I'm just sitting at level 39.  Or why when I log in my guild snaps me up.  I don't go LFG for long ever.  I think the most I have ever been flagged as such is around 30 minutes, and that was because I wasn't actively looking.
<br />

<br />
In the end I'm going to continue to look at these posts as just more of the same.  I've read posts about this and about that yet in game I've seen the exact opposite.  I've read about how Furies are broke as healers yet when I group with my guildmate I feel way more productive than before.  I've read how Brawler classes don't make decent tanks yet have had hours worth of fun doing high con groups with them.  The list goes on with things that I've read but haven't seen in game.  For now I'm just going to have to list this as yet another though.
<br />

<br />
I seriously hope though that either you can come to accept the fallbacks of the high end Dirge or at least move on to another class for now.  The game is about having fun and if you aren't, I hope you can find it.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /><br />_________________<br /><A HREF="http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/pplayer.vm?characterId=191894106">Weep</A>

<br />

<br />
Consider this. Sony has a history of ignoring problems until there is a great uproar. Historically, Bard type characters, because, I think, they are played by some of the most skilled and cunning individuals (myself excluded) have alsways pushed the envelope and been the subject of "balancing" nerfs.In addition, low population classes often get ignored.  EQI had/has a long history of having weak classes at certain levels...when it goes on long enough those guys get a rep as perpetual LFG's.
<br />

<br />
If you sit back and be complacent, and your class is weak, eventually every finds out and you will be perpetually lfg.
<br />

<br />
Remember, you (and I) are comparing experiences way before these shortcoming evidently become apparent.  Maybe when we have worn those shoes for a while they'll rub a few blisters on us?
<br />

<br />

<br />
Last night my pc locked up in Permafrost, by the time I got back in I had the pleasure of watching my group go without me on a group with several giants. They were falling noticeably slower than when I was in group. It was very gratifying. It was late and I should have bowed out, but I was happy to be a useful part and rejoined....there was rejoicing. I really enjoy watching a mobs exp bar move when my special lands.
<br />

<br />
What would I have done if I had come back and gotten the comment, "wow, we never noticed you were gone!", or if I had made the same observation myself?
<br />

<br />
I for one don't wanna be a eunich (sic?) sucking exp off a group of guildmates/friends. I am really happy to have Mog rail against the system and maybe get it fixed before it affects me!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Oh, side note and back to the original thread....I was grouped with higher level troub last night. That gave me the opportunity to do much more debuffing than I usually do. Yes, I saw a lot of utility in my debuffs. However, I didn't get to compare me full buffing to full debuffing. We had two healers so mob attack debuffs were kind of pointless.....but, in so much as a person my age and disposition can keep an open mind, I am doing so, lol.<br />_________________<br />Krescendo, 44 Kerran Dirge--Faydark

<br />
For me atm it seems either one of two things is happening.  Most people are happy with their Dirges at the high end, or the players who are level 50 just aren't actively voicing their concerns.  Having played MMORPGs for all this time now I just have a hard time believing that those players who are already level 50 and have been there for months wouldn't be making a bigger noise.  Perhaps for whatever reason the EQII community is different in that aspect, but I doubt it.

I understand this as well.  It's just again, there isn't a vocal outcry.  It's the same few people yelling.  Yet everything I've seen otherwise says that besides some obvious problems the class is playable and it is valued by other players.
<br />

<br />
I know I'm only 39 but again I've been invited to group with people in their mid 40s out of the blue.  "Sorry, I know you weren't LFG there but you wouldn't happen to want to join us in CT would you?"  Stuff like that just doesn't happen to friends who aren't a bard.  They go LFG and sit for an hour or two at times instead.  You yourself mention that you had a group notice that you were gone and were thrilled when you came back.  I've seen the same and I just don't see how it goes from being a valued member of a group to being a autofollow leech as continues to be the idea being continually espoused here.
<br />

<br />
I already see many things I wish were fixed myself.  Our spells don't scale well at all with most of our buffs being pointless to raise past Adept 1 if even to that point.  I hear that we loose some considerable damage compared to other classes in the 45+ game as well which I hope gets fixed with the Combat Updates.  We also have some serious power issues which I've suffered from the entire game which I hope might get looked at though I doubt it.  (been killing in Ferrott ever chance I get now for Robe of Invoker quest starter...)
<br />

<br />
In the end though at this point I'm seriously happy with the class regardless of the flaws that I see.  I don't want to be a leech not helping my groups either.  But I have seen pretty much no evidence that it is happening at this point and I'm just tired of seeing the same exact people on the official boards and these repeatedly harping on how we should all just quit now.  
<br />

<br />
It's so bad that people actually make posts saying 'Any hope for Dirges in sight?' on the official boards like we suck...  That's all this campaign of spam is really doing.

							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I realize I'm only level 33 which means a lot of higher level scouts will instantly discount what I say, but the fact is, I know the EQ universe pretty well.  I played a bard in EQ1 for over 4 years, killed most of the Norrath gods during my tenure there, and led raids in a POP-capable small guild.  So I think I have a good conceptual grasp of how classes work together and how they add value in this game.
<br />

<br />
That said, I'm uncomfortable with what I see ahead for my character.  Understand that right now, I enjoy this game quite a bit.  In groups, I make a very significant contribution and I'm capable of soloing mobs two or three levels above me with minimal difficulty.  But sometimes when you hear complaints, you write it off as malcontents sounding off or whiners unhappy with their situation.  Other times, as has usually been the case on this message board, the concerns come backed with facts and numbers.  What Sonsi has been saying about dirges in EQ2 is very similiar, in fact, to what Thott used to write about bards in the first couple of years of EQ1 -- bottom line, what it comes down to is that Sony has never let the power of utility classes scale at the same rate as the specialists.
<br />

<br />
Let me be specific -- the durability of a tank increases far faster per level than ours does.  The damage output of a wizard/warlock increases far faster per level than ours does.  Okay, you point out that that is the primary thing they do - that we shouldn't be as good at those things as they are.  I totally agree.  I should have a lower damage output, for example, than a level 33 warlock.  But at level 50, my damage should be PROPORTIONALLY as inferior to a warlock's as it is now, instead of comparing far worse than it does now.  The things I do to enhance a group now should be proportionally AS SIGNIFICANT at level 50 as they are at level 33.  And it is pretty obvious from the posts of the guys who are already level 50 that it isn't.
<br />

<br />
So I guess what I am saying is that they have some very valid concerns and I share them.
<br />

<br />
However, my conclusions are different because I've always been one of those crazy optimistic "glass-half-full" kinda guys, even when dealing with Sony.  This game is six months old.  That seems like a lot of time, but there are still not that many 40+ dirges in the game and the data that it takes to narrow down and make the adjustments needed are hard to gather in just 6 months live.  The fact is, there will be a lot more live updates before we can close the book on Sony's willingness to make scouts in general and dirges specifically more viable classes, at least in my opinion.  I think the process of adjusting, balancing, and tweaking classes is far from over.  We won't agree with all of the changes.  But I sincerely believe that if we ARE significantly less than effective in the high end-game raids, there will necessarily be changes down the road.
<br />

<br />
In the meantime, I understand the frustrations of those who are there.  That's the price you pay for being one of the first of your class to hit the high end-game.  Not even the best programmers can accurately anticipate the evolution of player tactics and group dynamics in an MMORPG.  Should we expect Sony to have done a better job?  Possibly so.  Are there going to be more changes down the line?  Without question.  Will that make scouts and bards in particular better class choices in the future?  That remains to be seen.  But know this: customer relations people and programmers read class-specific boards.  People like Sonsi, no matter how negative and frustrated they may become, provide essential, valid, and highly needed input for those people.  I WANT devs and CS people to read Sonsi's comments and understand that he is frustrated.  I want them questioning why this is. 
<br />

<br />
It offers hope that when I hit 50 this will be an even better game.<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://www.mausturm.com/EQ2/images/dingsig1.jpg"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Thott was capable of logging data and then expanding on that with well written thoughts on what exactly was broke and how best to go about fixinig it while still maintaining a decent balance compared to other classes.  Sonsi so far has attempted to do the same but it just comes off as somebody who hates the class he plays while souring those who are leveling up to it as well.  That's the thing that has bugged me most.  Not that he seems to generally care for the class and is trying to get it fixed, but that he is spreading a myth about how we are useless from 40 on.
<br />

<br />
I totally believe people when they say there are problems at the higher end and as I said I already have seen some of them with the way our (de)buffs don't scale well.  But there are better ways to get things fixed then to have 'SOE tells the Dirge, "SQUEAL LIKE A PIG!' as part of his sig on the official boards.  Or to answer a post questing Troub or Dirge with, "Reroll something that is NOT a scout before it is too late.".  Both of those things do nothing to advance the class or any forthcoming fixes to the class.
<br />

<br />
So yes while I do appreciate his zeal for the class and his apparent wanting to get things fixed, he honestly is doing more harm than good imo.  Constant spam on the official boards and here telling people to reroll, quit while they are ahead, etc.  He even goes so far as to argue with people from other classes who come to say that Dirges are far from worthless in their opinion.  He atm does nothing for the class except to further the idea by those who group with us that we are indeed worthless, and to make the numbers who do play our class lesser which makes it less likely to see timely fixes.  Yes he is a loud enough voice that the devs notice, but at the same time so does everybody else which is the problem in my eyes.
<br />

<br />
So if he wants to play the melodramatic savior role and claim he is done trying to save the class then oh well.
<br />

<br />
Ps, anybody that discounts what you have to say because of your level Steppy is a fool.  You were by far one of the best things about Diva when I still played EQ1.

							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Fact is do i think dirges are useless no.....do i still like my class???? I indeed do i love my dirge! I just wish somethings were a little more consistent. My major gripe is the fact that we dont really stand out from troubs, we are seen as run speed.  And the sad but true fact is that at lvl 50 the run speed aint all that helpful anymore. I look forward to more scout balancing and i hope that the dirge is thrown some more bones in the future. 
<br />

<br />
I think that we are still a useable class, but that is only because there are not many of us at high levels, so we never really have to worry about stacking issues.  Now if there becomes more lvl 50's which indeed there are starting to be many more then the problems are going to start arising where we are not that useful. Raid situations, there imo is only really room for 1 dirge in the raid. Our mana regen is grp only and a coercer/illusionist is not so they can easily give crack to all raid members and theirs is much better. Claras is are only debuff worth using, and in raid situations it wouldnt stack with another dirge.
<br />

<br />
The main thing i think that bugs me however is the fact that we just dont stand out from a troub, and most of are good spells dont stack with them.  Trust me this is not a rant about troubs and i do not want to see troubs nerfed i think they are actually very well balanced atm.  I just dont see us being able to do anything that they cant. Our songsters luck line does not stack with a toub and they get the same spell, our mana regen does not stack with a troub and they get that spell too.  They also get the same debuff line(discante) as we do. We both get a haste line and they do stack unfortunatly they are pretty much useless unless at master 1 lvl.  We get our stat song buffs that does stack with them which is very nice, however with this song you will see no upgrade after lvl38 and the upgrade is not very useful because most of the time you will be using JMOA.  Our one saving grace and i thank soe for that is having by far the best REZ in the whole game. No healer can even touch our rez a 15 sec recast in combat rez that rezs at 44% health and power. The downside of this however is that it says specificaly in the description that it is not supposed to be in combat which I am very surprised has not been nerfed yet. I do see this coming in the near future though <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> . While we get this and claras....troubs get a mana drain, mana drain on almost all there attacks, the ability to stack stat buffing songs, many increase to defensive abilities on there songs,  can increase arcane and elemental dmg mitigation, and the ability to mez.
<br />

<br />
I really just want a dirge to stand out more, i think sonsi is very correct in saying at lvls 25 to early 40 range dirges are out standing at standing out however after that 40 mark none of there bread and butter spells upgrade and if they do it is a very minimal upgrade.  I think post lvl 40 some work will need to be done to help the dirge stand out from its alter-ego the troubador. This could be only me thinking this, however i repeat i do not think that the fix to this is changing anything on a troubador they are balnced imo. I think we need more spells like lanets, claras, and things of that nature to show what a dirge is really for.  Bottom line post 40 we increase grp dps% by a very small amount when compared to earlier lvls.
