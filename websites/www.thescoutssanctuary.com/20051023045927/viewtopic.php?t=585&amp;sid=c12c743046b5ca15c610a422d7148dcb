<br />

<br />
CJ Tinkerman was well known for his craftiness - both as a merchant and as an artisan. And today would be no different, he told himself, fastening on his fine leather belt with the gem-studded gold buckle.
<br />

<br />
As he arrived downstairs at his shop, he found everything in its place. Just as it should be. Hopefully he wouldn't be interrupted by any fools today. Freeport was becoming a cesspool of evil idiots. Everyone thinking they were some kind of demonic hero. Idiots, all of them!
<br />

<br />
The arrogant gnome smiled to himself. He took such pleasure in toying with them, especially the larger brutes -- plenty of strength in their arms, but nothing in their heads! They were such easy marks...
<br />

<br />
He sat on his stool near his workbench. The intricate mechanisms he was inventing would certainly be greatly valued. The pompous half elven female had no idea what she was getting. But it really didn't matter to him. The "Lady", as she had introduced herself, probably had no idea how this new dagger would work. And quite frankly, he didn't care if she did or not. He would take her money... any day. And of course, he would charge her too much - again. Why she foolishly returned again and again was amazing.
<br />

<br />
"Little One," hissed a voice from behind him. CJ nearly jumped out of his skin. Turning so abruptly that he almost lost his balance and fell off his stool, his tool dropping to the table with a dull clink.
<br />

<br />
"How dare you enter my shop and disrupt make work!" he screeched. "Get back behind the counter at once!" he shouted. 
<br />

<br />
But the dark stranger did not move, standing still with his head bowed and eyes closed. CJ usually was not disturbed by the useless fodder that came through his door, but this one gave him pause. There was something different about him...
<br />

<br />
He was a dark elf male with long white hair streaked with lavender gray. He was a bit taller than most, but still slender. He was clad all in dark leathers: tunic, trousers, boots and bracers. He wore a hooded cloak of dull charcoal gray, with the hood pushed back. The intricate designs on his chest armor were highlighted in blood red runes. Runes he did not recognize.
<br />

<br />
Slowly the stranger raised his handsome face. When he opened his eyes, CJ caught his breath. Never had he seen such cold empty orbs -- and yet -- they were like clear green emeralds. Not dark in color, but very dark in nature. And the hint of a smile on this dark one's face...
<br />

<br />
"Move behind the counter," CJ reiterated, although not quite as forcefully as before. "If you would, malevolent one."
<br />

<br />
"I have need of a special item... a lightweight, silvered dirk of sorts. It must be of the finest quality and perfectly balanced. The blade must be sharper than the sharpest razor and never go dull," whispered the stranger, his haunting eyes boring into CJ mind. Most gnomes would have been already dead from fear, but CJ was accustomed to being threatened. But somehow he realized that he wasn't exactly in danger... yet.
<br />

<br />
"Are you capable?" continued the dark one.
<br />

<br />
"Capable!? Capable? How dare you ask the Mastersmith of Freeport if he is capable! I won't even answer that foolish question," CJ responded indignantly. He saw the momentary flicker in the clear green eyes of this would-be customer. Was it anger? Arrogance? Confusion? It didn't matter. Once again, he would outsmart this patron, just like he alway did with his weak-minded customers.
<br />

<br />
"When will it be done?" was the whispered reply. "I pay well for quality work when completed properly." The stranger produced a parchment from somewhere within his cloak and placed it on the counter. "Use this as your guide."
<br />

<br />
Who was this arrogant dark elf? How dare he insinuate incompetence? Who did he think he was to tell a master how to create art? CJ continued to hold his own, but had to consciously push back the tinges of fear that crept out of the dusty corners of his mind. He did not like being intimidated!
<br />

<br />
"It will be done when it is done. The price will be determined when it is delivered. Agreed?" was all he said. Then he crossed his arms on his chest. He would not be bullied today.
<br />

<br />
"Agreed," replied the stranger calmly, his unnerving gaze never leaving the face of the little artisan. Not even a flicker of emotion.
<br />

<br />
"Now, I'll need you to get me some things," CJ began to instruct, looking back at his table to quickly inventory a few items.
<br />

<br />
But there was no response. Looking around, the gnome found himself alone once more.
<br />

<br />
"Arrogant idiot, scaring me like that. Well, he shall pay for that disrespect! Oh yes, he will pay dearly, indeed," he confided to himself. "And I'll charge him extra for forcing me to use my own stockpiles!" Then he returned to his work. He would show that imbecile who was the master here!
<br />

<br />
Everyday for the next week, the dark stranger would quietly appear, at the same early morning hour and ask only one hushed question: "Is it done?"
<br />

<br />
And each day for seven days, CJ Tinkerman issued a negative reply. These repeated visits began to bother him a little, so on the eighth day after the now-expected visit, he decided that he would complete the silver dirk at all cost. And so he worked late into the night. Only the candles outlasted him.
<br />

<br />
With the dawning of the ninth morning, he awoke at his table, still dressed in his work clothes, gripping the polishing cloth.
<br />

<br />
On the workbench lay one of the most exquisite silver daggers he had ever created. Truly this was a masterpiece, he told himself. Why, he should be awarded a prize for such a beautiful work of art!
<br />

<br />
"Is it done?" came the voice from behind.
<br />

<br />
"How long have you been standing there?" the surprised, but not startled gnome asked.
<br />

<br />
The stranger said nothing more, but held out his left hand, palm up. CJ grasped the new dagger and held it tightly.
<br />

<br />
"500 platinum," he stated firmly, hoping to stun the dark elf. But instead, the stranger simply removed a pouch, opened it and poured the contents on the counter next to the craftsman. Large gems glistened in the early morning light that danced through the windows.
<br />

<br />
"Give me the dagger." 
<br />

<br />
CJ complied, handing it over cautiously, as if presenting the most rare of artifacts.
<br />

<br />
The stranger took the dagger and balanced it on one finger, standing it upright. A drop of blood formed where the blade touched the dark elf's finger. The dirk seemed to stand still all on its own.
<br />

<br />
"This should be adequate," said the stranger and turned to leave.
<br />

<br />
"Adequate?" roared the suddenly offended gnome. "Adequate? How dare you insult me!"
<br />

<br />
"Heed my word, Little One. Keep the gems and forget me," replied the dark one menacingly. "It would be best." Then the stranger silently slipped out of the door.
<br />

<br />
CJ harrumphed. That's the last time I'll see him, he consoled himself. Then gazing greedily at his new treasure he chuckled to himself. "Stupid elf! He left more in gems than that dagger is worth... What an idiot - just like all the others!" He allowed himself a little laugh.
<br />

<br />
Then he returned to his other work. "What a fool..." he murmured, shaking his head, then focusing on the piece of metal in his skilled hands.
<br />

Among the Guild Halls of Freeport, it was not the most noticeable entrance on the streets.  And the guild members preferred it that way.  There were plenty of showy, self-promoting groups calling themselves guild in this “free” society.  Most were busy trying to have the most members.  Some were focused on wealth and fame.  But behind the doors of this particular guild hall, those who attended planned for a different influence.
<br />

<br />
The talented group of guild masters and patrons meeting tonight were not concerned with becoming the largest guild in the domain of the fallen paladin.  And to the casual observer, this guild certainly did not appear to be the wealthiest.
<br />

<br />
“That arrogant tinkerer has insulted me for the last time,” the attractive half elf female declared.  She was a striking young woman, well-dressed, with a certain air of command and respect about her.  She stood up from her chair in the circle.  “It is time he learn a lesson!”  She turned and began to pace across the room.
<br />

<br />
The Iksar hissed his ascent and moved uncomfortably in his chair.  “Enough words!  We should act!”  The bloodlust was rising in him again.  Oh how he would relish resolving this problem…
<br />

<br />
“I’d rather just split his skull and be done with it!” grumbled the massive warrior, flexing the fingers of his axe-wielding hand.  His ancestors had lived in Halas long ago.  His prowess was well-known in Freeport, although his ties to any guild were only rumors in the street.  “But exactly how do you propose we deal with this little vermin?”
<br />

<br />
“His tongue he does not seem to tame, should he lose it there is no shame, for those who like to taunt and tease, should suffer horribly, as we please,” one of the others in the room outside the circle spoke clearly but quietly.  “I say we teach him a lesson.  One he will never forget.”
<br />

<br />
“Bash his head in and be done with it,” muttered a large ogre with disgust in his eyes.
<br />
 
<br />
“And what do you think, Lady?” asked the robed Erudite sitting in the circle to the left of the barbarian.  He remained calmly watching the woman move away while listening to the comments of the others.
<br />

<br />
She stopped and turned back towards the others.  “Killing him outright would certainly be satisfying.  Killing him slowly would be even more so… I have an idea… a special assignment for one of our newer members.”  Gaining confidence in her thoughts as they crystallized, she returned to the circle of chairs.
<br />

<br />
All eyes were on her as she sat down.  She spoke quietly, but steadily, as she presented her idea to the others.  As she explained her thoughts, the countenances of the others began to brighten with understanding and appreciation.
<br />

<br />
After a short while, the meeting adjourned.  It was time to blend in with the shadows of the night.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Chapter Three</span></span>
<br />

<br />
Another day dawned in the chaotic city of Freeport.  CJ Tinkerman came down his stairs to begin his daily work as the greatest artisan in the city.  At least, that was his personal opinion of his talent.  As he admired the new ring on his finger, he smiled at how successful he was at separating fools from their money.  And all he had to do was create articles that they wanted and then convince them that they were somehow worth more than they were.  He was definitely beginning to see the benefits of becoming a mage!
<br />

<br />
As he sat down at his workbench, he noticed that his tools were not in their proper places.  Something was definitely not right!  He always replaced every tool, every item and every material back in its proper place each night.  He was sure he had returned everything last night.  He was positive…
<br />

<br />
“Little One.”  It was a statement.  No emotion, no feeling.
<br />

<br />
The gnome turned slowly, recognizing the familiar voice of his most annoyingly persistent customer.  “What is it that you want now, my green-eyed shadow?”
<br />

<br />
“I am not a shadow,” was the quiet reply.  “I am less than a shadow…”
<br />

<br />
The short artisan slid off of his stool and stood facing the dark elf.  “So, what do you want?” CJ inquired.
<br />

<br />
“I have something to sell you,” the dark-leather clad figure replied.
<br />

<br />
“I’m not interested.  Unless you wish to have me create something for you, I have no time for you.  There are more important things to do today,” the gnome sneered condescendingly.
<br />

<br />
“I have tools to trade.”
<br />

<br />
CJ Tinkerman was not a tall creature, but the statement caused him to bristle, standing as erect as possible.  He turned and asked, “What tools?”
<br />

<br />
He suspected he knew the answer.  “Cowardly thief, stupid fool,” he thought.
<br />

<br />
Reaching into his cloak, the dark elf retrieved a leather bag.  Opening the bag, he held it out to the craftsman to examine.
<br />

<br />
“Thief!” shouted the enraged gnome.  “These are already mine!”  Then, thinking for a moment and letting his emotions calm, he continued, “I will not pay you for these.  But perhaps I will give you a reward – as a show of gratitude for meddling… um, I mean, your help in recovering them.”
<br />

<br />
The little tinker removed a single platinum piece from his belt and held it up.  The dark elf did not move.  He looked up into the dark elf’s face.  There were those penetrating green eyes, clear yet lifeless, showing no emotion whatsoever, staring back at him.
<br />

<br />
“I do not accept your platinum.”
<br />

<br />
“Suit yourself.  Now be gone, I have work to do for important people.”  The artisan began to turn when he felt the point of a blade, a very sharp blade, touch the soft skin of his neck, just below his right ear.  CJ Tinkerman the gnome froze.  His breathing changed.
<br />

<br />
“What is your life worth?” hissed the voice from behind.  “Be sure to value it as excessively as you do your craftsmanship.”
<br />

<br />
For the first time in his life, CJ Tinkerman had to think hard.  “If I say too much, he may kill me, just to find my treasure.  But if I set the price too low, he will think I am mocking him and kill me.  Hmmm…” he debated within himself.
<br />

<br />
“Well? What is the price?”  The voice had become menacing, hinting at the owner’s desire to shed blood.  The gnome had the distinct impression that if this would-be killer had a choice in the matter, he would already be dead… So, someone else was behind this… Quickly he decided what to do.
<br />

<br />
“I can create a dagger so exquisite that none could ever compare,” he was beginning to feel confident his clever approach.  “It will be worth more than 1,000 platinum!”  Perhaps this hesitant thief would take the bait, he thought.  “Let me live and I will double whatever you’ve been offered.  You can trust me, you know…”
<br />

<br />
And then his world went dark.
<br />

<br />
“Where am I?” the gnome thought hazily.  He strained to focus his eyes in the gray light, but it was difficult.  His glasses!  Where were his glasses?  No wonder things looked blurry.  And his head, the top of his head stung, as if it had been scraped raw.  His scalp began to throb in uncomfortable pain.  Thinking about the pain, he realized there was something on his head.  It felt like some kind of cloth… a strange hat, perhaps?  Or a bandage?  He tried to move but found that he could not.  He was being held in place by cords about his hands and feet.  He was trapped in this large wooden chair.
<br />

<br />
“Ah, so his mighty little lordship is awake, is he?”  A new voice, one he had not heard before, different.  “I see my brother has been very kind to you.  You’re lucky to be alive in one piece… well, mostly one piece!” the Iksar laughed.  “Well now, don’t go away… I’ll be back in a moment.”  
<br />

<br />
CJ saw the outline of a large Iksar as the light from the next room entered through the opening door.  Then it was darker again.  His mind began racing.  “Where am I?  What has become of me?” he pondered, striving to keep from panicking.  And then a terrible sinking sensation, almost a nausea swept over him as he realized what the Iksar had said:  “mostly one piece”.  He shuddered and started taking an inventory.  He felt for his fingers, wiggling each, and then his toes, and then his ears.  And then his head hurt again.  “Oh what have they done to me?”
<br />

<br />
A large wooden door opened, torches entered borne by two hooded figures.  Soon a fire was burning in a large fireplace, casting dancing shadows of firelight on the stone walls and across the wooden floor.  The torchbearers retreated from the room.  He was alone again.
<br />

<br />
After a while, (Was it an hour or two or three?  The gnome couldn’t tell…) the door opened again.  This time he could not tell who or what or how many entered.  He was sure that more than two or three had come into the room, but it was difficult to see in the shadows of the dying fire.
<br />

<br />
“Little One.”  His heart sank.  This was not the voice he wanted to hear.  “Welcome to a darkness.  Your days of deceit are ending.  Your days of service just beginning.”  It was the green-eyed dark elf, speaking softly into his left ear from behind.
<br />

<br />
“I… I don’t under… st… stand,” the small nervous craftsman ventured.
<br />

<br />
“Silence!” came the evil command of a woman’s voice.  CJ would have jumped, but couldn’t move.  So only his increasingly rapid beating heart did.  “You will not speak unless spoken to… do you understand, gnome?”  She spat out the words as if they tasted as vile as poison.
<br />

<br />
“Yes, of course,” he whimpered.  He raised his head trying to see who spoke.
<br />

<br />
“Yes, what!?” the female voice demanded.
<br />

<br />
“Yes, your… your…” he faltered, not knowing who he was addressing or what place this was.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly lightning flashed through his mind as his head jerked to the side.  He had been struck hard.  Hard enough to start bleeding on his cheek just below his left eye.
<br />

<br />
“You insolent speck of dust,” hissed another.  “How dare you mock our Lady.”
<br />

<br />
It was all the gnome could do to remain conscious.  “I’m sorry, sir,” was all he could manage.  He tried hard to focus on the shadows circling him, but it was too dim in this darkened chamber. 
<br />

<br />
Soon the shadows stopped dancing (or did they?) and he began to wonder what would happen next.  He wouldn’t have to wonder for long.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
Chapter Five
<br />

<br />
CJ the artisan awoke suddenly, confused and wondering where he was.  There was some light – a dim light coming in through a window… his window!  Could it be?  He squinted his eyes as best he could and scanned his surroundings.  It appeared to be early dawn and he was back in his own room!  All those terrible things, the dark room, the mysterious shadow figures, the chair… it must have been a nightmare!  That’s it.  It was just a silly nightmare!
<br />

<br />
“Well!” he thought as be began to sit up in his bed… HIS bed!  “I’m not going to be intimidated by any more shadowy patrons in my shop,” he began muttering to himself.  “From now on I’ll just… aaaaarrrgghhhh!”
<br />

<br />
The pain was unbearable.  Like jagged fangs piercing flesh, the pain attacked his feet.  Stabbing, then throbbing, then stabbing again.  He felt a little light-headed as he tried to adjust.  He started to remove his blanket and swing his feet around to get out of bed.   “Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!”
<br />

<br />
The wave of suffering that crashed against his mind nearly crushed him.  It was all he could do to focus his fading gaze on his feet – the source of the greatest pain.
<br />

<br />
“Nooooooooo!” he cried out in near hysteria.  Where were his little toes!?  All he saw was a bloody patch of torn skin on each foot where his little toes should have been.  As he realized what he was looking at, nausea washed over him.  He was drowning, fighting to keep his consciousness.  Exerting all of his will to stay awake, he tried to steady himself.  He didn’t dare move for fear of causing more pain.
<br />

<br />
Instinctively, he raised his hand to his head to run his fingers through his graying wavy hair.  But instead of hair, he encountered cloth.  “Oh no, no... it can’t be,” he thought, thinking that this was becoming the worst nightmare of his life.
<br />

<br />
“Little One.”  That horrible, hated voice!  The gnome jerked his head around to face the source of the sound, but there was no one there!  As he did, pain shot up his legs again, causing him to cringe.  And his head… the top of his head stung as if it had been scraped… or cut!  “No!  No!  This can not be happening,” he cried.  He reached up and grasped the cloth on his head.
<br />

<br />
The cloth on his head slipped away easily, as if an old bandage.  He carefully brought the rag in his hand around in front of his perspiring pale face.  There were traces of blood.  This cloth was indeed a bandage, of sorts.  But it was not made of the gauzy linen usually used for binding wounds.  This cloth was heavier, like canvas and was a completely foul lightless black.  And it smelled of dried blood.  Another wave of nausea washed over him.
<br />

<br />
Fearing what he might find, he dropped the cloth and raised his hand up to the crown of his head.  Moving carefully, as if he might encounter an intricate trap or a deadly sharp blade, he let his finger close in on his skull.
<br />

<br />
The master craftsman found no trap, no blade, and no hair.  As his fingertips touched the raw remnants of his skin, sending tinges of pain around his head, he realized to his total horror that he had no scalp.
<br />

<br />
It was all the poor little man could accept.  CJ Tinkerman passed out, draped across his bed like a worn out puppet.
<br />
 
<br />
Chapter Six
<br />

<br />
When he awoke again, the fading gray light in his room caused him to realize that it must be evening.  The throbbing dull pain coming from his feet and head told him that this was no nightmare.  “Oh, what has happened to me?”
<br />

<br />
“Little One.”  This time the voice was not whispered, but spoke quietly and firmly.  The sound came from his right.
<br />

<br />
CJ looked up at the stranger standing nearby, anger rising within him.  He sat up on the bed.  His rage would know no bounds, he would destroy all who did this to him.  He would kill…  
<br />

<br />
“I don’t think I like that look,” commented a casual feminine voice.   He looked to his left, and saw a hooded figure.  Dressed in an exquisite midnight blue robe, trimmed in gold embroidery, she pushed back her hood.  The gnome gasped as he looked up into her face.  It was the half elf Lady.  The one he had dreamed… no, no… the one he had seen in the darkened room.  His anger melted into fear.
<br />

<br />
“Well, we could always remove more items from this fellow,” offered the green-eyed dark elf in a menacing voice.  “I’m sure there are others who would like a souvenir.”
<br />

<br />
As he realized what was being said, not knowing what else to do, CJ Tinkerman the Gnome, master craftsman, begged for his life.
<br />

<br />
“Please, do not harm me.  I have been damaged enough,” he pleaded.  “Please.  I will do whatever you want, just don’t hurt me anymore.”
<br />

<br />
“Ah there.  You see,” said the Lady in midnight blue to her green-eyed colleague.  “He can be reasonable.  In fact, I think we should help this poor little man.”  She smiled a wickedly delicious grin, her eyes flashing with the sheer delight of what she was doing.
<br />

<br />
“What will you have me do, M’Lady?” the gnome asked humbly, bowing his aching head gingerly.  He knew he had lost.  He surrendered.
<br />

<br />
“And he’s learned some manners, too,” she pointed out, gesturing towards her victim as if the dark elf across the room cared.
<br />

<br />
She leaned in closer to the gnome and hissed venomously, “Listen to me, foolish knave.  You are now our servant and slave.  You will give us one half of all of your profits from this day forth.”  CJ’s mouth dropped open in shock.  How?
<br />

<br />
“Do not even think it!” she spat at him while landing a painfully glancing blow with the hilt of her dagger on his tattered skull.  “Cross us again and we will remove more bits of you.  Every time you disobey or think to deceive or cheat us, we will take another souvenir from your miserable little bag of bones!”
<br />

<br />
The gnome’s blanched expression showed that he fully understood.  This was no idle threat.  His life would be spared, but it would never be the same again.
<br />

<br />
“And another thing, Little One,” she glanced at her guildmate as she used of his favorite name for the gnome.  “You will use your artistic skills to craft whatsoever the officers and patrons of the Shadowfire Guild require.  Your payment for such services will be to keep your life.” 
<br />

<br />
With that she turned to leave the room.  Nodding, CJ watched silently as her dark elf companion backed towards the door, following her.
<br />

<br />
Just as she was about to leave, she turned, “Serve the Shadowfire well and live.  Cross the Shadowfire and burn in darkness.  It is your choice.”  She smiled and stepped through the darkened doorway.
<br />

<br />
“Little One,” the green-eyed dark elf smiled as he closed the door behind him.
<br />

<br />
Little One was alone.  His room was dark – darker that it had ever been before.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
THE END?
<br />
