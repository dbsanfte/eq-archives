							<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-style: italic">The bazaar has had a strange feeling of late, nothing perceptible to the naked eye, but nonetheless here. It is as if the air itself quivers with anticipation of some momentous event on the horizon. I can not stand by and allow this feeling to merely pass over, for it may extend from some very real force.
<br />

<br />
An old friend surprised me today, bringing back unpleasant memories from my days as a Reaver. It has been ages since I have recalled my ancient journey into the Plane of Hate.
<br />

<br />
	The fetid smells and the very feel of destruction in the air were like roses to me at the time. I barely remember the journey through the plane, so entranced by having receiving the honor of meeting the manifestation of my old deity. When I finally reached the throne of the most-high Innoruuk, I went to my knees, for his manifestation was overwhelming. I could feel the fear coming from him in amounts I could not even fathom. It was as if my dreams were finally coming to pass, and soon I would fulfill my life, and become a bane upon mortals. 
<br />
	
<br />
	A strange thing happened at that altar though, something I could not understand at the time. A voice deep within came audibly to me and said, “I am Nous, the creator of this universe, and I have need of you. A time will come when everything will change, and I require you to protect the mortals during that time. The Gods shall plot against the mortals, and alter their existence forever. I give you a choice now; follow this petty thing that is just as much my creation as you are, or follow me and I will make you my hidden general upon this dirt. The powers that I can give you would be the envy of these gods, but will pale in comparison to the gift that your heart truly seeks, to love and be loved. 
<br />

<br />
	At that very moment a tear fell from my eye, and in my soul I gave everything I had to this Nous. It seemed an eternity for which Nous explained my new duties, and powers, and then everything crashed back to the present. I rose steadily to my feet, looking with new eyes at these things I once held in such high respect. The putrid smell in the air made me nauseous, and I felt pity for the tormented souls displayed around this throne room of fear. One thing I no longer felt was fear; in fact I looked with new eyes upon the manifestation of Innoruuk, and felt nothing. This must have angered the deity, who slammed his fist down upon me, with enough force to level Felwithe. 
<br />

<br />
	To his eyes, he saw the mangled remains of a prideful Reaver, and smiled. Shortly thereafter he departed to some unknown plane. I smiled at the illusion on the floor, comparing it to an end of my old self. I merely envisioned the city of Freeport, and I was instantly there. Looking fondly upon the city gates, I floated up to one of the upper barracks, and made myself visible. I had chosen this spot, because of the lack of people, as well as the implications it had on my beginnings as a militiaman. 
<br />

<br />
	Nous had told me to walk the city as the new man I had become, and remember how things once were. As I passed by a long mirror in the barracks I gazed at it, not to surprised to see a reflection of me. But my image seemed much healthier, and I did something I could not remember doing in ages, I smiled. Also noticing my nakedness, I quickly envisioned a basic set of traveler’s garb, and it appeared, perfectly conforming to my body. One luxury I would allow myself was a pendant I envisioned, which appeared around my neck. On the pendant I formed an image of the gods and mortals standing as one, and Nous standing over them all. To the naked eye it would look like a blank pendant, but to anyone searching for something greater then themselves, they would see the image as it truly was meant to be seen.
<br />

<br />
	I casually walked down the barracks steps, and was questioned for only a moment by a member of the militia. He had been a friend when we were trainees at the militia hall, and when he finally realized it was me he broke down in tears and gave me a huge bear-hug. After chatting with him for a short time, giving him tidbits of adventures I had been through, excluding becoming a dark knight, I said my farewells and ventured into the common quarters of the city. The smells of sweet-breads and cakes brought back such pleasant memories from my days as a youth. I even recalled the once love of my life, Raven Birdsong, a half-elf whom I had fallen in love with in my youth. She had been singing such pleasant songs outside of the bakery one morning. I instantly fell in love, and made my way into the back door of Mrs. Doherty’s bakery, and asked her if she could spare me a cake in return for cleaning. She agreed to my request and I soon stood proudly before the heavenly half-elf and presented my gift. To my surprise she bowed, and took the cake and asked me if I wanted to go on a walk to the pier with her. I could barely stammer out a yes, and from that day on we were in love, barely ever away from one another. 
<br />
	
<br />
One morning we had an argument about my talking to the leader of the dark knight contingent. I had stormed out and never looked back, seething with anger over her lack of understanding. Leaving my post in the militia I led a life of death dealing, sparing not a single person, in my ultimate goal to become the greatest dark knight in existence. At that point I only sought power and the realization that one day I might meet Innoruuk, which came to pass. It did bring me to my knowledge of the truth, but I still wish I could change all that had happened.
<br />

<br />
Hearing some pleasant tunes, brought me back to reality, and I noticed I was in front of the bard’s hall. I quietly made my way through open door, and took a seat in the back row. The performer on stage was but a small girl, with flowing black hair, and garbed in the classic way of the bard’s; breeches, loose fitting shirt adorned with musical notes, and soft leather sandals. She sang rather elegantly, drawing much needed tears from my eyes, and a hearty clap from the crowd. When a teacher called the young lady Birdsong in applause, I froze in my seat. Gazing around the room, I looked for her, and my eyes stopped on the steps leading to the quarters above the stage. There sat my once beloved Raven Birdsong, still as beautiful as she always was, applauding her daughter, who returned it with a smile and ran to her mother, jumping into her arms. 
<br />

<br />
The sight dropped me to my knees, sobbing endlessly, until a hand touched my shoulder. I dared not look up, for I knew it was Raven by her touch, and I could see small feet next to hers, reminding me of the child that should have been mine. If this is what Nous meant for me to face, then I would face it with all of the might that I could be afforded. I slowly stood up, with my back still turned to Raven. Then I turned around, mustering something newfound since my entrance into the service of the creator. At first Raven did not recognize me, thinking me some stranger, finding the eloquent performance too much to handle. I smiled and asked her if she wanted some cake, and tears filled her eyes in a touching remembrance. She stood frozen, and I thought she might strike me, or tell the bards to remove me from the hall. Instead she flung her arms around me, and embraced me as though I were her only connection to life. I in turn embraced her, and we seemed to cry for an endless time.
<br />

<br />
	The bards around the room gave applause like no other, crying and weeping with us. As we slowly let go of each other I knew we both would have much to tell each other, and I wanted to meet the father of this child, and good husband of Ravens. It is almost as if she knew what I was thinking, and explained to me that she never met anyone who she could love again. It took a moment to dawn on me, then she said to her daughter, “Whisper, this is your father, Sanctus.” I did not know what to do, so I laughed, cried, jumped, and sang glory to the heavens for this joy. Whisper seemed to stare at me, with eyes like the depths of the ocean, and with tears flowing down her face she ran to me, and jumped into my arms crying from the years without a father. I embraced her and raven again, and knew this was what Nous meant by love, and I thanked him for it from the depths of my soul.</span></span><br />_________________<br />Live today,
<br />
Fight tommorow,
<br />
Love forever.
