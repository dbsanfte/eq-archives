<font color="#FF0000"><p align="center"><b>What is BAD?</b></p></font>

<p align="left">BAD is an old and well established online gaming Clan that creates an environment of fun, honorable gamesmanship,
support, loyalty, generosity and good humor for the benefit of its members.  As its name implies, the BAD
Clan shuns the darkness and embraces the light.  The Clan demands honorable play amongst its members, and
encourages kindness, nobility and fairness in the online world as a whole.</p>

<font color="#FF0000"><p align="center"><b>Who is BAD?</b></p></font>

<p align="left">BAD Clan members live all over the world what we have in common is our love of online
gaming.  We wish to enjoy the online world with our friends and provide a fun, safe and stimulating atmosphere in
which to play.  Many of our members have been playing together for years and all of our Founding Members are still
active in the guild.  BAD has a long time reputation for helpfulness and all Clan members share this quality.  
Fairness and generosity are also common BAD traits, along with a fierce protectiveness toward other Clan members. 
BAD is a family and we take care of our own.  Lighthearted humor and a
rollicking sense of good fun are universal BAD qualities, along with top notch
gamesmanship and mastery of game knowledge and play.</p>

<font color="#FF0000"><p align="center"><b>Structure and Government of BAD</b></p></font>

<p align="left">The BAD Clan is a democratic association.  Its leaders are elected from among those currently active players who have demonstrated their
experience, wisdom, willingness to serve and leadership abilities governmental structure of BAD is based
upon a triumvirate.  Each tier of leadership consists of three members or multiples of three. In most governmental matters,
the majority vote wins.</p>

<p align="left">The <u>Grand Elder Council</u> shall consist of three members
elected from among the collective leaders (Grand Council) of all the
game-realms in which BAD has an online presence.  The Grand Elder Council shall preside at meetings of the Grand
Council; shall be responsible for ratifying grand, sweeping changes in the
Guild affecting all game-realms; and shall serve as the Court of Final Appeal
for all disputes which are not resolved below.</p>

<p align="left">The <u>Grand Council</u> shall be comprised of all those Game
Council members duly elected as leaders by the players in each game-realm in
which the BAD Clan is currently active.  The Grand Council shall be collectively responsible for the maintenance
of BAD's philosophy of game-play; shall maintain and ensure that BAD's
rules and regulations are upheld; shall periodically review and ensure that the
governmental structure and rules of the Clan evolve dynamically to meet the Clan's needs; shall maintain the
guild-wide mailing list; shall oversee maintenance of BAD's website(s); and shall
nurture the health and growth of the Clan as a whole.</p>

<p align="left">The <u>Game Council</u> shall consist of three members duly
elected by all Clan players in a specific game-realm. Elections shall occur on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of March of every
calendar year.  The Game Council is
responsible for all game-specific issues, including but not limited to:
recruitment; maintaining the in-game treasury; maintaining the game-specific
website; maintaining the game-specific mailing list; resolving in-game
disputes; tagging new members; creating or dissolving formal guild-alliances;
providing leadership to new members; ensuring that BAD's philosophy of helpfulness, honor and fun is
sustained; encouraging and leading Clan hunts or events; safeguarding BAD's good reputation in the
game; and nurturing the health and growth of the Clan in the game.</p>

<p align="left">If a Game Council member resigns, an Interim Election will be
held immediately to fill the post.  In
the case of a Clan Crisis, an Interim Election may be called upon the majority
vote of all current Clan members in good standing within a game-realm. A Clan Crisis is simply any situation that
the <u>majority</u> of members in a game-realm DECIDE is a Clan Crisis.  In a Clan Crisis, the membership may also
vote upon the underlying issue which precipitated the Crisis and thereby reach
a solution satisfactory to the majority.</p>

<p align="left">The Game Council shall be responsible for Clan discipline and
will, in its sole discretion, apply the appropriate disciplinary step to fit
the seriousness of the transgression.  The disciplinary process takes the form of Warning, Censure, Probation, or
Banishment.  A Warning shall consist of
a private message to the member, in the game or by email, identifying the
specific transgression and warning against a repeat occurrence. Censure shall consist of a Public Warning
sent to the current game specific mailing list.  In the case of serious or repeated transgressions, the member
shall be stripped of his or her voting rights, will be placed on Probation and
shall have to suffer through the normal Probationary Period as outlined in the
Recruitment Procedures below (i.e., find Sponsor, go through probation and be
voted back to full membership).  Egregious acts and high crimes seriously damaging to BAD will result in
Banishment from the Clan.  Banishment
must be decided unanimously by the Game Council; if the Game Council's vote is
not unanimous, the issue will be decided by a majority vote of the members of
the game realm.</p>

<p align="left">All BAD Clan leaders and members are trusted to conduct
themselves honorably and responsibly both inside and out of the game
environment. Loose lips sink ships and irresponsible indiscretion and
rumor-mongering on the part of a Clan leader or any Clan member will result in
discipline, including Probation or Banishment, to be decided in accordance with
this Charter.</p>

<p align="left">Clan leaders have been elected by a majority to guide the
growth and betterment of the Guild -- their hard work and dedication deserve
the respect of the whole Clan.  The
chain of command will be respected and obeyed by all BAD members.</p>
