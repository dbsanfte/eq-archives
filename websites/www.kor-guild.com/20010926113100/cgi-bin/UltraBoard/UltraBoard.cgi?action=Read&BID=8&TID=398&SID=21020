I think it might be beneficial for applicants to garner &quot;votes&quot; in their behalf, indicating that more than just one or two people have met them and think they are KoR material.  Perhaps have the applicant be required to post on the board, introducing themself, giving a bit of info and stating their willingness to group with KoR members, perhaps with their normal playtimes (i.e., having them seek us out).   I think that we may need to watch the growth of some classes in our guild, while encouraging the growth of others.<p>I&#39m not sure that a duty roster for the officers would be efficacious for them, as many times things come up and wouldn&#39t want them feeling guilty because they are not in-game; however, if they are willing, then far be it for me to say one way or the other hehe.

<td valign="top"><font class="body"><b><i>last updated at 08-02-2001 02:04 p.m. (2 times)</i></b><br>As a Knight, I have opinions on these matters.<p>1. The Application process. It is my understanding that at present, anyone can apply to KoR, and at level 20, they can be considered for interview and invitation. Officer Ripped is working on new recruiting guidelines for the Officer Corps to discuss and approve. My only suggestions to improve this process are that an applicant be required to have a recommendation from at least one active Knight when he applies. That makes the mentoring process that much easier, as they will already have had some interaction with a guild-member prior to applying. I do not think that the applications should be viewable for all the guild to see. None of us had to be approved by 80+ people in order to join the guild, and neither should the new applicant, in my opinion. We select our Officers and Mentors very carefully based on their Ideals and past behavior, and I trust their judgement on this matter, each and every one of them. I would like to see more information shared with the guild after an invite however. Kellindil saw a new name in Guild Chat just last night, and asked in group who that was. I realized then that perhaps I should have posted a thread here, in Guild Business, that welcomed them to the Guild and at the same time informed his new brothers and sisters that he had been invited. Sometimes time zone differences do not allow for attending picnics, and raid events and such, but this makes the person no less qualified to be a member of this family. I will do my best in the future to keep the Guild up to speed on who is invited and a little about them.<p>2. The Officer Corps in my opinion, for the size Guild we have, is rather thin. Having said that, we still have to be selective about who we promote to Officer. We don&#39t want to come to a point where we are promoting members to Officer just to fill a time zone slot that no Officer is online. That, would be a big mistake in my opinion. So, the Officer Corps growing will take time, and I ask that we all be patient. I admit that I would like to see an Officer Duty Roster of some kind be put in place. I found it very comforting to know who was going to be available to me if necessary before I logged on. It would also potentially free up a night or two for me, so that I could refer a problem to the on-duty Officer. <p>3. I feel funny posting opinions on the Mentoring Program. I am too close to it to be truly objective. Suffice it to say that I think it is working very well, and that I know that the people involved are working very hard for the benefit of all of us. I will take a brief moment and explain, for those of you who don&#39t understand, how the process is working. A mentor is assigned an applicant, and then makes contact with them. They are supposed to group with that person, or find them a group of Knights to group with (depending on what levels allow), and then after much discussion and getting to know this applicant, make a recommendation to an Officer for interview. This takes a load off the Officer making a quick judgement after interview (which was the old way), and also gains us a better quality Knight in the process. We receive about 3 applicants a day on average, and that is a lot to handle, but know that you have 14 Knights, that you should have deep respect for, doing their best to make sure that our family continues to grow with positive people as a part of it.<p><br>These are my opinions....do with them what you will.

By this I mean that there are some people that some of us have grouped with that may apply to join the guild, that has shown in our opinions not to be worthy to carry the title of KoR.  I do not want to have a vote at the picnic, but would like a thread started so that if someone has information about an applicant it can be discussed and deleted prior to approval of applicant.

<td valign="top"><font class="body">(ponders the questions a hand a bit before speaking)<p>1. The Application process and how it is relayed to the Guild at large.<p>As far as I&#39m concerned, we have entered into another dangerous &quot;expansion phase&quot; for the guild.  The last time this happened led to a large exodus by high level, well establish Knights.  I for one do not wish to see this again cause it was quite painful for me last time.  <p>Right now I see the Mentors as a commitee, they review candidates and learn about the applicants from comunicating to them in game.  This takes time an preserverance since many times the applicant is not on the same time the mentor is.  Officers then review the Mentors list of applicants they deem worthy for admittance into the Knights of Reverence.<p>I personally see no problem in this.  If someone is invited to the Knights of Reverence, there is a probation period, if during this time members find the candadite to be un-knightly, then is up to them to bring it to the attention of the guild and for the officers to remove the person or deal with the problem as dictated by Krimlor.<p><br>2. Officer availability, and the number of Officers that are active.<p>Officers are volunteers who sacrifice their playtime to further the goals and represent the guild.  From what I&#39ve seen, there isn&#39t a manditory number of hours an officer must be available per week.  Personally, I think that&#39s great cause it makes us have to deal with our own problems.  When you stop to think about it, why do people need to confer with and officer 24/7 anyhow?  I&#39m here to play a game and have fun, not confer with an officer.  If I was going to take time out of my play time to confer/agrue with anyone, it&#39d be the EQ GM&#39s and Guides (grin).  But all they tell me is &quot;I&#39m sorry, I can&#39t help you&quot; (chuckle) I think it&#39s a recording each time I send them a tell, but I can&#39t be sure.<p>By the by, I do think it is the responsibility of Officers to remove people from the guild who violate the charter or who consistantly slander or demean guild members.<p>3. The Mentoring Program. What it was designed to do, and how it is working.<p>The Mentoring program as I see it, is to take much of the burden that other guilds heap upon their officers, and to distribute it into easily maintainable chunks.  I think they are doing a wonderful job at this.<p>These opinions are sole property of Holyian Lifebringer Inc.<br>The views expressed here do not reflect upon that of alts<br>or the command staff of the Knights of Reverence<p><br>Holyian Lifebringer<br>54 Vicar</font></td>

<td valign="top"><font class="body">I will have to agree with Holyian&#39s concerns about this expansion phase being &quot;dangerous.&quot;  We have already lost Cindall and Khasding recently to other guilds with no parting words on our message boards.  <p>Applications were at one time posted for the guild to see.  I would like to see this again.  Right now I log in and don&#39t know who is new and who is an alt.  Many of us use the boards as a means of communication to the guild when we are unable to log into the game.  A name, class, and level is just not enough.  It also seems to me that newer members are allowed to have guilded alts before they have been in the guild for a month.<p>As to officer availability.  I never asked for a 24/7 presence.  I asked for more frequent than 1 time in 3 weeks by an officer or gm.  Issues do arise once in a while in game, and you would have to be a fool to believe that everything is always hunky-dory when you are not in game.  I never said Krimlor was doing a bad job either, as was hinted at by posts elsewhere.<p>There is also an emotional aspect to people just disappearing for weeks at a time.  There is a difference between being on vacation and lying in a hospital.  Some of us care for the person behind the keyboard, but if you feel the well-being of the members of our guild in real life is none of my business, so be it.  I seriously thought something had happened to Krimlor during those three weeks he didn&#39t login during US evening hours, post, or update the web page.<p><br>Other than being a little incommunicado about their activities, I think the mentors are doing their job well.  If you want to know my opinion of some of the recent inductees over the last few months, you&#39ll have to ask, as this is not the place.  Sometimes I do question whether all mentors are looking for the same types of things in a new applicant.<p><br>I really am trying to be a civil as possible in my posts.  I am not prone to flaming people for no reason and would rather hold my tongue before saying something I&#39d rather not.  If you want to talk to me about something, please feel free to contact me.  I will be making myself more available in Norrath in the coming weeks to see how things have gone over the past month.

(Paladins can soak but can&#39t deal).<p>We could use bards they fight well and there songs keep Mana up or HP&#39s up or whatever the group needs.<p>Well thats my say and I&#39m telling it as it is if you dont like it..... Well you keep collecting Druids and Paladins and then you can raid hmmmm Fire Giants cos the rest is OUT of BOUNDS.

The one thing that I have noticed and that Gen pointed out was that the guild is VERY heavy in pallies and druids while being very thin in other areas. The bulk of the guild seems to now be 40+ (mostly 44+) to low 50&#39s and so when raiding greater strategy and class diversity is needed. But is raiding meant to be the primary goal of this guild? Personally, I enjoy trying to take on areas which are suicidal for me to tread, but I&#39m a sadomasochist, and when I have the time would love to raid as much as possible. It adds a whole new element to the game WAY beyond the hum drum exp grind or farming. However, if the guild is serious about this it would require recruitment of specific classes and a shift in the guild&#39s focus of activities.....I hope eople understand what I&#39m trying to say because I know I&#39m not explaining myself very well.  Was up till 5 AM last night and I may still be a bit drunk and slightly incoherent.  I guess what I&#39m trying to say is that if we really want to do tough areas like Fear (I do....Want my Apothic dammit =) ) we have to get serious about getting the needed classes and be more focused to that end.  I just hope that this would not interfere with the current casual camraderie I feel in the guild.<p>My 2 cp in a very incoherent rambling format....Hope you can ick up my vibe though<p>Sionell<p>PS: Oh, anyway to try to institute some way to try to make more single guild groups on a regular basis?  Kinda like the 6 pack but not so exclusive (Buncha snobs if you ask me! *grin*)</font></td>

Basically he said that he wanted new challenges, which by that I think he meant a high end guild (his new guild is 52+ I think) that focused on weekly high-end raids.  I completely understand his point of view, but I do think it would have been nice if he had posted something first about his concerns.....But c&#39est la vie, non?</font></td>

I realize the mentor program is new but i think in a since its always been their becuase the mentors have always been their to look up to we just didnt give them position like their is now and i think it is a good thing that now they can get some reconigtion.......The application process   It would be way to hard for their tobe a big vote like that we need to just leave that to the officers they wont steer us wrong or else they wont be officers..........Well now i Needs ta go to bed am tired and not even sure if my typing is making any since night</font></td>

<td valign="top"><font class="body">1) I don&#39t wish to become the apllicant stalker of Norrath so my answer to the apllicant issue is the same as Ruem:<br><blockquote><hr><b>Ruem (08-03-2001 12:29 a.m.):</b><p>Nobody will be doing any &quot;approving&quot;, its just simple knowledge about who our prospective members might be.. yeah yeah we have the names on the roster, but I for one can&#39t and don&#39t want to search out every single name on there to &quot;get to know them&quot;. Time differences and busy schedule being reasons among others for that, but it simply shouldn&#39t be that hard for us to gain some insight about them.<hr></blockquote><br>........................<br>The Idea of having the potential memeber post on the message boards their interest in joinin the guild is good also.  I believe of the last few applicatnts Himdar,Sono(sorry can&#39t remember how to spell the whole thing) and few others posted their desire to join us on the message boards after they had already filled out an app. this shows the applicant reachin out to the entire guild.  I also like the idea of the possibilty of the applicants needing a sponsor from within KoR, somebody they have grouped with and actively played with for a while, before they can become a full member of the guild.<p>2) the officer issues it appears Krim and Co. are already taking steps to increase the visibilty of our Leader Team.  I still like the idea of an active duty roster .. whereas 1 officer will be on duty to feild problems /issues at a specific time so as not to take time away from other officers that day.. once a week on duty isn&#39t that bad in my mind.( I could be wrong ) I am not asking for them to be on 24-7 but offices could rotate on a schedule when they will be on duty and feild issues when they during their regular play time. rambling again sorry.<p>3) I guess I never full understood the direction of the mentoring program if they are or recruiting armm of the guild they are doing fine, but I believe we need to have the applicants come to us a little more.  Yes their names are on the roster but so are ours.  If the applicant truely wishes to know the guild and become a part of the guild how big of a step is it for them to actively seek us out. ( I also know there are some who can&#39t play with most of us beause of timezone issues, this should not be held against them)<p>just my 2cp ... hope any of it made sense
