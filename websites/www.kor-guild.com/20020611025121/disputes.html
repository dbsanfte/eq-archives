<P>When a dispute occurs, whether involving two parties within the guild, or one party in the guild and one party
outside of the guild, the officers take it very seriously. Disputes are one of the things that make EQ so horridly
un-fun. There should not be a situation where you feel as though you are being harassed, bothered or otherwise
mistreated by anyone within the Knights of Reverence.<BR>
<BR>
If you are inside or outside of the guild and have had a problem with a member of the Knights of Reverence, here
are the steps that must be followed so that the officers can take the appropriate steps to resolve the situation:
<BR>
<BR>
Take Screenshots and Logs: We prefer both screenshots and logs to be sent when you send your dispute e-mail, so
when at all possible please take both of them. If you saw this page AFTER the event occurred, please keep this
in mind for any future problems, and send us what proof you do have of the incident. <BR>
<BR>
Use /petition if Necessary: If it is a clear case of harassment or anything else that defies the rules, do not
hesitate to petition a guide to take care of the problem. We can only determine who stays in and who is removed
from our guild. If the problem you are having is more far reaching than that, it will continue even after the offender
is kicked out of the guild. If you do call a guide or GM when you are being harassed, and you still wish to notify
the officers of the Knights of Reverence of the incident, please include that with your log and screenshots. <BR>
<BR>
Gather Witnesses: We ask that you also try and gather witnesses if they are available... people around you or in
the same zone who may have witnessed what happened. All we need is their names. Our officers will attempt to get
ahold of them online to verify the situation. We realize that in all cases (such as issues with /tells) this may
not be feasible. If you can not, for whatever reason, come up with any witnesses, that does not mean your case
will be thrown out.<BR>
<BR>
E-Mail Us: Send all of the above in an e-mail describing the situation in your own words to <A HREF="mailto: holyian@kor-guild.com">Holyian@kor-guild.com</A>
and we will look into the situation and get back to you as soon as possible. <BR>
Knights of Reverence does not tolerate inappropriate behavior or harassment in our guild.
