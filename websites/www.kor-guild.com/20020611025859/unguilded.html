Occasionally, in the course of all things, it becomes necessary for a guild member to leave the guild. On even
rarer occasions it becomes necessary for the guild officers to ask someone to leave the guild for the greater good
of the entire group. We hope this will happen very rarely, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared. <BR>
<BR>
There are currently two ways in which someone can be removed from the guild. It should be noted that it is VERY
DIFFICULT to have these things happen to you, and this guild does not take this issue lightly. <BR>

The three strikes rule is rather simple. If it has been proven to the Council that a member has wantonly broken
the rules three times in a row, that member will be asked to leave the guild by an officer of the guild. <BR>

On rare occasions, a guild member may not break any rules, but may also be hindering the progress of the guild
in some way. It may be that his or her personality clashes with the rest of the guild, generating more heat than
light, or that the person does not seem very happy within the guild, yet does not want to admit it and find somewhere
else. <BR>
In occasions such as this, the council will hold a vote. If the majority of the vote is to un-guild this person,
then the member will be asked to leave the guild.<BR>
<BR>
Though these methods of being kicked out of the Knights of Reverece may seem harsh, we recognize the need for them
in response to situations in past circumstances where inappropriate behavior from others has ruined the game for
some.</FONT>
