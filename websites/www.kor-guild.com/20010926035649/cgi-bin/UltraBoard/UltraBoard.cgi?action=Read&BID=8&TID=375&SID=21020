<td valign="top"><font class="body">Charter of a Knight of Reverence<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Prowess:<br>To seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a knight, martial and otherwise, seeking strength to be used in the service of justice, rather than in personal aggrandizement.<p>Justice:<br>Seek always the path of &#39right&#39, unencumbered by bias or personal interest. Recognize that the sword of justice can be a terrible thing, so it must be tempered by humanity and mercy. If the &#39right&#39 you see rings agrees with others, and you seek it out without bending to the temptation for expediency, then you will earn renown beyond measure.<p>Loyalty:<br>Be known for unwavering commitment to the people and ideals you choose to live by. There are many places where compromise is expected; loyalty is not amongst them.<p>Defense:<br>The ideal knight was sworn by oath to defend his liege lord and those who depended upon him. Seek always to defend your nation, your family, and those to whom you believe worthy of loyalty.<p>Courage:<br>Being a knight often means choosing the more difficult path, the personally expensive one. Be prepared to make personal sacrifices in service of the precepts and people you value. At the same time, a knight should seek wisdom to see that stupidity and courage are cousins. Courage also means taking the side of truth in all matters, rather than seeking the expedient lie. Seek the truth whenever possible, but remember to temper justice with mercy, or the pure truth can bring grief.<p>Faith:<br>A knight must have faith in his beliefs, for faith roots him and gives hope against the despair that human failings create.<p>Humility:<br>Value first the contributions of others; do not boast of your own accomplishments, let others do this for you. Tell the deeds of others before your own, according them the renown rightfully earned through virtuous deeds. In this way the office of knighthood is well done and glorified, helping not only the gentle spoken of but also all who call themselves knights.<p>Largesse:<br>Be generous in so far as your resources allow; largesse used in this way counters gluttony. It also makes the path of mercy easier to discern when a difficult decision of justice is required.<p>Nobility:<br>Seek great stature of character by holding to the virtues and duties of a knight, realizing that though the ideals cannot be reached, the quality of striving towards them ennobles the spirit, growing the character from dust towards the heavens. Nobility also has the tendency to influence others, offering a compelling example of what can be done in the service of rightness.<p>Franchise:<br>Seek to emulate everything I have spoken of as sincerely as possible, not for the reason of personal gain but because it is right. Do not restrict your exploration to a small world, but seek to infuse every aspect of your life with these qualities. Should you succeed in even a tiny measure then you will be well remembered for your quality and virtue.  <p><br>Code of Conduct <br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Last Updated: 06/19/01<br>We&#39re hoping that the individuals that choose to join the Knights of Reverence possess a certain level of maturity that will contribute to a fun atmosphere for everyone. Most of this is common sense, but we&#39re putting it in writing so there will be no questions as to what is expected. If in doubt, remember one rule: treat others as you would like to be treated.<p><br>I. General Attitude<br>The Knights of Reverence Code of Conduct is the glue that keeps this guild together.  It is a common set of standards that we should all agree upon.  These standards both portray a positive guild and give us all something in common.  If, for any reason, you do not agree with this code of conduct or wish to stray from it, we suggest you find another guild to join.<p>Though these are not hard and fast rules, frequently straying from the code will result in expulsion from the guild.  We feel it is necessary to portray a solid front.<p>This is necessary because every member of the Knights of Reverence represents every other member of the Knights of Reverence.  Whether we like it or not, it is only human nature for us to associate certain attitudes not only with the individual, but with the guild tag that they are associated with.<p>We expect members of Knights of Reverence to be polite, gracious and considerate individuals, generally speaking.  We believe that even the most unintelligent troll can offer simple thanks when it is called for.  We also believe that playing an evil character does not give one license to treat other people rudely or to violate the Play Nice Policy.<p>There are far too many people in Norrath who are inconsiderate, belligerent or just plain rude.  As a member of the Knights of Reverence you have proven to be one of the few who is not, and we expect you to act that way.  Remember that through steadfast example, we can teach others the same lesson. <p>--No Dewdspeak-- <br>If you aren&#39t familiar with what &#39Dewdspeak&#39 is, it is the use of the letter &#39u&#39 instead of &#39you&#39, &#39r&#39 instead of &#39are&#39, &#392&#39 instead of &#39two&#39 and the purposeful misspelling of certain words. This form of communication is it&#39s own sort of internet &#39subculture&#39 and can be seen almost everywhere. <p>As this is a soft role play guild, we find Dewdspeak to be completely inappropriate in any form of communication. Please, if you must use this form of communication, do not join our guild. It is difficult to understand at best, and does not accurately portray our guild as a soft role play guild. <p>--No Public Humiliation--<br>It shouldn&#39t have to be said, but sometime in the heat of anger and frustration our emotions get the best of us. Regardless, it is never appropriate to talk poorly about a guild member over any public channel may that be ooc, guildsay, auction, groupsay on the bulletin board or whatever. If you have a problem with a member, please either deal with it privately, or bring it to your officers.<p>Regardless of whether or not your character is evil or just plain misunderstood, we can all act civilized. In short, this means to treat everyone else the same way that you&#39d want to be treated. <p><p>II. Buying and Selling<br>-- Within the Guild --<br>Please remember that your guild is not a captive audience to hock your wares to.  Items that you loot are yours to do with as you please, but if you choose to give them to another guild member in need, we ask that you be reasonable in doing so.  Most of us just give extra items to guild characters who need them, or donate them to the guild vault characters so that others may benefit. Remember, if you give, you will also receive.  When it comes to trade skills, however, those can get rather expensive, so if you&#39re making armor or jewelry for a guild member, it&#39s perfectly reasonable to ask for the cost of materials when doing so.<p><br>-- Outside the Guild --<br>Set your prices fairly.  Don&#39t gouge someone just because they don&#39t know the worth of the item you&#39re selling.  Be kind, fair, courteous and friendly.  Particularly if you are selling wares created through a trade, you&#39ll find that you have return customers much more often. <p><br>III. Grouping<br>Grouping is the act of joining others to reach a common goal such as killing specific mobs, gaining experience, performing a quest and so on and so forth.  At some time in every character&#39s life (even the most soloable classes) it becomes necessary to group.  When grouping you represent the guild the most.  <p>There are good groups and there are bad groups, but we ask that no matter how difficult the situation you uphold your guild&#39s conducts of fairness and politeness to the utmost regards. <p>-- Waiting on a List -- <br>In the days of server overcrowding, there are many times when you&#39ll need to wait on a list in order to get into a room that has a group.  This can often be a very dull thing to do, but unfortunately the higher you get in levels, the more necessary it is to do this.  Often, while waiting, people will log in an alternate character, get some housework done or just do something else for a while.  Be sure to keep the list keeper updated on what you are doing, and if you decide you can wait no longer let them know to take you off of the list. <p>-- Joining a Group -- <br>When joining a group introduce yourself and offer your class and level so that everyone in the group will know what you are capable of.  Groups are about teamwork, never forget that.  Members of a group should watch each other&#39s backs. <p>There are times when a group may not be effective, or you feel in danger.  Occasionally, you will run into a group full of people who aren&#39t willing to watch each other&#39s back but are solely focused on themselves.  If you find this to be the case, politely extract yourself from the group, giving your apologies to the group leader and find something else to do.  As much as you&#39d like to give them a piece of your mind, it&#39s really not worth it in the long run in most cases.<p>-- Leaving a Group -- <br>In many places it is necessary to have a full group in order to take a room, mob or location.  If just one person leaves the group the rest of the members could be left in mortal peril.  When it comes time for you to leave a group, keep that in mind. <p>About ten minutes before you have to go announce that the group leader or list holder should contact a replacement.  Leave enough time for the group to find a replacement (about ten minutes) before you say your good byes. <p>If the group can not find a replacement, you should find out whether or not they can take the room, mob or location alone.  If they can not, then offer to help escort your group to a safe location before leaving. <p>In some cases you may not be able to wait for a replacement to arrive.  A Real Life emergency may have come up.  Before you leave, explain that an emergency has cropped up and send your apologies if at all possible.<p>-- Holding the List -- <br>If you are designated as the one to hold the list for your particular group, be fair.  We can not emphasize how important it is to be fair.   Do not let friends or guildmates in above others who have been waiting on the list.  We would all much rather you be fair and leave a good impression than be unfair and leave a poor impression. <p><br>IV. Twinking<br>Twinking in and of itself is the act of supplying a low level character or newbie with equipment that is highly beyond their means.  There have been many heated debates about the morality of twinking.  Here is what we think about the subject. <p>Under NO circumstances will the Knights of Reverence twink a brand new character out of its vault.  If you&#39ve been with the guild for a while and have proven yourself to be an ally, and not just someone who&#39s out to get some free equipment, then what&#39s ours is yours.  We&#39re actually quite generous with extra equipment, but we&#39ve been taken for a ride in the past, and we won&#39t let it happen again.  Sure, it&#39s just a game, and &quot;items&quot; are only pixels on a screen, but a game is supposed to be fun.  If you take advantage of someone, then the fun ceases.   We&#39d rather the items go to someone deserving of them.  So, please, don&#39t join the guild with the sole intent of getting items.  That&#39s not what the Knights of Reverence is all about.<p><br>V. Power Leveling<br>Knights of Reverence DOES NOT power level as a guild, so please don&#39t ask.  However, you may out of your own free will, choose to assist others in leveling.  If you choose to assist others keep in mind that those who level extremely fast will not get the full benifit of learning the stratagies and expereince of those who are well seasoned players.<p><br>VI. Role-Playing<br>The Knights of Reverence encourages the act of role-playing.  Does that mean you have to be &#39in character&#39 100% of the time?  No.  Soft role-play means that you role-play when it is appropriate and you do the things that your character would do. How do you know? <p>Take a look at the god your character follows.  This is a clear indication of what type of role-play strategy you have in mind for your characters.  For instance, a Druid of Tunare isn&#39t going to run around screaming that they worship Innoruuk.  In many cases the powers granted to the character are done so through the god that they follow.  Going against that grain is both poor role-play and against the nature of your character.
