			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Prowess:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>To seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a knight, martial and otherwise, seeking strength to be used
			in the service of justice, rather than in personal aggrandizement.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Justice:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Seek always the path of 'right', unencumbered by bias or personal interest. Recognize that the sword of justice
			can be a terrible thing, so it must be tempered by humanity and mercy. If the 'right' you see rings agrees with
			others, and you seek it out without bending to the temptation for expediency, then you will earn renown beyond
			measure.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Loyalty:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Be known for unwavering commitment to the people and ideals you choose to live by. There are many places where
			compromise is expected; loyalty is not amongst them.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Defense:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>The ideal knight was sworn by oath to defend his liege lord and those who depended upon him. Seek always to
			defend your nation, your family, and those to whom you believe worthy of loyalty.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Courage:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Being a knight often means choosing the more difficult path, the personally expensive one. Be prepared to make
			personal sacrifices in service of the precepts and people you value. At the same time, a knight should seek wisdom
			to see that stupidity and courage are cousins. Courage also means taking the side of truth in all matters, rather
			than seeking the expedient lie. Seek the truth whenever possible, but remember to temper justice with mercy, or
			the pure truth can bring grief.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Faith:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>A knight must have faith in his beliefs, for faith roots him and gives hope against the despair that human
			failings create.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Humility:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Value first the contributions of others; do not boast of your own accomplishments, let others do this for you.
			Tell the deeds of others before your own, according them the renown rightfully earned through virtuous deeds. In
			this way the office of knighthood is well done and glorified, helping not only the gentle spoken of but also all
			who call themselves knights.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Largesse:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Be generous in so far as your resources allow; largesse used in this way counters gluttony. It also makes the
			path of mercy easier to discern when a difficult decision of justice is required.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Nobility:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Seek great stature of character by holding to the virtues and duties of a knight, realizing that though the
			ideals cannot be reached, the quality of striving towards them ennobles the spirit, growing the character from
			dust towards the heavens. Nobility also has the tendency to influence others, offering a compelling example of
			what can be done in the service of rightness.</H3>
			<P>
			<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT COLOR="#990000">Franchise:</FONT></I></H2>
			<H3>Seek to emulate everything I have spoken of as sincerely as possible, not for the reason of personal gain but
			because it is right. Do not restrict your exploration to a small world, but seek to infuse every aspect of your
			life with these qualities. Should you succeed in even a tiny measure then you will be well remembered for your
			quality and virtue.
