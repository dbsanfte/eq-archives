       <p align="LEFT"><B><FONT color="#1F6814" SIZE="4">Victory!!  (1/25/04) </FONT></B></p>

           <P><FONT color="000000" SIZE="4">  After several demoralizing defeats the Knights of Reverence and its allies defeated
           the Vindicator of Kael.  Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and even Gnomes united to put down his evil reign.  The
           battle was in peril and many of our forces were crushed when the Magician Valkinar called upon the fire to do
           its dirty, but noble, deed.  Derakor screamed in pain as the fire came down, he stumbled around a bit, and then fell.
           Victory is ours, but alas, there's more work to do, as the giants of Kael continue to threaten the freedom of our allies
           on Velious.  Here are some sketched accounts of that battle and other battles of the past.
