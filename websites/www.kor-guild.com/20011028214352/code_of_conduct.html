</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#666666" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Last Updated: 06/19/01</FONT></H1>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">We're hoping that the individuals that choose to join the Knights
of Reverence possess a certain level of maturity that will contribute to a fun atmosphere for everyone. Most of
this is common sense, but we're putting it in writing so there will be no questions as to what is expected. If
in doubt, remember one rule: treat others as you would like to be treated.<BR>
</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">I. General Attitude</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Knights of Reverence Code of Conduct is the glue that keeps
this guild together.&nbsp; It is a common set of standards that we should all agree upon.&nbsp; These standards
both portray a positive guild and give us all something in common.&nbsp; If, for any reason, you do not agree with
this code of conduct or wish to stray from it, we suggest you find another guild to join.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Though these are not hard and fast rules, frequently straying
from the code will result in expulsion from the guild.&nbsp; We feel it is necessary to portray a solid front.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This is necessary because every member of the Knights of Reverence
represents every other member of the Knights of Reverence.&nbsp; Whether we like it or not, it is only human nature
for us to associate certain attitudes not only with the individual, but with the guild tag that they are associated
with.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">We expect members of Knights of Reverence to be polite, gracious
and considerate individuals, generally speaking.&nbsp; We believe that even the most unintelligent troll can offer
simple thanks when it is called for.&nbsp; We also believe that playing an evil character does not give one license
to treat other people rudely or to violate the Play Nice Policy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">There are far too many people in Norrath who are inconsiderate,
belligerent or just plain rude.&nbsp; As a member of the Knights of Reverence you have proven to be one of the
few who is not, and we expect you to act that way.&nbsp; Remember that through steadfast example, we can teach
others the same lesson.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">--</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">No
Dewdspeak-- </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><BR>
If you aren't familiar with what 'Dewdspeak' is, it is the use of the letter 'u' instead of 'you', 'r' instead
of 'are', '2' instead of 'two' and the purposeful misspelling of certain words. This form of communication is it's
own sort of internet 'subculture' and can be seen almost everywhere. <BR>
<BR>
As this is a soft role play guild, we find Dewdspeak to be completely inappropriate in any form of communication.
Please, if you must use this form of communication, do not join our guild. It is difficult to understand at best,
and does not accurately portray our guild as a soft role play guild. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">--No Public Humiliation--</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><BR>
It shouldn't have to be said, but sometime in the heat of anger and frustration our emotions get the best of us.
Regardless, it is never appropriate to talk poorly about a guild member over any public channel may that be ooc,
guildsay, auction, groupsay on the bulletin board or whatever. If you have a problem with a member, please either
deal with it privately, or bring it to your officers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Regardless of whether or not your character is evil or just
plain misunderstood, we can all act civilized. In short, this means to treat everyone else the same way that you'd
want to be treated. <BR>
</FONT></P>

<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">II. Buying and Selling</FONT></H3>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Within the
Guild</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Please remember that your guild is not a captive audience to
hock your wares to.&nbsp; Items that you loot are yours to do with as you please, but if you choose to give them
to another guild member in need, we ask that you be reasonable in doing so.&nbsp; Most of us just give extra items
to guild characters who need them, or donate them to the guild vault characters so that others may benefit. Remember,
if you give, you will also receive.&nbsp; When it comes to trade skills, however, those can get rather expensive,
so if you're making armor or jewelry for a guild member, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for the cost of materials
when doing so.</FONT></P>
<P>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Outside the
Guild</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Set your prices fairly.&nbsp; Don't gouge someone just because
they don't know the worth of the item you're selling.&nbsp; Be kind, fair, courteous and friendly.&nbsp; Particularly
if you are selling wares created through a trade, you'll find that you have return customers much more often.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">III. Grouping</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Grouping is the act of joining others to reach a common goal
such as killing specific mobs, gaining experience, performing a quest and so on and so forth.&nbsp; At some time
in every character's life (even the most soloable classes) it becomes necessary to group.&nbsp; When grouping you
represent the guild the </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">most</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2"
FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">There are good groups and there are bad groups, but we ask that
no matter how difficult the situation you uphold your guild's conducts of fairness and politeness to the utmost
regards.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Waiting on
a List</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --&nbsp;</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In the days of server overcrowding, there are many times when
you'll need to wait on a list in order to get into a room that has a group.&nbsp; This can often be a very dull
thing to do, but unfortunately the higher you get in levels, the more necessary it is to do this.&nbsp; Often,
while waiting, people will log in an alternate character, get some housework done or just do something else for
a while.&nbsp; Be sure to keep the list keeper updated on what you are doing, and if you decide you can wait no
longer let them know to take you off of the list.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Joining a
Group</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --&nbsp;</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When joining a group introduce yourself and offer your class
and level so that everyone in the group will know what you are capable of.&nbsp; Groups are about teamwork, never
forget that.&nbsp; Members of a group should watch each other's backs.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">There are times when a group may not be effective, or you feel
in danger.&nbsp; Occasionally, you will run into a group full of people who aren't willing to watch each other's
back but are solely focused on themselves.&nbsp; If you find this to be the case, politely extract yourself from
the group, giving your apologies to the group leader and find something else to do.&nbsp; As much as you'd like
to give them a piece of your mind, it's really not worth it in the long run in most cases.</FONT></P>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Leaving a
Group</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --&nbsp;</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In many places it is necessary to have a full group in order
to take a room, mob or location.&nbsp; If just one person leaves the group the rest of the members could be left
in mortal peril.&nbsp; When it comes time for you to leave a group, keep that in mind.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">About ten minutes before you have to go announce that the group
leader or list holder should contact a replacement.&nbsp; Leave enough time for the group to find a replacement
(about ten minutes) before you say your good byes.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If the group can not find a replacement, you should find out
whether or not they can take the room, mob or location alone.&nbsp; If they can not, then offer to help escort
your group to a safe location before leaving.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In some cases you may not be able to wait for a replacement
to arrive.&nbsp; A Real Life emergency may have come up.&nbsp; Before you leave, explain that an emergency has
cropped up and send your apologies if at all possible.</FONT></P>
<H5><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-- </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Holding the
List</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> --&nbsp;</FONT></H5>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If you are designated as the one to hold the list for your particular
group, be fair.&nbsp; We can not emphasize how important it is to be fair.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not let friends or guildmates
in above others who have been waiting on the list.&nbsp; We would all much rather you be fair and leave a good
impression than be unfair and leave a poor impression.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IV. Twinking</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Twinking in and of itself is the act of supplying a low level
character or newbie with equipment that is highly beyond their means.&nbsp; There have been many heated debates
about the morality of twinking.&nbsp; Here is what we think about the subject.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Under </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">NO</FONT></B><FONT
SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> circumstances will the Knights of Reverence twink a brand new character
out of its vault.&nbsp; If you've been with the guild for a while and have proven yourself to be an ally, and not
just someone who's out to get some free equipment, then what's ours is yours.&nbsp; We're actually quite generous
with extra equipment, but we've been taken for a ride in the past, and we won't let it happen again.&nbsp; Sure,
it's just a game, and &quot;items&quot; are only pixels on a screen, but a game is supposed to be fun.&nbsp; If
you take advantage of someone, then the fun ceases. &nbsp;&nbsp;We'd rather the items go to someone deserving of
them.&nbsp; So, please, don't join the guild with the sole intent of getting items.&nbsp; That's not what the Knights
of Reverence is all about.</FONT></P>
<P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">V. Power Leveling</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Knights of Reverence </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOES
NOT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> power level as a guild, so please don't ask.&nbsp;
However, you may out of your own free will, choose to assist others in leveling.&nbsp; If you choose to assist
others keep in mind that those who level extremely fast will not get the full benifit of learning the stratagies
and expereince of those who are well seasoned players.</FONT></P>
<P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">VI. Role-Playing</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Knights of Reverence encourages the act of role-playing.&nbsp;
Does that mean you have to be 'in character' 100% of the time?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Soft role-play means that you role-play
when it is appropriate and you do the things that your character would do. How do you know?&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Take a look at the god your character follows.&nbsp; This is
a clear indication of what type of role-play strategy you have in mind for your characters.&nbsp; For instance,
a Druid of Tunare isn't going to run around screaming that they worship Innoruuk.&nbsp; In many cases the powers
granted to the character are done so through the god that they follow.&nbsp; Going against that grain is both poor
role-play and against the nature of your character.&nbsp;</FONT>
