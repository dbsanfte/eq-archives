<td valign="top"><font class="body"><b><i>last updated at 09-05-2001 11:46 p.m. (1 times)</i></b><br>The big ugly Barbarian walked wearily through the vast snowy terrain, his senses keenly aware of the human in his midst.  He had always been a fierce fighter, but now, alone, he knew something...or rather, someone that he had not yet encountered would come.   More fear than caution, had kept him from sleeping or taking rest for very long, for he knew the enemy was watching him, waiting for the right time.<br>           Small, but not frail, she laid deep in the snow bank, watching him.  She was fully aware he was waiting for her, baiting her like a worm on a hook.  She was not a patient person, she wanted to jump and land a blow against the side of his head with the massive hammer that she carried on her side, but only experience refrained her from doing that again.  Absentmindedly, she reached up and fingered the bloodstained tooth that hung on a leather strap around her neck.<br>            He crouched and sipped from his water flask; eyes wide open, scanning the white hills before him. Ears, straining to listen to the slightest sound, the swift and fast approach.  He had tried to be the hunter, not the hunted.  But as swiftly as he had found her, she had somehow, someway, out maneuvered him.  It puzzled him beyond belief as to how, slower than he, could hide herself from him.  She had even proceeded to kill his pet whilst he was not looking.  The very pet that had sniffed her out was now a bloody heap of fur and bones, one of its teeth had been missing.... she had taken it as a trophy.<br>He had underestimated her, and it struck a coil of fright in his spine.  <br>	Still and silent, her eyes burned from not blinking, she did not want to miss an opportunity to catch him off guard.  It was hard, for he was an experienced huntsman.  But it would come…..so she watched his every move, and waited.<br>          A sound, muffed footsteps, and the Barbarian sprang to life, drawing weapon in hand.  Two ice blue eyes peered at him from the face of a snow cougar and growled intensely.  He shook his head, muttering under his breath about silly white cats and began to sheath his weapon.  Just then, a sound such as cascading thunder grew loud and fast in his ears.  He knew in an instant, it had begun.  <br>        Standing only strides away from him, she had a split second advantage.  Summoning from the depths of her mind she cast out around him and green fog surrounded his feet.<br>        He began to spin around to face his foe, but found himself locked into the snow, unable to move a boot step.  He reached into his potion bag, thinking surely the excellent marksman that he was he would be able to dart her with a strong poison...to make her weak....to make her fall to the ground in a hump of her own pity.  Before he could even grasp a vial, his sight failed him.  Blinded he cursed aloud, but choose a random poison in the darkness.  He turned his torso in the direction of her spells and crushed the small tube in his hand.<br>         Clutching her protection stone in her hand, she gathered the strength to summon another spell, it took so much out of her to cast a blow that would do any type of damage to the thick skinned Barbarian.  Gritting her teeth she raised her arms as thousands of sharp poison needles began to careen towards her at an alarming rate.  She lowered her body towards the ground, but it was no use.  Like a multitude of snakebites the poison stung right through her armor, through her protective shield.  The emerald green stone fell deep into the white powdery snow as the evil filth began to pour into her veins, loosening her grip on the glass like rock.<br>        Bright sparks of blue and green emitted from his fingers and shot like fireworks towards her.  She tried to duck, but the range was too wide and too long and splinters of poison fire rained upon her skin.  Even with her armored clad shielding, she wailed in agony.  He could now move his feet, and began to blindly walk towards her cries, fumbling for his weapon.  It was too late.  He heard her running snow crunched steps around to the side of him, and heard that familiar chilling sound.  He was stunned, immobile just as his vision was returning back into view.  Every muscle in his body froze, but he could see, as fuzzy as it was, he could see.  She stood just a leap away from him, marred with hundreds of tiny pinpoints, all of them bleeding.  Her pale completion faded into the white drifts behind her, and she looked weary to him, exhausted.  For a brief second, he felt pity.<br>	She stood there, drained, and getting more weakened by the second.  His eyes looked at her like darkened pits of coal.  Slightly tired, but without remorse or caring.  She had a choice, stay, try to spell him again with a powerful force that would surely knock him to his knees, or walk away now, while she still could.  If she stayed, the poison would surely consume her before she could both spell him to death and drink a cure, and then he would take over and leave her to die in the frigid temperature.  Hunched over, beginning to convulse, she took a small bottle of brown liquid out of her bag and slammed it down her throat.  It sped her adrenaline up with an extreme pace.  She noticed his muscles twitching, trying to break free of the invisible bonds that held him tight, slowly squeezing crushing him inside.  <br>	More painful by the second, the vice clamp around him kept it’s tight grip.  In places his skin began to crack, drawing small beads of blood to the surface.  It felt as though a boulder was sitting on chest, it was hard for him to breathe.  Staring at her, gasping for air, he watched as she backed away from him.  He tried to taunt her, to relinquish the fight to him that she had begun, but no words came from his mouth as the air coffin surrounded him.<br>	Her head began to throb as the blood raced wildly through her veins, making her bleed even more.  She backed away until he was just a small dark figure in the snow, and then turned run with the spirit of the wolf flowing around her.  As soon as shelter permitted her to, she would heal herself, and cure herself, and then, once again, she would find him….or he would find her.  Soon an end would come this, he would find his demise…and soon.<br>	He strained to keep an eye on the silhouette in the distance.  As soon as this damn spell breaks he would take after her, catch her, and then……THUMP…..he fell face first, flattened into the icy snow.  He sprang to his feet as every bone in his body screamed in misery.  Wavering, he tried to run towards the hill she had disappeared over, but only fell down again into the wintery tundra.  Partially glad she had backed away, and partially angry for not finishing this once and for all, he sigh deeply and struggled to sit.  No worries he told himself, she would meet her end….and soon.

From their sheltered alcove they listened to the battle and watched the glow of the magical attacks being hurled by both combatants.  The wolf turned its head toward her, and with the lights of the magical display playing off his wise, golden eyes, he looked at her calmly.  Pulling the cover up more firmly, she nodded to the wolf and sighed.  Quietly, she smoothed the path in front of the fleeing cleric, softly she spoke warmth to the hands and feet of the burly shaman as he stood in the snow not far from their shelter.  Turning on her side and closing her eyes with a sigh, she murmured to the wolf, &quot;mortals&quot;.
