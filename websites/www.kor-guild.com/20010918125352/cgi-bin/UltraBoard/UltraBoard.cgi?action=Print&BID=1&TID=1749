<td>I found this post on the Paladin&#39s of Norrath Board.  And I just wanted to share it with you guys, made me feel proud to be a Paladin.<p> <br>Who else can save the day like a Paladin? We have the unique and wonderful gift of Lay Hands. I feel that this is a gift not to be horded with greed, it is meant to save lives.....and usually that means the lives of others. Perhaps if I recount the story of a day in Unrest you will understand what it means to be a Paladin....<p>I had been invited to join a group to camp the animated hand room in Unrest. We fought our way into the room and began the task of clearing the surrounding mobs. During the early minutes of this camp, we got swamped when something ran and brought back some friends. Needless to say, it was rather tense as the mobs outnumbered our tanks. As fate would happen, one of the mobs centered his attack on our Cleric and prevented him from healing and soon his life began to fade quickly. As I looked up I saw he was about to die and I was down to a little less than two bubs of health. As quickly as I could, I targeted the cleric and used my gift of Lay Hands on him. Of course that attracted the mob on me and all the while I had my back turned to the other mob and as expected, I died in the process. But our group prevailed and they were successful in defeating all the mobs. As I made my way back to Unrest I recieved a tell from the Cleric thanking me for what I had done. He said that was the first time he had had a Paladin use Lay Hands on someone else in his group. Most it seemed had kept their Lay Hands for saving their own butt. He told me I was a true Paladin in every sense of the word. This made me proud and humbled me as well. I had no other thought than to save our group from defeat, the best way was to save the life of the Cleric. They needed him more than me. I have remained friends with each of those people that were in the group that day. They, as well as I, still recall that day in Unrest. Do I think of myself as a hero? Nope. Did I do what I did to boost my own ego? Nope. I simply did what,in my mind, a Paladin would do in that situation.<p><br>So take the time and look at why you chose a Paladin. Was it because we get a &quot;kewl d00d&quot; sword? I hope not. Because you see Paladins as &quot;kewl&quot;? I hope not. A Paladin is a Holy Knight, part fighter, part cleric. We have the ability to be the &quot;Knight in shining armor&quot; of fairy tales and legends. In our hands lay the ability to do what no other can do. We as Paladins must act with honor, valor, and humility. If any of these are the reason you chose a Paladin, then you will be a valued member of any group. Keep the Faith young Paladin. In the end it is you who will make the difference. Heed not the negative comments of others if you truly wish to be a Paladin.<p>I hope this helps.<p><br>Mallan Fyreheart<br>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<br>Commander of the Knights Templar<br>Rodcet Nife server.<p>Vive Dieu, Saint Amour!

<td>Very cool Lolthorn, very cool.<p>Being a cleric myself, and reguarly fighting with two Paladins, I have experienced first hand the heal/hate/pound and then LoH on me from a pally before. <br>Two fine Paladins, Wistful and Ripped have saved my butt on more than a few occasions, and I have even seen them LoH on each other.  (Sometimes I think it&#39s a contest between the two to see who can hold out the longest...LOL.)  <br>I&#39ve even been privy to a double LoH treatment at the same time from the two, and also laughed my ass off when it was too late and they either LoH on my corpse or the mob itself.....ROFL. <br> <br>Maybe I am spoiled...but I&#39ve come to need a paladin in my group, and I will rarely travel without one.  I keep him alive, he keeps me alive, it&#39s a win/win situation.  <p>I am honored and humbled by any paladin who would use LoH on their healer or whomever they deemed it necessary before letting them die and saving themselves first.  <p>Nice post Lolthorn.
