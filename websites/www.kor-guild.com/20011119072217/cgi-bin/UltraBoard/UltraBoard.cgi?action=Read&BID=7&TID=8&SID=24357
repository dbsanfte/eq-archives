<td valign="top"><font class="body">Galinya looked back with amused exasperation as, yet one more time, her daughter stopped in her tracks, apparently overcome by the movement of a caterpillar creeping along the forest floor.  “Galathiel”, she lightly scolded, “we’ll never get to the berry thickets before dark if you will not keep your feet in motion!”.   Galathiel stepped carefully over the inching creature and skipped over to stand by her mother.   The wood elf ranger smiled down at her daughter as they continued on along the barely discernible trail, shadowed by the huge trees standing on either side.   She then noticed that, again, Galathiel had paused in her trek.  Looking back, though, Galinya noticed an unusual sight.  Her daughter, a solemn look on her face, had her head tilted back as she gazed up at a venerable old tree, as though listening to a conversation only she heard.  Even stranger still, although no breeze was blowing, a slender limb gently brushed the top of her daughter’s head, almost in benediction, before lifting again into the murky foliage.  Galinya had hoped that in time her daughter would follow the ranger way, but now she had a suspicion that Another was calling Galathiel.  It was Tunare’s way.<p>	As she walked, Galinya mused as she often did about Galathiel’s father, Tsornin, a Barbarian shaman that lived in the frozen tundra of Halas.  She had been too proud to tell him that she was expecting and sure that her calling was for this place at this time, so had said nothing as his nomadic habits called him back to wander again.  She had received missives from him periodically, but since she did not return the favor, they became scarcer and scarcer until they finally trickled to a halt.  Her daughter, though a half-breed, truly looked to be full wood-elf with only a small degree of night-blindness hinting at any other blood.  Her hair, though, was golden like her father’s.<p>	Deep in her thoughts, she at first didn’t notice the hush settling over the forest, as something alien crept in.  Suddenly, crashing forth from the bushes all around came a troop of orcs, fiercely brandishing their crude weapons and bellowing encouragement to each other.   They reeked from the rotting, poorly cured pelts they used as capes, covering the cloth and raw hide armor they wore.   One particularly loathsome orc, apparently the leader, strutted in and snatched up Galathiel under his arm.   “Dinner”, he grunted in crude Common, slyly looking at the woman.   It took 4 of his henchman to restrain the enfuriated woman.   While he gloated over the reaction he had gotten, he felt a sudden, excruciating pain in his arm.  Clutching it to his chest, he dropped the girl, then backhanded her into a copse of bushes.   Looking down, he saw a perfect impression of the child’s teeth, just beginning to ooze blood.   At the moment of the orcs’ distraction, Galinya pulled her dagger from her boot and ferociously attacked, knowing it would be her death, but praying it would buy her daughter time to escape.<p>	Galathiel picked herself up from the ground and raced through the underbrush, blindly running much like a rabbit before wolves.  She almost stopped when she heard a sharp cry, but the final word “Run!” made her keep going.  She had no idea where she was or where she was going, but couldn’t seem to stop her breakneck flight.  Finally, lack of air forced her to slow her pace and she slowly stopped in a small clearing.   With tears in her eyes, she gazed around at the berry thicket, knowing this had been their destination.  Teeth chattering, she perched on a rotted stump while her mind whirled and lamented.   She needed no confirmation to know that her mother was no more.   Gone was the strong, but gentle woman that had always been there with her.  She had no idea how to get back to the city and was afraid to return without Galinya.  Only her mother’s fierce protectiveness had kept her from being banished from the city by the wood elves.  They felt a half-breed should be sent to one of the merchant cities, since they could never learn the true arts of the wood elves.  Galinya had known that Tunare would call her daughter; there had never been a doubt in her mind.  <p>	There came a sudden crackling noise in the bushes and Galathiel jumped to her feet, poised to run.  Lumbering in came a rotund black bear, intent on getting some berries for his dinner.   He showed no surprise upon seeing her, merely stopped by to sniff her over then shuffled to the nearest bush.   Galathiel herself felt no fear of the bear – she had known of his good will as soon as he appeared.  She didn’t know HOW she knew, but the knowledge had been there. <p>	Gradually, she became aware of a warm light growing and glowing in the center of the clearing.  Peering up, she beheld a beautiful woman, dressed in the colors of the wood and becoming the center of a growing circle of admirers, as the forest creatures crept adoringly to her feet.  Stepping carefully over a small rabbit cavorting wildly to win her regard, she approached the child and knelt beside her.  “Galathiel,” she said gently, “your mother was very brave and you must be brave, too.  Your mother won’t be with you any longer, but I will, and I’ll help you to learn and grow as your mother would have wanted you to.  My name is Tunare and what I say is true.”  Galathiel stared solemnly at the glowing woman then crumpled against her and mourned for her selfless and giving mother.  Thus a druid came into being.
