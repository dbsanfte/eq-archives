  We have several paths within our guild that one might consider applying for.
  Below is a list of current positions within the guild. Members may choose to
  apply and hold more than one position should they have the time to do so. The
  number of positions available for any position in the guild is based on how
  much guild support is needed in that area. This is determined by the High Council
  member that is in charge of overseeing any given group.</FONT></P>
