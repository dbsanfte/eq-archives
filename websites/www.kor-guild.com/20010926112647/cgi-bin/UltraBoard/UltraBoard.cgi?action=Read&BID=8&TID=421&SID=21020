<td valign="top"><font class="body"><b><i>last updated at 08-04-2001 02:16 p.m. (1 times)</i></b><br>Greetings Knights,<br> <br>Many things are organized in this guild in the background that are not seen or heard until they actually happen.  This is something I take the blame for.  One thing I have learned now, that it is not good business to keep things away from the people who help put the energy into it.  It was never my intention to do this, as I want every person in this guild to participate and to put forth effort in making this undoubtedly the best guild on Xev.  I have posted intentions and have addressed the guild in the past on what is going on within our organization.  However, I now believe I have done it too far and few between.  The simple act of keeping everyone informed more often would help avoid potentially dangerous situations.  <br> <br>The reason I am telling you all this is because a few of the things that are being debated right now are already in the process of being changed.  Some of the other comments and idea&#39s I have seen posted are definatly the type of input this guild needs.  Every one of those comments and suggestions is/will be reviewed by the officers and myself.  I read these boards everyday and the officers are required to read them just as often.  It makes me very pleased when members of this guild post a problem and a solution.  From experience, I know that not every solution is going to be the right solution.  Most of the time there is never one single person that can come up with the &quot;right&quot; solution.  After seeing several solutions from different people, you start to take bits and pieces from each idea and usually end up with something of value.  In closing on this topic, don&#39t let concerns build up.  It’s not healthy for any of us.  Share your concerns with us.  We are not here to merely exist.  We do serve a very solid purpose.  Unity.<br> <br>From this point forward I will be addressing the guild each month on what has happened, is happening, and things to come.  No better time to start than now...<br> <br>Overview of things that have happened over the last 3 months...<br> <br> <br>1)	We started a mentor program to relieve some pressure from the officers and start getting the members of the guild involved more with day-to-day activities.  The mentor program was certainly a program that needed to evolve as we went along.  It was also stated to those that joined this group, that by joining they would become potential Officer candidates.  Officer Ronaf was the first to lead this group.  Since then, we have transferred this group to Officer Wistful, so Officer Ronaf can move ahead on another project, which I will get to shortly.  <p>2)	We implemented the weekly picnic.  The picnic idea was first suggested and ran by Csenicer.  This picnic was another project that we thought would grow over time.  It started off as a simple gathering and meeting for trade, conversation and socializing.  It has progressed to also meeting new recruits, include performing initiations, mini raids afterwards, announcements, and promotion ceremonies.  This gathering has proved to be successful and each time we have it we are seeing an average of more and more attendants.<p>3)	It became obviously clear that we needed more officers as we grew and organized ourselves.   It was no coincidence that a month or so after the release of the mentor program we started promoting more officers.  The first to receive a promotion was Officer Wistful.  Soon after were Officer’s Csenicier, Ripped, and Annabell. We went from 6 officers to 11 officers in a very short time.  The goal was definatly to get more pressure off of our current officers, to make room to grow the guild in other directions and also to bring new energy to our efforts.  We knew by adding that many people in a short amount of time, we would cause some confusion at first, but they have overcome that stage and are now making definite visual progress.<p>4)	We had done a couple raids since March including Kaesora (twice) and Dalnir.  Other smaller raids took place such as the slayings of Lucan and several other impromptu hunts.  Then for a short time the guild stopped raiding to focus on some re-organization.  This is around the same time we started having weekly picnics and making internal changes with the Officers and Mentors.  After all those programs were launched it was only to our benefit to begin raiding again.  Officer Csenicier has since organized one official raid each week.  We definatly did not want to set our goals too high only to fall down.  So far we have raided Kael, Trakkanons teeth, Temple of Droga and Kael again.  For the most part the visual part of the raids were successful.   Each time we have added to the number of attendance and have started to evolve in a positive direction around how other members of the guild perform together in groups.  Each of these raids is being watched closely by officer Csenicier and evaluated so we may improve and move ahead.  We expect that not every raid will go as intended.  With each raid we do, we hope to increase the odds more in our favor.<p>Current Items:<p>1)	Please join me in congratulating Officer Ronaf as he has been promoted to the position of High Council.  This position has been left open during the last few months as we re-organized.   High Council is basically an advisor to the Guild Leader.  Ronaf will be assisting with some of the duties and responsibilities that I currently do.   This includes but is not limited to organization of officers and guild activities, conducting ceremonies, interviewing mentors for promotions, and general guild functionality.  Ronaf and I have had lengthy discussions as to what is expected of this position.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact Sir Ronaf or myself.  <p>2)	We are in the process of implementing a guild armory.  We have collected several donations and still have some armory items from when we had tried this project about a year ago.  When we first tried this project it became clear that it was a lot of work.  We have since came up with some ideas that we hope will make it less difficult to run the armory.  Wizzalo will guide this project.  All the details have to be ironed out yet.  The plan was to have this project up and running by now, but this is one of those projects we don’t want to be changing mid stream.  Once the armory is open for business we want to make sure any changes that need to be made are very small.  The armory will also serve as the guild treasury.  The treasury will fund such items we might use on guild raids…such as coffins…gems…ect.  We plan on keeping things such as weapons…armor…spell components...certain  lore items.  One of the main concepts with our armory is the fact that we can recycle certain items within the guild.  In other words, when you no longer have a use for it, you give it back to the armory, someone else can use it, and the loop carries on.  This project should be up and running in the month of August.<p>3)	Officer Wistful is also working on ways to improve the weekly picinic.  One of the ideas we are considering is rotating a theme around over a number of weeks.  Some of the theme’s being considered include Guild Quests, lower level mini-raids,  Armor Exchange night, and Arena duel/battle night.  You should start seeing some of these type of events happen during this month.<p>4)	We are continually in the process of growing our upper ranks.  As the guild grows we need more upper support.  This process is not a fast one.  The members selected to take on these positions are carefully selected.  We have a few candidates selected and will be contacting them shortly.<p>5)	The mentor/recruiting program is constantly being updated for better efficiency.  We still need more members of the guild to volunteer some time for this purpose.  This position is meant to benefit the entire guild, not just the applicants.  The program is designed to get the guild more involved with who our new members are to be.  We definitely are working on ways to include all guild members in this process.  Our reciting process is currently being re-written for this purpose and should be done very soon.  It is important that we get this process down to a science so we can focus on other projects for the guild.  Right now this is our main focus.  Our guild has always taken pride in our filtering of new members.  Our goal is to reduce que time of applicants while at the same time making sure we are accepting only mature type members who would best fit into this guild.  <p>6)	Our roster has always been one of the hardest items to keep updated.  Currently Officer Csenicier is working on ways to make this task easier to manage.  Please be patient as we move ahead on this project.  The current roster gets updated every 2-4 weeks.  Hopefully we can reduce this number drastically.  <p>Future items:<p>1)	I will soon be adding a section of the Roster to include a bit more information about the officers.  The type of information I am planning on adding includes but is not limited to the following…full name, rank, Level, Common play times, specific title (if applicable), pictures and biography of Character in Norrath.  <p>2)	Possibly adding a feature to the guild website that would be a weekly “where am I” puzzle.  This would be a challenge to guild members, which would offer rewards and prizes for the correct answer.  <p>3)	I have been writing in my spare time the making of a Guild Quest.  This event would be a daylong adventure for guild members.  This concept is based off of some ideas I got when attending the Everquest Fanfare.  Each Knight would be put into a group and work as a group.  The quest would take place in various locations in Norrath and will be based on an evolving story line.  Volunteers would become NPC’s in Norrath and the groups would interact with them to achieve certain parts of the quest.  Any ideas, thoughts or suggestions for this event would be gladly appreciated and reviewed.  Writers to help with the story line would also be of great help.<p>4)	Adding a position of guild scribe.  I would like to see the history of this guild remains active and viewable.  I will be seeking out members of the guild who are interested in documenting and reporting on events and history.   These articles would be posted and made viewable on our guild web site.<p>5)  Raiding is fun.  There is no doubt about that.  I soon hope to be recruiting more raid leaders.  This would help diversify Raid times and places.  Inlcuded would be one person specificaly dedicated to lower level raids.  This will certainly not be a fast process.  Before moving into this project, we will be finishing up some of our current activities.  Please be patient as we get ready for this transition.<p><br>I would like to take this time to thank everyone who is putting in time and effort to make all this possible.  I can definitely see that we are making progress and I hope that what I have shared with you today proves that we are all working very hard towards achieving our goals.<p>Respectfully,
