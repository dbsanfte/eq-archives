  <h1> <font color="#993333">DARKEST DESTINY GUILD RULES and CONDUCT GUIDELINE</font></h1>
</center>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">There will be NO fighting on guild channel, take your 
    arguments to tells. Persons that ignore this rule will be removed from guild. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">New Joiners will be proposed and seconded by people 
    who have been in the guild for one month OR after a satisfactory interview 
    with an officer. Players can also apply by writing to my email address posted 
    on the board, but again will be subject to an officer interview. When new 
    recruits join, the Chief Officer will be notified as to date of joining to 
    keep roster up to date. If possible, guild members will provide an email address 
    for Chief officer to send information to as occasion arises. This address 
    will NOT be passed to anyone at anytime. Guild members should not feel pressured 
    to give an email address.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Guild officers will have the web site address and 
    brief info on guild in their inspection window.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Guild officers that post on other message boards (such 
    as www.seventhhammer.net) will include their guild and position in their signature.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Warnings from guild will be subject to either: · Unanimous 
    vote from guild officers. · Guild leader / managers' discretion. Removal from 
    the guild is considered when the following rules are breached: · Kill stealing. 
    · Ninja loot. · Guild preference. It is not good practice to ask non-guild 
    group members to leave to allow guildmates to join. This creates a bad impression, 
    few guilds have a rule concerning this, but I think we should. · Unwarranted 
    / unjustified flames. OOC / Shout are not the best place to air grievances. 
    Flaming of players in these channels if unwarranted is a guild offence. The 
    Chief Officer will hold a record of each players' warnings, operating a 'three 
    strikes and out' policy. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Guild members are encouraged to join events and guild 
    meetings. Teleports / escorts will be provided if required, to and from the 
    event free of charge to encourage those of a low level to attend. If the event 
    involves inter-guild duelling, binds will also be provided free of charge 
    for melee classes at the event and also back at the players' previous bind 
    point afterwards. No guild event / meeting is compulsory however.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Power levelling is not cool. Grouping and advice are 
    encouraged within guild, but power levelling as a guild policy is not encouraged. 
    In some rare instances, this may be useful, but not as a day to day practice. 
    An example of acceptable power-levelling is if a player deletes a character 
    by accident and recreates the same character and needs to quickly return to 
    their original level.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966">Quest help. If an item is normally achievable by a 
    group of the requestors' level + 5(i.e. a party of 6 26-31's could take out 
    Grimfeather for the Ivy armour quests to help a level 26 ranger…) then help 
    to achieve the quest can be offered by anybody. For example, one level 53 
    could take out Grim for the Ivy rune for a 26 ranger. This is a guideline 
    policy, not a definitive rule, designed to promote playing the game as opposed 
    to becoming a guild of Uber Twinkdom.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> There will be absolutely NO begging for items On 
    or Off guild channel. Make your own way, if you need help obtaining an item 
    arrange it with friends/guildies to help you. (This is a game, not everyone 
    is going to be interested in camping you an item all the time. Be reasonable 
    with requests and most importantly, if you get help getting things you have 
    to be willing to assist others obtaining items also.) Repeated,(substantiated) 
    complaints by guild members of begging incidents will result in termination 
    of guild status. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> Vicious attacks on persons, guild or otherwise, will 
    result in termination of guild status. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> The guild leader retains sole rights on guild status 
    removal if present, in guild leaders absence any officer is encouraged to 
    quell problems by either temporarily or permanently removing the problem player 
    from guild.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> Kill stealing is a touchy issue, your reputation 
    and the reputation of Darkest Destiny is important to us. If there is a disagreement 
    over a "camp", try to remain civil, You Are NOT required or asked, to give 
    up a camp if you are certain you were there first! Please use tact when discussing 
    this with non guild players, we are generally a friendly guild and do not 
    want hard feelings for no reason. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> Guild events such as Plane Raids, are not far off 
    for us. I am asking,as your guild leader, for maximum participation. As always, 
    Real Life comes first, however, if you're online it is highly recommended 
    that you participate in scheduled guild events. NO, you will not be tossed 
    out of guild if you decide not to participate, this is a free thinking, free 
    playing guild. However, one of a guilds main functions is to socialize and 
    guild events provide a great opportunity for socialization. </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> Loot rules will be as follows: a. Any member of a 
    guild hunting party may loot, work it out before you start the hunt to avoid 
    stupid arguments. b. Rare items will be rolled for by anyone in the group 
    or groups that participated in the attempt/fight to get the rare item, regardless 
    of who can use. (See section "c" below) c. I suggest strongly, that on guild 
    hunts, the players that can use the rare or valuable loot roll amongst themselves,(for 
    main character). This is not laid in stone but must be decided before the 
    hunt and all involved must agree. EXAMPLE: I am a 52 Druid, our group has 
    looted Djarns Amethyst Ring. There is a 52 warrior that really wants the ring. 
    I also have a 45 Necro that could use the ring. Am I there with my Necro? 
    No. Is he there with his Warrior? Yes. The warrior should really be given 
    the ring at this point UNLESS…I wanted to bring my Necro but a Druid was needed 
    for the camp. In my opinion, and it's just my opinion, the Warrior and Druid 
    should roll for this ring. The main thing is this, the loot procedures should 
    have been agreed to before the ring dropped, not once it's laying on the mobs 
    corpse. The second part of this is which of those characters is my main? I 
    would say the Necro is because I don't plan on leveling the Druid anymore. 
    The entire point of all this is that we want to be fair to everyone, guildies 
    or non guilded hunting partners. d. LOOT should never ever be the cause of 
    a guild problem, sure everyone wants items, but items are replaceable, friends 
    aren't. Do the right thing and everyone wins. One last thing about LOOT, none 
    of us are entitled to LOOT because we are officers, higher levels or the loudest 
    on guild chat. We earn our loot in camps and hunts just like anyone else, 
    and yes that includes Me too.</font><font color="#CC9966"> </font><font color="#CC9966"> 
    </font></li>
  <li><font color="#CC9966"> Play fair, be considerate of others and have fun. 
    That's the last, but probably most important rule we could have. If you treat 
    others as you would like to be treated, this guild will function so smoothly 
    it will be FUN as it was intended.</font></li>
