  Hope the Holidays were great for everyone. The new year is dawning, and so is 
  the rebirth of Darkest Destiny. A few things to look for. First, we are planning 
  a members only Guild Event soon, so keep a look out for information about that 
  in the near future. Also, we are now accepting petitions for new members. We 
  want to keep recruitment down to a minimum right now, just to see how well new 
  members will fit in and give us a chance to all make acquaintances with everyone.</font></P>
<P align="left"><font size="3" color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
  want to encourage people to post messages on the message board. That board is 
  there for people to communicate ideas, needs, wants, freebies, or whatever, 
  so please, use it up. Feel free to list potential guild members there also. 
  Recruitment is something everyone can take part in.</font></P>

<P><font color="#CC6600" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
  the streets of Qeynos, a young man was learning to live life the hard way. Aba</font><font color="#CC6600" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">ndoned 
  at birth at the door of a tavern, he was accepted by the owner as his own son. 
  As a young lad, he would help his father in the business, hearing stories of 
  the great and vast world of Norrath. Although he longed to see the world, he 
  wanted to carry on his father's business and one day pass it on to his children. 
  He was not unhappy working and living here. He loved his father, a well educated 
  man who taught him to read and write. This young man was even named after his 
  father's favorite poet: Eurypedies.<BR>
  <BR>
  Years pass by, and at the tender age of eight, some patrons entered his father's 
  bar and spoke in private with his father. Eurypedies could hear harsh words 
  being spoken through the closed door, and could only make out a few scattered 
  parts of the conversation. To his young mind, however, it made no sense. Revenge? 
  Royal Assassin? Eurypedies had no idea what the whole conversation could mean. 
  Finally, the men left and his father walked out shortly after, a look of weariness 
  on his face. He looked to his adopted son and said, "Get yerself back ta werk, 
  son. Pa's gunna be fine." Eurypedies complied, but could not shake the look 
  on his father's face from his mind.<BR>
  <BR>
  That night, young Eury was being tucked in to bed in the attic when he finally 
  mustered up the courage to ask his father what those men wanted. His father 
  looked at him with gentle eyes and said, "Yer Pa's not a saint, lad. I was once 
  a bad man, and now some people are mad at me cause of it." Eury started to worry, 
  but his father, sensing the words may have uneased his son, smiled and said, 
  "Don't ye worry, son. Pa's gunna be fine." Eury fell to sleep with his father 
  telling him stories of gold and dragons.<BR>
  <BR>
  The smell was what woke him up. Eury does know that even to this day. Eury shot 
  out of bed to see a strange pale orange light coming from his father's room 
  down the hall. Panic struck him as he ran down the hall to his father's room, 
  but he already knew what he would find. Smoke filled his lungs as his little 
  legs pumped across the wooden floor. He got to his father's room and looked 
  at the closed door, he could see little flickers of light dancing around through 
  the cracks in the simple door. He tried to open the door, but it was locked. 
  He screamed for his father, but heard no response. He flung his little hands 
  at the door, trying to break it open, but he was grabbed from behind by strong 
  arms and pulled away. He looked at he door shrinking in the distance and understood 
  that a fire had been set in his father's room.<BR>
  <BR>
  He turned to look at his kidnapper, hoping for a few moments that perhaps it 
  was his father, but he knew it was not. He saw the fire reflecting off the helm 
  of a city guard, one he knew well because he had been a regular patron of this 
  tavern. The guard looked at young Eury and in a strong voice said, "Com'on wee 
  one, we got ta get ya outta here!" Eury went limp and just let the guard carry 
  him out to the street. Once there, he could see an entire flock of people gawking 
  at his life being burned into ashes. Guards barked orders for the water brigade 
  to move faster. Eury turned to look at his home one last time and saw that the 
  flames were now sprouting from every window of the bar. With a sense of calm 
  and adult determination, he knew his father was still in there.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  The misty fog of the early morning made the smoldering ruins of his home look 
  like one of his father's tale of the undead. Guards were scattering now, going 
  about their usual day. They had found his father's body and pulled it from the 
  ashes. They all consoled and pat Eurypedies on the back, telling him how sorry 
  they were. The young Eury did not let one tear fall from his eyes. He stood 
  there like his father would have and just let events go by. Soon, he was left 
  standing alone amidst the ruins of what was once his happy life.<BR>
  <BR>
  Minutes passed by, soon it began to rain. Only then did Eurypedies let himself 
  cry. The rain was a good way to hide tears. As the sobbing boy was wiping his 
  eyes, he looked up to see a weary traveler had come to join him. He was amazed 
  at her beauty, and had only see it equaled a few other times when he had seen 
  others of her kind. He knew she was a wood elf. Although she was wet, she still 
  looked like some princess his father had made tales of. The wood elf looked 
  sadly to the tavern ruins and said, "This was my favorite place in this wretched 
  city! I leave for a few years and return to this?" She shook her head and looked 
  to Eury. "My, you have grown. You were just a infant when I saw you last." She 
  sighed, "Well, this is perfect, my guild is destroyed, my favorite tavern is 
  destroyed, and I now have to witness the spirit of a young boy destroyed. This 
  truly is the darkest destiny we live". Eurypedies looked at her through teary 
  eyes. Ashes were smeared on his face, with a few scrapes and bruises from his 
  urgent pounding on his father's door. The wood elf looked at his hands and uttered 
  a few simple words. The wounds on his body began to mend. He felt a strange 
  tickle as the magic worked its way through his body. "Do you have a place to 
  go? Someone who will look after you?" she asked. Eury nodded, knowing it was 
  a lie, but not wanting to show weakness in this moment. With her deep blue eyes 
  she considered him. She frowned and heaved a great sigh. "You lie to me, young 
  one. But I am wise enough in the ways of Mother Earth to know you have a great 
  destiny ahead of you. What has happened to you will guide your life from now 
  on. You have been chosen to live the darkest destiny that any person may live. 
  Not an evil destiny, your soul is not corrupted, just one that is hard and full 
  of trial." She knelt down and grabbed his head to make him lock eyes with her, 
  "You are a member of the Darkest Destiny. Choose your paths wisely, young lad, 
  or you may have the darkest destiny of all; death."<BR>
  <BR>
  With that, she stood up and pulled her pack from her shoulders. Eury looked 
  on as she pulled some money and food from the sack. She handed them to Eurypedies 
  and then dug something else from inside her backpack: a dagger. She handed him 
  the dagger with a hard look, "You must be careful with that, it will hurt you." 
  He knew what it was, and what it was capable of. His mind raced as he thought 
  of all the things that he could do to the people that hurt him. He grew angry 
  and bitter in a matter of seconds when he thought of the strange men who entered 
  his fathers tavern yesterday.<BR>
  <BR>
  The Elf threw the back pack over her shoulders and looked the boy up and down. 
  She nodded sadly and said, "I will check up on you from time to time, to see 
  how you are. Stay out of trouble." With that, she began to cast a magnificent 
  spell, saying only these last words, "My name here in this life is Twig Fernheart. 
  Anything you need, just ask." With that, she was gone.<BR>
  <BR>
  Eury looked to the sky and felt the cool rain on his face. He knew of a few 
  people down by the Crow tavern that might be able to help him. They were good 
  friends of his father. Eury stuffed a piece of bread in his mouth and headed 
  towards the Crow on the other end of the city. He looked one last time at the 
  remains of his father's tavern and said, "You had the darkest destiny, pa. It's 
  gunna be okay, I'll be fine. You sleep good now, pa."<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC0000" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5">Arathon 
  and Darkest Destiny</font></P>
</B> 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There 
  was a moment of stillness, of final evaluation, and then the goblin tensed, 
  lunged towards Arathon, the stubby dagger in its clawed hand glinting in the 
  moonlight. But it had miscalculated, as Arathon had known it would. It had put 
  all its weight into the leap, and sacrificed balance and control for speed. 
  Deftly side-stepping the creature’s attack, Arathon brought his arm around. 
  His sword sung as it carved a flat arc through the air, before cleaving the 
  creature fully in two. The goblin had been the last of its small band of marauders, 
  and Arathon breathed a sigh. He wiped his blade clean and returned to the campfire. 
  His comrades silently acknowledged his victory with nods and smiles of respect, 
  none so coarse as to shout or cheer – all had seen too much death to find any 
  more such naive delight in killing, no matter how necessary it might be. His 
  magical energy drained for the moment, he settled himself by the fire to meditate, 
  and as he did so he reflected on his good fortune in finding such honourable 
  travelling companions. His old friend, Eurypedies, lay on the other side of 
  the fire, looking at the stars. And as Arathon began to meditate, allowing the 
  trance state to wash over him, his thoughts drifted further into the past...</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">He 
  recalled another Arathon. Young, inexperienced, yet hardworking and keen to 
  learn. He remembered days and nights spent studying in his home village of Surefall 
  Glade. He remembered every spare moment spent in the Qeynos Hills, learning 
  the ways of nature, and practising the skills of the Rangers. He had discovered 
  the art of magic, and had developed those skills with the assistance of his 
  teachers. They had been proud as he took his leave of them. But the Darkness 
  had been abroad in the land back then, as it was now, and he had quickly been 
  thrown into conflict with the evil gnolls and orcs which threatened the Human 
  settlements from their shadowy dens, deep under the hills and forests. As Arathon 
  journeyed east, assisting local farmers and travellers wherever he could, he 
  eventually came to the mountaintop fortress of Highkeep. The people of this 
  citadel community were engaged in a constant struggle against all the forces 
  of Innoruuk, each side vying for control of the Highhold Pass and the path to 
  the Kithicor forest. Whoever had control of that strategic pass would have control 
  over all travel, and therefore commerce, from the Human city of Freeport in 
  the east, to the bustling market town of Qeynos in the west. Arathon quickly 
  decided that his sword would find good work here, and threw in his lot with 
  the defenders of the pass.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">His 
  intended stay of days stretched into weeks, but Arathon fought on. The two sides 
  were well-matched – the numerical superiority of the Orcs balanced well against 
  the sheer fighting skill of the Humans and their allies. Many Humans and Half-Elves 
  fought, many died. Some, simply passing through, would lend their sword arms 
  for a day or two, and move on. And the tide of Orcs never slowed. There seemed 
  no respite from the relentless march of evil from the realm below the mountains.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
  then came a new ally. A man dressed in dark armour – a rogue, who joined the 
  fray no sooner had he arrived at the citadel. This new soldier was called Eurypedies, 
  and he proved himself quickly in the seemingly eternal war. His manner was light-hearted, 
  but his eyes showed a great pain, a burden which manifested itself in an apparently 
  unstoppable fury in combat. Orc after Orc fell to Eurypedies’ blade, and he 
  quickly earned the respect and trust of many of the fighters of Highkeep. Arathon 
  in particular determined to make the rogue’s acquaintance and, being impressed 
  with the man’s keen mind, and unending courage, soon befriended him.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They 
  fought together from then on, their combined strength, experience and valour 
  making them a formidable team against the Orcs. But through all this time, Eurypedies’ 
  eyes held their terrible secret, and it was only when he felt his trust in Arathon 
  was absolute that he finally related his story.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;You 
  say I fight as though possessed by demons,&quot; he said in conclusion. &quot;In 
  truth, you are perceptive. When I stand at arms with my brethren here, I fight 
  not one, but two foes, each as terrible as the other. My strength, in no small 
  part, stems from my demons, but I must be vigilant always. These monsters within 
  - they present me with strength to choose a path, but they will me towards one 
  alone... That path will lead me to my darkest destiny, and it is a path I do 
  not care to tread. I have chosen a purpose, and as there is living breath in 
  my body, to that purpose I will remain true.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">And 
  the words themselves rang true in Arathon’s heart. Eurypedies’ story was parallel 
  to his own. The continual struggle to make a difference, the fight to control 
  those things which might otherwise control him – hatred, fear, pain, the ability 
  to kill... These things could be tools to be used, or, without watchfulness, 
  could twist a man to their own evil will and ultimately destroy him. The two 
  fighters talked long, until the night grew old, and the glimmer of dawn appeared 
  in the east. Eurypedies stood, and looked to the horizon, at the approach of 
  the new day.</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;Arathon,&quot; 
  he said, &quot;we are kindred, you and I. Brothers in purpose. We should stand 
  together. And there are others like us, all across Norrath, but for the expanse 
  of these lands already united in our belief in our ability to make a better 
  world. We must seek out these souls so that we might all stand together. Our 
  Darkest Destiny may always be with us, but with unity and strength we can face 
  it and emerge into a new dawn of our own. Will you join me, my friend?&quot;</font></P>
<P><font color="#CC6600" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Eurypedies 
  held out his hand. Arathon, sensing the truth and faith in his words, did not 
  hesitate. A new alliance was forged.</font></P>
