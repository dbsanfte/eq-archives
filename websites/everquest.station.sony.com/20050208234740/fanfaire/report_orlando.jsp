                    Mennix Report. In my ongoing endeavor to justify the company 
                    sending me to Fan Faires, I am proud to present my thoughts, 
                    opinions, ramblings, sentence paddings, and other fine meanderings 
                    of my mind. </span></p>

                    or serve in any other way than to express my thoughts on an 
                    EverQuest Fan Faire. I usually do provide more in depth coverage 
                    on selected subjects and will be publishing them throughout 
                    the week. So, with that in mind, I shall begin.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="textBold">Airport 
                    Security </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">In the past, 
                    if I had a flight departure time of 10:00 am, I would arrive 
                    at the airport around 9:15 and make it to the gate just as 
                    the last passengers were boarding. I am not big on sitting 
                    around an airport waiting to leave. But, due to the heightened 
                    security at our airports, I actually arrived for my flight 
                    two hours in advance of the departure time for my flight to 
                    Orlando - and I am glad I did. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">I am not going 
                    to sit here and rant about the personal inconveniences caused 
                    from the results of September 11th. To me, I was not inconvenienced. 
                    I was thankful for the increase in security and attention 
                    to detail. I was looking forward to getting to Orlando and 
                    having a great time. Besides, you can't have a party without 
                    a halfling present.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">So, as I stood 
                    in line at passenger screening and then waiting to board the 
                    aircraft, I thought about all the things I wanted to do when 
                    I got to Orlando. And topping that list, I wanted to go straight 
                    to my room and relax a bit before heading to the lounge to 
                    meet everyone. Traveling makes this halfling sleepy.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text"><i>Wavy flashback 
                    lines ahead</i></span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">In most hotels, 
                    the bar and or slash lounge is in sight and near check in. 
                    Every Fan Faire I have attended as soon as I checked in and 
                    turned around, with the hopes of reaching my room to drop 
                    of my luggage, I heard the words, &quot;Mennix, let me buy 
                    you a drink.&quot; Who am I to say no thank you? As that old 
                    adage goes, the customer is always right. With most companies, 
                    each employee is encouraged to go that extra step when dealing 
                    with the public&#133;so, I always took one for the team. Valiant 
                    of me wasn't it?</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">These thoughts 
                    of past Fan Faires raged about my mind as the hands on the 
                    clock crawled towards departure time. I wanted to do something 
                    different in Orlando. I didn't want to be stuck in a bar all 
                    night with my luggage strewn around my feet waiting for a 
                    polite opportunity to dash upstairs and stow my belongings. 
                    What to do? What to do? What to do?</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Then I remembered: 
                    No one really knew I was attending Fan Faire. I didn't know 
                    myself until a few days before. During past events, I would 
                    let some people know and promise to meet them when I arrived 
                    at the hotel. Now, for Orlando, I could walk right in, get 
                    my room, kick off the shoes and let my socks air out and mosey 
                    on downstairs at my leisure. This would be the first Fan Faire 
                    where I met people without that tired glassy-eyed, travel-weary, 
                    face of mine.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="textBold">Arriving 
                    at the Rosen Centre</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">I made my way 
                    to the registration desk. Around 7:30 in the evening Thursday, 
                    I got my key card and turned around with my luggage.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">&quot;Mennix! 
                    Hey, let me buy you a drink!&quot;</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Time to take 
                    one for the team.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="textBold">The Early 
                    Bird Party</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Fan Faires have 
                    always officially began on a Friday night with a reception 
                    that starts at 8:00 pm. The Orlando Fan Faire was no different 
                    although most attendees started showing up at the hotel on 
                    Thursday. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">The Early Bird 
                    Party was first created on the Fan Faire message boards back 
                    before the Baltimore Fan Faire when a player suggested that 
                    everyone arriving Thursday night should get together in a 
                    centralized location for a pre-celebration celebration. And 
                    where is more central in a hotel than the hotel bar?</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Hey, traditions 
                    have to be born somewhere.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Once again, 
                    there were only about 800,000,000,000 players from Tarew Marr 
                    that showed up for the Fan Faire. You enter the hotel and 
                    notice a slight humming noise. As you round the corner, the 
                    buzzing grows until you draw within range of the bar and the 
                    Early Bird Party where a cacophony erupts from a grouping 
                    of tables where some folks were gathered in celebration. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Yep, Tarew Marr 
                    was in da'house. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Then Povar showed 
                    up and made that Tarew Marr hullabaloo sound like a meek little 
                    whisper.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Although the 
                    Early Bird Party is not an official event, it is sure to be 
                    a tradition at future Fan Faires.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="textBold">Friday, 
                    Friday, Friday</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">We had meeting 
                    a few days before Fan Faire here in our San Diego office for 
                    all of us employees who would be heading to Orlando. Don't 
                    do this. Don't do that. Yes, you can do that. You can do this, 
                    but if you get in trouble, we don't know you. That sort of 
                    meeting. One thing that was made very clear though was the 
                    fact that all of us were required to attend the organizational 
                    meeting on Friday during Fan Faire in Orlando. I had no idea 
                    what this meeting would be about.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">The organizational 
                    meeting was scheduled to take place at 10:00 am in one of 
                    super secret sony hotel rooms on Friday morning. Uhm, Friday 
                    morning? Early Bird Party the Thursday night before? Uhm, 
                    uhm, uhm? </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Needless to 
                    say, I attended. It was a meeting and we may have been told 
                    something important, national security important-like. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Yeah, right. 
                    It was a ruse concocted to get some work out of me. Instead 
                    of the meeting I was duped into attending, I ended up counting 
                    EverQuest merchandise and stuffing name tags into the plastic 
                    name tag holders. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Ok, it wasn't 
                    that bad. I actually like everyone I work with so spending 
                    time with them is always fun.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">The official 
                    Fan Faire began Friday at 8:00 in the evening with a casual 
                    reception held in the ballroom. Tables, the kind you stand 
                    at not sit down at, were scattered throughout the room with 
                    server signs on them so that people could quickly find players 
                    from their servers. Of course the term &quot;quickly&quot; 
                    has a whole new meaning when dealing with 1000 plus people 
                    in a ballroom. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">The reception 
                    ended at 10:00 and the parties began in various rooms throughout 
                    the hotel. Again, I took one for the team. My dedication knows 
                    no bounds.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="textBold">Saturday 
                    - Whole Lotta Fan Faire</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Saturday just 
                    kind of happened. I don't think anyone was even looking for 
                    it. So many people were preoccupied on Friday night with things 
                    like the socio-economic distinctions of16th century French 
                    aristocracy compared to that of the rise of the industrial 
                    revolution in Piqua, Ohio that time seemed to just slip by. 
                    Of course, theories of time and space and how they relate 
                    to the human genome was also keeping people preoccupied. Most 
                    people probably think we just hang out and party at these 
                    Fan Faires when in fact we are engrossed in discovering the 
                    nature of ourselves. Really! Honest!</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">This is the 
                    big Fan Faire day. A live quest, discussion panels, an in-game 
                    quest, an in-game wedding, dinner and awarding of prizes were 
                    all on the agenda. I also had the honor of escorting Denise 
                    &quot;Firiona Vie&quot; Harris-Kester who was all decked out 
                    in her Firiona garb from her room to the main event. It's 
                    always fun to watch heads turn when she enters a room.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Once Cindy Archuleta 
                    started the day's activities at 1:00 by welcoming everyone 
                    and introducing us SOE people, the Live Quest began. Players 
                    joined up in server groups consisting of 10 - 14 members, 
                    chose a leader, and ran pell-mell throughout the hotel trying 
                    to solve the quest and be the lucky winners of free copies 
                    of Shadows of Luclin that will be shipped to them once released. 
                    I'm sorry, but I can't reveal any information on the quest 
                    itself because Cindy and Tessa would beat me up. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">No, they wouldn't 
                    really beat me up, they would just give me some serious stink 
                    eye which is much worse.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">At 3:30 the 
                    Live Quest came to an end. Quest packages were turned in and 
                    under heavy guard, stashed in a secret bunker in order to 
                    be cataloged and a winner determined.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">From 3:30 to 
                    5:00 discussion panels were held in meeting rooms and an in-game 
                    quest was conducted on the big view screen the hotel had set 
                    up for us, including a demo of Shadows of Luclin also.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Let's see, I 
                    believe there were 6 separate discussion panels going on. 
                    There is only one rather adorable little halfling with extremely 
                    sexy foothair responsible for covering each one of them at 
                    the same time. So, I did the best that I could in portraying 
                    the image of a hard working halfling. (One of these days I 
                    might explain the difference between portraying the image 
                    of a hard working halfling and actually being a hard working 
                    halfling).</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Here are the 
                    panels and who chaired them. You may be reading more on some 
                    of these as the week goes on and I continue my coverage on 
                    the Fan Faire.</span></p>

                    at 7:00 when security swung open the doors and people rushed 
                    in. Kudos to the wait staff for keeping their composure. When 
                    players got their registration package at the beginning of 
                    Fan Faire, they received two tickets. One ticket was for their 
                    free t-shirt provided by RPGwear (Cory, I still haven't decided 
                    if I am going to publish your dark secrets or not) and the 
                    other was the raffle ticket for door prizes. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">But a funny 
                    thing happened on the way to the Fan Faire&#133;all the raffle 
                    ticket stubs got thrown away on accident before dinner. Have 
                    no fear! We got new tickets and some of our valiant staff 
                    went from table to table handing out a new ticket to everyone 
                    thus saving the raffle. Yay! </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">I don't know 
                    what anyone else thought, but I had me some good eat'ns all 
                    weekend, and the dinner served to us that night was very good 
                    indeed - breast of chicken resting on a bed of wild rice, 
                    bathed in a piquant lemon sauce, accompanied by buttered asparagus 
                    that captured the flavor of&#133;.gah! Enough with the prosey 
                    food writing. This is the Mennix Report, not some snooty food 
                    column. The food was good. It was chicken and rice. Yummy! 
                    'Nuff said.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">Dinner ended 
                    and prizes for the Live Quest and raffle drawings were awarded. 
                    The EverQuest Fan Faire - Orlando was now officially over. 
                    And the parties began again. </span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text"><br>
                    Here's where I get serious.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">I'd like to 
                    touch upon what this Fan Faire really meant to me. During 
                    our time of national crisis when America and its allies are 
                    waging an active war against forces of terrorism, an EverQuest 
                    Fan Faire event is a prime example of the ability of Americans 
                    to stand together as a strong community and not let terrible 
                    forces disrupt our lives. On September 11, our lives were 
                    changed. On October 19 and 20, we came together and had fun, 
                    showing perpetrators of terror that they can't intimidate 
                    us.</span></p>
                  <p class="bold" align="left"><span class="text">I will be providing 
                    additional coverage of the Fan Faire throughout the week. 
                    I hope you keep stopping by to check it out.</span></p>
