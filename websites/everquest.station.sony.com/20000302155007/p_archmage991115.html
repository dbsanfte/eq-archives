Q: When I party, how much experience does a pet take from my group.
</STRONG>

<P>

A: When you group, the pet takes a <B>minimal to zero</B> experience share 
from your party.  This is different from soloing - when you solo, your pet 
<B>does</B> take a percent of the experience that you would ordinarily have 
gotten.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

On average, a pet will take about a .5 to 1 (out of 100) percent party 
experience share.  From personal summoning experience, a pet is always worth 
having in a group <B>if</B> you are in an environment that is pet friendly.

<STRONG>
Q: Is there a different saving throw for Root and Grasping Roots?
</STRONG>

<P>

A: No.  Root and Grasping Roots use exactly the same saving throw algorithms.  
The fact that Grasping Roots does a single hit of damage when it immobilizes the 
creature does not get figured in to the saving throw math - if the creature fails 
its save verses Grasping Root, damage is applied.  If the creature makes the save, 
no damage is done.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Once again, there is <B>no difference</B> between the saving throw for Root and 
Grasping Root (or any of their higher level versions), urban myth notwithstanding.

</font><A NAME="fourroots"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: What is the difference between Root, Enstill, Immobilize and Paralyzing Earth? 
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: The Root (and Grasping Root) series of spells are a bit confusing because they do 
not upgrade like most other EverQuest spells.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

First a bit of information on Root spells.  When a Root spell is cast, the Target 
gets a saving throw.  If the saving throw succeeds, then the Target is not Rooted.  
If the saving throw fails, then the Target’s movement is reduced to zero.  Every 
designated time increment after that, the Target gets a reduced percent saving throw 
to break out of Root.  

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The Target gets an additional reduced percent saving throw every time they are damaged 
- by melee or by magic.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

This being said:

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Root</B> (and <B>Grasping Roots</B>) are the baseline from which all other Root spells are 
measured.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Enstill</B> (and <B>Ensnaring Roots</B>) have a longer potential duration then Root.  You 
would use this spell if you were trying to keep a creature out of combat.  If you 
plan on damaging the creature, then use Root.  If you just want the creature to 
stay out of the way (say you are fighting two creatures), then you would use Enstill.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Immobilize</B> (and <B>Enveloping Roots</B>) have a quicker casting time then Root, and 
have slightly longer potential durations.  This is in all ways an upgrade to Root, 
with the only downside being the higher mana cost.  You would use this spell when 
you expect the creature to be within melee range of you and casting time is important.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Paralyzing Earth</B> (and <B>Engulfing Roots</B>) both have four times the potential duration of 
Root and twice the potential duration of Enstill.  It is in all ways an upgrade to 
Enstill.  You would use this spell in the same circumstances that you would use Enstill.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

As a note, each of the Druidic Grasping Root spells do more damage then the previous 
versions.


</font><A NAME="feigndeath"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: How do the new Monk / Necromancer / ShadowKnight changes to Feign Death work?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: Feign Death was recently changed by the Tuning Team to reflect evolving gameplay 
issues.  Since two of the three classes that get Feign Death get it through spells, 
I thought this might be a good place to explain the changes.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Previously, when you used Feign Death (and assuming you cast the spell successfully 
or, in the case of the Monk, made your skill roll) hostile monsters would decided 
that you were dead and wander off.  When you later got up, they would still remember 
that they were angry with you.  If you were within sight, they would immediately 
come after you.  If not, they would come after you at some later point.  This might 
happen within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later.  The only way 
to be absolutely sure that a monster had forgotten about you was to zone.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

With our new changes, about a third of the time that you successfully Feign Death, 
the monster will immediately forget about you, similar to an Enchanter casting 
Memory Blur.  If they do NOT forget about you, they will immediately come after you 
when you stand up.  No more monsters coming back at irregular amounts of time - it 
should be immediate or not at all.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

This is a change - the old way, if you Feigned Death a <B>single time</B>, the 
monster would <B>always</B> remember you.  This way, they remember you about 
two-thirds of the time.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Using the old Feign Death, you could Feign Death multiple times to try to confuse 
the monster.  After about seven or eight times doing this, most monsters would 
eventually forget they were mad at you. 

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

With the new Feign Death, if you Feign Death once the monster has about a 65 
percent chance of remembering you.  Twice and the monster has about a 50 percent 
chance of remembering you.  Four times means about 20 percent, and six times means 
about 8 percent.  This is very similar to the old Feign Death.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Another addition to the new Feign Death involves a monster "going home."  When you 
Feign Death, most monsters will return to where they were before the fight.  If a 
monster returns to its initial location, it will immediately forget about you 
greater then 90 percent of the time.  Therefore, if you Feign Death and stay down 
long enough for a monster to "go home," you should be safe when you stand up a 
majority of the time.  If the monster <B>is</B> still mad at you, it will return 
immediately, rather then wandering back later at some irregular interval.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Late Breaking News</B>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

After further testing and watching these changes on the Live verses the Test 
Server, we will be changing Feign Death again on the next patch.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

New changes will make it so that if the monster is less then level 35, the monster will 
<B>always</B> forget about you.  If the monster is greater then level 35 it 
will use the changes detailed above.

</font><A NAME="spellread"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Why is [X] spell worse then [Y] spell?  I used [insert name of program that 
strips spell information here], and...
</STRONG>

<P>

A: OK - STOP.  All of those nifty programs that supposedly strip out the 
information for our spell are nice for reading what class can cast the spell, 
or the text that the spell displays when it is cast - but then again, a good 
website can tell you that.  I've checked out a lot of those programs, and I 
have yet to see one that ACCURATELY tells the effects of a spell.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

At this point, I would trust information from websites more then I would from one 
of these programs.  The information from webistes usually comes from players who 
have gotten the data first hand.


</font><A NAME="lifetap"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: When my ShadowKnight casts Lifetap, it takes more mana then when my Necromancer 
casts it.  Is this a bug?
</STRONG>


</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">


A: This is not a bug.  It does take more mana for your SK to cast a Lifetap spell 
then it would take a Necromancer of the same level.  

<P>

We did a lot of Internal and Test Server testing on this one, and set the mana cost 
to a level that we felt was appropriate to the level of power that we wanted to add to 
the SK.  ShadowKnights gave up three fairly ineffective spells for three spells that 
will help to reduce their downtime.  Until this point, the only healing that a 
ShadowKnight had access to was their 22nd level spell Vampiric Embrace.  With the 
addition of the three Lifetap spells, the ShadowKnight now has access to limited 
healing abilities - they can siphon life from other creatures and add it to their own.  
These spells will not be mana efficient for dealing damage - 
SK DoT spells will be much more effective in that regard.  These spells will, however, 
let the ShadowKnight reduce her downtime 
by siphoning life at the end of a fight or from a nearby light green.

</font><A NAME="cancelmagic"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Changes to Cancel Magic
</STRONG>

<P>

A: Cancel Magic (and all of its variants) were recently made into Party Only spells 
- similar to Invisibility.  This was done for the same reasons that we made 
Invisibility Party Only - to cut down on player abuse.  Some players of more malicious 
intent were casting Cancel Magic on other players to get rid of their beneficial 
Buff style spells.  This got around our play nice policy - effectively letting a 
NON PVP player adversely effect another NON PVP player.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

To combat this, we made Cancel Magic Party Only.  This means that you can only cast 
the spell on Party Members.  The exception to this is if the target of your spell 
is a Player AND is not under their own control - say from a charm or a Fear spell.  
In this case, all Players are allowed to cast Cancel Magic on the effected player (to help
get rid of the Charm or Fear).  
We feel that this solution will let players have the best of all possible worlds for 
Cancel Magic.


</font><A NAME="bardsong"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 49?
</STRONG>

<P>

A: When we was finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave some room for 
expansion during the evolution of EverQuest.  Because Bards get one song per 
level, if we had given them all fifty songs there would have been no room for 
expansion - aside from taking away older songs.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Expect to see new songs coming soon.  These songs will not be 
anything that radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions 
that help keep the Bard interesting at high levels.

<STRONG>N O N &nbsp; S P E L L &nbsp; Q U E S T I O N S</STRONG>

<BR><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Is it true that I get more experience when I party?
</STRONG>

<P>

A: Yes.  If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience.  If a party of two 
kills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), divided by two 
(half of that experience for each of you).  The bigger your party, the bigger 
that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people then for 
then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc.

<P>

As a side note, pets do NOT count towards P (2 players and 2 pets still count as 
a party of 2).

<STRONG>
Q: Who made all of those wonderful spell graphics?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: One of our extremely talented artists Scott McDaniel designed all of the spell 
graphics.  I was involved to the point of saying "we need some graphics for these 
spells - and they should look cool."  Scott did the rest.

Q: In every screen shot you always have a Skull Staff.  Which staff is it that you carry?
</STRONG>

<P>

A: Contrary to popular belief I do not carry a Staff of Writhing or a Staff of 
Discord.  I carry the Skull Staff of Geoffrey.  Sometimes its good to be the 
Arch Mage.
