<P><B>DoN FAQ</B> </P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Will Dragons of Norrath be available in stores or only for digital download?<BR><BR>a. This expansion will be available for digital download and in retail outlets.<BR>
<LI>What are the system requirements?<BR><BR>a. Dragons of Norrath uses the standard EverQuest system requirements which are listed on <A href="http://www.everquest.com/">www.everquest.com</A>. There is no increase in minimum specs for this expansion.<BR>
<LI>What level range is this expansion aimed at?<BR><BR>a. There is content for characters from level 45 and up. There are raids, multiple group events and single group adventures. <BR><BR>b. There are features for players of every level which include the potion belt, the bandolier and the Looking for Guild tool.<BR>
<LI>I hear that you revamped Lavastorm with new art and new NPCs. Does everyone get this new zone, or do we have to buy the expansion to get it?<BR><BR>a. Lavastorm is available right now to all EverQuest subscribers. <BR>
<LI>When you revamped Lavastorm, did you change the level of the NPCs?<BR><BR>a. The zone still has content for the players of the same level, but it also has additional content for players of a slightly higher level, along with many new quests.<BR>
<LI>I've been told that some of the adventures in Dragons of Norrath start with NPCs in two camps in Lavastorm. Some people tell me that these NPCs evil races can get adventures from one camp and can't get them from the other. Are these adventures really restricted by the race of our characters or existing factions?<BR><BR>a. All PCs will start neutral to the new camps, but they will have to make a choice about which camp to ally with. Even if you are well-liked by one camp, you can still help your friends on their adventures for the other camp.<BR>
<LI>DoN will allow you to summon your corpses to the Guild Lobby, does that work?<BR><BR>a. The Guild Lobby is accessible to anyone, even those not in a guild, as long as they own the expansion. Using the altar in the Guild Lobby you can summon your corpse from anywhere in Norrath, however, there is a cost associated with summoning your corpse, dependent on your level.<BR>
<LI>Where will the Guild Lobby and Barter Zone be located?<BR><BR>a. They can both be accessed from the Plane of Knowledge. They are located on the eastern side of the central section of the zone.<BR>
<LI>Does everyone have access to the Guild Bank?<BR>a. While everyone in the guild that owns the expansion can deposit and view any of the items in the guild bank, you can only withdraw items that have been designated for you or for all guild members to withdraw. Guild Banker Members can perform these designations and withdraw any item. 10) How do I designate a Guild Banker? <BR><BR>a. Only your guild leader can designate guild bankers. He or she does so by using the Guild Management Window (ALT-G by default), selecting the member and clicking the check-box next to the label "Banker" at the bottom of the window. You can tell that a member is a banker by the 'B' next to his membership rank (M, O, L) in the Guild Management Window.<BR>
<LI>What does "Public Can Use" mean as a withdrawal designation in the Guild Bank?<BR><BR>a. Only guild members who can use that item (for equipment, this means "can wear the item") are allowed to withdraw an item with that designation.<BR>
<LI>Can guild members that do not own Dragons of Norrath enter the Guild Hall.<BR><BR>a. You must own the expansion to enter the Guild Hall.<BR>
<LI>I hear that there will be some sort of new map introduced with this expansion. Will this replace our old maps? <BR><BR>a. No. The atlas is an enhancement to the map system and will not replace your existing maps.<BR>
<LI>In the Barter Zone, can I set up to buy 20 bat wings and offer a Combine Scimitar in compensation?<BR><BR>a. No, you can only buy a single item. Everything in the "compensation" will be given in trade to the seller for the item you are buying. Each time the seller sells you one of the item you are asking for, he or she will get all of the items you listed as compensation.<BR>
<LI>When I do a search in the barter window, the item I'm looking for doesn't show up. Why not?<BR><BR>a. The barter search list only displays tradable items that have already been discovered by players. If the item you are looking for can't be traded it will not show up in the search.<BR>
<LI>Why isn't my 6 charge Blood of the Wolf showing up in the "my inventory" section of the barter window?<BR><BR>a. Only fully charged items (if the item has charges) can be traded in the barter system.<BR>
<LI>When I go to a buyer and try to sell him something, I click sell and nothing happens. Why?<BR><BR>a. If either you or the buyer do not have inventory space that will allow the transaction to occur, the transaction will be cancelled. So if you only have two open inventory slots and the transaction would give you three items, the transaction will not go through.<BR>
<LI>When I click "Start Barter" to go into buyer mode several of my buy-lines are changed to "inactive". Why does this happen?<BR><BR>a. If the system determines that you do not have the compensation for that buy-line then the buy-line will go inactive. This check is also performed after each transaction. <BR>
<LI>I've seen some stats on the new cultural armor. Why aren't they better?<BR><BR>a. You've seen the statistics on the base armor. The armor is not complete without the augments that attune them to your chosen deity. We think you'll find the complete armor pieces to be very nice.<BR>
<LI>Is the new cultural armor no-drop?<BR><BR>a. The new cultural armor and augments are attunable. Once the armor is worn or augmented, or once the augments are sealed to a piece of armor, they become no-drop. <BR>
<LI>How do I access the potion belt?<BR><BR>a. To access the potion belt press the key combination that is assigned to the potion belt window. Default is SHIFT-P.<BR>
<LI>How do I add a potion to the potion belt? a. Place a potion on your cursor, then click on an active potion belt slot in the potion belt window.<BR>
<LI>How do I use a potion from the potion belt?<BR><BR>a. There are 3 ways to use a potion that is in the potion belt.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>i. Right click on the slot in the potion belt window.<BR>ii. Use the assigned hotkey for that potion belt slot.<BR>iii. Use the /potionbelt activate # command.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>How do I remove a potion from the potion belt?<BR><BR>a. The only way to remove a potion from the potion belt is by using the /potionbelt remove # command.<BR>
<LI>Why is one of my potion belt slots red?<BR><BR>a. You no longer have any of that type of potion in your inventory. <BR>
<LI>How do I know how many potions I have left?<BR><BR>a. The number of charges you have available of a potion is displayed in the upper left of the potion belt slot.<BR>
<LI>How do I know if a potion can be used with the potion belt?<BR><BR>a. The item display window for a potion will display "Potion Belt Enabled" in its item display window. You can see the item display window by right-clicking and holding on the item.<BR>
<LI>How many potions can it hold?<BR><BR>a. The potion belt allows you to access two different potions. When you assign a potion to be accessed through the potion belt, you are telling it to access all potions of that same type. So if you have ten potions of the same type and you assign one to the potion belt, you will see the item with ten "charges" appear in the belt slot.<BR>
<LI>How do I access the bandolier?<BR><BR>a. To access the bandolier press the key combination that is assigned to open the bandolier window. Default is B.<BR>
<LI>How do I add a weapon set to my bandolier?<BR><BR>a. To add a weapon set to the bandolier first select the slot in the bandolier list window that you want the weapon set to fill. Next, click the add button. Finally, enter the name of the weapon set and click ok in the dialog box.<BR>
<LI>How do I clear a bandolier slot?<BR><BR>a. Click on the slot that you want to clear and then click the delete button.<BR>
<LI>How do I activate a bandolier slot?<BR><BR>a. There are 4 ways to activate a bandolier slot.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>i. Click the slot you want activated then press the activate button.<BR>ii. Make a hot key using the Hot Button key and place the newly created hot button in the hot buttons window. Then click on that hot button. <BR>iii. Use the /bandolier activate "bandolier set name" command<BR>iv. Check the auto swap check box in the bandolier window and then anytime you select a bandolier slot it will activate it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>What are the inventory slots on the left side of the bandolier window?<BR><BR>a. The inventory slots on the left side of the window display the items that make up the currently selected weapon set. If you do not have an item the item slot will be red.<BR>
<LI>What does activating a weapon set do?<BR><BR>a. Activating a weapon set in the bandolier window will change the weapons that you are currently equipping to the first weapons found in your inventory that match the weapon set item. This will allow you to quickly change the weapons your character is currently wielding.<BR>
<LI>Where do the weapons I am currently wielding go when I activate a weapon set?<BR><BR>a. The weapons you are currently wielding will go into the first empty slot found in your inventory.<BR>
<LI>I tried to get an adventure from one of the NPCs at the camp, but it tells me I don't meet the requirements for any available shared tasks. What does that mean?<BR><BR>a. We generally refer to the adventures given out by the new NPCs as "shared tasks". Shared tasks can require a minimum and maximum number of players, minimum and maximum levels and level spread, and may require players to have certain flags. You will get a message if you do not meet one of the requirements set on that adventure. If you do not qualify for any tasks, make sure the players in your group or raid do not differ by too much in level and are appropriate for the tasks the NPC is giving out. If the tasks you would like to do require certain flags or expansions, make sure all the players have them.<BR>
<LI>How do I add and remove players from my shared task?<BR><BR>a. Anyone in your raid or group when you create the shared task will automatically be added. After that, you can use the commands /taskaddplayer <NAME>and /taskremoveplayer <NAME>to add and remove players. You may also use the "Add Player" and "Remove Player" buttons in the Shared Task tab of the Task Window. Anytime you try to add or remove a player, your party must still meet the requirements for the shared task, or you may not be allowed to make the change, or your shared task may be terminated.<BR>
<LI>Why does it tell me the shared task is not allowing players to be added or removed? a. Some tasks have a defined restriction that the leader may not add or remove players after a certain element has been completed. However, players may still quit the task if they so desire.<BR>
<LI>Can we change leaders in a shared task?<BR><BR>a. Yes. The leader can transfer leadership using the 'Make Leader' button in the Shared Task tab of the Task Window, or /taskmakeleader <NAME>.<BR>
<LI>How do I quit a shared task?<BR><BR>a. You can select the shared task in the Task Window and click 'Remove', or type /taskquit.<BR>
<LI>What happens if I am offline when my party finishes the shared task? Do I get the reward?<BR><BR>a. The shared task remains active for 30 minutes after completion. If you log back in while it is still active, you will receive the reward.<BR>
<LI>Why does it say I can't loot a corpse because I don't belong to the shared task?<BR><BR>a. When a group or raid has any members with a shared task, any NPCs killed may only be looted by members of the shared task.<BR>
<LI>Why can't I group (or raid) with somebody with a different shared task?<BR><BR>a. The shared task system is set up to allow you to invite players who are not in your group or raid to help with the shared task. However, you are not allowed to have people with different shared tasks in the same group or raid. A group or raid can only have one shared task at a time.<BR>
<LI>Why does the shared task stay in my window after we've completed it?<BR><BR>a. You remain in a shared task for 30 minutes after completion. This allows players time to loot, retrieve corpses, perform optional elements of the task, and allows time for link dead players to log back in and receive their reward. You can manually remove the task from yourself by choosing the task in the task window and clicking "Remove", or by using /taskquit.</LI></OL>
