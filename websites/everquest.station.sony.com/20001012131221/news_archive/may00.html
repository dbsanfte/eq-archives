                  of King Ak'Anon and the Ak'Anon Parliament. The Gnome places

                Guild Alliance </font><font size="-2">7:30 PM<br>
                </font></b> <font size="-1"> An alliance of good guilds is forming 
                on Brell Serilis:</font> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">To the Good Guilds of Brell Serelis</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Hail and well met, leaders and members of the 
                  fine guilds that defend justice, kindness, and truth on Brell 
                  Serelis! We have many, many such guilds on our server. Each 
                  are great in their own way. A thought has crossed my mind to 
                  make us greater still.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Brell has always been a relatively peaceful 
                  and quiet server. There aren't a whole lot of non-guild raids, 
                  wars, or events. Because of this, our guilds have generally 
                  found it easiest to go through life on their own, with little 
                  need for active alliances and the like. This is not a bad system. 
                  However, there are times when we need to be stronger, times 
                  when we need to band together and strike down evil, times where 
                  we just need support, times when one guild, no matter how great, 
                  can accomplish something. No one guild can continuously fight 
                  to retake the lands that evil has taken from us. No one guild 
                  can be there across the world to help that person getting killed 
                  feet from safety, or to respond to evil uprisings and attacks. 
                  Overall, no one guild can accomplish all the goals of good.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">That is why no one guild must stand alone to 
                  do so any longer. I am issuing an invitation to all the good 
                  guilds of Brell to come to a conference. At this conference, 
                  we will lay the groundwork for a world-wide alliance of all 
                  the guilds that are interested. The exact functions that this 
                  alliance would perform , and how it would carry these out ,will 
                  be up to us as we carry this on in further meetings, until things 
                  are finalized and implemented. It is my goal to have all the 
                  good guilds of Brell united through a council of representatives 
                  to keep communications open, organize ongoing operations in 
                  the name and intent of good, and make Norrath better for the 
                  good people that inhabit it.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">We would like to see 2-5 representatives from 
                  all the good guilds here. The number of people from each guild 
                  in no way affects the decision making process at this stage. 
                  We will set a more formal and concrete representative system 
                  once we have the basic workings of the alliance laid out. We 
                  will, within the council, eventually elect people to key positions 
                  such as military operations, economics, public relations, and 
                  more as we determine needs. With cooperation from all ,we will 
                  make this a grand alliance that is never resting in it's battle 
                  against evil. Come, help achieve that dream.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">- Lerdar</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">OOC: The meeting will be on Wednesday, June 
                  14th, and will begin at 7 PM CST. It is to be held in North 
                  Kaladim, at the enterance to the mines. I chose this place both 
                  in honor of our dwarves, and so we may communicate via /shout 
                  and /ooc with little disturbance-North Kaladim isn't the most 
                  populated place at any given time. Please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:legomanm@aol.com">Legomanm@aol.com</a> 
                  with your guild name and the number of people you have coming. 
                  Let us take Norrath, not with an iron fist, but an open palm.</font></p>

                  lower level characters from the North Karana ring.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Format: There will be 3 categories... Haiku, 
                  Limerick, and Free-form. Each will be judged and awarded prizes 
                  independently. Freeform poems can be of any length, form, or 
                  subject, provided they pertain to EQ, or an EQ topic as their 
                  main content. Freeform poems can be sent at any time, up to 
                  June 14th, at <a href="mailto:SWPoetry@hotmail.com">SWPoetry@hotmail.com</a>. 
                  Please use HTML format for your poem, rather than sending it 
                  as an attachment. Attached files will be deleted without opening, 
                  due to virus issues. Winners will be announced at the event.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Haiku and Limericks will be performed at the 
                  competition, and judged there. Contestants will recite their 
                  poem, then will be given a random topic pertaining to EQ. They 
                  will have 5 minutes to compose another poem of the same type, 
                  and recite it to the audience/judges. There will be 5 judges, 
                  representatives of different Bristlebane guilds, who will judge 
                  the poems on creativity, topic, form, and impact. Judges will 
                  score between 4-20, and the total will be added together to 
                  create a composite score.</font></p>

                <blockquote><font size="-1"> Just wondering if you or the other 
                  programmers were RPG players before you went to work for EQ? 
                  I have notice the Mobs look allot the RPG pictures given in 
                  monster manuals for almost all RPGs. Is this due to those visual 
                  conceptions of those original artist or your bosses lack of 
                  creativity? Or are you just constrained to the RPG players conceptions 
                  of the mobs in their minds? Do you get to free-lance any of 
                  the graphics for mobs? The armors and such have some great details

                    ask the question and not give some long winded explaination

                  Game Designer<br>
                  3 years at Verant<br>
                  B.S. in Psychology (not computer science)<br>

                <p><font size="-1">Topics in this edition range from the Jammin 
                  Geoffrey Doll, to the portals in the Timorous Deep. Even if 
                  your not a caster or hybrid you'll find it an enjoyable and 
                  interesting read. Here's an excerpt: </font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Naming pets is a cool idea, and one that we 
                  have talked about. There are, however, several problems. We 
                  already maintain a live staff that checks names as the go in. 
                  Adding something that let our staff check pet names as they 
                  come in to the world would be using too many real world resources 
                  for such a small payoff (adding more staff simply to let players 
                  name their pets just wont happen). If a player could only pick 
                  one name, and their pet got named that every time would be more 
                  feasible - but that would mean that your fire elemental and 
                  your air elemental would both be named flamtar or some such. 
                  We would probably have to make pet names unique at that point 
                  - since we dont want two pets having the same name for player 
                  recognition reasons. </font></p>

                  I will be hosting an event for the E'ci server. The gathering 
                  will take place in <b>East Commons</b> by the <b>Ro Tunnel</b>. 
                  The time will be <b>7pm CST</b>. The purpose of this event is 
                  to encourage others to host similar events on our server since 
                  they seem to be lacking. It also allows newbies to meet other 
                  newbies and group for experience. There will be many events 
                  such as a scavenger hunt, mini-quests for prizes, drinking, 
                  a bazaar, and just a general good time away from evercamping. 
                  Buffs, heals and binds will be given freely. Be on the look 
                  out for various surprises too. Following the festivities a dungeon 
                  raid on Befallen will occur, preferrably for lvls 9 and up. 
                  We will need experienced Befallen players to help lead the raid 
                  and take leadership of the various groups. The first 30 or so 
                  players that are gathered will attempt to eradicate Befallen 
                  of its evil minions. Ports will be offered from various places 
                  throughout Norrath. It would be very nice if we could get some 
                  ports going from Kunark and allow our fellow Iksar brothers 
                  to attend. <b>I am asking the higher lvl Wizards and Druids 
                  to give free teleports to the event in order to make this successful.</b> 
                  So bring your drinks, possessions and your party hats and lets 
                  have a good time!!</font></p>

              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">Age of Hatred - Xegony</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">With the lack of Innoruuks presence on Norrath, 
                  the TeirDal quest for more of their father and creator. Away 
                  in the plane of Hate, Innoruuk battles the denizens of the light 
                  races as they breech his realm, while on Norrath those of his 
                  children who have been blessed by him seek out more of his power 
                  that has been scattered about Norrath. This brings us to the 
                  present day and what the TeirDal call the Age of Hatred.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The known fact that dark elves were created 
                  from the limbs and souls of the first Elven king and queen only 
                  fuel their hatred and drive them to seek out more of their history. 
                  Complex and intricate details lead the TeirDal to clues of 
                  a tome, the writing is said to portray them during the Elder 
                  Age in which they have little knowledge of. Rallied by the leaders 
                  of many TeirDal guilds, a small army of powerful dark elves 
                  gathers for the worldwide search of this tome. The clues known 
                  to them often point to a select group of light dwellers acting 
                  as protectors of the realms. It is written that these protectors 
                  keep the tome of Innoruuk hidden away from the searching eyes 
                  of Innoruuks children, least the dark ones find and learn what 
                  true power they may wield from what they find in the scriptures.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">A young prophet of Innoruuk, Saphyre Myrrdin 
                  has foretold of this group of protectors and their intentions 
                  to keep the searching TeirDal at bay. In the forest of Nektulos 
                  a forming army of Innoruuks children gather together in preparation 
                  to recover their history and what they see as a way to turn 
                  the tides of war.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Informants of the light races relay this news 
                  to the Protectors and in turn the plot is revealed of the forming 
                  army of TeirDal and their mercenaries. In the days that follow, 
                  the Protectors gather together and spirit away the lost tome 
                  in hopes to keep the dark ones from ever finding the power of 
                  their lineage. All across Norrath trouble begins to brew, for 
                  the seeking eyes of Innoruuks children hound the Protectors 
                  at every turn. This brings us to the present and final search 
                  of the TeirDal. The Protectors are just out of their grasp.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">OOC/</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">In this quest their will be two armies of players, 
                  any light races interested in joining will be known as the Protectors 
                  and act as the guardians of the tome. They will travel together 
                  as one large army and evade the Army of Hate until a final battle 
                  is declared on open and equal ground. Those interested in joining 
                  the Army of Hate must be pure dark elven, troll or ogre. In 
                  hopes to keep the battle fair to all, we will limit the amount 
                  of players on each side to an equal number, this will depend 
                  on the response of both the light and dark races. After the 
                  armies are set, the Protectors will begin to evade and elude 
                  the Army of Hate at all cost. At each of the first three encounters 
                  of the armies they will stop and choose a champion for each 
                  (three different champions for each battle). The champion of 
                  each army will battle unaided to the death. The winning champion 
                  of each battle will receive a backpack of loot that he or she 
                  can distribute to their army. After the third battle of champions, 
                  the two armies will take to the Arena for the final showdown. 
                  This will be a battle of honor, if you are killed during the 
                  battle you are asked to honorably sit aside until either the 
                  light or dark army has won, do not enter the arena and begin 
                  fighting again.</font></p>

                  over well and so here we are again. Being an evil roleplaying 
                  guild, roleplay events will be included among the traditional 
                  races (Nektulos), newbie quests (Nektulos) and so on, with prizes 
                  being awarded. Later on there will be an opportunity to purge 
                  the lands of carefully selected wood elves. What they carry 
                  is yours to keep. (I call this 'wood elf pinata') We also have 
                  spent much time acquiring the services of many noble and persons 
                  of good intent to fight and die in our very own gladiatorial 
                  games. Feel free to bring your own gladiator, or bet on the 
                  outcomes. The owner of the winning gladiator will receive a 
                  reward. (Entry fees undecided at this point, this is a roleplay 
                  event as much as a standard tournament) This event will be held 
                  in East Commons.</font></p>

                <p><font size="-1">Hundreds of thousands of people around the 
                  world now play the games, even though the first of them appeared 
                  just three years ago. "EverQuest" alone has more than 215,000 
                  subscribers in its one year of existence.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The games are computer-generated fantasy worlds 
                  where thousands of players can talk and adventure together in

                <p><font size="-1"> In their short existence, the games have led 
                  to the creation of friendships, the formation of close social 
                  groups that meet in real life and even a booming industry in 
                  which players take virtual equipment they have gathered in the 
                  games and sell it to other players for real money.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1"> The games have created an absorbing social 
                  realm that transcends the bland text world of Internet chat 
                  and makes older computer games played by individuals or small 
                  groups look lonely and juvenile. </font></p>

                  and a couple interviews as well! The show starts at 8pm central 
                  (9 eastern, 6 pacific) and will be held in Kelethin. In order 
                  to get to the site of the show, take the orc ramp up and make 
                  a direct left on to the first bridge. After crossing that, make 
                  a direct right across the next bridge. And on your right from 
                  that is a ramp leading upward. The show will be held there or 
                  in the building on that platform. Drinks and snacks will be 
                  provided along with free instruments to young bards in the making. 
                  There will also may be a party afterward with a variety of things

                  Milo Column</a> here on Everlore. This week Milo talks about

                  specific questions, his fascination with Jewel, insults more

                    a program out there somewhere that can generate those? It's 
                    been a while since I've seen one and was starting to think 
                    of it as a lost art form.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="-1">Second, the custom scrollbar on your site 
                    is a nice touch. Did you grab that from somewhere, or write 
                    it from scratch yourself?</font></p>
                  <p><font size="-1">Third, great work on the female wood-elf. 
                    I would like to sincerely thank you, the texture artist, and

                  and I have made some very important conclusions. I would like 
                  to call a meeting of all guilds and people of The Norrathian 
                  Senate. I would also like to invite guilds and people not affiliated 
                  with The Senate to attended. Anyone is welcome to attend and 
                  hear what we have to say. We will be discussing a common law 
                  that I would like to put into effect. And a new organization 
                  of the guilds. This will probably be the last meetings of the 
                  entire Senate if all goes well. This meeting will be held just 
                  inside the Tunnel to East Commons in Northern Ro on May 23rd 
                  at 8pm EST. If anyone needs a teleport so they can make it to 
                  the meeting please feel free to call on me and I will do my 
                  best to get you there. I look forward to seeing everyone at

                    why not. It is my intention to take the helm of our new government, 
                    to stand at the head of our proud peoples to repel the tides 
                    of the pales of Norrath, and take the fight to their very 
                    gates. And I am willing to prove my battling talents against

                    is a bag of platinum in the hands of a trusted assassin. I 
                    have allies all over the world, contacts and servants as well. 
                    I look at the human, troll and ogre citizens of Neriak, and

                    My black heart pulses with a passion for rage, rancor and 
                    revenge. Baptized in his burning gaze at birth, his favour

                    be found wanting. We are not a people of charity, pity and 
                    mercy. Nor are we given to the pleasantries of the light races. 
                    But our politics cannot be insular, lest we turn to in-fighting

                  Those that consistently go above and beyond the call of duty 
                  to help someone. Those that give with little or no thought to 
                  themselves. Those that will never have "phat lewt" or any riches

                  Perhaps your life has been touched by the actions of one that 
                  made an impact on your outlook in Norrath. Perhaps you know 
                  of someone that consistently breaks the bonds of greed and envy 
                  with quiet selflessness, or valiant truth.</font></p>

                  currently in a guild, guild leaders of good rep must be able 
                  to vouch for the hero/heroine through personal experience. Please

                  C) Guild leader's vouching for the altruistic nature of the 
                  hero/heroine</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Starting June 1st, the stories will be reviewed 
                  to choose finalists. The writers of the chosen stories will 
                  be contacted to let them know their stories are in the final 
                  round. After contacting guild leaders and getting their input,

                  of you who lay claim to the expansive Faydark wood as your homestead. 
                  For those of you that hold a place in your heart for Felwithe's 
                  marbled brilliance, or a memory of Kelethin's hardened roots. 
                  -Come hither, for herein lies a bulletin of the utmost importance 
                  to you:</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Soon, nominations will be called for regarding 
                  the taking of seats on the pronounced eleven position "Faydark 
                  Council". This council, as a whole, is to serve as a governing 
                  body of law for those registered as citizens of Kelethin and 
                  Felwithe, as well as the Greater and Lesser regions of the Faydark 
                  forest. The "Faydark Council" will consist of the two small-bodied, 
                  five seat, councils of Kelethin and Felwithe. In addition to 
                  governing within their own respective city limits, these two 
                  councils will commit to overseeing the Faydark lands as a whole, 
                  together, with the mediating efforts of a single High Chancellor. 
                  Once the seats of the two city councils have been filled by 
                  both nomination and election, the High Chancellor will be nominated 
                  from among them, as an "alternate" is seen into the then vacant 
                  city council position. This serving as a brief synopsis, let 
                  us continue with this important notice.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Presently, as a final step of preparation before 
                  nominations begin, a "Faydark Census" is taking place. Located 
                  in the "Faydark" alcove of the "Collective of Fennin Ro Discussion 
                  Hall", this census will exist for as long as it is needed, -but 
                  should be brief. The purpose of which, is to heighten awareness 
                  before our important next step, and strengthen our numbers with 
                  the intent of being able to produce the thorough voting and 
                  nomination process that Faydwer rightly deserves! -And demands 
                  of us.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">With this, we ask that you pay us a visit. 
                  You may come as a prospective nominee, a representative of your 
                  Guildhouse, or a common citizen. It matters not. What does matter, 
                  however, is your very presence. The procedure is not strenuous, 
                  and a simple nod or wave of your staff will mark you as present. 
                  Once a sufficient amount of supporters have come forth, nominations 
                  will be taken for the two Elven cities, and an election held. 
                  We urge, and beseech of you all kindly, to come forth. And better 
                  yet, encourage others to make the journey with you. -It is the 
                  fate of your land that is being decided. There has been no better

                  love to see is as many bakers there as possible! The purpose 
                  is to gather as many brownie parts as we can and distribute 
                  them out to the bakers. Brownies are not easy foes though, and 
                  we will need a lot of power in order succeed. </font>

                raise a force to invade the Nektulos Forest and retaliate for

                captain of the guard. Come join me and my comrades in our crusade. 
                If you would like to help run this, please tell me, we need good

                The online gaming world is vast and teeming with life. In this 
                world you have solo players and you have guilds of players. But 
                there is a 3rd category of group that is very very rare yet very 
                visible and active. That group is know as the OGG's (Online Gaming 
                Groups). Everquest has some like The Syndicate. Other types of 
                games do as well. OGG's are a special kind of entity going beyond 
                what a normal guild offers. How do Everquest's OGG's stack up 
                against those from other game worlds? What makes an OGG different 
                from a regular guild? What does an OGG offer to the gaming world 
                its in? Well Game Domain has released the following article discussing 
                what is an OGG, sharing the most prevalent ones and then discussing

                Something has been bothering me for a long time. It seems as though 
                our server has nothing going on, such as the now infamous "nekkid 
                gnome races" or the weekly bazaar in the commons. Well, id like 
                to change that. I would like to get together a large group of 
                level 30 somethings together and make a suicide raid on Ogokk. 
                I am thinking on Saturday, May 13 at around 10:00 PM EST or so. 
                We will gather in Feerrott beforehand and get boozed up a bit 
                and maybe do some bartering then kick some ogre arse. If you would 
                like to participate in this "Suicide Raid" send Fittun a tell 
                so I can get an approximate number. Hopefully this will be the

              <blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark 
                expands the EverQuest game world by 30 percent, adding new creatures, 
                treasures, and spells, as well as a new race to play, the Iksar, 
                a race of evil anthropomorphic lizards. The level cap for players 
                was also raised from 50 to 60. This alone would be worth the price 
                of admission to EverQuest fans, but it doesn't stop there. Verant 
                has spent a year living with EverQuest, and they have taken that 
                experience and offered a refined version of the game in the new 
                Kunark lands.&quot;</font></blockquote>

                awaited expansion pack for that massive multiplayer RPG EverQuest. 
                But in many ways it's more than just an expansion -- it's everything 
                the original EverQuest should have been. For fans of the series 
                the year long wait was almost certainly worth it, and new players 
                who may have passed EverQuest by may find it worth a second look 
                (the game and its expansion are now being sold as an affordable

              <blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;Few games maintain such an avid 
                fan following as Verant's online role-playing game EverQuest. 
                That's partly because Verant created an impressive game to begin 
                with and also because Verant has consistently appealed to its 
                many dedicated subscribers, both by adding new gameplay features 
                and also by adding entire new regions to the game's already enormous 
                world. As such, it's understandable why some of EverQuest's more 
                skeptical players felt as if the new expansion, The Ruins of Kunark, 
                was a ploy to milk its customers for more money for the same sort 
                of additions they'd already been getting as part of the package. 
                But as you explore the new continent of Kunark, it'll become increasingly 
                clear to you that the expansion's value is as immense as that 
                of the original game.&quot;</font></blockquote>
              <font size="-1">Finally, <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank">CNN</a> 
              featured The Ruins of Kunark in their Technology section. Here is 
              a section of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/05/02/everquest.idg/index.html" target="_blank">main 
              article</a> by Jay Turner: </font> 
              <blockquote><font size="-1">&quot;Ruins of Kunark adds an entire 
                continent to the already massive world of Norrath, and it introduces 
                a new player race of lizardmen, called the Iksar. The Iksar are 
                a great example of what Verant can do if given half a chance -- 
                the Iksar themselves flesh out very nicely, and their city is 
                definitely one of the most complete as far as quests and things 
                to do go. Every class of Iksar has a series of "newbie quests" 
                for lower-level characters to complete, making young life in Kunark 
                seem much less like a game of "rat hunter 3D" than almost anywhere 
                else in Norrath.&quot;</font></blockquote>
