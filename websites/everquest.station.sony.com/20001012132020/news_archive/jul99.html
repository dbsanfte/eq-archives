                        <font size="-1">Explorers and Gypsies alike will want to 
                        take note of this prospective Guild on Fennin Ro: </font> 
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Hail fellow citizens of Norrath!</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> My name is Deosyne and I play a Wood 
                           Elf Ranger on the Fennin Ro server. I would like to tell 
                           you of my idea of a guild for the hardcore travelers 
                           of Norrath and request that if you are interested in 
                           becoming one of the founding members to contact me so 
                           that we may get the process underway. :)</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Some players regard themselves as powergamers; 
                           they play to level as fast as possible and get the best 
                           loot. Some players are nesters; they choose a location 
                           and attempt to organize and enhance their home area by 
                           providing events and build a rapport with the other nesters 
                           in that area. Still others are tradesfolk; they adventure 
                           only to build up a stash of loot with which to build 
                           up their trade skills and become reknowned tradefolk.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Then there are us travelers.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> We travelers are always on the move. 
                           We level very slowly and often have poor loot because 
                           we spend more time going from place to place than hunting, 
                           not to mention the corpses that we have left behind due 
                           to going to places we really have no business going. 
                           :) The thought of exploring an entirely new zone is so 
                           much more exciting than participating in an organized 
                           raid on Crushbone or attending a trade fair in Qeynos. 
                           We are often found in areas being hunted by players 20 
                           levels above us. When given massive buffs and a SoW, 
                           we more often than not forget about taking advantage 
                           of the buffs to take out those prized yellows and reds 
                           and instead start running to somewhere new because we've 
                           got the SoW. :) There's a whole lot of Norrath out there 
                           and we want to see it all!</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Now, I know that we're in the minority 
                           of players, but I believe that there are a sizable enough 
                           number of us that we should band together into a loose 
                           "network" spanning Norrath to provide our fellow travelers 
                           with help during our travels, in the way of binds, heals, 
                           buffs, food and drink and other helpful basics as we 
                           wander. We could provide companionship for one another, 
                           especially on those long, trans-Norrath treks that we 
                           are apt to take on occasion. We could provide directions 
                           to places that we are going and ideas for new places 
                           to travel to. We could assist one another in those five 
                           zones away corpse retrievals. :)</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Now, of course, Everquest isn't just 
                           about traveling (or so I'm told :)) so we can also get 
                           together on occasion for hunting expeditions, host some 
                           events or just gather and regale one another and other 
                           Norrathians with tales of our journeys. We can support 
                           one another during those grueling periods we sometimes 
                           undergo, such as getting rubicite or, more appropriately 
                           for us, camping for Journeyman Boots. :) </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> If you're interested in joining a guild 
                           designed around us wandering folk, send me an email to 
                           <a href="mailto:deosyne@bellsouth.net">deosyne@bellsouth.net</a>. 
                           Include in your email your character(s) name(s), class(es) 
                           and race(s), your email address and the server(s) that 
                           you play on. No need to include your real name; its not 
                           necessary and none of my business. :) Also, include a 
                           quick paragraph on your most interesting trip; not necessarily 
                           your longest trip or most difficult, but the most interesting 
                           journey that you've taken thusfar. OK, its not required, 
                           but I love reading them. :) Oh, and although the guild 
                           will be based off of the Fennin Ro server, I have received 
                           interest in starting similar guilds on other servers, 
                           so I will be more than happy to start branches on servers 
                           other than Fennin Ro. :) </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Let's band together and make our journeys 
                           just that much more fun by having like-minded folks who 
                           we can share our experiences and assist one another while 
                           adventuring in Norrath. Thanks for your interest!</font>

                           be and usually <b><i>before</i></b> anything slips through 
                           the cracks, like major exploits. The bugs are also kept

                           the noble elf that started the Elven Council of Faydark, 
                           that the time for voting for members is almost upon us. 
                           We are looking to have the voting this very weekend. 
                           This brings me to another subject, threats by the Tier'Dal. 
                           </font></p>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Since the idea of this Council was first 
                           voiced, many of our wayward cousins, the Drow, have been 
                           in opposition to it. Daily, threats are made upon the 
                           members who are nominated and against the citizens of 
                           the Faydark as a whole. I have this to say to my cousins, 
                           such as Drakkyn K'Dymm, Ghenocide, and the sort: "Many 
                           have spoken your exact same words and they have proven 
                           to be hollow. Are yours any different? The Tier'Dal make 
                           their threats upon this Council time and time again, 
                           yet no real show of force has been seen. And do you truly 
                           think we should fear such an attack? The Tier'Dal couldn't 
                           even take the city of Qeynos... what chance do you think 
                           you have, so far from your homelands and in the heart 
                           of the elves? I would say little to none." Recognize, 
                           this is my opinion.</font>

                           end. Falling from the city will result in disqualification, 
                           and spells like Levitate are not permitted (although 
                           SoW is encouraged). Players may also take any shortcuts 
                           in the race if they wish to jump from bridges to other 
                           platforms, they're welcome to attempt it. The first race 
                           will be only for rangers, paladins, warriors, and rogues; 
                           the prize will be the winner's choice of any of my handcrafted 
                           bows, including Darkwood or a Trueshot Longbow. If there 
                           is enough interest for a second race, others will be

                           learning for me as I roamed about. I began speaking with 
                           a few of my fellow Tier'Dal when one of them spoke of 
                           an Elven Council. At first I dismissed the idea, just 
                           another political scheme of our cousins, the Fier'Dal. 
                           But, the more I thought about it, the more my blood began 
                           to boil. How dare they call it an Elven Council but not 
                           have the rightful rulers of Norrath upon it? And I learned 
                           that this "Council" is also planning on making a Faydark 
                           Guard, a guild responsible for the safe travels of the 
                           lands in the Faydark... a group of warriors that could 
                           deal with the orcs, the bandits, and the Tier'Dal if 
                           need be. I could not believe their arrogance in thinking 
                           they could create such an army that could deal with the 
                           greatest warriors of all the lands! Such actions cannot 
                           be tolerated.</font>

                           Council. But none seemed to know. It seems those bringing 
                           this Council together are keeping such things a secret 
                           in fear of retaliation. And they are wise to do so. I 
                           think it is time the Tier'Dal postpone our assaults upon 
                           the humans and barbarians and focus on our age old enemies, 
                           the Half, High, and Wood Elves. We need to teach these 
                           lesser elves who the true rulers of the lands are. What

                        am attempting to rectify this problem by uniting all the 
                        Australian players so that we can decide how to deal with 
                        this. This is why I have set up <a href="http://www.uq.net.au/%7Ezzgcoope/" target="_blank">EverQuest

                        to announce events that will take place when Australians

                        <p><font size="-1"> We anxiously await the day that the 
                           Great Ban is lifted, {ooc: the Race War server opens} 
                           and we are able to raise our might against the children 
                           of the false gods and deliver the world to Our Father. 
                           The Will of Innoruuk can only be accomplished by true 
                           Unity of all of His Children. </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Hear Our Father Innoruuk’s Own Words, 
                           recorded in the Second of the Three Commandments of Obedience:</font> 
                        <p> <font size="-1">"Teir’Dal shall not raise word, hand, 
                           or sword against Teir’Dal. All are Sisters and Brothers 
                           in the Will of the Father. Those that turn away from 
                           the Will, however, shall be considered Spurned, and shall 
                           be treated as are the Hated Others.."</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> The time has come to heed His Commandments!</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> The Church has deemed that in accordance 
                           with His Will, we shall give our blessing to a single 
                           order, and support that order’s purpose to unify all 
                           Teir’Dal under one banner. That great order, chosen by 
                           Innoruuk Himself, is the Ebon Army. The Army is not merely 
                           a guild or an order, it IS the Teir’Dal nation. The Army 
                           walks fully in the Will of Innoruuk, and His Eye is upon 
                           it.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Many will consider founding their own 
                           separate guilds, but I ask you, why would one do such 
                           a thing? There are only two answers; either to strengthen 
                           the Teir’Dal nation and insure the destruction of Our 
                           enemies, or simply for personal power and prestige. Be 
                           assured that dividing Our people will not strengthen 
                           us, and indeed will insure our eventual downfall. Also, 
                           by joining the Ebon Army, you will be part of the greatest 
                           force ever seen. What could be more prestigious than 
                           that? You may choose to lead a handful, or join the Army 
                           and advance to command hundreds. Ignore the rantings 
                           of your ego and join your Brothers and Sisters in True 
                           Unity!</font>

                           to place all other concerns aside and join the glorious 
                           ranks of the Ebon Army. Let the humans and other daydwellers 
                           insure their defeat by dividing themselves into petty 
                           factions. The Teir’Dal shall be united! We are One, and 
                           the world shall be Ours!</font>

                        <p><font size="-1"> Hail Elves of Norrath! For a few short 
                           weeks now, discussion has been ongoing concerning the 
                           formation of a council to deal with issues of the elves 
                           in Faydark. Unfortunately, it has been hard to keep up 
                           with who has been nominated, what this council will do, 
                           and other aspects of this council since it was only spoken 
                           of across various forums. Well, I began the task of making 
                           a site upon the silken web to deal with this problem 
                           and the result was the Elven Council of Faydark website. 
                           Upon here, you can read what news transpires with the 
                           Council, learn more about the Council members, participate 
                           in the Public Forum concerning issues that affect the 
                           elves of Faydark, and even cast your vote! </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> This Council was formed to help govern 
                           the lands of the Elves upon the continent of Faydwer. 
                           The Council will concern itself with issues such as planning 
                           for war efforts (race wars), the senseless murders occuring 
                           around the Faydark (murderer policy), political position 
                           with other races, local events, and any other upcoming 
                           situations. The Council will consist of 9 members to 
                           begin with: 3 Half Elves, 3 High Elves, and 3 Wood Elves.</font>

                        <font size="-1">Here is an event for the Tunare server residents

                        </font> 
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Event: Tunare Lottery!!<br>
                        When: July 20th, 2:00 CT<br>
                        Where: Freeport Arena<br>
                        Why: Because there aren't any events on the Tunare server, 
                        I have decided to do a lottery and let some lucky winner 
                        hit it big! The more people that come means the more money 
                        you can win, and you don't have to pay more!!<br>
                        Cost:Only 5 gold!!!<br>
                        Pot:80% of all profits (If 200 people come, 200*5 = 1000, 
                        80% of that is 800 gold, or 80 plat! And thats just with 
                        200 people!)<br>
                        Other Remarks: You do NOT have to be presant to win, you 
                        just have to have givin me the 5 gold and made sure I wrote 
                        it down on record and gave you your lucky lotto number (be 
                        SURE to hold on to it) before July 20th, 2:00 CT. I will 
                        hold the winners prize for 2 real life days (48 hours), 
                        and if it is not claimed (IE: I cannot get ahold of you) 
                        it will go to the 2 winner. Also if you plan to be presant 
                        bring any/all wares you wish to be sold or come trying to 
                        buy something, i'm hoping to spark the population of Tunare 
                        into throwing an all out fest, with a big prize for coming! 
                        There will be a few gift prizes, and hopefully stories and 
                        more! So come on down, and even if you dont have anything 
                        to sell - or want anything to buy - or don't want to participate 
                        in the lottery you can still win just for being present!!! 
                        To reach me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:Amberwiz@mindspring.com">Amberwiz@mindspring.com</a> 
                        or you can /t me in the game as Trintigal, Llewe, Jarl,

                           gorget, and maybe even a bloodforge hammer (we'll see). 
                           Names will be drawn from a pool of people that the item 
                           could be useful to (warriors will not be included in

                           an option available if it is wanted. No official prize 
                           has been decided, but it will probably be quite the large

                        merchants to reach a much broader group of potential clients. 
                        The system uses software similar to Ebay, therefore, you 
                        get email updates of your bids, and how your items are doing. 
                        The dollar signs have been replaced by the currency of platinum, 
                        thus, items for sale are for in game currency only.</font>

                           groups to be pretty balanced. Revenge is a good motivation 
                           but the prospect of great loot and exp is a better one.

                           The Festival of Change celebrates a change in the land 
                           of Norrath. The change being celebrated is the arrival 
                           of an official player market. The Festival of Change 
                           will spread the word of the arrival of the Trade Council. 
                           The word is that Trade Council will sell any merchandise 
                           that is requested, provided it is reasonable for us to 
                           obtain it (items such as Green Splint Platemail are pretty 
                           much out of the question for the time being). Other specialties 
                           of the guild are mastery in all trade skills, excellence 
                           in all languages, knowledgable guides for hire, and item 
                           deliveries. Come to the Festival of Change and celebrate
