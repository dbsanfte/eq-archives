                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Huddled in his cloak, damp, Byrch 
                        awaited the others. Invisible against the wall of the canyon, 
                        he inspected his weapons once more. The axe. The tomahawk. 
                        The spear. The dagger. And his newly crafted bow, smooth 
                        ashwood and taut silk.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> A dark elf, his blue skin concealed 
                           beneath his heavy armor and enveloping clothes, crept 
                           by, looking about cautiously. A cleric, one of Terrak's 
                           tools. Not part of Tunare's intent, for her fire was 
                           not yet present.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Aranic arrived first, followed by Kazied, 
                           in guise as one of the Teir'Dal, Xiao, and Aenen. Grim 
                           faces all around. Byrch stepped from his concealment, 
                           his hands clenching with anticipation. The Mother of 
                           All watched close, her presence about the small band, 
                           overwhelming.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"I will go ahead, to see that the way 
                           is clear of the Dragoons of Neriak."</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> He vanished once more, the Mother's 
                           power covering him, and slipped into the Nektulos Forest.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> One of Neriak's guardians had, in fact, 
                           made his way to the borders of his land, but finding 
                           nothing but the cold wind rustling fallen leaves, he 
                           left once more. Nervous, though; something heavy hung 
                           in the air this night.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Terrak's nose, preternaturally sensitive, 
                           caught scent of elves in his private domain, for he shouted 
                           his insane threats, challenges, and hatred. The others 
                           had followed into the forest, and Byrch moved back, waiting 
                           for Tunare's hand to give him leave to strike.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The Huntsman, stepping out of shadows 
                           and darkness. Striking. Aranic fell, too quickly, his 
                           blows useless against Terrak's evil. Kazied fell, and 
                           Byrch began to simmer... (Mother, give me leave to act, 
                           and end this thing!) Aenen was treacherously ambushed 
                           by one of Terrak's Teir'Dal henchmen, the sneering countenance 
                           of the Dark Elf showing what he, and his race, thought 
                           of this Feir'Dal and his pretensions of lordship.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> And then the blue fire. And then the 
                           Hand was upon him.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Darkness.<br>
                           Something cold.<br>
                           A hand.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"Byrch? He lives, though I know not 
                           how."</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Aranic.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Byrch opened his eyes. The Commonlands. 
                           "The others?"</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"Kazied escaped somehow, through some 
                           magic. My wounds were not fatal, and we monks harness 
                           our body's healing abilities. Aenen is here, but dying 
                           slowly of some magical disease. But -- how is it with 
                           you?"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Byrch raised himself on one hand, shook 
                           his head. "There was the Fire, and She was with me... 
                           I know no more. Does... does the huntsman live?"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Aranic began to speak, when from the 
                           north, a cry of pain -- and death. Xiao.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Cold fury swept the ranger, and all 
                           his limbs and body shook. (MOTHER!)</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"No. Not this. This cannot be." Staggering 
                           unsteadily to his feet, Byrch was as a man struck by 
                           lightning. Aranic called after him, but Byrch was insensible.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"No! Mother! You promised victory!" 
                           He was shouting now, screaming from the hillside, his 
                           axe and spear fallen at his feet.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> A young monk raced by, terror in his 
                           eyes, for he knew what had passed within the forest, 
                           and knew his love's fate.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Byrch stood, blankly, a cipher, numb 
                           to the rain, to the world, as Terrak leaped once more 
                           from the darkness and felled Chungtao. A dark, horned 
                           shape loomed over the Huntsman.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Eyes blurred with hot tears, Byrch shrieked 
                           to the heavens. "MOTHER! You BETRAYED me! You LET THEM 
                           DIE!"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Casting off his armor now, throwing 
                           aside his bow, not hearng the string snap.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"You denied me your power when I needed 
                           it! You ABANDONED us to the lord of HATE!"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Clutching his head now.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"Mother! I RENOUNCE YOU!"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> A stab of pain, terrible, through his 
                           temple, and Byrch felt the power leave him. All of the 
                           power. Her gifts were gone. He was a Ranger Knight no 
                           more.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"To HELL with Tunare! To HELL with Innoruuk,

                        are designed for characters over level 35, unless you are 
                        of a special class needed for the event, then that class 
                        will be permitted in the main assault force, but must join 
                        only at their own risk with the knowledge that they may 
                        very well die, and the assault cannot be stopped so people 
                        can get their corpses back before we fight on (and let enemy 
                        reinforcements arrive).</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Each assault is planned by Eldrad Stormrider, 
                           self appointed General of Tunare, on the hemisphere of 
                           Tarew Marr. The object of these assaults is not to find 
                           any special loot, or gain a lot of experience. It's for 
                           the sheer fun of it, and just to be able to say you did 
                           something not too many others have done, in addition 
                           to checking out new areas that may be too dangerous to 
                           go alone or with just one group. </font>

                           of a great upsurge of strength. It will take offerings 
                           from the land, it will take many, many questers all set

                           many will be given knowledge and priests will appear 
                           to guide us on the true path. In the meantime, we try 
                           to best the evil with force of magic and brawn. May the

                        Marr server appears to be a success (sort of): </font> 
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">No, we did not acheive all of our 
                        goals, however we did penetrate Neirak, and fight our way 
                        deep inside. The Arena proved way too fortified for us to 
                        enter and live (Imaging steping into a room with 20 sand 
                        giants waiting for you :) The fact that so many came, and 
                        got inside, and had FUN is what made it a success :)</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> It all started in East Commons. I heard 
                           from a lot of people saying they'd come, but when the 
                           time to march on came, our army was only FIVE strong! 
                           I was all but ready to call the assault off, when we 
                           decided to enter Nektulos and play with the Dragoons 
                           a while for a little xp, since we all came anyway.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> We were greeted with some rude remarks 
                           from Lanys T'Vyl, the Daugher of Innoruuk! We headed 
                           for the bridge, only to find an army of dark elves, trolls 
                           and ogres blocking our way, with Lanys cheering them 
                           on like it was a pep rally. We got sick of her attitude, 
                           and attacked her.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Then, suddenly, Tunare herself appeared 
                           in all her glory! The pathetic army of evil sprang to 
                           action instantly and attacked her, doing no damage at 
                           all. She yawned, killed a few, then gave a quest. The 
                           quest however, was totally missed due to the sheer number 
                           of people yelling, fighting, etc. No one knows what we 
                           were to do for her, and she left us :( The fact that 
                           she did come, however, made it all worthwhile!</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The dark elves thought they killed her.. 
                           They inflated their egos and while they stood at the 
                           bridge bragging, the army of light stormed Neirak when 
                           they weren't ready at all!</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> We got in, only to be pushed back by 
                           the super (gm driven) guards inside! When the crowd caught 
                           up the trolls and ogres blocked the entrances, people 
                           were stuck inside or outside and eventually those inside 
                           were victorious! With the guards slain, we moved in deeper, 
                           climbing up and over the walls instead of using the doorway 
                           the "smart" trolls and ogres blocked thinking they'd 
                           keep us out!</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Those that got past the wall stayed 
                           inside for a while, killing more guards and merchants, 
                           until we came to the Troll and Ogre arena, where we were, 
                           unfortunately, stoped. Those that went in, died, luckily, 
                           quickly and painlessly :) Me, being the General and all, 
                           stayed back like Generals do and gave some orders :)</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> All in all, it was a very fun event. 
                           Thanks especially to the guides and gms for helping out, 
                           when all I really wanted to origianlly do was get some 
                           groups together and kill a few inside guards for a while 
                           :) This should also go to show that fighting within cities 
                           is NOT impossible. If you hate having to camp at higher 
                           levels, there's no better place to get good experience 
                           and loot than the cities of your enemies :)</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> I'll be planning a new assault every 
                           weekend thanks to the success of this one. Next weekend 
                           (Sunday 10/3) we'll be assaulting Kedge Keep, and the 
                           weekend after that, the Heretics in Toxulia Forest will 
                           fall under the might of the Soldiers of Tunare!!!</font>

                        stories in the ever evolving story that is The Heartstone 
                        saga. The First finds the Lord Merle and his Lady-Wife Eneria

                        members of the dark houses to be impossible: the infiltration 
                        of Neriak by Lamas and his report on the Unholy Ritual that 
                        was performed.</font>

                           a deity-influenced dream. Many days later, I was sitting 
                           outside an Inn in the Common lands when I noticed the 
                           hilt of my father’s sword was somewhat coming unscrewed. 
                           I took it off and found a rolled up letter. I read it 
                           and was shocked by the contents…</font>
                        <p> 
                        <i><font size="-1">To my dearest son, Drakain,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are reading this then we are probably 
                        gone. We knew a time would come when the evil one would 
                        find us, we only hope that you and your sister will be all 
                        right.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your father and I have decided that you 
                        should know the truth about who your parents really were.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Empress Alanisa Rebecca El’Aaron. 
                        I was once the Empress of the Island Elven Nation of Val’Halak. 
                        I was married to the Emperor Kailen when I was 16 and I 
                        loved him very much. One year after we were married, Kailen 
                        was murdered in the night by a person that left no trace 
                        of their passing. I was alone for a while but then one day 
                        I met a human smith named Glen, your father. We soon fell 
                        in love... true love. I knew that having a human as a mate 
                        was looked down upon so we left. Not long after out departure, 
                        we got word that Val’Halak was destroyed by an evil army 
                        under the control of The Prince of Hate, Innoruuk. We knew 
                        that it was our fault but there was nothing we could do, 
                        so we kept running. We soon settled in a small village outside 
                        of Freeport. I knew I was pregnant with you the whole time 
                        we were in flight so the home was very welcome. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know as we write this letter, the evil 
                        one is looking for us, and it won’t be long until he finds 
                        us. We are no longer afraid nor should you be. Please Drakain, 
                        take of Celes and keep her from the hand of Innoruuk. Remember 
                        that we love you and we always will… make us proud Drakain.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more thing. You have another 
                        sister Drakain, a half sister. She is an elf woman named 
                        Alanisa, after me. I gave her to my trusted aids after Kailen 
                        was killed to protect her. I do not know her location but 
                        you must find her. The evil is after her too. The evil is 
                        after all of you. He is scared of you Drakain. That is why 
                        he wants to kill you now. You will become very powerful 
                        one day. Fight till the end Drakain…</font></i>

                        <p> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried then. I told 
                           no one of the letter either. I had to know the truth, 
                           so I set off for the lost Isle of Val’Halak. </font>

                        <p> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got there, 
                           there was nothing left but the foundation a great castle. 
                           I had the proof I needed. I am the son of an Empress, 
                           a prince in a sense. But I do not think of myself as 
                           one. I am still a holy warrior of Marr and a member of 
                           the Holy Order. I then told Lord Finncanon everything. 
                           And when I returned to Freeport, I found that the guards 
                           knew me by my face and I was to be killed on site. Another 
                           one of Innoruuk’s evil deeds. I knew I was no longer 
                           safe in Antonica, so I left for Faydwer to find Alanisa.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reaching Faydwer, I was overwhelmed 
                           by the forests that covered the land. As soon as I stepped 
                           in to Lesser Faydark, I became disorientated. The sheer 
                           size of the Butcherblok Mountains awed me. It was a relief 
                           to find that the guards here didn’t know me and I could 
                           walk in the towns unmolested. Finding Kelethin wasn’t 
                           a problem; it was finding places in Kelethin. After asking 
                           around for a few days, I got word that Alanisa was a 
                           member of a secret Ranger guild named Nalk’Un Roath, 
                           witch I later found out means Noble Rangers in old Val’Halak 
                           tongue. It wasn’t long before I was granted entry to 
                           the Guild’s Headquarters. There I met Lady Alanisa El’Aaron, 
                           guild master of Nalk’Un Roath. We looked into each other’s 
                           eyes and we both saw our mother. She embraced me and 
                           cried.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was so worried about you.” She whispered.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn’t say a word. I just stood 
                           there. It had been so long since I felt the love of a 
                           family member. Sure there is love in the Holy Order, 
                           even a family love in the guild, but nothing that compares 
                           to the love of your true family.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come, there is much to talk about.”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent the rest of the day and into 
                           the night talking about our lives and our family. I told 
                           her of my father Glen, and she told me of her foster 
                           parents.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I envy you Drakain,” she said, “Your 
                           father was a good man.” “I never knew my father.”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alanisa…?”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, enough of this talk… we have much 
                           to prepare for. Innoruuk knows where we are and he will 
                           be here soon. Don’t be afraid. This will protect you.”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me a golden chain with a crested 
                           shield on it.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is our Family Crest. I was given 
                           this from my foster mother, now I give it to you.”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I can’t take this.” I said<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Please Drak, take it. I will do me 
                           no good. My time in this world is almost up…” she trailed 
                           off.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say that!”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come, we must rest. You will need 
                           all your strength tomorrow.”<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drove the fear into me even deeper. 
                           I had another Dream that night.</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Innoruuk 
                           was there from the beginning. He said nothing but just 
                           looked at me and grinned. I couldn’t move for some reason. 
                           Then Alanisa was there and He took her by the neck and 
                           I heard a terrible scream of true pain and terror. That 
                           is when I awoke…</font>

                           </center>
                           <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day was a 
                           day I will never forget. I ate with Alanisa in silence 
                           and then we left for Greater Faydark. In the middle of 
                           the forest was when I got the chill that I had dreaded 
                           since the first dream. Innoruuk was there. Waiting for 
                           us, toying with us. Alanisa then began to chat and I 
                           was surrounded by a blue aura. She then seemed like she 
                           was talking to someone, telepathically. That’s when the 
                           dark one came. He stood there in his hunched form watching 
                           her. But the weird thing was he couldn’t see me. I watched 
                           in terror as he reached out and grabbed her by the neck. 
                           Even though I couldn’t hear anything, I knew what he 
                           was doing. He was talking through Alanisa to whomever 
                           it was she was talking to. Then it was all over. Innoruuk 
                           was gone and Alanisa lay there on the leaves, still as 
                           death. As soon as her spell wore off, I ran to her and 
                           held her. I do not know how long I was there. I was lost 
                           again, nothing, no one. That is when I somehow got in 
                           contact with Lord Finncanon. He told me to be strong 
                           and not to greave. I will always have a home with the 
                           Holy Order. That is when I Finally cried. I had lost 
                           everything. <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My entire family was dead. Innoruuk 
                           had taken my entire life from me. But it had made me 
                           stronger. I have true friends now. Unbreakable bonds 
                           with my fellow guild mates. I had to leave Faydwer though. 
                           I met up with a Erudin and a dwarf paladin and we were 
                           gated to Odus. The dwarf and I then caught the ship to 
                           Qeynos and I was on my way back to my home. For some 
                           reason, Innoruuk wants me dead. Why? I do not know. But 
                           I will find out. I will someday battle the Prince of 
                           Hate and win. I do not care what anyone says. I will 
                           win!</font>

                           will stop me. No one will hold me back. May the Prince

                           will NOT be attacking mermaids. They are indifferent 
                           to pretty much everyone, and very tough. Better to leave

                           have tried before, and have a lot of fun! There are a 
                           few nice items in Kedge (serated bone dirk, I hear) but 
                           for the most part the zone is unitemized. We'll mostly 
                           be killing sharks and pirannas, until we come to the 
                           Seahorse area.. I don't know what's past there besides 
                           Phinegil. I'm pretty sure Phinegil is a level 50 caster 
                           of some sort, so he will be tough! </font>

                           doesn't have any magic power like the legendary sword 
                           <i>Ghoulsbane</i>, or the impossible <i>Soulfire</i>, 
                           but it is to remind you that men have power too. This 
                           sword was made by a man for a man. Wield it well. And 
                           when you feel down and feel like the world is more powerful 
                           than you, remember that this sword was made by flesh 
                           and blood, not magic. Just... make me proud, my son..."<br>
                           <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the last words my father 
                           spoke to me… <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night an Orc raiding party 
                           swept my village, killing everyone. My elf mother, Rebecca, 
                           my human father, Glen, and my half elf sister, along 
                           with all my friends and their families. I do not know 
                           how I survived. I was knocked unconscious early in the 
                           battle. When I woke up... the orcs had gone and all I 
                           had left was my father's sword. I wanted to cry but somehow, 
                           I couldn't. I spent the next few days burring the villagers. 
                           On the third day the Freeport Militia came to investigate 
                           the rumors. I hid. That's when I saw Sir Lucan for the 
                           first time. I could sense the evil in him. He said, <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This village should be condemned. 
                           There was no raid. It must have been… the plague." <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he laughed the most wicked 
                           laugh I had ever heard. I knew from that point on I must 
                           fight against him. That's when I left the village forever. 
                           I went to the mountains separating the commons from the 
                           desert and I thought. I watched the sunrise... I watched 
                           the sunset. Then it came to me. I will become a Paladin! 
                           I will fight for truth, justice, and love. I will fight 
                           the evil of the world in hopes that what happened to 
                           me will not happen to others. <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I WILL BECOME A PALADIN," I shouted 
                           across the land. </font>

                        <p> <font size="-1">Chapter 1</font> 
                        <p> <font size="-1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I walked into 
                           Freeport, I had to keep from taking my anger out on the 
                           Militia. Every Helm I saw I wanted to bash in with my 
                           father’s sword. I finally found the paladin guild house 
                           and they made me a squire. I spent the next five weeks 
                           training and working on my fighting skills. I found that 
                           killing the orc pawns was good for my aggression. It 
                           wasn’t long before I got the Tokens of Generosity and 
                           Bravery and the Token of Truth was soon mine. That is 
                           when I became a Knight of Truth and defender of the Temple 
                           of Marr. <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met many people in the area, and 
                           we have all become friends. I couldn’t believe that there 
                           we so many who had similar situations to mine. Those 
                           of us who were about the same skill level soon made unbreakable 
                           bonds that will last forever. <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day while killing skeletons near 
                           some ruins, I met a dwarf named Denithor. I started talking 
                           to him and he told me that I should seek out his guild 
                           master Lord Finncanon MacLaig. He was the leader of the 
                           Holy Order of Virtue and since I was a paladin, I could 
                           find a family with this group of paladins and clerics. 
                           I met up with Lord Finncanon and his lovely fiancée, 
                           Lady Katalina. They taught me much of the world that 
                           I didn’t know and soon I was a full member of the Holy 
                           Order. That is when I had the dream. </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was running from 
                           something unknown. I knew it was pointless to run because 
                           this entity was everywhere at once. I stopped and turned 
                           to see nothing. Then a raspy voice spoke to me in a way 
                           that sent the coldest chill down my spine. </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Greeting Drakain. 
                           I have been watching you.” </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first 
                           time I felt true fear. <br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thou art a bastard son Drakain. Thy 
                           impure birth was the reason for thy parents’ death. Tis 
                           your fault Drakain… Remember that.” </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when he laughed 
                           and then was gone. Then the hilt of my father’s sword 
                           started to glow and that is when I woke up drenched in 
                           sweat. I never told anyone of the dreams. I do know who 
                           it was though. Only Gods can enter dreams. It was Innoruuk, 
                           Prince of Hate.</font>

                           of strength and might. Participants will be pitted in 
                           a series of one-on-one fights (duels) to the death, or 
                           the yield. If a fight is lost, the loser is removed from 
                           the competition, the victor goes on to fight the next 
                           opponent and so forth. Opponents will fight in "brackets" 
                           just as they would in a karate tournament. IE: there 
                           are 4 people, call them A, B, C, and D. A and B fight, 
                           then B and C fight. A wins his fight and D wins his, 
                           so now A and D duel to determine the winner. There will 
                           be 3 "classes" based on level. Light: levels 9-11, Mid: 
                           levels 12-14, Heavy: levels 15-17, and Super Heavy: levels 
                           18-20. Prizes will be given to the champion (Only competitor

                           Bloodforge Hammer; Medium: Dwarven Ringmail Tunic; Heavy: 
                           Grobb Cleaver Axe; Super Heavy: Lrg Bronzed Helm, and

                        When: October 2 <br>
                        Where: Mar Vista Park, 11430 Woodbine Avenue, Los Angeles, 
                        90066 <br>

                        <p><font size="-1"> Okay, the decision has been made, and 
                           money has been spent. Since our group was almost twice 
                           the size that Veteran's Memorial Park can legally handle, 
                           we had to change the park to Mar Vista Park. The address 
                           is 11430 Woodbine Avenue, Los Angeles, 90066. This park 
                           is still a reasonable distance from the airport, so not 
                           to worry. For a map, go to <a href="http://www.csunbooks.com/eq" target="_blank">www.csunbooks.com/eq</a>. 
                           The site has a large grassy area that will be available 
                           for our use by 1PM, a playground, basketball courts, 
                           tennis courts, and a huge picnic area for our general 
                           revelry. </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The date and time still stand at Saturday,

                        available, and will have artwork front and back commemorative 
                        of this event. They will cost $10 each. If you are interested

                     recap of his Belmass Festival on the Prexus server: </font>

                        <p><font size="-1"> The dust has settled and the discarded 
                           ale jugs cleared away, and as I sit here in Freeport 
                           gathering my thoughts regarding the Belmass festival 
                           that my family, the Moon Clans, hosted on Sunday the 
                           19th, I can only think good thoughts.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The day started smoothly enough, with 
                           the Belmass Overseer Arbor Arjentia running around like 
                           a desert madman taking care of last minute details. People 
                           started gathering early in the tunnel, and the shouts 
                           of those wondering where the festival was to be held 
                           and what time it began echoed off the cool walls of the 
                           cavern. The nameless swashbuckler in the tunnel was still 
                           very nervous about the whole affair, but he fell silent 
                           at the prospect of making a lot of coin with the numerous 
                           citizens that were sure to attend. If only we knew what 
                           number that would grow to beforehand *sly smile*.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Once the 6th hour rang, the festival 
                           began. I gave a short speech to the assembled (at this 
                           point closing in on the 150 mark), and we started off 
                           Belmass by a concert by the VERY talented Bards Clef 
                           and his partner Sayeni. They had a HUGE audience sitting 
                           before them in the caverns, and I'm frankly surprised 
                           that they could stay focused on their beautiful music 
                           with all the shouting, dancing, and revelry going on 
                           around them. The Prexus citizens were hungry for a celebration...that 
                           much was certain.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The races and duels started soon after 
                           the performance began, with the duels being held in the 
                           Freeport arena and the races formed at the tunnel entrance 
                           outside. We also had wandering members giving out refreshments, 
                           a linguist giving free language training, and a fortune 
                           teller providing mystical services to the curious, as 
                           well as the Moon Clans Master Blacksmith Gadian at the 
                           forge in Freeport hard at work making items for those 
                           who were interested.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> I began to sense trouble when the numbers 
                           in the East Commonlands grew to over 220, and my anxiety 
                           was proven true when suddenly the entire world went dark. 
                           It was as if a deep sleep was forced over all those in 
                           attendance....likely the work of the prankster Bristlebane. 
                           (ooc: Certain zones, including EC, crashed...probably 
                           due to the numbers involved...). Only a short time passed...no 
                           more than 20 minutes or so, before the veil of sleep 
                           was lifted and we all began to rise to our feet. We wanted 
                           to get things rolling as quickly as possible after the 
                           delay, so we hurriedly reformed the races and duels and 
                           made plans for the Belmass Beauty Pageant to begin in 
                           the cavern.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Soon after a majority of the events 
                           had ended and most of the action had moved to the tunnel 
                           entrance, we were blessed by the arrival of at least 
                           four members of the Order of Prexus (ooc: GM's). They 
                           stayed for some time...conversing with the citizens and 
                           watching the festivities around them. I'd like to personally 
                           thank all of them for stopping by and adding to our event.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> (ooc: We next began our guild-sponsored 
                           quest) Belmass was not free from danger, nor were the 
                           leaders of the Moon Clans as we soon found out. The entire 
                           Lord Assembly was taken hostage, almost simultaneously, 
                           and groups were formed from those present at the festival 
                           to help find and free the captives before it was too 
                           late. I personally was taken deep within the dungeon 
                           of Befallen, while my other leaders were held in areas 
                           around Freeport including the West Commonlands and the 
                           Northern Ro desert. The rescue teams searched far and 
                           wide for clues to the kidnapping, some traveling as far 
                           as Rivervale and the Nektulos Forest for information. 
                           Luckily, the teams persevered, and all members of the 
                           Lord Assembly were rescued intact. The Moon Clans are 
                           investigating the reasons behind the attack and will 
                           hopefully discover those who gave the orders soon.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> I was taken away by the goddess Erollisi 
                           to the OtherWorld shortly after my rescue (ooc: ISP problems), 
                           and so could not be present for the remainder of Belmass. 
                           I would like to send my heartfelt thanks and gratitude 
                           for all those who took part in the quest...you showed 
                           great patience and understanding and you all should be 
                           commended.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Although we had our rough spots, as 
                           any event of this scope is bound to have, I feel that 
                           everyone that took part came through with flying colors 
                           and it was a great success. This was the first time that 
                           my guild had attempted to run anything like this, and 
                           it was certainly a learning experience. Trust that we 
                           will take the mistakes of this festival and learn from 
                           them, which will only serve to improve future events 
                           that we plan to sponsor. Personal thanks go to those 
                           in the Moon Clans who helped with the design and running 
                           of the event: Arbor, Took, Tahoe, Torunt, Dorthur, Malicio, 
                           Smomb, Tendaila, Gadian, Moonriser, Nnore, Tharki, Sythanas, 
                           Ozure, Holden, and Cambron. Also, to those allies that 
                           helped us: Adunaphel, Elderan, Clef, Sayeni, and Oculus. 
                           I know there are plenty of names that I am forgetting 
                           (including our linguist, our fortune teller, and others), 
                           and I do apologize for that. When you have close to 250 
                           adventurers in one place, it's hard to keep tabs on everyone 
                           *smile*. But your help *was* noticed and very much appreciated. 
                           We couldn't have done it without all of your support. 
                           Thank you all for helping make Belmass come to life!</font>

                     was scheduled for last weekend, has been rescheduled to this 
                     weekend: </font>

                        I had a sudden RL thing I couldn't get away from :( I dunno 
                        if anyone tried to go into Neirak, but with the Vox attempt 
                        I doubt there were many big folks around anyway.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> But, this weekend I'd like to try and 
                           get the assault going. Sticking to the old plan, if we 
                           can get at least 3 full groups of 35 - 50's we'll try 
                           to march on to the foreign quarter, and help the dark 
                           elves get rid of those smelly trolls and ogres. Goal 
                           is to take over the arena. When the arena is cleared, 
                           if we can keep it that way, we'll be able to use it to 
                           spar with some of the dark elves there that will want 
                           to defend their home :)</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> We will meet at 8 PM EST in East Commons 
                           by the Nektulos zone. There we will get organized, form 
                           groups, wait for late people, etc. Groups for the assault 
                           force will be formed of people levels 35 to 50, best 
                           combo would be 3 fighter types, 3 caster types, with 
                           at least 2 people able to heal in some way also (paladins, 
                           druids, etc).</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> At 9 PM we will march on to Neirak. 
                           We'll kill any outside guards along the way, and once 
                           inside, after clearing the main gate, we will head for 
                           the Arena in the foreign quarter. The main goal of this 
                           raid is to take and hold the arena.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Those under level 35 are welcome to 
                           come, but you must do so at your own risk. You will most 
                           likely die in there if you aren't careful, and if you 
                           do die we won't be able to stop our attack just so you 
                           can get to your corpse. If you're very low level, beware 
                           of NPCs casting area spells, and also come naked so if 
                           you do die you won't lose anything but a little xp.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> This isn't a raid to get loot. This 
                           isn't a raid to get experience. This is a raid to just 
                           have fun! I know a lot of evil types want to defend their 
                           home, and I think that's great, but I ask you use common 
                           sense and don't exploit flaws in the game (ie training 
                           guards on us while we meditate, etc) to do so, this will 
                           only result in /petitions and /reports against you that 
                           could get you in lotsa trouble. Please be creative :) 
                           I'm sure there will be a few of us in the attack force 
                           that might accept a duel too, and since we'll be clearing 
                           the arena, you can defend your home there.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> If we don't get enough people, we can 
                           still hunt inside Neirak. It's a great spot for high 
                           30's - low 40's xp and decent loot. So, hopefully we 
                           can get a full assault going, if not we can still kill 
                           a few smurfs and have fun :) </font>

                        Godfrey, quoted in Wired Online), as many players spend 
                        as much of their free time as possible playing the game. 
                        Since the adventure of the game is completely dependent 
                        upon the interaction between the players, EverQuest has 
                        put to rest the commonly held assumption that computer gaming 
                        is a solitary activity. So what will happen when these online 
                        aficionados get together in flesh and blood for a day of 
                        merriment in the real world? We will soon find out. </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The event began as a casual post by 
                           player Kevin Scott on an Internet site devoted to the 
                           game, inviting fellow players in the Los Angeles area 
                           to "come hang out at a park or something". Over the course 
                           of the following few days, the scope of the event grew 
                           to include over 150 attendees. Some attendees will be 
                           coming from as far as Florida to attend the event. The 
                           get together has also drawn the attention of several 
                           representatives of Verant Interactive, one of the three 
                           companies responsible for bringing EverQuest to life. 
                           These members include the <b>Verant CEO, John Smedley</b>, 
                           and several members of the game's development team, who 
                           will be attending the event. </font></p>

                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Citizens of the Faydark:</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> It has been brought to my attention 
                           that there is a human woman walking about the Faydark 
                           named Milinara who claims to be the Queen of Freeport. 
                           This woman, along with a few of her followers (such as 
                           Jaelan) are spreading lies and sowing deceit in our lands. 
                           And when I say our, I mean the Feir'Dal. Neither of these 
                           individuals are even of Elven blood. Let me assure you, 
                           currently there is no Elven Liberation Army that wishes 
                           to overthrow the Elven Guard or the Elven Council of 
                           Faydwer. There is just these few individuals who are 
                           trying to enlist the good people of our lands into bloodshed. 
                           Their reason for doing such? These people are minions 
                           of a greater evil. An evil that wishes to bring our lands 
                           into turmoil so their true members can come forth and 
                           easily slaughter us. So, if you see these individuals, 
                           listen to their words. And then think of what they are 
                           truly telling you. Are they giving you any facts? Are 
                           they even of these lands? And who's best interests do 
                           they have at heart? Their stain of evil shall not be 
                           spread across our lands so beware of them.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Speaking of murderers, there is talk 
                           of a "Buechler Appreciation Day". The first line of Buechler's 
                           announcement reads:</font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">"In anticipation of the Respectable 
                           Buechler's return to Norrath, the citizens of Greater

                           be held on September 24th at 8PM EST." </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Well, I am here to assure you, as General 
                           of the Elven Guard, that there is nothing respectable 
                           about Buechler and that he is naught but a kinslayer. 
                           But do not let my words make you believe such things. 
                           Let me use his own. The "noble" Buechler was in a discussion 
                           just today saying, and I quote "ANd yes your right GOOD 
                           God watch out in Greater Faydark for me, the most notorious 
                           eternal lvl 5 naked MAGE!ANd this time HOgan EVERYONE 
                           that I see(lower lvl or same) will dIE!" If you wish 
                           to view its authenticity, please join us on the Rallos

                           for yourself that it was his hand that wrote such things. 
                           </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Furthermore, you can read Buechler's 
                           very own autobiography at that very same place (OOC: 
                           Rallos Zek website). At the very end of it, the "honorable" 
                           wizard Buechler says: "Now I continue to kill and murder 
                           my fellow kin of GF and Kelethin. No one can stop me, 
                           the eternal level 5 naked mage of Greater Faydark. And 
                           no one ever will!"</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Well, I am here to tell you that I shall 
                           help stop this murderous kinslayer. But not only with 
                           my blade. Nay, I will do something more useful. I shall 
                           inform all of thee of this fiend's actions and his plans. 
                           So, if you are upon the Faydark's lands and see Buechler, 
                           I would warn you NOT to turn your back on him. And if 
                           he attacks you or you see him attacking someone else, 
                           please shout for the nearest Elven Guard or member of 
                           the Vengeance of Elddar and we shall do our best to protect

                        our founder and benevolent (if crotchety) leader, Remmi 
                        has decided to follow the path that so many other unfulfilled 
                        Rogues have taken... he is leaving EverQuest in search of 
                        greener pastures. It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye 
                        to Remmi, a grumpy dwarf and a good friend. Thank you and

                           all is not lost! Already the effects of new blood have 
                           shown in our dark trade's libraries. Our librarian and 
                           new leader, Zato, has recently rewritten the Rogue Guide 
                           and I must say that in my opinion it is the most comprehensive 
                           Class Guide I have ever had the pleasure of reading! 
                           We've also published a guide called How to Group with 
                           a Rogue which should be very helpful to those of you 
                           who are friends to Rogues. There is a Rogue FAQ which 
                           explains nearly everything you might want to know about 
                           Rogues such as which skills work/don't work, where to 
                           find the trap in the game, poisoning, and other interesting 
                           bits. We also have many posting areas for various topics 
                           of Rogue interest such as Quest Information, the short 
                           list of Rogue Items, detailed melee statistical analysis, 
                           Pottery/Poisoning, Training Info, and even a Retirement 
                           Wing for those Rogues who have given up hope of class 
                           balance. If you are a Rogue without knowledge, friend 
                           of a Rogue or an interested observer, please drop by 
                           and become educated on the Rogue lifestyle, strength, 
                           and weaknesses. </font>

                           people have gone to the Chron X registration web page 
                           by accident and purchased another registration on their

                           cards, we'd rather they spend the money on new decks!

                        the 13th circle. Basicly, me and my HUNDRED some guildmates 
                        (Defenders of justice rule!) were a little restless due 
                        to the lack of events and dynamic quests and such. So, I 
                        was elected (well, i was the only one to volenteer) for 
                        the position as Ye old Rec coordinator. As it is, I have 
                        come up with the first of hopefully many BIG OL' QEYNOS 
                        FREE FOR ALL! Yes, that's right! In Qeynos, we will be having 
                        a mob clash where EVERYONE kicks eachothers butts! Prizes 
                        are awarded to the last man standing! They will probably 
                        be cash and items. To raise these funds, a small entrance 
                        fee of 5gp for Newbies (lv 1-5) 1pp for intermediates (lv 
                        6-9) and it gets higher from there. To get items for the 
                        prizes, we will accept almost ANY item of SOME worth, or 
                        more cash! So, looking to get that equipment off your back? 
                        Dump it on me! And also, any guides or GMs are welcome to 
                        attend (but don't fight plz, that would be MILDLY unfair) 
                        and we would be HONORED (me and the guild) if one came and 
                        donated an item to the pot.</font>

                           proud to announce to the fair citizens of Norrath the 
                           hosting of Belmass - a festival of new life, new beginnings, 
                           and new friendships. The Lord Assembly have scoured the 
                           ancient writings of our ancestors for the details of 
                           this grand event, and we hope to bring new life to a 
                           celebration that has not seen the light of day for hundreds 
                           of years.<br>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belmass will be held on Sunday, September 
                           19th, beginning at 6pm EST and continuing until at *least* 
                           11pm EST. Our scouts have examined many possible locations 
                           for the festival, and after much discussion we have decided 
                           upon the cavern inside the underground tunnel linking 
                           the Eastern Commonlands with the Northern Ro desert. 
                           The cavern offers safety from dangerous interlopers as 
                           well as cooling relief from the heat of the desert sands 
                           and is within easy reach for young adventurers based 
                           out of the city of Freeport.<br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my dismay, it was brought to my attention 
                        that a great artifact was stolen from the Darkmoon treasury 
                        a few days ago. The culprit has turned out to be none other 
                        than the barbarian Leber, a former slave to our High Lord 
                        Graffe of Darkmoon. I say former because as of now he will 
                        be hunted down and killed on sight. Word has reached us 
                        that the filthy barbarian is holding our artifact in exchange 
                        for the release of his two children, currently being held 
                        captive inside Nariak. For many years Leber has served as 
                        a slave to Graffe, while the High Lord held the children 
                        in a dungeon within the dark elf city. Now Leber believes 
                        he may purchase his children's lives with the exchange of 
                        our artifact. <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am offering a grand reward for the safe 
                        return of Darkmoon's artifact. The reward will be a pack 
                        full of various magic items that we have collected over 
                        the years, plus some platinum. <b>The hunt will start on 
                        Sunday at 9amPST-12noon EST, Sept 19th.</b> This hunt will 
                        be open to only the Dark Races (dark elves, troll and ogres). 
                        Leber has been know to be able to travel wide distances 
                        in just a short while, so we assume that our search will 
                        take us all across the continent of Antonica. The first 
                        of our evil brethren to find, dual and slay the heathen 
                        must bring back the artifact(a staff) to Nektulos and you 
                        will be handsomely rewarded with riches of great power. 
                        Be forewarned, we have information that Leber has sought 
                        out help from his pale skinned allies, so this may require 
                        a coordinated search with your fellow brethren of Innoruuk. 
                        Any and all that feel up to the challenge must meet in Nektulos 
                        forest in front of the pyramid before the starting time 
                        of the event so myself or High Lord Graffe may take your 
                        name. Any late comers will be welcome to register their 
                        name with Darkmoon as long as they start in Nektulos forest.</font>

                        There is going to be gladiator battles in the arena. There 
                        is going to be a hide and seek game. Also there will be 
                        a drinking game and much more. There will be merchants on 
                        hand to make you deals on armor and magic items (could help 
                        out those gladiators in the arena). The games such as hide+seek 
                        and the drinking game will only cost 5gp to join in, but 
                        you will be able to win ten times that. </font>

                        (again), the new expansion pack models, Gnomes, and of course 
                        the all elusive Easter Egg. If you would like to ask Milo

                        today's questions: </font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&quot;Why can you not swap the colors 
                           before it gets transformed to 16 bit color? I think all 
                           EQ players will agree we wish we had something like in 
                           UO where we can dye our clothes and such to specific 
                           colors to make it more 'personalized'. As it is now, 
                           say, for druids and monks, they eternally look like newbies 
                           with the exact same colors for 50 levels straight. I 
                           know Flowing Black Robes should not be able to be changed 
                           colors, but items such as leather and mesh should be 
                           able to. The game feels very im-personal with everyone 
                           looking exactly the same. I know its possible, why not 
                           add it in? Also, you mentioned the reference point for 
                           the shield was left out on Barbarians, why hasn't it 
                           been added in? It truely amazes me that the simplest 
                           things can make people happy, yet Verant seems to work 
                           on the tougher stuff all the time. :) </font>

                        warning out to those that might be considering, or are already 
                        in a transaction to purchase an Everquest account on Ebay. 
                        Currently, we have evidence that there are several individuals 
                        that are attempting to defraud legitimate bidders, and Everquest 
                        gamers out of large sums of money. </font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&quot;On 09/06/99 we decided to partake 
                           in the auction of a Level 50 Cleric character. The bidding 
                           on this character was proceeding slowly, and it looked 
                           like we would win the bid at around $320.00. Suddenly, 
                           a new bidder entered the arena, and put in a single bid 
                           proxy bid at $800.00, up from $320.00. We attempted to 
                           outbid him, and were forced to enter a bid of $810.00 
                           to finally win, as he didn't escalate it any further. 
                           </font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&quot;Normally, this would appear to 
                           be how competative bidding works. However, we investigated 
                           further, and spent many hours on Ebay researching closed 
                           auctions and the accounts of regulars that post or purchase 
                           Everquest accounts. We discovered that the aggressive 
                           bidder in the auction we just won purchased the very 
                           same account on 08/29/99 for $399.00. 6 Days later, someone 
                           new is selling the account, and the person that is driving 
                           the bids over $800.00 is the same person who purchased 
                           the account 6 days prior? Its called bid padding, its 
                           a fraud, and is a felony in some states, and is considered 
                           wire fraud in a select few states. It gets worse, the 
                           original seller on 08/29/99 was another one of the high 
                           bidders! The bidding was stuck at $100.00 for the account, 
                           and the original seller comes in and bids $399(amazingly) 
                           and begins the drive to rise the cost of the character, 
                           he never bids again after this initial boost. </font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&quot;Speculation leads us to believe 
                           that we have a group of delinquent minors that are using 
                           Everquest and Ebay to defraud many innocent people out 
                           of hard earned cash. We caution anyone that is considering 
                           purchasing an account to deal with only adults, and individuals 
                           with positive feedback, references and to very carefully 
                           research the Ebay databases for prior auctions. </font>
                        <p> <font size="-1">&quot;Everquest accounts have been sold 
                           for up to $20,000 on Ebay. Clearly, a vast majority of 
                           these auctions are padded, inflated, and simply fantasies 
                           of minors wishing big things. We've seen people spend 
                           large amounts of money on frivalous things, but the facts 
                           are clear, most true, legitimate everquest accounts have 
                           a real market value of between $100 and $600.00. If you 
                           are paying much more than this, the likelyhood of the 
                           bids being padded is tremendous, the likelyhood of you 
                           being defrauded is extremely high. They are banking on 
                           the fact that at least one legitimate person wants the 
                           account, and will keep bidding on it against their "Staged" 
                           competitor/s, driving the price to high levels. We've 
                           seen accounts that they haven't played there con game 
                           on sell for $100-$300 for well geared level 50 characters. 
                           So the obvious plan of action they are using is to scoop 
                           up level 50 accounts at a low cost, then resell them 
                           a few days later, driving the price up with their con 
                           game partners. </font>

                           Straylight Gem being the so-called Straylight Tome. An 
                           ancient book of Feir'Dal origin. Stolen by the Teir'Dal 
                           over a two hundred years ago and recently stolen back 
                           by the Erudites. Trying to ferry this tome to Felwithe, 
                           the Erudites were laid upon by a number of Teir'Dal at 
                           the Freeport Docks and slain ... but the captor of this 
                           tome was one of the Spurned and had no love for the Clerics 
                           of Innoruuk. Instead he gave the Book to a mysterious 
                           Tier'Dal child by the name of Sazami, a devout follower 
                           of Erollisi Marr.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The original thieves of Book, the Teir'Dal 
                           clergy, were wary that it might one day change hands 
                           again and they cast upon the Book all manner of enchantments. 
                           The Book could not be gated or teleported to prevent 
                           easy theft, just one such enchantment. And as Sazami 
                           plumbed the depths of the work, she slowly and unknowlingly 
                           was growing mad with hate and jealousy and rage. Fearing 
                           that even the Priests of Marr were turning against her, 
                           she stole the Book and fled into the sewers of Freeport.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Many weeks passed and both sides of 
                           the conflict searched for her ... eventually learning 
                           of her whereabouts in the sewers. Forces closed in on 
                           both sides. The protectors of Sazami were fortunate to 
                           find her first, but her madness was great and she fought 
                           them, thinking them enemies here to steal her treasure. 
                           Their attempts to subdue her was time spent in favour 
                           of the enemy forces and soon battle was engaged. For 
                           two hours the forces fought, but in the end a sister 
                           of the Blood Coven, Tenacious Val'Sharess, was able to 
                           kill Sazami and in the continuing melee, able to make 
                           off with the treasured Tome.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> At this time, the Straylight Tome lies 
                           within the Spires of Neriak. Recent research has uncovered 
                           the true purpose of the Straylight Gem ... to rid all 
                           of Norrath, once and for all, of Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk, 
                           and Rallos Zek's creations. The Blood Coven wishes to 
                           destroy the Book, to keep it from falling into their 
                           would-be destructor's hands. The Clergy wishes to study 
                           the Book, for another great Gem exists, unenchanted, 
                           one that could be used to construct an opposite, a Gem 
                           to rid Norrath of all the races of Light. More information 
                           has come to the foreground, that papers on the original 
                           Gem's construction were stolen along with the Book from 
                           the Feir'Dal ... but that the Gnoll conspirators never 
                           handed them over. Neriak is eyeing Infected Paw with 
                           great interest now. And what does the Undead Knight, 
                           Tiram Saeger, in the Estate of Unrest have to do with 
                           all this? What information may he have possessed while 
                           he was a living breathing Paladin of Marr?</font>

                           believe the child to be the link to everlasting peace,

                           (introducing a race of Lizards), Amano Jyaku has created 
                           a wonderful plotline revolving around a Lizard Demon, 
                           Isili Thepa, that, much like a plague, is taking over 
                           the minds of anyone it comes in contact with, Amano being 
                           the first of the Taken. As yet, the demon's plans are 
                           unfolding and much is unclear. The only clarirty being 
                           the amount of pain and suffering the demon wishes to 
                           inflict upon the world. Here is a short snippet by one 
                           of the most recent Taken, Zifeer:</font>

                        <p><i><font size="-1"> After some initial confusion, I find 
                           myself fitting in to Faydark life well. These ‘Elves’ 
                           are a curious breed, how they bicker so. They seem full 
                           of unsatisfied needs and wants. I have learned a new 
                           skill, Master. This puppet used to do a great deal of 
                           something it called ‘helping’, and I am trying this out.</font></i>
                        <p> <i><font size="-1">“Have you got any spare food?” they 
                           bleat. Ah, I think, ‘zekka!’ At first I believed they 
                           meant food in the sense you do, Master, and simply went 
                           about my merry business providing them with a private 
                           little world of pain and misery. (The ears of these ‘Elves’ 
                           are particularly sensitive, yet stretch for inches before 
                           ripping.) Then I came to realise they meant nourishment 
                           of a different kind. My baking skills have improved, 
                           and I get a strange fuzzy feeling inside as the young 
                           wood elf wanders away munching greedily on the fine repast 
                           that I have prepared for him, using the meat of his kin. 
                           Indeed, I fear I may be starting a cultural phenomenon 
                           here, many come back for more. I keep my recipe secret.</font></i>
                        <p><i><font size="-1"> (Did you know that they come in three 
                           flavours? Wood Elves are distinctly spicier in taste 
                           and are good smoked, whereas High Elves are blander, 
                           but work well with white wine. The Half Elf variety is 
                           more filling, but somewhat stodgy.)</font></i>
                        <p><i><font size="-1"> Of course, the meat must be drained 
                           first, and I am never one to let nature’s goodness go 
                           to waste. I find I can now turn one bottle of white wine 
                           into two bottles of red, and again, my new friends are 
                           grateful.</font></i>

                     <font size="-1">Here's a handy little program written by a 
                     fellow adventurer. Version 4.5 is available <a href="http://www.drelmo.net/multimedia/" target="_blank">here</a>: 
                     </font>
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Attention fellow Norrath inhabitants! 
                        I am Drelmo, a High Elf Enchanter ont he Xegony Server. 
                        A while back, I released Elmo's Image Browser 4.0 to allow 
                        us to view our EQ screenshots without waiting for load time. 
                        I noticed there were many problems and areas of improvement 
                        in the program, so I have been working on version 5.0 for 
                        months. Here is an idea of what is in it:</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> - Scroll bars for those of you who work 
                           in 800X600.<br>
                           - Color Schemes to change what your browser looks like.<br>
                           - A print function to print your screenshots directly 
                           from the browser.<br>
                           - The splash screen loads itself. You don't have to click 
                           on it anymore.<br>
                           - The displayed picture's height and width in pixels 
                           is displayed.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> However, a few of these features require 
                           a bit more coding that I don't know how to do. Specifically, 
                           how to make the scroll bars visible ONLY when a picture 
                           needs it and how to make the print function print the 
                           picture, not a bunch of numbers.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> With all of you dedicated players out 
                           there (especially the programmers) I'm sure I can release 
                           version 5.0 within a week. If all esle fails, those features 
                           will be compromised for the final release date: 9/1/99</font>
