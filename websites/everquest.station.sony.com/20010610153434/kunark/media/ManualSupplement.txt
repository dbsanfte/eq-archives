Introduction

Welcome to EverQuest!  You are about to enter a world ripe with adventure and intrigue.  Before you do however, please familiarize yourself with the manual, and the information contained in this supplement.  If you are new to EverQuest, or have just purchased the expansion known as EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, this supplement contains information that you may find vital on your adventures.  

The PDF version of the manual at http://www.everquest.com and this supplement obsolete the files in your EverQuest directory labeled everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt.  


Additional and New Information

This section contains information that is either new to the game or information that was not included in the manual.  It also contains some specific information on skills and abilities available to those who have purchased the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark upgrade or retail box.


Server Selection

Choosing a server is one of the first decisions you must make when you enter EverQuest.  Though it is true that many people who have friends in game will choose the server where their friends are, it is generally recommended that unconnected people choose the least populated server for play.  

There are also three special servers that new people will want to take care before choosing, these are the PvP servers.  Each PvP server has a different theme and should you choose to play on one, the following information should be considered.

The Rallos Zek Server (PvP)

The Rallos Zek Server is the oldest PvP server in EverQuest.  On this server, everyone has the ability to attack each other subject to a 4 level limit.  For instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41 through 49.  

In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server, the loot rules are "Coin + 1 item".  You may loot (or have looted from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item.  Items in bags, in a melee slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be looted.

The Vallon Zek Server (PvP Teams)

The Vallon Zek Server is what we call a PvP-Teams server.  Only races on opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.  The four teams are:

Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls
Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.
Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.
Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians.

Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they are on opposing teams.  

The loot rules on this server are identical to the Rallos Zek Server.

The Tallon Zek Server (PvP Teams, Coin Only)

The Tallon Zek Server is what we call a PvP-Teams server.  Only races on opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.  The four teams are:

Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls
Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.
Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.
Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians.

Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they are on opposing teams.  

The loot rules on this server differ from Vallon Zek.  Only coin may be looted from a fallen opponent.


Giving Another Consent to Loot Your Corpse

As mentioned in the manual, only you are allowed to loot your corpse, thus retrieving all of your items after death, unless you give consent to someone else to do so.  You can do this by typing "/consent" followed by the first name of the character that you wish to be able to loot your corpse.   Once consent is granted, you can also revoke it by repeating this operation.

Please be aware that there are people in game that attempt to convince people new to it to give consent, only to take all of the items off the corpse and not return them to the owner.  Should this happen to you, you should let our GM staff know with the /petition command.  We will pursue the issue and take action against the scam artist, but please be aware that we cannot guarantee that your items will be returned.  

Please use /consent only at your own risk.  





The /Report Command

The /report command instructs your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest servers for logging.  The purpose of this command is to create a record of any text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement.  The usage of this command in game is a little bit misleading.  The syntax of the command is "/report charactername", however the true function of the command sends any data in your chat window.  To properly use this command, use shift-PgUp to scroll until the suspect text is in the chat window, then type "/report charactername".  You should then file a "/petition" (see EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark manual), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation of what the /report is meant to show.


Item Flags

When you inspect an item (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags printed right below the name of the item:

MAGIC ITEM:  This means that the item is imbued with magic.  If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures which can only be harmed by magic/  

LORE:  This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time.  If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up.  This will check your bank account.

NODROP:  This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant.  However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests.

ARTIFACT: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out.  Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly.  Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power.

A Deities name:  If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects.  


Tail Rake

The "dragon punch" skill has been replaced by "Tail Rake" for Iksar characters.  



Melee Disciplines

In addition to the many automatic skills and abilities that characters will receive past 50th level, we've added player-controlled fighting "disciplines" to the repertoires of the pure melee classes (warriors, monks, and rogues).  These disciplines are activated using the /discipline command on the command line, and have a duration and base reuse time associated with them.  You cannot use any other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used discipline has expired.  You can type /discipline on the command line to view the disciplines available to you, as well as the amount of time before you can use another one.

Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long durations, have a disadvantage in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline.  In all cases where this happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage.  For instance, where the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his opponent less by a factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less, but only by a factor of 15%.  In the interest of exploration, further formulae will not be provided. 


Warrior Disciplines
 
EVASIVE (Level 52): The warrior is hit by his opponent less often, but also will hit his target less often.  This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.

CHARGE (Level 53): When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent.  In other words, he will not miss.  This discipline lasts for 14 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.

MIGHTY STRIKE (Level 54): When using this discipline, all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows.

APPENDIX A - Corrections to the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Manual


EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark was released with a new printed manual, which is also available for download on the main EverQuest site at www.everquest.com.  As with any static printed material associated with dynamic games such as EverQuest, information has a potential to be outdated.

In addition to some obsolete information included in the manual, there were also several inaccuracies.  This are corrected below.  Please refer to your printed or downloaded manual so that the comments may be taken in context.


Player Corpse Decay Times

p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status.  The times provided are incorrect. The player-corpse decay times are as follows.  Please note that all times are in real time, not game time:

Level 1 - 5:	30 minutes
Level 6+: 	24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.

*Note:  If you have no items on your corpse, it will decay in 3 minutes regardless of level.


Character Creation

p.24: The starting city for the Iksar is listed as New Sebilis.  It should be noted that New Sebilis is also known as Cabilis.


Sitting and Camping

p.34: The "Jargon Note" makes reference to player-killers lingering around another player-killers regeneration point (bind point, where they return after death) in order to attack them again.  It should be noted that this tactic (called "Bind Point Camping") is considered unsportsmanlike conduct in Player-versus-Player combat, and is against the rules.


Safe vs. Dangerous Locations

p.35: Section should read:

As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and other players can't kill you.  (You have to become a player-killer, or PK, to give other player-killers "permission" to attack you.  You do this by giving a Priest of Discord the Child of Discord book in your inventory.)  If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous guards may immediately come to the rescue, providing that they are fond of you.  Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.

*Note: Changes to the original text are in bold text.


"Feeling Out" Strangers

p.40:  It is stated that you cannot "consider" a merchant.  You can, but you must use the "Consider" key ("C" by default) or type /consider on the command line.


Skills and Combat: Skills

p.49: The next-to-last paragraph on this page reads, "You can have anywhere from 0 to 100 points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher skill ranking".  This section is incorrect.  This section should read:

Skill values start at 0 and go up from there.  The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class.  Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill.  Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master". 


p.52: The "Tiger Claw" skill is listed under "Other Skills".  It should be listed under "Combat Skills" on p.51.


Party Experience

p.54:  This should specify that additional experience is granted with every kill based upon the number of people in your group.


Before You Attack

p.56: The bottom of this page references text color associated with "Considering" your target.  The procession of text colors listed is: Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Red.  The correct procession is: Green, Blue, White/Black (depending on video mode), Yellow, Red.  The listed descriptions apply in that order.


Right Hand vs. Left Hand

p.58:  This section makes several references to separate "auto-attack" keys for the right and left hands.  These functions were merged prior to the release of EverQuest, and are now controlled by a single auto-attack button (the "A" key by default).  


PvP: Fighting Other Players

p.67: The second bullet-point makes reference to the "Child of Order" book.  The correct name for the item is the "Child of Discord" book.

p.67:  The last line reads, "If you attack another player in the city, the guards immediately attack and kill you."  Please refer to the correction for p.35 above for the correct information.

Reclaiming Items

p.69: This section states that you can give someone permission to loot your corpse by typing /loot followed by the player's name.  The command given is incorrect.  The actual command is /consent.  Please read the section about /consent above so that you may be aware of the possible dangers associated with it.


Participating in Parties

p.76:  It is stated that, "Only people of similar experience levels can join a party.  A level 11 of 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30 player can't - even if everyone agrees to it."  This information is incorrect.  Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members.  As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging.  


Guild Halls

p.78: "Some of the larger player-created guilds may purchase halls as well".  This information is incorrect.  Players may not purchase guild halls, houses, etc., in EverQuest.


Contacting a Game Master

p.94: The bottom of this page makes reference to the commands of "/who Guides" and "/who GM-Admins all".  Neither of these commands exist.  You should use "/who gm all" to get a list of all visible GMs and Guides in game.  Furthermore, the description of a Guide is incorrect.  A Guide is a volunteer CS representative that serves as the first line of support for customers in game.  They can assist with most issues, however will not be able to give you hints or other information that is meant to be discovered in game.
