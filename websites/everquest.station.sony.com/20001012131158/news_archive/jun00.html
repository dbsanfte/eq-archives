                  our humble home was destroyed. But we have picked up from the 
                  ashes, and are building a bigger house on this land, to accomodate 
                  all the new friends we've made. Please, venture around back, 
                  there is a story telling circle going around a warm campfire,

                  knew well the art of war, and provided us with worthy opponents. 
                  I envied some of their skills, but that was the limit of my 
                  praise. I notched an arrow, knowing full well that it would 
                  be but a nuisance to them, but still hoping to get off one critical 
                  shot. My companions shifted in their armor, eager for the fight, 
                  restless from the wait. They were brave souls all, and I was 
                  proud to call them my friends. Champions to the last. Champions

                  with me at <a href="mailto:Sunray@ruis-saille.com">Sunray@ruis-saille.com</a> 
                  so that I can meet with you and port you in would be most appreciative. 
                  We will start our run and anyone who is not KOS with the Erudites 
                  will get our first bind and we will go from there. There will 
                  be quite a few of us, so running in any outdoor zone should 
                  be fine and there will be no problem of getting jumped by something 
                  that we cannot handle. We shall bind along the way, just in 
                  case there are any accidents. Hope to see you all there. =)</font></p>

                  Once there you post a topic saying so and so for city name leader. 
                  You then need to have three people backing that person up and 
                  they have to accept it. Once that happens they will be entered 
                  in the final election. We will take nominations for the next 
                  three weeks or until we feel we have enough nominations for 
                  each city. We encourage all citizens of The Senate to vote when 
                  the time comes.</font></p>

                </font></b> <font size="-1">We recently received this bit of info 
                concerning the War of Hate on Solusek Ro:</font> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">Storms billowed beneath a malevolent sky. Mordeki's 
                  steed could barely be seen within the fold of night, black upon 
                  black. His long ebon cloak shielded his obsidian armor, and 
                  a cowl tapered his sinisterly chiseled features. He spurred 
                  his steed forward as he descended the valley in the Rathe mountains 
                  to where he saw the encampment's glowing embers that burned 
                  into the midnight sky.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Sometime later the proud shadow knight of the 
                  House of Dra'Vedd stood before the old crone, Madame Eva. "tell 
                  me what you see..." he inquired as he sat across the table from 
                  the gypsy. Odd trinkets hung throughout the wagon. Skulls, swirling 
                  beakers that overflowed with mists, charms, sigils, and other 
                  strange things that laid trapped in the confines of jars and 
                  other containers.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Upon a velvet cushion the crytal ball filled 
                  with a smokey hue. "I see the son of hate will rise up. He is 
                  strong and his hands run red with blood. His one is touched 
                  with a particular venom", she spoke with her eyes focused still 
                  upon the smokey sphere. She stammered a bit, "Vengefull spirits 
                  from the beyond..."</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The cowl concealed the features of the Teir 
                  Dal whose hate began to boil, "Bah I do not have time for spirits...tell 
                  m of the book...I must have it...". The dark elves lips turned 
                  upwards in a snarl beneath the hood of his cloak as his hatred 
                  mounted. It was then a cold wind blew through the wagon. An 
                  inky cloud of blackness filled the wagon and their was silence.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Mordeki sat atop a hill overlooking the encampment, 
                  a black bound tome folded under one arm covered with the face 
                  of what seemed a groaning spirit carved out of its "hide" cover. 
                  The flash of crimson orbs and haunting laughter filled the air 
                  as the child of Dar'Vedd crossed spurred his steed into the 
                  night and vanished into its embrace.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">In the wagon the sage gypsy muttered her last 
                  breath of life. "I curse you son of Dra'Vedd...may the eye of 
                  Mal'Arigar swollow you whole with the unborn son of the futures 
                  wrath...", she gurgled past dying lips...and faded into the 
                  void of death.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Off on the horizon were two brothers, both 
                  the heads of armies. One who embraced Hate and the other Valor. 
                  Now would be the dark lord to come, and his army would bring 
                  damnation in its wake. The cursed son of a misbegotten house...and 
                  now the servant of armageddon itself. This was the future...and 
                  written upon it were not just the dogs of war, but the demons 
                  who preyed upon them.</font></p>

                  twice at 10:00 am and 7:00 pm Pacific time so everyone has a 
                  chance to attend.</font></p>

                  during the event for information on where help is needed in

                  in Norrath at least one hour real time prior to event...and 
                  will try to escort during the event depending on the turnout.

                  On the 21st of this month the two guilds Draken and Elder 
                  Dragons have planned a great event in the forest of Faydark 
                  to celebrate the first birthday of both guilds. So we invite 
                  every brave adventurer who is willing to join our peaceful party.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The party will start at 8 a.m. (PST) at the 
                  wizard gate near Felwithe. You will find there a exquisite meal 
                  to everyone of you and beside this we planned for the young 
                  adventurers (level 1-9) of you a special challenge to award 
                  the brave warrior who knows Faydwer best.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">We hope to have a lot of guests who will celebrate 
                  the first birthday of these two guilds with us.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">( Important: Because both guilds are German 
                  speaking only guilds we decide to use this language mainly on 
                  this event. This makes it easier for some of our members who 
                  are not too good in English. But of course we have some members 
                  who have no problems with the English language. So they will 
                  translate it roughly and as good as they can. The challenge 
                  is planned in German but we translate it in English as well 
                  if demanded so that every one has the possibility to take action 
                  in it. I hope everyone will be satisfied with it)</font></p>

                  ) with Verant's Bill Trost. Bill was one of the main designers 
                  of EverQuest, and a strong force behind the game itself. Although 
                  this interview is a little out of date, it still has some interesting 
                  bits about how Bill got his start in the games industry, and 
                  a few interesting looks at the game play side of EQ. There's 
                  also a Real Video format of this interview for those interested. 
                  Here's a snip from the page.</font></p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p><font size="-1">Bryan Reynolds: I have a question about being 
                    a game designer. If you had to take some of the standard things 
                    you do in a day when you were building the game, what would 
                    they be?</font></p>
                  <p><font size="-1">Bill Trost: It was mostly just sitting with 
                    blank paper, and saying this would be cool. Luckily we had 
                    creative writers who would write the history. Our primary 
                    quest designer, Tony Garcia, really did an awesome job, Tony 
                    is another guy I played D&D with ever since I was 10 years 
                    old. So a lot of the guys from Norrath are part D&D characters.

                War of Hate Update </font><font size="-2">3:15 PM<br>
                </font></b> <font size="-1">The latest news regarding the War 
                of Hate on Sulusek Ro indicates a possible end to the conflict:</font> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">It was a day of epic proportions that would 
                  be forever remembered for all time by both the armies of the 
                  light and the dark. The 1st Fist of Light had gathered at the 
                  gates of Qeynos and prepared their descent into the depths of 
                  teh catacombs beneath the city where had rested the fate of 
                  Norrath in the grips of the Plaguebringers.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">As the army made their way down inside their 
                  deepest fears had been wrought to light. The armies of hate 
                  had indeed forged a pact with the plaguebringers but Drayvar 
                  was not their only commander. Euthan Hatebringer had indeed 
                  brought ihs warband the Order of the Crimson Hands in tow. Behind 
                  him from the shadows Euthan summoned his ally tis his side. 
                  Lasombra, high lord of the dark order Illumin Cathari.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The army of light stood their ground yet could 
                  not possibly survive the onslought of the defending forces. 
                  Having retreated back into the surface, Drayvar turned his attention 
                  to the now disheveled army of light assured that victory was 
                  his.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Drayvar sent a herald to the Sovereign Lord 
                  of the 1st Fist of Light and demanded that a battle be set for 
                  he had the paladins betrothed and would see her fate sealed 
                  in hate, should he refuse to meet him in battle to the end with 
                  the loser decommissioning their army. (OOC - duel for deletion 
                  of guild and character).</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The two stood before the gates with people 
                  from both sides of the army standing fast to the battle. Yet 
                  upon that hour Innoruuk was not with his daughters champion. 
                  As the paladin that had been Banegrivm drew his blade down to 
                  send the shadow knight to his god, Drayvar whispered his final 
                  words, "she is one of us, you will never know your peace". With 
                  holy rage the paladin took the shadow knights head to place 
                  back upon High Keep as witness to all those who cross the threshold 
                  of darkness.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The armies of hate were no more, however now 
                  an alliance was set. Where Drayvar had failed stood the human 
                  born son of Innoruuk to hold fast the mantle of hate and reforge 
                  what was broken. Euthan Hatebringer, High Lord of the Order 
                  of the Crimson Hands stood...and evil would surely flow. </font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">There were tales and legends of heroes, of 
                  villains, and strange beasts that walked the lands. This was 
                  but a saga or a legacy of things to unfold. Was this the end 
                  of the war of Hate as we had known it...or a new beginning? 
                  Many questions yet remained unanswered. Only time would tell...but 
                  at least for now their was a banner of peace.</font></p>

                <p><font size="-1">Too long have the daydwellers of Norrath rested 
                  easily, thinking the knowledge of the Will of Innoruuk buried 
                  forever. A new age has come upon us, and new lands have been 
                  discovered. It is time that Our Fathers words be heard once 
                  more.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Many have visited the Library of the Firstborn 
                  and found guidance, but many more have yet to hear of the Glories 
                  of Innoruuk. Therefore, one year after its first opening, the 
                  Library of the Firstborn has been renovated and now stands open 
                  to welcome all who come seeking knowledge of the Will.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">If you are TeirDal, come to the Library and 
                  learn of your birthright. Those of you who are old friends and 
                  have lost the way to the Library, we welcome you back.</font></p>

                  army that had valiantly defended high keep had returned and 
                  sailed their crest upon a banner once more; the 1st Fist of 
                  Light returned. But then within the bowels of Neriak came a 
                  stir amongst the Teir Dal. They had not forgotten their past, 
                  nor their plans, and especially their defeat. There must be 
                  retribution! The "Fist of Hate" is born?</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">With the appearance of that dark standard came 
                  Drayvar, whereabouts still unknown. Then appeared Mordeki, a 
                  ruthless shadow knight who carried orders supposedly from the 
                  hand of Lanys, daughter of Innoruuk. Mordeki poisoned a high 
                  priest in the process of collecting these orders only hand them 
                  to Drayvar personaly. These orders commenced and officiated 
                  in the new Hate army that was to crusade through Norrath in 
                  a retributive strike to eliminate the light army.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Then somewhere along the lines is believed 
                  Euthan (Banegrivm's brother) and Martyr (who is now reportedly 
                  Euthans brother also) have also allied with the new hate army 
                  as well.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Then a letter arrives from Qeynos written by 
                  Chesgard, a Knight of Thunder. A greta veil of shadow has begun 
                  to fall across the city of Qeynos. Crops wither, fish found 
                  floating dead at sea, the graves of the dead found torn open 
                  as a sore against the land, and strange sounds began to fill 
                  the hills at night accompanied by the baying of wolves beneath 
                  a witches moon. Rumors abound that the undying one had even 
                  returned to the disheveled ruins nearby. Chesgard worried for 
                  the life of his son, but was afraid to act for rumors and stories 
                  had been spread as old wives tales about their good commander 
                  Kane, speaking of witchery and demon worship.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">After counseling with the the High Priestess 
                  of Rodcet Nife, within the temple of life...she too concured 
                  with the knight that a great evil was laying its grip fast about 
                  the city and if something was not done, then the end would come...and 
                  darkness would reign supreme over the vassal.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Chesgard feared for the life of his son who 
                  patrolled the hills. He could not bare the thought of losing 
                  him. This in mind the knight set out upon the road and entered 
                  into the Rathe mountains. Here he entered a valley enshrouded 
                  by a thick heavy fog, wherein he found a small band of gypsies. 
                  He spoke to an old crone that saw in her visions the darkness 
                  which that knight spoke upon.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">She told him if he sought its source she needed 
                  to find the mariner who had traveled the world over. Only then 
                  would the source of the evil that plagued the good people of 
                  Qeynos be known. Her last words to Chesgard as he departed were 
                  "the blood is on the walls." Later Chesgard discovers from a 
                  local youth about a captain whose ship is in dry doc at port 
                  and comes to believe this may in fact be the same "mariner" 
                  that the old crone spoke of.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Chesgard then set quil to parchment and sent 
                  a page with the letter to the Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist 
                  of Light. The page then was seen in the hallways leaving "changing" 
                  from the visage of a young lad, to that of a fair and beautiful 
                  high elf from whose lips could be heard, "soon we will be together 
                  my love."</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">In the letter Chesgard also had become suspicious 
                  as to the dark tidings, considering the re-emergence of the 
                  hate armies. The last time such evils were soon were none other 
                  then the war of hate, around the time of the battle of high 
                  keep. This was when the dead raised from their graves in the 
                  hills and Varsoons decayed plague was wrought across the lands.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">During this time Drayvar managed to temporarily 
                  ensnare the soul of Hothrog, with the aid of the witch Najena. 
                  Zyac later used his rites to unbind the soul of Hothrog from 
                  being bound in a Necromantic rite of passage. During this time 
                  a few confrontations occured between Fist of Hate and 1st Fist 
                  of Light, this only being one of them...not even counting the 
                  endless taunting from the ranks of the Hate army.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Having the letter a scouting party sets out 
                  to Qeynos. Its believed by Aikek and Linien that the "mariner" 
                  is none other then Captain Rohand form the Mermaids Lure at 
                  the docs. This same Captain also speaks of tales regarding the 
                  vampire Mayong Mistmoore not as a Teir Dal, but as a fallen 
                  high elf.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The party which then consisted of Banegrivm, 
                  Linien, Genieve, Hothrog, Shaym, Mystican, Jarkari, and Raleldor 
                  Jax; a passing warrior who had heard the tales of Qeynos's strife 
                  and offered his sword in the cause. They maid their way the 
                  docs and found the Mermaids Lure and spoke with the captain. 
                  In the midst of their conversation with Captain Rohand, a gypsy 
                  spoke to Banegrivm and said "only he who is of open faith may 
                  pass, what god do you follow?"</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">When Banegrivm answered the gypsy he was informed 
                  to "hail mister bloodheart" deep within the catacombs. Shaym 
                  new immediately considering her former past "who" exactly mister 
                  bloodheart was. He was none other then the Lord of the Bloodsabres 
                  themselves, vile champions of Bertoxxulous.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The scout group made their way into the sewers. 
                  After much searching they discovered a secret door which led 
                  entry to the home of what was thought to be just a temple of 
                  Bertoxxulous. As they entered the ante-chamber a foul wind blew 
                  and what sounded like howling demons filled the air.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">As they entered in they saw twin shadow knights 
                  which guarded and entry.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Raleldor was able to pass deeper within, being 
                  a warrior without liege to any faith. As he entered he saw not 
                  but a temple...but an entire citadel of deep dank evil. He made 
                  his way to S'ragg Bloodheart and as he hailed him...a shrill 
                  vile sound pierced the air as a demons tendril like wisps took 
                  the life of Hothrog within an instant.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Banegrivm gave the command for immediate retreat 
                  knowing there was know hope of a frontal assault. They reformed 
                  and pulled back with the knowledge that they had and an idea 
                  of the perils that lay ahead of them. But now new questions 
                  remain. What do the followers of Bertoxxulous have to do with 
                  those of Hate?</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Later that same fatefull eve...Raleldor and 
                  Banegrivm discovered a paladin of Mithaniel Marr amidst the 
                  ranks of of the Qeynos guards. This struck odd considering as 
                  soon as he appeared he dissappeared and then was found outside 
                  the Mermaids Lure. Even stranger is the fact that it had been 
                  thought all the guards true to the Qeynos seal were followers 
                  of Rodcet Nife. As the two spoke with Lieutenant Arathur, they 
                  were told by him to seek out "Rolius" in the Hall of Truth. 
                  When the two traveled there they were told by this knight to 
                  collect militia helms from the fallen corrupt city guardsmen.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">How odd a wayward knight of truth finds himself 
                  in Qeynos spreading the word of Marr. How odd yet again a paladin 
                  who follows Marr is fated to battle the arch enemy of the temple 
                  of life. But again...why? And how does all this relate to the 
                  the rising hate armies. What will happen next? Only time will 
                  tell...for assuredly war is coming...</font></p>

                  that will be leading to mass guild conflict. Please contact

                  the person who strikes the killing blow will win a Greater Lightstone! 
                  We will have 2 rounds of this event. There is NO entrance fee 
                  for this event, however Harm Touch users will be disqualified 
                  if it is used, and there will be a cleric on hand to reverse 
                  HT effects. Spell casters are also allowed to participate; however 
                  DoTs will be frowned upon.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The Second event will consist of Last Man Standing 
                  in the Arena. We will break people into level ranges and users 
                  must register with an appointed guild member before participating. 
                  All participants will enter the arena and when told GO will 
                  try to kill everybody else in the arena. The LAST person standing 
                  will win a Greater Lightstone. Second place winners will win 
                  a Regular Lightstone. This event will continue as long as we 
                  have enough people for each level range. This is also a free 
                  entrance. Level ranges are as follows:</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">1 to 4<br>
                  5 to 7<br>
                  8 to 11<br>
                  12 to 15<br>
                  16 to 19<br>
                  20 to 23<br>
                  24 to 27<br>
                  Etc.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The Third event for the evening will be a Drunk 
                  Chase, also in West Freeport and will start at the Gate. Upon 
                  registration into this event, alcohol will be given to the participant. 
                  Just before starting each participant will drink his or her 
                  alcohol when told. We will already have a runner somewhere in 
                  West FP who will ALSO be drunk, and when told GO all people 
                  will run all around West FP trying to find our guild runner, 
                  the first person to INSPECT successfully will win a Greater 
                  Lightstone and the pot money. There will be a small entrance 
                  fee for this event that will be paid to the guild member you 
                  register with. The fees will follow this formula and FTD will 
                  not be keeping any cuts:</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Levels 1 to 5, 5gp<br>
                  For each range after add an additional 5gold. (6-10 1pp, 11-15 
                  1.5pp etc)</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Registration for each of these events will 
                  be handled by a single person for an event, a line will form 
                  in front of this person to easily register names. This will 
                  start at 8pm EST near the arena. You may also PRE Register by

                  for prizes.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">If our supply of GLSs or LSs runs out, we may 
                  substitute a cash prize instead. Hopefully this won't happen 
                  though.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Alcohol will be given out to people as long 
                  as our supply lasts, but please don't get greedy, we will have 
                  1 or 2 people giving it out so it won't be hard to remember 
                  names of people who ask for alcohol repeatedly.</font></p>

                </font></b> <font size="-1">Wars appear to be breaking out accross 
                Norrath. The details of this particular conflict are a bit scarce 
                at this point, however:</font> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">It all started one fatefull day when followers 
                  of both light and dark gods amassed for a battle of epic proportions 
                  that would never be forgotten. It was a time when Norrath needed 
                  heroes, where villains rued the day, the gates of hate opened 
                  wide, and a legacy was born. An army of light stood to defend 
                  the gates of High Keep from an assault led by Innoruuks daughter. 
                  The army of light stood victorious as Lanys had been cast into 
                  hate, and the heads of Teir Dal lined the gates of high keep.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Sometime later the standard that had valiantly 
                  defended high keep sailed once more; enter the 1st Fist of Light. 
                  Within the confines of Neriak there had been a stir, orders 
                  issued, and a crest of hate and retribution vile was raised; 
                  enter the Fist of Hate.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Now the war of hate that had once been is reborn. 
                  Sides have been drawn and the story unfolds once more. Brave 
                  heroes and villains fight on a battlefield to determine the 
                  fate of Norrath.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Rumors scourge the taverns across fair Norrath 
                  from bards aglib with tales of woe and the heroic fray. Are 
                  the Bloodsabres secretly in league with the newly reborn hate 
                  armies. Is Commander Kane finally preparing for his tyrannical 
                  reign of Qeynos? Will the hate armies have the sacred ore they 
                  seek from the bowels of high keep at long last? All this and 
                  more to come...as the War of Hate has returned at long last.</font></p>

                    one thing, the helmet that whole tin man bucket head thing 
                    just doesn't work for me and I wanted to know if you had anything 
                    to do with that design because its horrible. I wonder why 
                    you just didnt make the Human helmets similar or exact to 
                    the militia ones those are nice. I'll give you props on those, 
                    your guard models are great but one more thing. The butts 
                    on the models??? why are they so screwed up are you just not 
                    good at modeling butts? because you handled the chest area 
                    very nicely. But the rear is a different story. I hope you 
                    can answer my questions and possibly fix those in the near 
                    future. If at all possible well thanks for giving me the time 
                    of day and keep up the good work.</font></p>
