                  of Ask Milo</a> here at <a href="http://www.everlore.com" target="_blank">www.everlore.com</a>. 
                  In this issue Milo talks about UO2 Models, Software Bugs, 3D 
                  Modeling programs, and quite a few other topics. Great read 
                  as always, here's a snip from one of the questions.</font></p>
                <blockquote><font size="-1"> Milo, I would just like to know about 
                  how things work with you and Verant. Are you simply told what 
                  to make and you create it (with the help of design sketches, 
                  etc.), or do you have room for your own creativity? I am an 
                  aspiring 3D artist, and was wondering what it is like in the 
                  workplace... And if you do not get to use your creativity to 
                  its fullest, do you wish you could? </font></blockquote>

                  that overlooked the resplendent marble courtyard of the Temple 
                  of Life. Her mind still ached, it was not like any physical 
                  ailment that she had ever experienced. It was her very thoughts 
                  that pained her, they were still jumbled and aimless. The random 
                  thoughts and memories that flashed past through her consciousness 
                  causing her balance to falter, and her eyes to take on a hollow 
                  shade that could only allude to the turmoil within.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">She was still only half-aware of what had gone 
                  before. That part of her mind that had remained solely hers 
                  throughout the possession had at least allowed her to recall 
                  the events of the previous day. The images and sounds were distorted 
                  beyond her comprehension though, with either one or the other 
                  making no sense to her as she struggled to remember</font></p>

                  us this weekend! ***</font></p>

                  sites, meaning we get mentioned on their homepage!</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Many thanks to all of you who made this possible 
                  and keep coming back to read the new episodes as without this 
                  support we surely would not have come to the attention of our

                </font></b><font size="-1">A major battle between the forces of 
                light and dark took place on Fennin Ro this past weekend:</font> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font size="-1">Greetings residents of Fennin Ro. My name is 
                  Allarn, the Acting Vice-Mayor of Rivervale. This past Saturday, 
                  the forces of Light and Dark clashed as never before.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">As some know, the city of Neriak, ruled by 
                  the Prince Regent Darmendrax Thex, declared war on Rivervale 
                  for the halflings part in a raid on Neriak. In order to further 
                  his goal of world domination, the Prince called together all 
                  his horde and allies. The Houses of DeVir, Kenafin, and the 
                  other great Teir'dal houses were joined by the likes of the 
                  Skorchers and others of the dark races. Together, the great 
                  horde was known as Da're d'Philith.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">In order to save Rivervale from certain doom, 
                  Erolotis founded the Elders of Tunare. A Norrath-wide call for 
                  help went out from both Erolotis and myself, and many were the 
                  returns. The Grudge Bearers, the Heavy Foot, the Halfling Nation, 
                  the Furry Footed Crusaders, members of Tal Kor and others came 
                  together to combat this menace.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The battle was met in Kithicor, and continued 
                  on through the Commonlands. The first line of the dwarves held 
                  strong that day, and pushed the tides of the Dark forces back. 
                  Then the day was won, suddnely, as Darmendrax fell and the heart 
                  went out of the invaders.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Thanks to the combined forces, the Elders of 
                  Tunare saved Rivervale from the Da're d'Philith.</font></p>

                  just shy of 200 people taking part in this war. Although there 
                  were many negatives, just about everyone involved had a great 
                  time. This war came about due to the RP and RP politics fostered

                  Server. My name is Ignitz Gemcaller, and I am the guildmaster 
                  of the Heroes of Valor. It is my distinct pleasure to announce 
                  to you today the start of a month long events sweep. That's 
                  right, once a week for the entire month of August the HoV will 
                  be holding an event, and there promises to be something for 
                  all walks of the Norrathian Life to enjoy.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The first event, I am proud to say, is the 
                  first of it's kind (as far as I know). Once I read of an event 
                  where a guild held a gnome race across the world. Well, today 
                  I announce a dwarf race of the same nature, except that it is 
                  across all the known zones of Faydwer with the notable exception 
                  of Kedge Keep. That's right, all participants will create newbie 
                  dwarves and traverse Faydwer, to include Unrest, Butcherblock, 
                  and Mistmoore Castle. As well, we are raffling off a full set 
                  of Crafted Armor for some lucky adventurer to win. This is just 
                  the beginning, and it promises to be a fun filled month. So 
                  without further ado, I will proceed to lay out the details of 
                  our first event.</font></p>

                  Rules: As of now you may log on to the Tribunal Server and begin 
                  purchasing raffle tickets for a full set of Crafted Armor for 
                  warriors. The price is 5pp a ticket and you may purchase as 
                  many as you want. Any HoV member will take your order so long 
                  as you go to them and pay for the tickets. They will take your 
                  name down and list how many tickets you bought, then relay that 
                  information back to me. The next day you may ask me (Ignitz) 
                  what numbers you have if you wish to know. The winner will be 
                  chosen at random using the ingame random number generator. In 
                  the event that the winner is not present to receive his/her 
                  prize then the set will be held until the winner can come collect. 
                  Proceeds from the raffle will go to support more raffles like 
                  this. Good luck to all who wish to participate.</font></p>

                  Where: Kaladim near the Paladin's guild<br>
                  When: Friday, August 4th at 7pm CST sharp!<br>
                  Rules: Registration will begin at 5pm CST near the entrace to 
                  Butcherblock Mtns in Kaladim. All participants must register 
                  as the character they wish to receive the prizes should they 
                  win. When creating the newbie dwarf you must use Hov as the 
                  first three letters and the name of the character who registered 
                  as the rest. (IE. Ignitz = Hovignitz).</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">To make things more interesting and to add 
                  an element of strategy to he race the following rules are made:<br>
                  1. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins will start at 7pm on the dot 
                  with no penalty to their start time.<br>
                  2. Clerics will start at 7:01. This is to illustrate that they 
                  have a little bit better chance of surviving the race without 
                  much difficulty due to the spells that they start with.<br>
                  3. Clerics may choose to accept the spell Divine Aura in order 
                  to give them an even better chance of survival, but doing so 
                  will cause you to start at 7:02.<br>
                  4. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race 
                  with the spell Skin Like Diamond cast upon them. Doing so however 
                  means they will begin the race at 7:04.<br>
                  5. Clerics may also begin with Skin Like Diamond with a start 
                  time of 7:05.<br>

                  2. BB Mtns to Dagnor's Cauldren.<br>
                  3. Dagnor's Cauldren to Unrest.<br>
                  4. Once in Unrest you must make your way to the back of the 
                  zone, near the backdoor of the mansion, and /poke the HoV member 
                  that will be stationed there. Once that is done you may make 
                  your way back out.<br>
                  5. Unrest to Greater Faydark.<br>
                  6. Greater Faydark to Crushbone.<br>
                  7. Once in Crushbone you must make your way to the area behind 
                  the castle and find the HoV member that is there and /poke them. 
                  You may then make your way back out.<br>
                  8. Crushbone to Felwithe.<br>
                  9. Once in Felwithe, you must find the HoV member hidden within 
                  the city. Once you have found them, /poke them then you may 
                  make your way back out.<br>
                  10. Felwithe to Lesser Faydark.<br>
                  11. Lesser Faydark to Mistmoore Castle.<br>
                  12. Once you are in Mistmoore, make your way to the other side 
                  of the lake at the bottom of the entrance ramp and /poke the 
                  HoV members that will be waiting there. You know the drill :)<br>
                  13. Mistmoore Castle to Steamfont Mtns.<br>
                  14. Steamfont Mtns to Ak'Anon.<br>
                  15. Once in Ak'Anon you must find me (Ignitz). The first four 
                  people to /poke me are the winners of the race.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">There will be HoV members in all the zones 
                  mentioned and upon entering each zone for the first time you 
                  must /shout "Naked Newbie Dwarf Race!". This is to prevent people 
                  from shortcutting. The winners will be not only the first four 
                  people to /poke me but will also be the first four people to 
                  have /shout'ed in all the zones and /poke me. If you forget 
                  to /shout the phrase but manage to be one of first four participants 
                  to /poke me, I am afraid that I will not be able to reward you 
                  on the grounds of not knowing if you actually went through all 
                  the zones (non-negotionable).</font></p>

                  East Commons. To what end? What is the dark power that gives 
                  him strength and purpose? Neither the Humans, nor the Teir'Dals 
                  have answers to these questions. Afraid for their safety, the 
                  authorities of Freeport and Neriak have decided to hire several 
                  teams of investigators. Their mission will be to find the schemer, 
                  uncover his true identity, and force him to reveal his secrets. 
                  At the same time, each group will have to "clean" the zone, 
                  which has become very dangerous in such troubled times...<br>

                  Centurions and, who knows, to gaze at a Griffin without turning 
                  your back and running like a hare! Departure will take place 
                  at Neriak's entrance and Freeport's West Gate. An escort will 
                  take you to the EC / Nektulos pass, in which groups will be 
                  formed, and people will be buffed and equipped. Then, the master-hunters 
                  will lead you to Orc 2 for the revel to begin! Several gifts

                  Guild Mixer Hunt on Saturday, taking out 3 dungeons at the same 
                  time. Our hunts were broken up by level, with great turnout 
                  at all dungeons involved. Levels 26-35 went to Permafrost to 
                  kill the goblin king, levels 36-43 took on Splitpaw in the hopes 
                  of finding the Ishva Mal and his cronies, and the level 44+ 
                  group took on Kedge Keep, to conquer Phingel.</font></p>

              <p><font size="-1">Due to the problems encountered in yesterday's 
                patch, some additional data has been moved to the live servers 
                today. As part of this patch, three new changes are included:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">- /Consent no longer gives other players permission 
                to loot your corpse. Instead, it only gives them the ability to 
                drag your corpse using the /corpse command. This change is due 
                to player request stemming from number of customer service issues 
                raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to steal 
                the belongings of other players. The change will eliminate those 
                concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>
                - Yesterday's patch changed the way spell-damage messages are 
                reported to the caster. The new text was dark blue, making it 
                hard to distinguish from the background when in HUD mode. The 
                text color has been changed to "yellow" due to player request.<br>
                - Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless 
                the winner of the duel is over 10th level. This should greatly 
                reduce the number of duels with inappropriate names that have 
                been occurring in the game.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">We would like to apologize to everyone for the 
                problems stemming from yesterday's patch, and let you know that 
                we have taken steps to greatly reduce the possibility that something 
                of that nature could happen in the future.</font></p>

              <p> 
              <p><font size="-1">Hello all,</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Many people have suggested over the past few 
                months that we should implement a version of the /consent command 
                to give people the option to drag a corpse (via /corpse) rather 
                than loot it, due to the amount of item theft that takes place. 
                As you know, we previously ruled out such an option for various 
                reasons, not the least of which were technical limitations.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">After considering issue for some time, and taking 
                into account the customer-service issues created by those who 
                loot corpses and steal items under the guise of /consent, we've 
                decided that a change to its operation is warranted. In the next 
                patch, /consent will be changed to give permission to drag the 
                corpse only, not to loot it. Other people will not be able to 
                loot your corpse.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Though we realize that some will miss the ability 
                to /consent in the previous fashion, the proliferation of NODROP 
                items in game has made asking someone else to loot your corpse 
                a very infrequent event. Given the ability to do one or the other, 
                consent for loot, or consent for drag, we believe that most people 
                would prefer the option to /consent for drag.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">We hope that this change will address everyone's 
                concerns by eliminating the amount of antisocial conduct that 
                surrounds corpse looting.</font></p>

                - You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.<br>
                - Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the 
                profanity filter.<br>
                - Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through 
                locked doors.<br>
                - Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery 
                against non-moving, non-rooted targets. These restrictions allowed 
                us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>
                - Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than 
                was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>
                - Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>
                - A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history. 
                The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending 
                humor that the old one was.<br>
                - Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>
                - Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the 
                world.<br>
                - Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons. Take

                with the new gems/icons.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Poison*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 
                51+).<br>
                - Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>
                - Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>
                - Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>
                - Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*General Crafts*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>
                - The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>
                - The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may 
                now be crafted.<br>
                - The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>
                - Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>
                - The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>
                - The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been 
                replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making 
                this item". </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Items*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn 
                by Half Elf paladins.<br>
                - The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of 
                the player.<br>
                - Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>
                - There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running 
                around in the world. Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's 
                Tooth".<br>
                - The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to 
                something a bit more useful.<br>
                - The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time. The function 
                of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended 
                to be a buff.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*/consent*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Some people were spamming others with /consent, 
                causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only 
                be done once every two seconds. Should you be harassed via this 
                tool, please use /report. Also, please take care to avoid accidentally 
                /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can 
                undo it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">There has been a significant change to the factions 
                in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule. Take care not to get killed by 
                NPCs that previously left you alone. The significant upside to 
                this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer 
                in nature for those who work on their faction.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Regen Effects*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type 
                spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite 
                DOT spells. As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept 
                a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT. However, 
                if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but 
                not replace the regen spell. This will allow users of beneficial 
                DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while 
                under the affect of regen.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Keyed Dungeons*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now 
                NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago. Furthermore, 
                when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's 
                Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead 
                return with your character to its bind point. We made this change 
                to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, 
                and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Barbed Scale Whip*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">In the last item patch, this item was changed 
                from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer 
                was not aware that it was already in-game. It has been changed 
                back to its original stats.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Hiding Corpses*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest 
                client. This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress 
                the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen. This can 
                be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number 
                of corpes, causing framerate to decay. It will be particularly 
                useful in the planes. The command supports the following arguments:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>
                - ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people 
                in your group.<br>
                - NONE: No longer hides corpses.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">For community reasons, this option must be set 
                after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after 
                you enter the zone. You can reset it while in the zone in order 
                to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">*Resurrection*</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">The resurrection confirmation box will now report 
                the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell 
                they are casting. Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" 
                from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing 
                YES. Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause 
                the experience to be unrecoverable.</font></p>

                yesterday's news posting regarding the Karana Council of Guilds:</font>

                  hunt on Saturday, JULY 22, 2000, not June 22 as previously reported.</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">The Councilis staging hunts to certain dungeons, 
                  depending on level. We have also added a dungeon for those players 
                  from levels 16-25. All hunts will begin staging at 1 pm Central 
                  Standard time, with the actual raid beginning at 2 pm Central 
                  Standard time. Any participants wishing to join after this time 
                  must find their own way into the dungeon to rendezvous with 
                  their group. The dungeons being raided and the levels associated 
                  with those dungeons are:</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">Runnyeye, for levels 16-25</font></p>

                </font></b> 
              <p><font size="-1">Hello All, </font> 
              <p><font size="-1">I'd like to announce some pretty big changes 
                for the better to our Customer Service:</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">1) We are making a serious revision to our Item 
                Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse 
                items to players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added 
                a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse 
                the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed 
                lost. Please be aware, if we watch people lying to us (i.e. a 
                person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded 
                it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. 
                We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather 
                than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this 
                is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. 
                Be warned - Don't try it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">2) We're in the process of adding a lot more 
                GM's. In addition, we're adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm 
                shift to better accommodate our International users. We're also 
                adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely 
                handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it 
                was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out 
                of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff 
                to better accommodate players.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">4) We've modified our Internal procedures with 
                regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints 
                we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important 
                to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, 
                so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that 
                players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition, 
                we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's 
                not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the 
                GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a 
                GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer 
                Service, George Scotto at <a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com">gscotto@station.sony.com</a></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. 
                Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">6) We've put a new email system in place that 
                should help ensure quick response.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">7) A different version of the Online Store will 
                be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able 
                to order Kunark from it once it's up.</font></p>

              <p><font size="-1">One clarification that I need to mention in regards 
                to the newly announced policies.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">The section that states, "We've added a lot of 
                logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the 
                item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed 
                lost.", infers that items will be reimbursed prior to investigation.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely 
                manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the 
                GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, 
                etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. 
                The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) 
                based upon the outcome of the investigation.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Our customers deserve courteous and prompt service, 
                and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive 
                it.</font></p>

                  event on Saturday, June 22, 2000. The Council is staging hunts 
                  to certain dungeons, depending on level. Each dungeon is given 
                  a dungeon leader, from the member guilds of the Council, who 
                  is in charge of coordinating the hunt for that dungeon. All 
                  hunts will begin staging at 1 pm Central Standard time, with 
                  the actual raid beginning at 2 pm Central Standard time. Any 
                  participants wishing to join after this time must find their 
                  own way into the dungeon to rendezvous with their group. The 
                  dungeons being raided and the levels associated with those dungeons 
                  are:</font></p>

                  and find them informative and fun. I want to know that I find 
                  your EQ work brilliant and exciting. My first question is: What 
                  artist(s) do you consider to be your role models? I am curious 
                  because I have grown up an fantasy art(my favorite is Frank 
                  Frezzeta) and think I sometimes see influences of other famous 
                  artists in EQ. My second question:Where can I find other work 
                  by you, either just to view of for sale? </font></blockquote>

                population on the servers, we're going to allow another group 
                of players from Karana to split off to Terris-Thule.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">This Friday we will again open /movelog registration 
                on Karana sometime around 7pm PDT (GMT-8). The GMs will broadcast 
                when registration is open, and we will continue taking /movelog 
                requests for 24 hours. Players wishing to have their characters 
                moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog 
                yes" after registration is opened. As we have identified a minor 
                problem with the hundreds of simultaneous uses of the /movelog 
                command, it is recommended that you wait a few minutes after registration 
                is opened using it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Notes:<br>
                - /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count 
                for all characters on that server on that account.<br>
                - Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their 
                corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down the 
                following Tuesday morning. Corpses will not be duplicated in the 
                new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone 
                who moves will be lost.<br>
                - We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this 
                action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive.<br>
                - The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not 
                you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<br>
                - Karana and Terris-Thule will be down for several additional 
                hours on Tuesday, the day of the next patch. Updates will be given 
                at that time.</font></p>

                would get done</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">I would like to list a few things that if included 
                in the emails and bug reports that would make it much easier for 
                us to reproduce the situations.<br>
                1. Zone name<br>
                2. Location -- /loc<br>
                3. Full names of NPC’s<br>
                4. Full names of items - not abbreviations, I don’t know all of 
                them!!<br>
                5. Location<br>
                6. Any mitigating circumstances even if they seem trivial (you’d 
                be surprised)<br>
                7. Location<br>
                8. Server - even on bug reports, some times they get shuffled<br>
                9. Location<br>
                10. Did I mention Location???<br>
                11. Server name<br>
                12. Location</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">If you are reporting a broken quest PLEASE include 
                the starting NPC’s full name, the zone it is in, the NPC’s loc, 
                and the phrase used to trigger the quest. This will save us SO 
                much time when reproducing these bugs.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Something else that is useful is the threads 
                that talk about broken quests, or bugs in the game. It is a little 
                difficult to sort out the wish lists, flames, complaints, but 
                we have pulled bugs out of those threads and some of them are 
                already fixed.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">I am a firm believer in communication. I as also 
                a firm believer in EverQuest, and the team of testers I work with. 
                There are some things we just don’t catch. We haven’t played every 
                class race combination to 60, so we desperately need your input. 
                Please remember that the testing department can not change anything 
                fundamental in the game, so the rants and flames are a waste of 
                your and my time. To be honest, when I get an email that is offensive 
                I stop reading right there. It is the same with posts. I do lurk 
                on these boards, and I communicate frequently with Abashi. Sometimes 
                he will ask for more information and clarification. This is usually 
                me asking him to find me some more information so we can reproduce 
                whatever bug you are talking about.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Thank you for playing EverQuest and caring so 
                much about this game. I do promise to lurk and read. I’ll never 
                post, but if Abashi says Ester the Tester said well that was me.</font></p>

                  here's a snip.</font></p>
                <blockquote><font size="-1"> Question: Why do the loved-by-all 
                  Guides have the coolest graphics like the electric sword and 
                  hot looking green plate armor while the people who are paying 
                  for the game get nothing but totems that look like a little 
                  dolly no matter how bad-ass it should look. My point is that 
                  there are allot of graphics in the game that could be improved 
                  to make the customers happy. Instead it looks like Verant is 
                  more concerned with making those that don't pay for the game

                  contact with a rogue scout, telling stories and spreading rumors 
                  that one of Firiona Vie's servants is being held captive by 
                  a vicious clan of Burynai, deep within the caverns below Kurn's 
                  Tower. This story has been heard by many among the outpost, 
                  but to this day no parties have been dispatched in search of 
                  the truth, until now.</font></p>

                  the General will be leading an expedition to these caverns. 
                  This raid is for anyone levels 10 - 25 who would like the chance 
                  to check out Kurn's Tower and see what it has to offer. It's 
                  a nice dungeon for the younger levels, with somce decent loot 
                  for the levels required, and in addition for the raid many monsters 
                  will be given new and better high level items to fight with 
                  (which will come out as loot when they die). Kurn's Tower is 
                  located in the Field of Bone. It's a far hike for the Firiona 
                  Vie outpost, so if you can't bind yourself it could be a problem, 
                  unless you're welcome enough in Cabilis to bind there (killing 
                  a lot of sarnaks and kunark goblins will help factions with 
                  most of the guards)</font></p>
                <p><font size="-1">If you'd like to come, or donate items for 
                  quest rewards/monster loot, send email to <a href="mailto:eldrad@tarewmarr.net">eldrad@tarewmarr.net</a>

                <p><font size="-1">Once again the time is 3 PM EST this saturday. 
                  The raid will begin at that time with or without you. If you 
                  need time to travel there, I'd suggest doing it the night before 
                  and camping there, or leaving extra early. The raid forces will 
                  be gathering at the bottom of the ramp the leads up, around 
                  and into the castle, around 2 PM and going in at 3 PM. Also 
                  there should be a few high level players in the zone hosting 
                  the event, to help keep some of the "kids" alive, and to hopefully 
                  provide revives or resurections to those who die but are bound 
                  far away and can't get back themselves.</font></p>

                <p><font size="-1">The occult relationships between Freeport and 
                  Neriak are now well known by most men of political knowledge 
                  on Norrath. The Human city "rents" its underground domain to 
                  the Teir'Dals who, in turn, teach ambitious Humans the dark 
                  path of necromancy, and reward the cooperative attitude of the 
                  local militia. Now, we, Dark Elves, propose ourselves to share 
                  our hunting tradition with the youngest residents of Freeport. 
                  The northern fringe of Ro has been chosen as the perfect ground 
                  for this Wild Hunt! Those who are willing to embrace our bloody 
                  ways should look for Radharc at Neriak's entrance, or Moruviell 
                  at Freeport's south gate. An escort will then lead them to North 
                  Ro, where the slaughter will begin!</font></p>

                  to EverQuest, organises its first event this Friday (July the 
                  7th). Newbies (level 1 to 7 characters) can meet us at Freeport's 
                  and Neriak's gates between 2:30 and 3:00 PM (EST). Then, we 
                  will hunt in North Ro, until 6:00 PM. Argarwaen, our Lady of 
                  the Blades, will join us from time to time to skin your preys 
                  alive and turn their hides into pieces of patchwork armor, so 
                  start collecting ruined pelts : wolf if you're small (Elf, Dwarf, 
                  Halfling, Gnome), cat if average (Elf, Human, Iksar), or bear 
                  if large (Barbarian, Ogre, Troll). If a monk or a caster, prefer 
                  spider silks.</font></p>

                  the amount of witty come-backs, sarcasm, and your amazing ability 
                  to change the subject to something entirely differant, and completely 
                  avoid the question at hand, I couldn't tell if you were being 
                  legit, or just trying to see if somebody would be foolish enough
