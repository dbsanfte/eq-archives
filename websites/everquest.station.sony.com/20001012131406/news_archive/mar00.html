                           carry any equipment nor wear any armor (so you don't

                           and may not use any spells during the event (Rule 3 should 
                           take care of that) nor have any spells cast upon them

                           time. Any entrant found to be sober will be disqualified.</font>

                           run within sight of the Rivervale zone entrance (any

                           "fair play" in this case (although the success of such

                           The major purpose is to start YAAP (the Young Adventurers 
                           Assistance Program). All races are welcome, we will be 
                           stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, 
                           buffs, and weapons available for free for characters 
                           under 10 seasons. Armor for all classes available for 
                           easy tasks. Magic items will also be given for simple 
                           quests. Equipment will NOT be "uber-twink"; expect fine 
                           steel, banded, raw silk and the like. If you have Crafted 
                           Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, you've already 
                           had enough assistance :-). We will also have a raffle, 
                           storytime at the stage, and maybe other events as well. 
                           These are for everyone. Free 6-packs for all who want 
                           to relax with the crowd. We'll make sure to have enough 
                           drink so everyone can stagger through Freeport! The Raffle 
                           will have items nice for low and mid-level characters. 
                           Tickets will be 1pp each, limit 3 per person. (we want 
                           younger people to have a fair chance at goodies). We'll 
                           have a nice assortment of prizes, hopefully several dozen. 
                           A cash prize will be awarded to end the raffle. Winners 
                           need not be present, we'll record them and post a list

                           East Commons should be just dying down, so once its over,

                           Here are the rules... One unlucky character named Malinine 
                           is going to DIE in several places all over the West Commons 
                           Area. The members who wish to play this game must pay 
                           5pp to join to a designated member of Bootleggers, and 
                           come to the East Commons Tunnel. Once everyone is in 
                           East Commons Tunnel, Malinine will zone in and give them 
                           all consent to loot his corpse. Everyone will zone into 
                           West Commons and begin to run madly around looking for 
                           the corpses which will be looted for prizes and money! 
                           (Kind of like an easter egg hunt.) All members must be 
                           in the East Commons Tunnel to play, latecomers will most 
                           likely not be let in. </font>

                           This event will be going on during the entire festival. 
                           It is open to all classes and races. At different times 
                           during the festival, questions about Freeport and it's 
                           surrounding areas, will be asked and the first person 
                           to answer will win a prize for answering that particular 
                           question. Questions will cover things such as names of 
                           shop owners, different locals in Freeport, etc. 15 to 
                           20 trivia questions will be asked during the festival, 
                           so there will be plenty of chances to win a prize. </font>

                           A series of judges will run 2 contests: female beauty 
                           contest and male beauty contest. Entrants will be judged 
                           on personality, beauty, dancing and poise. Judges will 
                           pose a question to each to help in their determination. 
                           Prizes will be given to winners, 1st and 2nd runners

                           The Lottery will simply use the /random command. There 
                           will be a designated ticketmaster. The ticketmaster will 
                           stand at the East Commons tunnel exit. </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> There will be two stages to the lottery.

                        <p><font size="-1"> FIRST STAGE - 2pp per ticket <br>

                           All lottery contestants must give the platinum to the 
                           ticketmaster. The ticketmaster then writes down their 
                           number. For example, if "Milla" was the 6th person to 
                           buy a ticket, she would be listed as No. 6. Then, the 
                           ticketmaster will use the /rand command for how ever 
                           many people there are entered. Whoever wins gets 50% 
                           of the lottery earnings, second place gets 40% and third 
                           place gets 10%. </font>

                           higher level players of each guild to lower level players.

                           slave! Need a personal cleric, tour guide, information 
                           source, whatever they want to use them for within reason. 
                           They will probably not attack a Sand Giant for you. There 
                           will be a mulitude of players of various levels availible 
                           for "Auction." Could you use a 35th level druid for two 
                           hours? The winner of each player will buy the right to 
                           have him/her as their "Servant" for 2 hours, (real time).

                           wear off. This change had been made due to an issue that 
                           was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo creatures 
                           while feigned and AFK. The change had some unintended 
                           effects, as we discovered that there are a few cases 
                           where someone could be legitimately feigned for a longer 
                           period. Instead of having the spell wear off, any summoned 
                           pet will automatically suicide 2 minutes after its owner

                        <p><font size="-1"> Well I would like to start off by thanking 
                           everyone who attended the meeting that was held on the 
                           17th. We didnt get much done since I didnt know that 
                           that was St. Patricks day at the time and so most people 
                           were out partying. We decided that we should probably 
                           vote on a leader and officals of other departments of 
                           the Senate. We concluded that it would probably be best 
                           to do this offline using our mailing list. If you want 
                           your guild included in the Senate please email me. If 
                           you or a guild representative isnt on the mailing list 
                           it means your guild is not offical listed in the Senate 
                           so please contact me. My email address is <a href="mailto:Apocalip19@aol.com">Apocalip19@aol.com</a>. 
                           Next I would like to say that we will be holding another 
                           meeting this Friday the 24th. In the same place, behind 
                           the Jade Tiger in Northern freeport, at the same time 
                           9pm EST. I dont like to have meetings this close together 
                           since I know they are time consuming but we werent able 
                           to accomplish much do to my folly last week so this meeting 
                           will be to make up for it. I hope to see you all there.</font>

                        <p><font size="-1"> The tale of the Tome of Hatred, as told 
                           by Arravis Dru`giir:</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Twenty two hundred years ago the Necromancers, 
                           Shadowknights and Priests of Innoruuk created a spell 
                           which allowed their deity, Innoruuk, to physically enter 
                           the world of mortals. This complex spell was kept within 
                           The Tome of Hatred, a singularly evil and vile book. 
                           The existence of this tome became known to an order of 
                           holy monks who stole the book from the Tier`Dal with 
                           the objective of destroying it. All but one of the monks 
                           was slain in the process of retrieving it, however they 
                           were unable to destroy the book. To protect the tome 
                           the monk split the pages among seven powerful adventurers. 
                           These individuals are to safeguard the pages and avoid 
                           contact with each other lest the tome be reconstructed. 
                           Unfortunately, the pages themselves still seem to hold 
                           a sentient power and can at times exert an influence 
                           over the guardian they are bound to. Each page is able 
                           to sense the general location of the other pages and 
                           their guardian.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> The guardians have protected the pages 
                           by passing them from generation to generation, however, 
                           recently three of the guardians fell into the hands of 
                           the Tier`Dal. The dark elves have been using the captured 
                           guardians to find and recover the remaining pages. I 
                           was the leader of these guardians, and to rescue them 
                           I gathered a large group of adventurers to assist in 
                           the recovery of the guardians and the pages of the tome 
                           (this was the previous event, part 1). These adventurers 
                           succeeded all too well. The guardians were rescued and 
                           the pages in the hands of good again. It was then that 
                           I began the magical ritual that would destroy the book. 
                           During the casting, I began to feel the power of Innoruuk 
                           in my mind. The father of my kin, the Tier`dal, whom 
                           I had left long ago spoke to me. A divine vision possessed 
                           me and it could not be denied. My mere mortal mind broke 
                           under the strain... And I saw the error of my ways. In 
                           secret, Lord Innoruuk had organized an army of darkness 
                           that at that moment, attacked the gathered adventurers. 
                           In the confusion, I fled to the depths of Neriak, tome 
                           in hand. There, I have studied the Tome of Hatred under 
                           the watchful eye of Innoruuk and his priests and priestesses.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> I am now ready to begin preparations 
                           to cast the spell that will summon our father back to 
                           his home. Gather children of Hate, progeny of Innoruuk 
                           and let us bring our wrath upon this petty world. We 
                           shall sweep over the land, destroying all our enemies 
                           and making it ours for the plunder. The necessary preparations 
                           must be made. The spell requires blood and magic. Help 
                           me recover these so that Lord Innoruuk may walk among 
                           us again. So prepare yourselves Kin, gather your spells

                        of immersiveness and addictiveness that is present in Everquest. 
                        The game features a large game world, with hundreds of NPCs, 
                        quests, items, as well as thousands of other players with 
                        which to interact. This game should come with a warning

                           companies in the interactive entertainment industry.

                           multiplayer online game to date, is recognized as the

                           "The combined expertise of LucasArts, Verant, and Sony 
                           Online Entertainment will bring to gameplayers an incredibly 
                           dynamic online gaming experience worthy of Star Wars," 
                           says Simon Jeffery, president of LucasArts. "The immensity 
                           and richness of the Star Wars universe lends itself ideally

                           incredible amount of depth and detail that we'll be able 
                           to create a place for fans to feel right at home. This 
                           game is going to be incredible!"<br>

                           be food and drinks, and maybe even a piñata! (who doesn’t 
                           like a piñata??) Come meet Red Branch and your fellow

                           meant as a gathering for the Solusek Ro server, we welcome 
                           all players of Everquest… and would especially like to

                           the most successful player run event ever held, it was 
                           truly a momentous event, celebrating not only the release 
                           of EverQuest, but also the coming together of it's community. 
                           One year later, on Saturday, March twenty-fifth, 2000, 
                           the second annual EverQuest Gathering will be held to 
                           help unite the community of Fennin Ro as well as prove

                           server. The event will begin with a speech to honor the 
                           event and to introduce the new era of EverQuest. It will 
                           include predictions of what the future may bring for 
                           Fennin Ro, and illuminate the true potential of it's 
                           role playing community. This will be followed by various 
                           events including: numerous raffles, each organized by 
                           what class can use the reward, as well as a general raffle 
                           which will have a cash prize; a trade market in which 
                           people can buy and sell various items; free alcoholic

                           finally, a scavenger hunt. Following the event, the procession 
                           will move to Mistmoore Castle, where we will battle our

                     about EQG2 and the plans for EQG3: </font>
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">EQG2 was a success far past what 
                        we expected. We had a little over 140 people pre-registered, 
                        and we had over 240 people at the event. Cindy and I want 
                        to extend our thanks to everyone that attended, especially 
                        the Verant representatives without whom the event would 
                        not have been such a success. </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> We were treated to the most extensive 
                           public look at EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark that has 
                           been given to date, and let me be the first to say that 
                           it looks like it's going to blow our socks off! We were 
                           also fortunate enough to be able to give away several 
                           copies of the product that will be shipped to the winners 
                           when it is released. </font>

                           for EQG3, and we would appreciate any input you can give 
                           us as to how to make the event better. Please come visit 
                           us at <a href="http://www.eq-event.com" target="_blank">www.eq-event.com</a> 
                           and give us your input on the message board. Everlore 
                           will be hosting a poll for us to help us decide where 
                           EQG3 will take place. From our informal poll on our website 
                           and at the event, the top contenders are, in no particular 
                           order: Los Angeles, Denver, Orlando, and Las Vegas. </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Unfortunately, some idiot tried to fool 
                           with the poll on Everlore as to where the next EQG will 
                           be. Somehow, Los Angeles got 80 votes in an hour, and 
                           Denver got over 1000 in an hour. Not only isn't this 
                           funny, but if we had believed it, we would have spent 
                           entirely too much money on event preparations. This would 
                           have been a financial blow that neither Cindy nor I can 
                           sustain. </font>

                        this is the first dance on Everquest. So grab a bottle, 
                        grab a date, it's time to celebrate. Be it wine, be it brine, 
                        it's dancing time. Come on over and join the posse from

                        to help provide some entertainment. Feel free though to
