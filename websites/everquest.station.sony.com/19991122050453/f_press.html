                     Addiction</a>. Here's a highlight: 
                     <blockquote>"You could say Hunter Godfrey is hooked
                        on EverQuest.<p>

                        'That game is the digital version of
                        crack,' sighs the 29-year-old father of
                        two from Birmingham, Alabama.<p>

                        But don't look for Godfrey at any 12-step
                        program any time soon. He and more than
                        150,000 other gamers are too busy
                        hunting monsters, collecting loot, and
                        forging alliances in MUD world, where
                        players lose themselves for days at a clip."</blockquote></li>
            <li> For those of you who did not get the printed issue of TIME featuring 
               EverQuest, there is an <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/articles/0,3266,26830,00.html" target="_blank">online 
               version</a> of the article available at <a href="http://cgi.pathfinder.com/time/" target="_blank">TIME 
               Online</a>. The author, Michael Krantz, had some great things to 
               say including: 
               <blockquote> &quot;Everquest raises the bar again.&quot; <p>
                        and,<p> &quot;The Everquest team, says 989 president Kelly 
                        Flock, took a chance by deciding to leap-frog the 2-D Ultima 
                        and create a game so graphics-rich it would require a 3-D-accelerated 
                        PC in order to play it. Smart move.&quot;</blockquote>

<li>
Edward Umheiser, 
               of <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/" target="_blank">3DGaming.net</a>'s 
               review team, has given EverQuest an 'A'! Among the fine details and 
               kind words in the <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/reviews/rpg/everquest/" target="_blank">review</a>:
            <blockquote> 
               <p>&quot;To me, 
                  EverQuest has become more than a game… it's another life!&quot;</p>

               name, <a href="http://www.damagedgoods.com" target="_blank">Damaged

            <blockquote> 
               <p>&quot;EQ is

</li>
<li>
   The reviewers of <a href="http://ww.electicgames.com" target="_blank">Electric 
   Games</a> have given EverQuest 4.5 stars out of 5. To sum up <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquest.html" target="_blank">the 
   review</a> in their own words: 
   <blockquote> 
      <p>&quot;Everquest is the "killer app" of online multiplayer games. It is 
         diverse, balanced, and incredibly detailed. The world is enormous, and 
         you can easily get lost in the gameplay... Everquest is the single most 
         addictive game I have ever played.&quot;</p>
   </blockquote>

   has <a href="http://www.mpog.com/reviews/software/action/everquest/" target="_blank">reviewed</a> 
   EverQuest and given it a 3.5 stars out of&nbsp;5. While Kevin does not believe EverQuest 
   is an RPG, he does have this to say: 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;... if you have a very good [computer] system and are looking for a 
      community based killing/experience game Everquest is the best thing currently 
      available.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li><a href="http://www.gamepost.com" target="_blank">GamePost</a> 
   has put up a great <a href="http://www.gamepost.com/reviews/everquest.html" target="_blank">review</a> 
   (98%) of EverQuest. The author, Pa¥nE, has this to say: 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;... EverQuest is definitely one the best games in my lifetime, and one 
      that I can imagine will be played for years from now.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li>Greg Kasavin of <a href="http://www.gamespot.com" target="_blank">GameSpot</a> 
   has posted a <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/rpg/everques/review.html" target="_blank">new 
   review</a> of EverQuest. Assigning a score of 8.4, he had this to say, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Between its excellent graphics, its performance, its rich fantasy setting, 
      and its propensity to force you to cooperate with, rather than hinder, your 
      fellow players, EverQuest is the best game in its class.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li><p><a href="http://www.cdmag.com" target="_blank">Computer 
   Games Online</a> reports that EverQuest debuted at number one in PC Data's <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/articles/018/174/pc_data_031499.html" target="_blank">weekly 
   sales</a> figures.</p>

   at <a href="http://www.g3dn.com" target="_blank">Generation 3D</a>. Among their 
   comments, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Well, let me first start off by saying, it's been a long time since 
      I've been this addicted to a game, and I don't think I'll be getting board 
      with "Everquest" for a long time to come.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</li><li>The staff at <a href="http://www.pcblitz.com" target="_blank">PCBlitz</a> 
   have posted their <a href="http://www.pcblitz.com/reviews/eq" target="_blank">review</a> 
   of EverQuest and seem pleased with the game. They have this to say, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;EQ is much more than a simple game, its a world, a life, a living entity, 
      an addiction. Try it out and see how badly you get sucked in.&quot; 
</blockquote>
 
</li><li>Cindy Yans and Jason Cross, of <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/" target="_blank">Computer 
   Games Online</a>, have posted their <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/018/111/everquest_qt.html" target="_blank">&quot;Quick 
   Take&quot; </a> of EverQuest. They write, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Our initial impressions of EverQuest are perhaps best summed up by the 
      fact that we leave our jobs every day to go home and play all night.&quot; 
</blockquote>
 
</li><li><a href="http://www.pcfan.com/pcfan/" target="_blank">PC 
   Fan.com</a> has posted the <a href="http://www.pcfan.com/pcfan/reviews/everquest.html" target="_blank">first 
   review</a> of EverQuest and rated it at 101%. They give three perspectives. Jason 
   "Spartan" Montes says,  
<blockquote> 
   <p>"It's quite amazing how versatile this game is and it's hard to see it ever 
      dying out... EverQuest has dominated my life more than any other game before 
      it.&quot; 
</blockquote>
<p> Jeremy "Manabyte" Conrad says, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;You can see where the "ever" in EverQuest comes from, as you will be 
      playing this game forever. I know I will.&quot; 
</blockquote>
<p>And Chris "Paladin" Allen says, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Simply put, Verant has created the most spectacular RPG I've ever played. 
      And I am prepared once again to drop everything and have no life.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li><a href="http://www.gamespire.com" target="_blank">GameSpire</a>'s 
   Kevin Cheng, has written an EverQuest <a href="http://www.gamespire.com/previews/everquest/index.shtml">preview</a>. 
   He says, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Initially, I was skeptical of an Online RPG game developing their own 
      3D engine and at the same time, creating a lag free, diverse world. I was 
      quickly proven wrong when my first reaction to the game was, 'Wow.'&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li>Sean Miller of the <a href="http://www.elecplay.com" target="_blank">Electric 
   Playground</a> has posted a <a href="http://www.elecplay.com/preview/everquest.shtml" target="_blank">Preview</a> 
   of EverQuest. He covers what he believes makes EverQuest special. Among his impressions: 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;Sure there are incredible graphics, smooth graphics and a simple interface, 
      but what makes this game so incredible is the shear volume of variety.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li><p>989 Studios announced that EverQuest has 
   broken industry record numbers for pre-sell orders and has become the number 
   one PC pre-sold game on EBWorld.com. Read the entire press release in the <a href="n_press.html" target="_content">Press 
   Releases</a> section.</p> 
</li><li>Jason Samuel of <a href="http://www.games.net/" target="_blank">Games.Net</a> 
   has written a nice <a href="http://www.games.net/pcgames/articles/0,1034,6315,00.html" target="_blank">little 
   preview</a> of EverQuest. Jason, amazed with the size and depth of EverQuest 
   says, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>&quot;There seems to always be something more to discover, some farther distance 
      to travel, and as I gain more levels and abilities new possibilities present 
      themselves.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li>Joe Ewbank of <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net" target="_blank">3Dgaming.net</a>

   review</a> of EverQuest. Ten pages chock full of information and screenshots. 
   He comments, 
<blockquote> 
   <p>"Not only does EverQuest have "Ultima Online Killer" written all over it, 
      it may very well present a challenge to the latest and greatest first person 
      shooters coming to market in 1999.&quot; 
</blockquote>
</li><li>EverQuest has been chosen as <a href="http://www.games.net/pcgames/articles/0,1034,6052,00.html" target="_blank">Games.net</a>'s 
   #2 Most Highly Anticipated Game of 1999. Here's some of what they have to say: 
<blockquote> 
   <p>"Brad McQuaid and team are taking online role playing to new heights with 
      the incredible 3D-accelerated EverQuest. We must admit we were skeptical when 
      first logging onto the EQ beta: we didn't think it was going to be all that. 
      But damn, were we wrong." 
</blockquote>
</li><li><p> On January 22nd, EverQuest was featured

</li><li><p> Jason Montes of <a href="http://www.pcfan.com/" target="_blank">PC 
   Fan</a> can't keep away from EverQuest. "Words can't describe how addicting this

      This is the revolution that Everquest heralds." 
   <p>"Sometimes the awe you feel hits home and you feel like the discoverer of 
      a new world." 
</blockquote>
<p> Next-Generation promises to stick around and see how the game lives up to it's 
   promise, "If it does, it could be the greatest time eater we've ever played --

      together into a drop-dead gorgeous package.&quot; -- PC Gamer.</p>
   <p>&quot;Day/night cyles create subtle lighting
