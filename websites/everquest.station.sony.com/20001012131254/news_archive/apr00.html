                        As of today, I have catalogued over 200 items that have 
                        been found on the lost continent, most with the zone and 
                        Mob information showing where they were found. You will 
                        also find specific information on most of the zones, including 
                        what level you need to be to hunt there, what types of creatures 
                        you might expect to see there, and how to find your way 
                        there and back. Obviously, with such a huge and exciting 
                        new world, this listing is still a work in progress, but

                        about this, I know a good many people have been looking 
                        forward to this for upwards of a week and I know I'm letting 
                        you down. I know this frustration ,and hope to still see 
                        everyone there. If anyone could go to Nektulos at 7 central 
                        and hang about for half an hour or so, telling this to anyone 
                        attending the raid who didn't e-mail me before hand, plz

                        Island Raid </font><font size="-2">12:15 PM</font></b><br>
                     <font size="-1">Here is another raid being organized by Eldrad the General on Tarew Marr server:
<blockquote>The first Raid on Monster Island I put together a while back went really well, where we went and killed the dino in OOT.<p>

But there's a new Monster Island for us to raid, on Kunark in the Field of Bone. This island is the home of The Tangrin, a giant ape. This ape is rumored to con red at level 51, he hits for around 200 points, and drops "some kind of hairy armor". I dunno if anyone has killed him yet on our server but someone told me he went down on Fennin (but of course they could have been making it all up too :)<p>

Anyway, I'd like to get some 50ish groups together to take him out. This will need the forces needed to take on a dragon, most likely, only without giants to kill along the way. If you'd like to come, email me at <a href="mailto:eldrad@tarewmarr.net">eldrad@tarewmarr.net</a> or find me in game.<p>

We'll do it this saturday (4/29) at 3 PM EST, meeting in the Field of Bone zone, at the ruined building right near the swamp zone (to the right when you enter the zone from the swamp).<p>

To get to the field of bone, I only know the way from the Fironia Vie outpost... From the outpost, find the bridge that leads off the island it's on, go off this bridge perfectly straight, run all the way to the end of the zone (sow and invis will help so the spider people don't see ya). At the end of the zone when you hit the mountain/cliff, turn left and follow the hill. Eventually the grass will turn icky and you'll know you're near the swamp. Just keep following the zone edge hill till you get there... In the swamp, keep LEFT following the zone edge hill. SOW and Invis will be needed as you'll be running past an entrance to Calibis. You'll know you're there when you see the stone tiled floor, don't go near the entrance just run past it, keeping left the whole way. I didn't run into any trouble at all. Just keep left the whole way in the swamp and you'll get to the field of bone. Approx running time from the outpost to the Field of Bone should be around 20 minutes total, with SOW on.<p>

I'd also like to humbily request that any of the big guild types, please don't kill this guy before us. Reason is, I'm planning the event and I'd hate to find out the hard way that he's a 1 week spawn or something :( You can come along if you want, whatever, but please let us have this first shot at taking down king kong :) Thanks in advance :)

                           for a crowd to gather, and iron Crown members will be 
                           there early to bind folk who need it. All participants 
                           must be drunken until they cannot consume anymore! Then 
                           they will be stripped of all their buffs by an Iron Crown 
                           member. After this they will begin boxing. Many bouts 
                           will be going on at once and all will be refed by Iron 
                           Crown members to ensure no cheating occurs. This is a 
                           "Monk style" Fight which means ABSOLUTELY NO WEAPONS 
                           allowed. Also during your fights our announcer/cordinator 
                           (Gdiyen) will shout MORE BEER! when you hear this you 
                           must again consume all the beer you can! Loot is allowed 
                           so only wear what you are prepared to lose. The winner 
                           of each bracket will recieve 2/3 of the entrance fee 
                           gathered. Also, if you are scheduled to fight someone 
                           outside your lvl limit ex 11 vs 16, you MUST accept the 
                           duel or lose, you will both be drunk and im sure your 
                           hand to hand skill isnt soo bad that there will be a 
                           distinct advantage. Here are the lvl brackets and entrance

                        this raid is mainly for those 18-21, we ask that any higher

                        too. We will meet in Nektulos near the Lavastorm Mtns. zone 
                        on Sunday, April 30th, at 5:30pm Central. There, we will 
                        organize into well-balanced groups,review the plan, and 
                        march through Lavastorm into Najena, have soem fun, get 
                        some exp, and make some cash :). Come on over and bring 
                        your friends, as we will probably need at least 12-18 people 
                        to do some serious damage. If you need help getting across 
                        Nektulos, or have any other questions, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:Legomanm@aol.com">Legomanm@aol.com</a> 
                        , or give me a tell in-game as Lerdar. It would also help 
                        a lot if you could RSVP with your lvl and class so we can 
                        get an appx. headcount. Thanks, and see you there!</font></blockquote>

                           will get whatever buffs he needs to survive 450 damage

                        difficulty levels and face a host of new creatures, such 
                        as dragonmen, sabertooth tigers, wyverns, Iksar skeletons, 
                        and more. The Kunark regions will also benefit from a higher 
                        polygon count, which will allow for greater detail in the

                           foul Iksar. These lizardmen once dominated all of Kunark, 
                           but were devastated in a war with the mighty dragons. 
                           As you explore Kunark, you'll see the shattered remains 
                           of the once-mighty civilization; ancient battlefields 
                           will display the scars of war, and you may even see the 
                           bones of the mythical dragons. &quot;</font>

                           great pleasure, I stand before you the citizens of Norrath, 
                           welcoming you to join us in the Second Annual Celebration 
                           of Light and Dark. The event will start on Sunday April 
                           30th, 2000 on the Fellowship's picnic grounds in the 
                           Lesser Feydark, just follow the wall of the Lesser Fey 
                           left to the first set of tents before the Nybright Sister's 
                           camp. The celebration's festivities will start at 4pm 
                           EST and after the festivities we will all embark for 
                           the lands of Kunark. After previewing the lands a few 
                           days before hand, we will decide where and how best to 
                           meet in Kunark (or travel there). </font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> We plan to have a language fair of languages 
                           including dragon and other archaic languages. We will 
                           also have a lotto of items for sale from various people 
                           in the guild. We will again have a duel to crown the 
                           Champion of Light and this year we will have a Champion 
                           of Dark, as well. Winners of each fight will be crowned 
                           and reign till next years festivities. Galarun won this 
                           title last year and has since retired the adventuring 
                           life. So it is with eager anticipation we await the crowning 
                           of a victor to reign till next year and have him/her 
                           try to retain their title at next year’s celebration. 
                           Fights are to the death or till the opponent yields. 
                           Honor and Chivalry are to be foremost in the minds of 
                           the Champions of Light. The Champion of Dark may use 
                           any means at their personal disposal to obtain their 
                           title. Of course, they must fight the Champion of Light 
                           for the title of Grand Champion of the Celebration of 
                           Light and Dark. </font>

                        stormed onto the gaming scene and became an instant force 
                        in the online RPG arena. For better or for worse, EverQuest 
                        is the standard for massively multiplayer role playing in 
                        persistent worlds. However, RPGs aren't all that Verant 
                        builds. Clint Worley, producer and designer on Verant's 
                        next big game, wants us to know that there are more worlds 
                        to explore than the world of EverQuest, and more genres 
                        of play than just role playing. We interviewed Worley about 
                        his upcoming project, a real-time strategy game that is 
                        played online. It's called Sovereign, a game that Worley 
                        hopes will be as big for online strategy gaming as Everquest 
                        was for role playing.&quot;</font></blockquote>

                     <blockquote><font size="-1">All was calm in Lesser Faydark 
                        Saturday when a cry shattered the peaceful afternoon, "The 
                        Gnomes are coming, The Gnomes are coming!" as nearly 30 
                        gnomes burst forth from the Steamfont zone, feet beating 
                        the ground as fast as their little legs could push them. 
                        Battles stalled, women screamed and Beasts of all kinds 
                        licked their chops as the small horde of Gnaked Gnome Racers 
                        streamed by. And so it went from zone to zone, continent 
                        to continent as the dwindling number of gnomes strove to 
                        reach the gates of Halas and prove that such a quest could 
                        be done. One by one and in groups the brave gnomes fell 
                        to beasts, raiders and orc, in the Commons, the Karanas 
                        and Everfrost as they struggled to reach their goal. </font>

                           to think that none would survive the ordeal, shouts of

                           of Everfrost. Of the 28 racers that started the race, 
                           only 7 made it to the Everfrost zone. Exactly 55 minutes 
                           after the start of the Antonica leg of the race, the 
                           first weary gnome staggered up the ramp to the Halas 
                           zone and finished. 22 minutes later the last of the 5 
                           finishers tagged the race official.</font>

                        <blockquote><font size="-1"><i>There is a great deal of 
                           personal taste involved when it comes down to choosing 
                           which MMORPG you wish to play. The best advice I could 
                           give any gamer would be to purchase each of them, play 
                           for the first free month and then choose which one best 
                           fits your style. However, not everyone gets evaluation 
                           copies of these games (I live a tough life), and not 
                           everyone has enough money to purchase every MMORPG that 
                           hits the market. So in an attempt to help you decide 
                           which game to spend your hard-earned cash on, let the 
                           Playdown begin.</i></font></blockquote>

                           bleed to death, as they WILL lose experience if this 
                           happens. This event is to vent anger, make (or most likely 
                           lose) money, and above all, have fun. We know that there 
                           are some of you out there that just want to enter this 
                           to kill your rivals, and we'll try to accommodate being 
                           able to fight against them. No promises however! Hopefully, 
                           this event will run without a hitch, and will indeed 
                           become a regular event on Povar.</font>

                           Why: Because we need them and we are giving out cash 
                           and prizes for them. Xps for lowlevels too!<br>
                           Who: Open to all! Guildies & nonguildies. Lvls 1-50.<br>
                           How: You kill clockworks. If you find a micro servo, 
                           you stay in the loot screen but DON'T LOOT. Give me a 
                           tell (Ceinwein) with your general location and coordinates. 
                           I run over, loot the micro servo, pay you 10pp (!), and 
                           randomly generate a prize for you. At the end of the 
                           event, I'll be giving out extra prizes for the people 
                           who found me the most micro servos. First prize is a

                           can be found in the newbie area near the druid ring. 
                           Watch out for the spiderlings ganging up. They can also 
                           be found near the dragon bones. Watch out for skeletons. 
                           The can occassionally be found on the path to Lower Faydark.</font>

                           the ridges north of the windmills. Watch out for kobolds 
                           and skellies.</font>

                        <p><font size="-1"> Different clockworks drop cash, blackboxes, 
                           blackbox fragments, cogs, and scrap metal. We are not 
                           interested in these. Either loot them to sell or destroy 
                           them. Clean up your corpses! It makes it easier to find 
                           you.</font>

                           you agree who gets credit for what kills. I have no problem 
                           with people splitting the cash rewards or trading prizes,etc.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> But I need to know who gets "credit"

                        <p><font size="-1"> I have alot of small prizes and try 
                           to make them appropriate to the winner. Not all of them 
                           are great. You could win everything from a torch to a 
                           thick leather apron to a piece of cured silk or bronze 
                           armour to forged weapons to bows and much much more. 
                           And that automatically 10pp doesn't suck either.</font>

                     <blockquote><font size="-1">Greetings! On Saturday April 8th 
                        at 4pm EST House Del`Tiroth, an evil guild on the Brell 
                        server, will be hosting a trade fair in East Commonlands 
                        at the Ro tunnel. The focus of this event will be the younger 
                        players of Norrath. Where most trade fairs feature thulian 
                        claws and oracle robes, our fair is to assist the lower-level 
                        players attain patchwork, banded, runed totem staves, skulls 
                        of Jhen'Tra, etc.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> Everyone is welcome to come to ply their 
                           trade, but only evil players will be attending the following 
                           tournament in Neriak. An open battle will be waged in 
                           the Warriors' Hall in the Neriak commons. Sober players 
                           will wage a free-for-all battle to win a prize to be 
                           announced at the fair, while a drunken brawl will take 
                           place afterwards for another prize.</font>
                        <p><font size="-1"> For those of you who are thinking, "But 
                           I don't have anything to sell!" fear not, you can gather 
                           bone chips and bat wings, as higher-level players would 
                           rather purchase them than chase after something they 
                           don't get experience for (but you might). And as any 
                           trade fair, language exchanges will surely take place. 
                           Since this is sponsored by an evil guild, you light-dwellers 
                           can learn Tier'Dal or Troll (if you don't get eaten).</font>
