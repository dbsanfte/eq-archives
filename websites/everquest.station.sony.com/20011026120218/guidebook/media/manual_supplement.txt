Introduction

Welcome to EverQuest!  You are about to enter a world ripe with adventure and intrigue.  Before you do, please familiarize yourself with the manual and the information contained in this supplement.  If you are new to EverQuest, or have just purchased one of the expansions (EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark or EverQuest: Scars of Velious), this supplement contains information that you may find vital on your adventures.

The PDF version of the manual at http://www.everquest.com and this supplement obsolete the files in your EverQuest directory labeled everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt.


DirectX 7.0a or Higher Required

EverQuest now requires that clients have DirectX 7.0a or higher installed.  

To determine what version of DirectX is currently installed on your system:

1. Click on start; 
2. Go up to the run box.
3. In the Run window, type DXDIAG than hit ok. This will launch the DirectX diagnostics tool. 

Your version of DirectX will be listed at the bottom of System Information.  Version 7.0a is listed as "DirectX 7.0 (4.07.00.0716)"

Please do the following prior to playing EverQuest.  It is very important that your drivers are installed in the order indicated to avoid potential problems:

1. Go to http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Update/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DX7Aeng.exe and install the latest DirectX drivers for your operating system.  

2. Go to the website for your 3D accelerator. There are a number of different manufacturers, and it is preferred that you visit the website for the manufacturer of your card.  You can, at your option, go to the chipset manufacturer site.  Most will be able to use either www.3dfx.com (for Voodoo cards) or www.nvidia.com (for TNT/GeForce cards).  Download and install the latest drivers for your card and operating system.  See our Video FAQ: (http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/index.jsp) for more details.

3. Go to the website for your sound card manufacturer and do the same.  If you do not know what brand of sound card you have, you can right-click on "My Computer", go to properties, click on "Device Manager", and open "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers".  If you use a SBLive sound card, you can run "LiveUpdate" from the Windows Control Panel off of your start menu.  View our Sound FAQ: (http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/general_audio_troubleshooting.jsp ) for driver locations and more details.

If you experience any issues of this type, please do the following:

1. Run DXDIAG.EXE from your Start menu (click start, run, then type dxdiag.exe)
2. Click the "Save all Information" button at the bottom of the program window.
3. Save the file as dxdiag.txt


Copy the contents of that file into the form at http://www.station.sony.com/services/everquest-technical.jhtml along with a complete description of your problem, any text from any error messages that are presented, and a phone number that you can be reached at if you are willing to assist our testing department over the phone.

Also, if you experience a crash to the desktop while running EverQuest, please email your dbg.txt file from your EverQuest directory to EQtech@station.sony.com.

Additional and New Information

This section contains information that is either new to the game or information that was not included in the manual.  It also contains some specific information on skills and abilities available to those who have purchased the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark upgrade or retail box, and/or the EverQuest: The Scars of Velious Expansion.

Sense and Disarm Traps

Bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps, have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some may have not trained sense or disarm traps due to them formerly being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill without training, once they have reached the appropriate level and have crossed a zone boundary.
These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only be detected and disarmed by rogues and bards.  
Use "Sense Traps" to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you can then use "Disarm Traps" to try to disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the trap will remain inactive for a short period of time while your group passes through the area.  
If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be directed towards the closest one.  

Corpse Dragging in Velious

Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence or risk.  As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse is considered "assisting the enemy" by the inhabitants of the area.  They will react accordingly.

Dragon Circles In Velious

Players in Velious will notice "Dragon Circles" in the Iceclad Ocean, the Great Divide, the Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar.  These dragon circles are teleport locations for the wizard and druid teleports into Velious.

They are however unlike other teleports.  In order for a wizard or druid to teleport you to the area, you must have in your inventory a "tooth" from the appropriate or "higher level" dragon circle.  These teeth are soulbound (they stick with you when you die) and spawn on the ground in the center of each circle with exception to the one in Iceclad.

The Tooth of the Great Divide will allow you to be teleported to the Great Divide.
The Tooth of the Wakening Lands will allow you to be teleported to the Wakening Lands AND the Great Divide.
The Tooth of Cobalt Scar will allow you to be teleported to Cobalt scar as well as the previous dragon circles.  
Again, you must have a tooth in your possession in order to be teleported to that location.  In other words, you must reach each location on foot before you can be teleported there.


User Interface

The User Interface features new options and screens that allow players to remain in the "Full Screen" video mode when playing the game, rather than switching to the lower resolution "Overlay" mode.  As a result, the additional windows superimposed on the full screen UI are greater in number and support additional options:

Positioning

Windows can now be moved to a location of your preference by clicking on the upper left-hand corner of each window, moving it to a location of your preference, and clicking again to set it into place.  This option is set on a "per-resolution" basis, so you can have different window positions for each resolution.

Scaling

The Chat and Spell-effect windows can be scaled in size by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the desired size, then clicking again to set the option. This option is set on a "per-resolution" basis, so you can have different window scaling for each resolution.

Enabling / Disabling Windows

Each window in full screen mode can be enabled or disabled for viewing by engaging the customizable hot-key combination for that feature and window.  The defaults are:

ALT - B: Buff/Spell Effects Window
ALT - P: Party (Group) Window
ALT - C: Chat Window
ALT - S: Spell Gem Window
ALT - H: Hotbox Window
ALT - T: Target Window
ALT - Y: Self-Status Window
ALT - M: Menu Window
ALT - L: Lock down window position

Experience Bar Enhancement

Players will notice a blue line in their experience bar in addition to the bars.  The blue line is a "macroview" of each bubble of experience.  The blue line will fill the entire experience bar for each bubble of experience earned.

Selecting, Buying and Selling Stacks

Holding down the Shift key while right-clicking a stack of items will place the entire stack of items onto your cursor.  Holding down the Control key while right clicking a stack of items will place a single item on your cursor.

When selling stacks of items to a vendor, the same is true.  After selecting the item to be sold, holding down the Shift key while right-clicking the Sell button will sell the entire stack of items to the vendor.  Holding down the Control key while right-clicking the Sell button will sell only a single item to the vendor.  Similarly, holding the Shift key while right-clicking the Purchase button will purchase an entire stack (20) of items from a vendor, if your character has the money needed.  Holding the Control key while right-clicking the Purchase button will allow your character to purchase a single item.


Same Resolution Looting, Trading, Inspection, and Inventory (Velious Only)

Previously, when looting, trading, or viewing inventory, the screen would switch to a lower resolution mode (that small UI in the center if you are at resolutions above 640x480).  Now, if you are in resolutions above 640x480, nearly all functions take place in the higher resolution mode.  Functions that currently do not take place in the higher resolution mode will do so in the near future.


EQCLIENT.INI

Your EverQuest directory now contains a file named EQCLIENT.INI.  This file contains custom settings for most user preferences within EverQuest.  The EQCLIENT.INI file is split up into several sections.  The following information is presented in the order it appears in the EQClient.ini file:


[Defaults]

This section contains general information regarding client setup:

Log=TRUE or FALSE

Sets the default state of chat logging to the log file for your character and server.  Setting this option to true would have the same effect as logging into the game and typing "/log on" at the beginning of every play session.

AttackOnAssist=TRUE or FALSE

Sets whether or not you want "autoattack" to be automatically turned on after issuing the /assist command in game.

ShowInspectMessage=TRUE or FALSE

Sets whether or not you want the "CharacterName is inspecting you" message to be displayed when you are inspected by another character.

RunMode=TRUE or FALSE

Sets whether or not you want to automatically "run" when you log into the game.

LoadArmor17 through LoadArmor23 = TRUE or FALSE	(Velious Only)  

Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with Velious into your video card's texture memory.  Players with older video cards may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you experiencing slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in areas with many textures.

By default, these are all set to "FALSE", as it is possible that those with lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all of the new armor files.  At your option, you can switch all or part of them to "TRUE" to see the new armor.  If you have problems with framerate or disk swapping, turn all or part of them back to "FALSE".

As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless you are.


ScreenMode=NORMAL or FULL

Sets the default screen mode for when you enter the game.
LockWindows=FALSE - This statement is the same as hitting Alt-L in game.  This allows windows to be rearranged with your cursor if FALSE and locked in place if set to TRUE.  You can very easily do this in game with using the Alt-L function to toggle the lock off/on.

HidePlayerWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-P function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your character name, hit point bar, mana bar and stamina bar will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-P.

HidePartyWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-G function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your group members hit point bar and names will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-G.

HideTargetWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-T function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows target's name and hit point bar will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-T.

HideSpellsWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-S function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your spells gems (to hit to cast spell with mouse) will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-S.

HideBuffWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-B function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your buff icons and icons of spells cast upon you will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-B.

HideHotboxWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-H function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that the six pages of hotkeys will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-H.

HideChatWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-C function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your chat text will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-C.

HideMainMenuWin=FALSE - This statement is the same as the Alt-M function in game.  If this statement is set to TRUE, than the window that shows your main menu window with your abilities, socials, combat abilities, etc., will not show up.  You can easily get it to show again in game by hitting Alt-M.

ChatLineSpacing=0 - This line controls the number of spaces between each line of text in your chat window.  Default is 0.  It is not suggested putting this value over 2, or it could be very difficult to read text as it scrolls by.

ShowDynamicLights=TRUE - Having this line set to TRUE enables the player to see special graphics due to light sources on your character such as torches, greater lightstones, in a new light so to speak.

ChatFontSize=[0-5] - This line controls the size of the text font in your chat window.  Default is 0.  When using full screen mode with higher resolutions, it is helpful to set this value to 2 or higher, depending on your taste, eyesight, and reading comprehension ability.

VideoMode=[0-4] - 0 is 640/480 resolution, 1 is 800/600.  2 is 1024/768.  3 is 1280/1024.  4 is 1600/1200.  Players need to have the Velious expansion in order to set this line to 3 or 4.

LastCharSel=[1-8] - This line controls which character is selected at the character select screen, so that whichever character you played last will be selected when you go to the character select screen the next time you play Everquest.

InvWinLabels=TRUE - This is a Velious only line that enables the labeling to show up when in the full screen inventory mode.

MousePointerSpeedMod=[0-3] - This is to allow faster movement across the screen by your mouse.  The higher the number, the faster the mouse scrolling will be.  Default is 0.  It is not suggested to set this to higher than 3, as it makes it difficult to accurately control the mouse movement.

TrackPlayers=TRUE/GROUP/FALSE - This line shows the current selection  (Default is TRUE) for showing players in tracking, not showing players, or only group members.  It is suggested to change this setting in game to change this value.

TrackSortType=[Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider] - This is a Ranger only ability and is best changed in game.  It changes the way that tracking is sorted, and how it shows up.

TrackFilterType=0 - This is another Ranger only line that is best changed in-game.  The command in game allows you to specify not showing certain conning creatures.  Default is 0.  Please refer to the section later in this manual dealing with all of the /commands to see the proper use of this in game.

InspectOthers=TRUE - This line set to TRUE allows you to inspect others.  If set to FALSE, you will not be able to right-click on their character to inspect.  The default value is TRUE.

ShowSpellEffects=[0-1] - 0=No, 1=Yes.  This line allows particle effects to be shown if it equals 1.  If this line equals 0, no particle effects will be seen in-game when someone casts a spell.

ServerFilter=[0-1] - 0=No, 1=Yes.  If this line is set to 1, than Server side filtering is occurring.  Default is 0.  If you are having problems with lag in a raid situation, or when many other players are in the same general area in Everquest, it is best to have this set to 1.

VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16/32 - This line reflects and controls the video mode while in Everquest.  Default is 16 bits.  It is suggested that most players keep this value at 16 as increasing to 32 can cause a decrease of performance.

UseD3DtextureCompression=FALSE - This line turns on/off texture compression.  If set to TRUE, it can add much time loading to the game between the server select and character select screens, but can also improve performance.



[TextColors]

The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. 

Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:

 1 - Say
 2 - Tell
 3 - Group
 4 - Guild
 5 - OOC
 6 - Auction
 7 - Shout
 8 - Emote
 9 - Spells (memorizing, scribing, casting, etc.)

15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)
16 - Disciplines or special abilities
17 - Unused at this time
18 - Default text and stuff you type

30 - Money splits
31 - Loot message
32 - Dice Roll (/random)
33 - Others spells
34 - Spell Failures (resists, fizzles, missing component, bad target, etc.)

[WindowsXXX]

Sections labeled in this fashion store the full screen window locations (per resolution) as set by you in game.  You should not edit this section manually.

[KeyMaps]

The KeyMaps section stores your keyboard customizations as set in game.  It is best for this to be edited in game.

[WindowColors]  (Velious Only)

This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode.  It can be set using the /wincolor command in game.


Social Scripting

EverQuest now supports a total of 120 configurable "socials" in game, as opposed to the previous 12.  Along with these additional socials, there have been several enhancements to your ability to develop custom emotes and sequences of commands:

Custom Animation Text

EverQuest has default text for all existing animations.  For instance, when typing /point, or /point with a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your character will execute the "point" animation and "CharacterName points at <target>" will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. 

You can now use the animation, but substitute your own text.  To do this you need to specify the "target" after the command as "say" followed by your custom text.  For instance, typing "/point say points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" will cause your character to execute the "point" animation and display "CharacterName points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it" to those nearby.

Emote Codes

When creating custom socials, you can now use a series of "%-codes" that expand into various pieces of information when the social is executed.
 
The %-codes are: 

%M - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet)
%T - Returns the current target.
%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).
%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).
%P - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).
%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).

For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:

/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.

...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."


Pauses in Social Batches

You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600 (600 = One minute), with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  

For example, a social consisting of:

/sit off
/cast 1
/pause 100
/sit on

...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.

Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.

For example:

/sit off
/pause 100,/cast 1
/sit on

...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  


Voice Recognition

EverQuest now supports SAPI 4.0 (Microsoft's Speech API) compliant voice recognition packages, such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking(r) 4.0.  

Activating Voice Recognition

1) You must already have a voice recognition engine, such as Dragon Naturally Speaking, installed on your system, and have the default user (this was "Unknown" for me) trained, etc.  You do NOT have to run the engine yourself, the game will do that for you.

2) Once in EQ, bring up the chat bar (hit enter) and type in "/voice". Make sure it gives you the message, "Voice Recognition will be *ON* the NEXT time you run the game..."  If it does, then quit all the way out of EverQuest like the message instructs you to do and re run it.

3) After you have done this, you should get a message in the chat box when you get back in letting you know that Voice Recognition is Enabled.  You must turn the Microphone	on though.  Typing in the /microphone command (/mic also works, perhaps even /mi) will toggle the microphone on/off.  Voice commands and dictation are ignored when the Mic is off, and the game starts up with the microphone off.


Other related typed commands:

/vrdelay <delay in milliseconds> - Allows the user to set how long EQ will Sleep in the main rendering loop in order to improve voice recognition response.  The higher the delay, the lower framerate will be, so it is recommended that the user start with "/vrdelay 1" and go up by one each time until they are happy with the voice recognition response time.  Use the lowest number that provides adequate response time.

Server Selection

Choosing a server is one of the first decisions you must make when you enter EverQuest.  Though it is true that many people who have friends in game will choose the server where their friends are, it is generally recommended that unconnected people choose the least populated server for play.  

There are also at least three special servers that new people will want to take care before choosing.  These are the PvP servers.  Each PvP server has a different theme and should you choose to play on one, the following information should be considered.

The Rallos Zek Server (PvP)

The Rallos Zek Server is the oldest PvP server in EverQuest.  On this server, everyone has the ability to attack each other subject to a 4 level limit.  For instance, a level 45 person may attack or be attacked by anyone from level 41 through 49.

In the event that you kill or are killed by another player on this server, the loot rules are "Coin + 1 item".  You may loot (or have looted from you) all coin on the corpse, plus an item.  Items in bags, in a melee slot (primary, secondary, ranged, or ammo), or item marked NODROP may not be looted.
.

The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers (PvP Teams, Coin Only)

The Vallon/Tallon Zek Servers is what we call PvP-Teams servers.  Only races on opposing teams may attack, kill, or loot each other.  The four teams are:

Dark Races - Comprised of Iksar, Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls
Short Races - Comprised of Dwarves, Halflings, and Gnomes.
Elven Races - Comprised of Half Elves, Wood Elves, and High Elves.
Human Races - Comprised of Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians.

Anyone on one team may engage in PvP combat with anyone on any of the other three teams subject to an 8 level limit. For instance, a level 42 person can attack or be attacked by anyone between level 34 and 50, assuming that they are on opposing teams.  

The loot rules on these servers differ from Rallos Zek.  Only coin may be looted from a fallen opponent.

The Sullon Zek Server (Deity based team PvP)

The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character. 

Sullon Zek rules: 
1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply. 
2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat, unless they stray from city and newbie zones. As soon as a character 'dings' into 6th level he or she will become PvP enabled. 
3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience. 
4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse. 
5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters. 
6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team. 
7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team. 
8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level. 
9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters. 
10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels. 
11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally'.
 12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves and wood elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town. 
13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any PvP server. 
14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team. 
15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones. 
16. 'Buff' spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule. 
17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward. 
Important Addition to the rules: 
18. Naked corpses WILL disappear when looted by a player character. If you are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse will disappear when it is looted. 
The 'Teams': 
The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare 
The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek
The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan. 

There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics. 
Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good. 
Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some ancient writings that opened up new avenues. 
We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon Corpse or something similar.

The Test Server

The Test Server is a server maintained for testing new ideas, spells, NPCs, zones and many other new concepts.  You can access the Test Server by running the testeverquest.exe file located in your EverQuest directory.

Because this is a functioning test server, you may find that you are downloading patches frequently from this server.  If you play on a standard server, you may also have to patch files from those servers to play there to replace files altered by the Test Server patch process.

If you plan to play on the Test Server, please read the following disclaimer.

Test Server Disclaimer

Playing on the Test server will give users an opportunity to experience changes firsthand before they are made available to the live world servers.  However, it should be noted that due to frequent changes and revisions, enhancements made to the Test server will not necessarily make it to the live servers.  Any quest-related bugs should be submitted via e-mail to eqtesting@verant.com.  In addition, the Test server has NO official Game Master support, therefore, if an item(s) is lost due to a bug, server outage, or any other reason, there will be NO reimbursement for the lost goods.  It should also be noted that due to the nature of testing, the Test server may be brought down at anytime, without notice.  Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity of the test platform.


Giving Another Consent to Drag Your Corpse

As mentioned in the manual, only you are allowed to loot your corpse, thus retrieving all of your items after death.  You can however give another person permission to "drag" your corpse. You can do this by typing "/consent" followed by the first name of the character that you wish to be able to drag your corpse.   Once consent is granted, you can also revoke it by repeating this operation.

Once consent is given, the target character will be able to move your corpse providing the character is near the corpse, has it targeted, and types the /corpse command.

The /Report Command

The /report command instructs your client to send authenticated data from your chat window to the EverQuest servers for logging.  The purpose of this command is to create a record of any text sent to you by another player that might be in violation of the EverQuest Rules of Conduct or the EverQuest license agreement.  The usage of this command in game is a little bit misleading.  The syntax of the command is "/report CharacterName", however the true function of the command sends the bottommost ten lines of your chat window.  To properly use this command, use shift-PgUp to scroll until the suspect text is in the chat window, then type "/report CharacterName".  You should then file a "/petition" (see EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark manual), explaining the fact that you have filed a /report, with a brief explanation of what the /report is meant to show.


Item Flags

When you inspect an item (right-click and hold on the item), there are often several different flags printed right below the name of the item:

MAGIC ITEM:  This means that the item is imbued with magic.  If this item is a weapon, it will have the ability to damage creatures that can only be harmed by magic.  

LORE:  This means that you may only have one of these items in your possession at any one time.  If you attempt to acquire another, you will not be able to pick the item up.  This will check your bank account.

NODROP:  This means that the item cannot be traded to another player nor sold to a merchant.  However, you can hand the item to an NPC, which is necessary for many quests.

NO RENT:  A no rent item will disappear from your inventory 30 minutes after logging out.

ARTIFACT: This means that the item is unique upon the server that you play, and that there will never be another one given out.  Artifacts are usually earned through participation in dynamic quests that occur in game regularly.  Artifacts however remain so rare that most people may never see one, much less own one, which is why they are called Artifacts of Great Power.

Item Size:  The size of any item will be listed (and for containers it will show what sized items it will hold).  This should make organizing your inventory a little easier.

A Deity's name: If a deity's name is listed upon the item, it means that only followers of that deity may equip the item or use its effects.  

Weight Reduction:  If a percentage for weight reduction is listed on a container, that container will reduce the weight of any item placed into it by that percentage while it is in the container.


Tail Rake

The "dragon punch" skill has been replaced by "Tail Rake" for Iksar characters.  



Melee Disciplines

In addition to the many automatic skills and abilities that characters will receive past 50th level, we've added player-controlled fighting "disciplines" to the repertoires of the pure melee (warriors, monks, and rogues) and hybrid (Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, and Bard) classes.  These disciplines are activated using the /discipline command on the command line, and have a duration and base reuse time associated with them.  You cannot use any other discipline until the reuse time of the last-used discipline has expired.  You can type /discipline on the command line to view the disciplines available to you, as well as the amount of time before you can use another one.

Some disciplines, particularly the ones with long duration, have a disadvantage in addition to the advantage provided by the discipline.  In all cases where this happens, the disadvantage is less severe than the advantage.  For instance, where the Evasive Discipline allows a warrior to be hit by his opponent less by a factor of 35%, the warrior will also hit his target less, but only by a factor of 15%.  In the interest of exploration, further formulae will not be provided.

APPENDIX A - Various Commands and Emotes

Below is a list of more command /command available within game.  You can get a complete list of all /commands available to you in game by typing /help [type] where "type" is "guild", "emotes", or "normal".  Type /help alone to return usage instructions.

When you see [ ] below, the text within those brackets are parameters for the command being described.  They are the options that you can choose when using that command.  They will be separated by commas when there is more than one.  Typing the command and then parameter (without the brackets) will give you the result described.  If you see [ON/OFF] then the command is a toggle.  That means that you do not need to type on or off, just typing the command will change the state of the toggle.  So if you are currently Anonymous and you type /anon, the command will toggle the state of your anonymous flag to OFF (since it was ON before).

[target] indicates that you must have a character targeted for the command to work.

Also, where you see < >, the information within the brackets is not a specific parameter, but is a kind of text that you will need to type.  For example if you see <character name>, then you will need to type in a character name as the parameter for the command, without the brackets.  If it just says <text>, then the nature of the text is up to you to determine (though the brackets are not needed).


/anon or /a [ON/OFF] - Makes you Anonymous in /who and /who all, preventing other players from seeing your class, level, and current location.

/afk [ON/OFF] <text> - When activated, all private tells sent to the user will auto-respond with the following text, "You told <players name>, 'Sorry, I am A.F.K. (Away from keyboard) right now.'".  If you add <text> then that text will replace the default AFK message.

/assist [target] or <character name> - if you target a character that is within 200', the /assist command will automatically target for you whoever that character has targeted at the moment- this can be very useful in heavy combat.  To be most effective, it is best to set this as a Social (see IV.F above)

/assist [ON/OFF] - Toggles the autoattack function associated with the /assist function.  The default of ON turns on your autoattack when you use /assist.  If you type /assist off then autoattack will not start when you use /assist.  This is one case where you must use the parameters on and off for this to work.

/attack [ON/OFF] - Toggles in and out of attack mode.  This will put you in attack mode even if nothing is targeted.  Be careful not to use this when near NPC's that you have targeted.  By default, this is set to the "a" key.  Care should also be taken when you are near an NPC that you have targeted not to hit the "a" key, as this may cause you to attack the NPC.

/auction <text> - Allows users to send auction messages throughout the current zone.  Please use this channel only for auctions.

/autosplit [ON/OFF] - automatically splits any loot you get with the rest of your party.  Each member must do this to split all loot.

/book [1-50] - Opens your spell book to the specified page.

/bug or /b - takes you to a bug-reporting screen

/camp [desktop/server] - Allows the player to exit to the server select screen or desktop depending on what is specified.  You can use just /camp by itself as well.  You must be sitting in order for this command to work.  If attacked while camping out, the /camp command will be cancelled, thus preventing exit from the game.

/cast [1-8] - causes your character to cast the spell in the specified memorization slot.

/channel [gsay/ooc/shout/guild/auction] - toggles the chat channels on or off.

/chatfontsize [0-5] - This is for Velious subscribers only.  It is used in full screen mode only to change the chat font size.

/consent <character name> - gives the character permission to drag your corpse

/consider or /con - gives vital statistics of a targeted PC or NPC

/corpse [target] - will summon the target's corpse if it is within a 50' radius of the character.  You can either target the character or the character's corpse.  This will only work if the targeted character has used the /consent command on the character trying to use the /corpse command.  If no target is selected when the /corpse command is used, it will summon your own character's corpse if it is within 50' of the character.

/decline - Declines a duel.

/disband [target] - Allows a character to disband from a group if he/she has themselves targeted.  This command also allows the group leader to disband a targeted member of the group if they are in the same zone.

/doability [1-6|7-10] - 1-6 performs the associated ability from the "abilities" page, 7-10 perform the associated combat skill.

/duel or /d - challenges targeted PC to a duel - to accept, they have to type /d with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one combatant "dies" (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone.  Until the duel is resolved, the two combatants can't be affected by spells from PCs not in the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel.

/dynamiclights [ON/OFF] - When on, this command enables players to see specially rendered lighting.  This command is most useful when the player is holding, or has a light source with them, such as a torch.  Turn this command to off if you notice low frame rate. 

/em <text> or : <text> - emotes the text.  Some emotes have animations associated with them, most do not. Predefined emotes are listed below.

/exit -  This command is the same as /quit and should not be used by players unless to escape from a death bind loop.

/fastdrop [ON/OFF/NEVER] - Disables or enables the ability to drop items on the ground without a confirmation box. The recommended setting for this option is the same as the default setting, which is /fastdrop off.  If set to never, you will never be able to drop any items on the ground.  If set to on, no confirmation box will come up before dropping the item on the ground.  Caution is advised as many  NPC's (Non player characters such as merchants) do pick up items dropped on the ground by players.

/feedback - takes you to the feedback/comments screen.

/filter [ON/OFF]- Toggles the profanity filter on and off.

/follow [target] - When this command is used while targeting another player, the user will automatically follow the targeted character.

/friend <character name> - adds or removes a 'friend' from your friends list.  /friend <character name> will add the player to your list, and /friend <character name> again, for the same character, will remove him/her.  /friend by itself will list the players in your friends list.  A /who friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is in the zone you are in, and a /who all friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is on the server you are on.  Your friends list can only contain 30 names per character.  And be aware that in order to remove someone from the list, you must type their name precisely.

/gems - This command allows a player to play the game Gems.

/gsay <text> or /g <text> - text is seen by all in your group


Guild Commands:

/guildsay <text> or /gu <text> - Sends a text message to all fellow guild members currently on-line.

/guildinvite [target] - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this command to invite new guild members.  In order to make an officer, the guild leader must use the following command:  /guildinvite o <playername>.  You can also just have the player targetted and type /guildinvite o.  You must be in the same zone as the player you want to invite into the guild. The letter o must be lower cased.  If the player you want to make an officer is currently in the guild, they will have to /guildremove themselves (with themselves targetted) , in order to be made an officer through this command.

/guildremove [target] - Guild Leaders and Officers may use this command to remove guild members.  Keep in mind that if you target yourself when executing this command, you will remove yourself from the guild.

/guilddelete - Guild Leaders may use this command to disband a their guild.

/guildstatus [target] or <character name> - Will return the guild status of the targeted or named character (their rank within their guild, if any).  This command will only work on characters within the same zone.

/guildleader [target] - Transfers guild leadership status to the targeted guild officer..

/guildwar <guild leader name> <number> - Allows the guild leader to challenge or accept another guild in guild war.  Both parameters are necessary, and both guild leaders must execute the command.  The number is the number of days that the guild war will last, from 1 to 14.  All members of a guild at war with another guild are PvP with each other for the duration of the guild war.

/guildpeace <guild leader name>- Allows the guild leader to end a guild war.  Both guild leaders must execute this command to end the war.  Guild war will end in any case after the time limit has passed.

/guildmotd <text> -  Officers of a guilds can specify the text to show up after the regular server MOTD (Message of the Day) for each of their guild members when they log in.  The guild message of the day will always be preceded by the name of the guild officer that set it up.  There is a maximum of around 200 characters for this guild motd.  Any new guild message of the day overwrites the last guild message of the day.  When a server goes down, all guild messages of the day will be deleted and will need to be reset.  There is no other way to delete a guild message of the day.


/help [emote/guild/normal] - Shows the player all of the commands available in area specified.

/hidecorpses [all/none/allbutgroup] - This command allows the player to choose to not see other player's corpses in-game.  This allows for less lag in situations where there are many corpses around.  Keep in mind that the all and the allbutgroup options will hide NPC corpses.  Your own corpse is never hidden.  The default is none.

/ignore <player name> - Will block all text from that character.

/inspect [ON/OFF] - Toggles on and off your ability to inspect others with a right-click of the mouse.  Use this toggle if you use the mouse for movement and find yourself accidentally inspecting others.

/location or /loc - Displays the characters current location coordinates within the zone. The location will show as x, y, z.

/loot - Allows the character to loot a corpse from a short distance. The corpse must be targeted when performing this command.  You can achieve the same result by right clicking on a corpse.

/lootnodrop [ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/NEVER] - This command is used to specify how you loot no drop items on corpses.  Always is default and will cause a prompt box to always be shown when looting no drop items.  Set to sometimes so only items not usable by your character will show a prompt box.  When you have this set to never, you will never get a confirmation box to see if you want to loot or not. 

/mcicontrol - Allows a player to control sound devices such as cdaudio or mp3s to play when in-game.  This command will be further developed in the future to be more user friendly.  Until that point, the following are some commands you can use to play audio CD's:
Before using any other of these commands, use the following to open up communications:
/mcicontrol open cdaudio 
To play:
/mcicontrol play cdaudio 
To pause:
/mcicontrol pause cdaudio 
To stop:
/mcicontrol stop cdaudio 
To skip forward:
/mcicontrol step cdaudio 
To skip back:
/mcicontrol back cdaudio 
To eject the CD:
/mcicontrol eject cdaudio 
Note:  Though ejecting itself should not cause any gameplay problems, putting in a new disk may. 
If you have AutoPlay enabled on your computer (which is windows default), it may start your CDaudio program and possibly, switch out of EverQuest, causing EverQuest to likely crash, or at the least may cause a phantom cursor to appear. 
If you have AutoPlay disabled, putting in a disk should not cause any problems.

/mousespeed [0-3] - Changes the mouse travel speed across the monitor.  3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse moves).  Don't set this above 3.  Your mouse will move too quickly and you will probably not be able to play.

/msg - This is the same as using /Tell.

/note <text> - Allows the player to write notes when in-game to be referenced later out of game.  This creates a notes.txt file of the text.  Each line of text sent using /note is appended to the end of this file.  There is a maximum number of 455 characters when creating a note.

/ooc <text> - allows you to say something as yourself, not as your character, heard throughout the zone.  Please only use this channel for out of character speech, and please try to limit your out of character speech to this channel.

/pet [command] - gives orders to a charmed or summoned pet.  Sample pet commands:

/pet guard here - tells the pet to guard its current location.

/pet guard me - tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks it's master, or that it's master attacks.

/pet follow me - tells the pet to follow you, but ends when you cross a zone line.

/pet attack [target] - tells the pet to attack the designated target.

/pet back off - tells the pet to stop its attack.

/pet as you were - returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.

/pet get lost - will send the pet back to where it came from.

/pet report health - Reports the health of your pet in percentages.

/petition <text> - Used to request assistance from a GM.  The more detailed <text> is, the quicker the assistance can be rendered.  To prevent 'spamming' of the petition queue, each character can only send in one petition (for as long as that petition is in the queue).

/played - Returns the birth date and hours played for the current character.

/quit - Immediately exits the game.  However, when you exit in this manner, your character has not 'camped out' in the proper fashion, and he or she will remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit.  Your character will be under the control of the server, and may very well die while you are not there to tell it what to do.  So only use this command when you are in a rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you can't get out of with the standard sit and camp method.  The risk you take when using this shortcut to exit the game is all yours.

/random [x, x y] - /random x generates a random number between 0 and x.  /random x y will generate a random number between x and y.  This can be used to decide things randomly, for instance, who gets a recently acquired treasure.

/reply <text> - If a "/tell" is received, the user may respond by using this command.  /reply will reply to the very last person to send you a /tell.

/report <character name> -  Allows a player to report the text that is currently being displayed in the chat window.  If you are reporting harassment, bad language, threats, or other actions by another player, use their character name for the <character name> in the report.  If you are reporting falling for 10,000 points damage, or other irregularities that affect your character, then use your character's name.  You should then use /petition and let a GM know that you have used /report so that they will know to look for your reported text.  To prevent 'spamming', you can only send one report at a time.  You can do another /report only after zoning.  Please make sure to have the text you want to report in the chat window when you use this command, /report will only send the bottom ten lines of text that are actually shown in your chat window.  Use Shift-Page Up and Shift-Page Down to move through your chat text until you see the text you want to report.

/resetwindows -  Used to reset to default the locations on-screen for the different Graphical User Interface (GUI) boxes.

/reverb [ON/OFF] - Toggles the reverb (echo) sounds on or off.

/reversesound -  This command will reverse the left and right channel for your sound.

/roleplay [ON/OFF] - Hides your race, class, and location while still displaying your guild tag, and turns your name purple to indicate that you prefer to remain "in-character".

/serverfilter [ON/OFF] - Allows player to turn off or on packet messages from other players, allowing for less lag in raid situations.

/shout <text> - Shouted text is seen across entire zone.  Shout is an 'in-character' channel, so please keep your speech in this channel in character.

/shownames [ON/OFF] - turns on or off visible names above PC's and NPC's heads.

/showspelleffects [ON/OFF] - Toggles spell effects (visuals) on or off.

/sit [ON/OFF] - Causes your character to sit or stand.

/split # # # # - splits a defined amount of money with your group members in the same zone: platinum, gold, silver, & copper respectively...i.e. /split 4 4 2 0 splits 4 plat, 4 gold, 2 silver, and 0 copper with the rest of the group.  For example, /split 4 will only split 4 platinum with your group members.  /split 0 0 0 200 will split 200 copper pieces with your group.

/stopsong -  Bards can use this command in hotkeys to stop singing their songs.

/surname <last name> - Players with a character level 20 or over may use this command to assign a last name to their character.  Once you have chosen a last name you will not be able to change it, so make certain that you choose a name that you like, and make certain that the name meets the requirements for our naming policy (see www.everquest.com for more details).

/tell <character name> - The text is seen by the named character anywhere in the game.

/time - gives you the time of day in Norrath and your local time (based on the clock on your computer).

/trackfilter (Ranger only)[Red/Yellow/White/Blue/Green] - Specify here what NPC /con colors you do not want to see in your tracking display.  For example, /trackfilter Red will remove all 'red' (dangerous) NPCs from your tracking display.

/trackplayers [ON/OFF] - Allows those with the tracking skill to indicate whether or not they want player characters to show up in their tracking list.

/tracksort - (Ranger Only) [Normal/Distance/Consider/Rdistance/Rconsider] - This is used by Rangers to control how their tracking display sorts targets.  Normal is by how long they have been in the zone (oldest NPCs first), Distance will put the closest NPC on top of the tracking list, Consider will put the highest level NPCs on top, Rdistance will  have the closest NPC listed last, Rconsider has the tracking list from low level on top to high level below.  

/usercolor [Chat Type] Rvalue Gvalue Bvalue. - For example, For Guild chat to be yellow, you would type /usercolor 3 0 255 255.  This is the same as editing the TextColor portion of your Eqclient.ini file, and the list of Chat Type numbers can be found in that section of this manual.

/vrdelay [1- 5 ] - This command is used to specify the delay time for responses when using voice recognition software.

/who - lists all player characters in your zone.

/who corpse - lists all the corpses your character has in the current zone.

/who all - lists all player characters in the world.

Note: /who and /who all are also usable with masks to look for certain characters, races or classes online.  For example:

/who wiz all - generates a list of all Wizards online in all zones.

/who 1 5 all - generates a list of all characters online who are between levels 1 and 5.

/who fip all - generates a list of all characters whose names begin with Fip.

/who gm all - generates a list of all the GM's that are online and not hidden.

/who all friend - generates a list of the players in your friends list who are online (see the /friend command).

/whotarget - Does a "/who" on the player character targeted.

/wincolor -  This command allows players with the Velious expansion or later, to change the color and transparency of the background for all of the window boxes for the updated user interface. 
 Format: /wincolor <window name> <red> <green> <blue> <trans>
<window name> -> CHAT, SPELL, PLAYER, PARTY, TARGET, BUFF, DATA, MAIN, INV, TRACK, or HOTBOX
<red> <green> <blue> -> 0 to 255
<trans> -> 0 = off, 1 = 25, 2 = 50, 3 = 75, 4 = 100 percent
To reset a window color use /wincolor <window name> reset

/yell - will issue a "cry for help" to all players within a 100 foot radius.  Characters hearing the yell will be told what general direction the yelling is coming from.

APPENDIX B - Errata for the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Manual


EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark was released with a new printed manual, which is also available for download on the main EverQuest site at www.everquest.com.  As with any static printed material associated with dynamic games such as EverQuest, information has a potential to be outdated.

In addition to some obsolete information included in the manual, there were also several inaccuracies. These are listed below.  Please refer to your printed or downloaded manual so that the comments may be taken in context.


Player Corpse Decay Times

p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based upon level and login status.  The times provided are incorrect. The player-corpse decay times are as follows.  Please note that all times are in real time, not game time:

Level 1 - 5:	30 minutes
Level 6+: 	24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.

*Note:  Empty corpses that are level 30 or above characters will remain in game for 3 hours.  It is best advised to get your corpse right away.  If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game.  Also, be advised that your corpse decay is still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account.  

Character Creation

p.24: The starting city for the Iksar is listed as New Sebilis.  It should be noted that New Sebilis is also known as Cabilis.


Sitting and Camping

p.34: The "Jargon Note" makes reference to player-killers lingering around another player-killers regeneration point (bind point, where they return after death) in order to attack them again.  It should be noted that this tactic (called "Bind Point Camping") is considered un-sportsmanlike conduct in Player-versus-Player combat, and is against the rules.


Safe vs. Dangerous Locations

p.35: Section should read:

As a new player, stick to the cities - they're relatively free of monsters, and other players can't kill you.  (You have to become a player-killer, or PK, to give other player-killers "permission" to attack you.  You do this by giving a Priest of Discord the Child of Discord book in your inventory.)  If someone attacks you in the city, regardless of your PK status, numerous guards may immediately come to the rescue, providing that they are fond of you.  Beware though, if the guards are fond of your attacker, and are not fond of you, they may choose to assist your enemy.

*Note: Changes to the original text are in bold text.


"Feeling Out" Strangers

p.40:  It is stated that you cannot "consider" a merchant.  You can, but you must use the "Consider" key ("C" by default) or type /consider on the command line.


Skills and Combat: Skills

p.49: The next-to-last paragraph on this page reads, "You can have anywhere from 0 to 100 points in any skill, and it takes 10 skill points to get each next higher skill ranking".  This section is incorrect.  This section should read:

Skill values start at 0 and go up from there.  The maximum value of any skill is 250, however the maximum that you will be able to obtain is dependent upon your level, race, and class.  Upon reaching a skill level of 100 in any skill, you are considered a master of that skill.  Though you will continue to gain skill points as you use the skill, the highest that will be reflected on the skill page is "Master".

If your skill is over 100 you will also be shown the numeric value of your skill.


p.52: The "Tiger Claw" skill is listed under "Other Skills".  It should be listed under "Combat Skills" on p.51.


Party Experience

p.54:  This should specify that additional experience is granted with every kill based upon the number of people in your group.


Before You Attack

p.56: The bottom of this page references text color associated with "Considering" your target.  The procession of text colors listed is: Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Red.  The correct procession is: Green, Blue, White/Black (depending on video mode), Yellow, Red.  The listed descriptions apply in that order.


Right Hand vs. Left Hand

p.58:  This section makes several references to separate "auto-attack" keys for the right and left hands.  These functions were merged prior to the release of EverQuest, and are now controlled by a single auto-attack button (the "A" key by default).  


PvP: Fighting Other Players

p.67: The second bullet-point makes reference to the "Child of Order".  The correct name for the item is the "Tome of Order and Discord".

p.67:  The last line reads, "If you attack another player in the city, the guards immediately attack and kill you."  Please refer to the correction for p.35 above for the correct information.


Reclaiming Items

p.69: This section states that you can give someone permission to loot your corpse by typing /loot followed by the player's name.  The command given is incorrect.  The actual command is /consent.  Please read the section about /consent above so that you may be aware of the possible dangers associated with it.


Participating in Parties

p.76:  It is stated that, "Only people of similar experience levels can join a party.  A level 11 of 9 character can join a 10th level adventurer's party, but a level 30 player can't - even if everyone agrees to it."  This information is incorrect.  Any player can group with any other, however the amount of experience received while adventuring is associated to the level spread of the party members.  As a general rule, you will receive the most experience from a group that has the ability to accomplish the task at hand, but is not overpowered to the point that encounters are no longer challenging.  


Guild Halls

p.78: "Some of the larger player-created guilds may purchase halls as well".  This information is incorrect.  Players may not purchase guild halls, houses, etc., in EverQuest.


Contacting a Game Master

p.94: The bottom of this page makes reference to the commands of "/who Guides" and "/who GM-Admins all".  Neither of these commands exist.  You should use "/who gm all" to get a list of all visible GMs and Guides in game.  Furthermore, the description of a Guide is incorrect.  A Guide is a volunteer CS representative that serves as the first line of support for customers in game.  They can assist with most issues, however will not be able to give you hints or other information that is meant to be discovered in game.
