<p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">From 
  the Dawn of Time to the Present Day: The History of Norrath</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is said that outside 
  of space and time an entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this 
  being created all that there is and was and will be. It is also written in ancient 
  texts that from His mind sprang not only the universe and its countless suns 
  and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient, powerful, yet finite creatures whom 
  one such as a man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a god.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In aeons past came one of 
  these gods upon the world Norrath. Veeshan, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of 
  the Plane of Sky, found this world pleasing and deposited her brood onto the 
  frozen continent of Velious. With one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened 
  several great wounds upon the surface of Norrath, staking her claim to this 
  promising new world. Dragons then walked the land and flew the skies, powerful 
  beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength. Thus began the Age of Scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In time the other gods noticed 
  Veeshan's work, and being often petty and jealous beings, they too came upon 
  Norrath, intent upon leaving their mark. Brell Serilis was first, and from his 
  Plane of Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and endless tunnels, he quietly 
  created a magical portal to a cavern deep in the belly of Norrath. Through this 
  portal the Duke of Underfoot seeded the depths of Norrath with all manner of 
  creatures. Brell then returned home, sealing his portal within a labyrinthine 
  chamber of mystical Living Stone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And when the other gods 
  came to Norrath, Brell Serilis approached each of them, and after some time 
  convinced them to meet as one to discuss the fate of the world. The Great Mother 
  Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord were in attendance, and Rallos Zek, the warlord, 
  was also there, yet in mistrust kept his distance. Brell, carefully avoiding 
  all queries as to the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery 
  of the new and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood. 
  Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips and he proposed 
  that they accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos Zek agreed, 
  ignorant of the fact that Brell had already released some of his creations into 
  the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would be called Norrath was 
  divvied up between these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen 
  in check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep 
  a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the 
  planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains 
  of Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the oceans Prexus left his children, the 
  Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina. And on the surface 
  of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and beauty, 
  and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce and formidable beings, intent upon the defense 
  of their lands. Thus began the Elder Age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was inevitable that such 
  energies involved in seeding planets with life would attract even more of the 
  gods, and it was the Elves who drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince 
  of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane 
  over which he ruled, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it 
  was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their 
  pact and vowed to make them regret such disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' 
  fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King 
  and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically 
  and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then gathered the quivering 
  remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic 
  image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, 
  as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot 
  of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane 
  and Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath, and Brell met them, concocting a second 
  pact with these latter gods, wishing another excuse to create more peoples into 
  the world. Rallos Zek again watched from afar, determined to add to his creation 
  as well, and this time Brell convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring 
  him that it was indeed an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. Deep in the 
  earth did Brell return to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves to some extent, 
  yet more wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with devices more so than 
  their cousins. On the surface, away from Elves and Giants, Bristlebane made 
  the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile and with a propensity to meddle 
  and even pilfer at times. Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps 
  and jungles of Norrath and there created the green skinned Trolls and reptilian 
  Lizard Men. And Rallos Zek returned to the surface, pleased with his sanction 
  to create even more peoples for his army. He made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable 
  beings of questionable intelligence, and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded 
  in their desire for conquest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By this time, those who 
  are now known as the elder races of Norrath had begun to expand and mature. 
  Villages became cities, and cities became kingdoms. Several of the races became 
  bent on expansion and warfare became part of their developing cultures. And 
  of all the races, it was the Ogres who quickly proved the most interested in 
  battle and plunder, and their empire grew outward from their mountain home until 
  it eventually encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents. 
  Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became weary of 
  only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and dimensions, invaded 
  the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged 
  the gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself 
  led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the 
  greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted 
  and forced back to his domain, after which a great barrier to the Planes of 
  Power was erected, denying entry to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. 
  And then, in what some view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the 
  Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed 
  around them. The Giants were spread from one end of the earth to the other, 
  forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and ice to their previously 
  lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed, but no writings remain of their 
  punishment as they no longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps 
  some indication as to the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the dust settled, the 
  last of the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi 
  Marr, goddess of Love, created the Barbarians, a hardy race who settled the 
  cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being the youngest 
  race, they were generally unwashed and rugged, possessing very few social graces. 
  And while they too had a warlike culture, there were those amongst them who 
  began to believe in something more. By this time the other civilizations of 
  Norrath had either long since declined, or were well on their way, and this 
  small minority of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others 
  had failed. Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or 
  perhaps it was only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out across the lands, 
  warring with both each other and any other race encountered, this tiny movement 
  continued to grow. And so even amidst desolation and war, there was hope. Thus 
  began the Age of Blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last of the old races 
  to decline was the empire of the Elves. The Elddar Forest spread across the 
  entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and villages built high into 
  the trees housed thousands of Wood Elves, and the marble cities of the High 
  Elves were built in the forest's clearings and meadows, their white towers and 
  spires climbing out of the forest, higher than the tallest tree. But then came 
  the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of 
  the serpent mountains, bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. 
  The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids 
  fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the change, they 
  could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and eventually 
  even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving 
  much of their greatness behind. Thus began the Lost Age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This next period of Norrathean 
  history as it relates to many of the races is the least known. It is surmised 
  by the more knowledgeable historians that while the elder races regrouped and 
  reestablished themselves, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed 
  both physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the last major and 
  direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the reason so little is known 
  about this period is that the gods wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that 
  they would have less to do with their creations. In any case, this small and 
  enlightened group were the fathers of the Human race, and they rapidly gained 
  a foothold throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. The Combine 
  Empire, as this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout the known world, 
  but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown. 
  And while they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath and their relics 
  and ruins still litter the lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of this 
  period remains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the fall of the Combine 
  Empire, the remnants of mankind dwelled mostly in the center of Tunaria, inhabiting 
  primarily the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, 
  several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities. To the west 
  a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, founded 
  Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. Freeport, to the east, became an active 
  and dangerous port of call for all who dared to venture into the Ocean of Tears. 
  Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from afar, remained 
  strong, even daring to rename their home after one of their own instead of one 
  of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would forever more be known as Antonica. 
  This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Competition was fierce, 
  and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups abandoned 
  the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out 
  against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold 
  north. Others reminded them of their former glory and the might of the Combine 
  Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals 
  to which all had agreed. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales 
  of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient 
  abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and 
  the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, 
  they became both jealous and determined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A small, frail man of great 
  intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They 
  quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small 
  network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of 
  Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed 
  upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited 
  and quite appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city 
  of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for 
  it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it 
  the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed 
  reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by 
  their spies. The first human mages since the Combine Empire were born – wizards, 
  sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely 
  in both power and knowledge. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It came to pass some years 
  later that a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of Necromancy. 
  They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several 
  hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely 
  dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. 
  But there was one very significant difference – they did not use swords and 
  bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were 
  lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics 
  were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. 
  In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense hole 
  leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this 
  chasm the heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. And while 
  both sides still seethed with anger and hatred towards one another, their fear 
  of what the last battle had wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus 
  began the Age of Turmoil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is in this age you find 
  yourself, an age filled with wonder. The elder races have begun to reclaim their 
  former glory. The younger races have matured, and an active economy stretches 
  across Odus, Antonica, and Faydwer. And while conflict and battle is hardly 
  rare, it has also been centuries since open war has plagued the lands. A myriad 
  of alliances and factions exist, friend and foe plot and scheme, and the world 
  of Norrath is ripe for action. Equip yourself for adventure, seek allies and 
  knowledge, and head out into a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, even 
  planes and realities beyond your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, 
  acquire treasure and equipment, meet friends and encounter enemies. And whether 
  you assume the role of a noble human knight, a vicious dark elf thief, a greedy 
  dwarven merchant, or whatever suits your desire, remember one thing:</font></p>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>You're

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>The 
  Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul</strong></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <font size="1">as told by Aradune Mithara, sometimes historian, more often Ranger 
  Lord, Outrider of Karana </font></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Over three thousand years 
  in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, 
  spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages 
  appeared and prospered, several reaching the size of towns, and two even became 
  cities -- Qeynos to the west, and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the 
  disdain of the elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained 
  a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is not to imply, however, 
  that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups formed, some linked by similar 
  appearances, others by common goals. Competition was fierce, and when resources 
  grew scarce for one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises and 
  alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, 
  urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken 
  away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of peace, 
  and these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals 
  to which all had agreed. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Their cry was not totally 
  ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged to trade with one 
  another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An economy based largely 
  on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded by 
  large farms. Most of humanity&#146;s leaders were pleased with this, wanting 
  nothing more than peace and food on every man&#146;s table after a hard day 
  of work. A few, however, wanted more. Even though their people had risen well 
  beyond the standard of living endured by their barbarian brothers to the north, 
  they were not content. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales 
  of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient 
  abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and 
  the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this,

  Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, 
  and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered 
  and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought 
  to them by their spies. The first human mages were then born &#150; wizards, 
  sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely 
  in both power and knowledge. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the more adept practitioners 
  of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme than the others, he not 
  only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew 
  to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. 
  They created schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning 
  themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found 
  this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one 
  school of thought or another. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He soon found others who 
  felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of outcasts who often studied 
  forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority 
  of students. The council was morally and ethically opposed to much of the information 
  gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied 
  the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and 
  a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was 
  called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts 
  describing this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created 
  for himself four identities, four separate countenances and names, and joined 
  all four schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that 
  matter. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It came to pass some years 
  later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know all there was to 
  know, both in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of 
  Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first 
  time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil 
  war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back 
  on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference &#150; they did 
  not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives 
  by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually 
  the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern 
  regions of Odus. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Miragul, being a member 
  of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. 
  He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity 
  and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to 
  buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal 
  and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city 
  of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also 
  filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled 
  again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the 
  barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake called 
  Winter&#146;s Deep and he hid there for some time. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> While Miragul waited in 
  secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every 
  letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his 
  understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even 
  more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began 
  to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His 
  power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again 
  he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands 
  of men. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Not far to the south of 
  where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of the new races, 
  the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people 
  and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both 
  size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther north, 
  and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond 
  the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a 
  vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred 
  to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to 
  Miragul&#146;s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and 
  the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence 
  forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. 
  He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when 
  absolutely necessary.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Under the icy ground of 
  the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which 
  to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to 
  remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did 
  create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score 
  out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them 
  to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of 
  several laboratories he had created. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many years passed, even 
  centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend his life 
  using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to 
  aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect 
  of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect wrought 
  him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#146;s 
  time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. 
  He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the 
  Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse 
  these planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving 
  him, and his journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. 
  More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter 
  of death haunted him daily. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The mage&#146;s research 
  into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow 
  outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became 
  Miragul&#146;s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create 
  portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere 
  seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the 
  other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat 
  death. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mage soon found that 
  the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole that led to unknown 
  depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge 
  civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, 
  though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned 
  its inhabitant&#146;s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while 
  a select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, 
  power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability 
  to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their 
  master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, 
  to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in 
  centuries past. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One important aspect of 
  their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. 
  Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover 
  a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic&#146;s goals, learning 
  spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, 
  however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small 
  home he was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had 
  sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the 
  undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, 
  his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make 
  war once again. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Miragul then left Paineel, 
  using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to 
  his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently 
  to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the 
  while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate 
  experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul 
  hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he 
  had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered 
  and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead 
  mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In his haste, however, 
  Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical 
  power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#146;s soul, now locked 
  within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire 
  to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human 
  traits, and Miragul&#146;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began 
  to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled 
  with artifacts of power. </font>
