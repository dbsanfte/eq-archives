<p><strong>CHAPTER 11 - TWO WEEKS</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Nic, hurry, hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You lazy bum, you&#8217;ll never reach us!&#8221;</p>
<p> What these guys can think about... Well, all of us, in fact. But the thing 
  is I didn&#8217;t know there was gonna be a paddle boat race, and now I was 
  taking part in one of them.</p>
<p> &#8220;Watch out, it&#8217;s gonna crash!&#8221;, I yelled, beside Nic. Then 
  I gripped the sides of the boat, so I wouldn&#8217;t fall into the water.</p>
<p> &#8220;Sorry, our fault!&#8221;, he yelled, laughing, to the boy in the other 
  paddle boat, who didn&#8217;t understand why we were faster than what was normal.</p>
<p> &#8220;We&#8217;re almost there... almost...&#8221;, I was laughing. Nic whistled: 
  &#8220;We&#8217;ve passed you! Haha! Who&#8217;s the lazy bum now?&#8221;</p>
<p> Guilherme, along with Lu&iacute;sa and Val&eacute;ria (I don&#8217;t know 
  how they found room for three people there), started trying to go faster. Nic 
  was singing that song for Airton Senna&#8217;s victory, and kept paddling:</p>
<p> &#8220;Tan tan tan, tan tan tan...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Whoaaa watch oooout...&#8221;</p>
<p> I felt the crash. Nic was turning back to cross the lake again, and Guilherme 
  went right over us. The &#8220;race&#8221; ended, with everyone laughing. Nic 
  raised my arm:</p>
<p> &#8220;We won! The champions!&#8221;</p>
<p> Everything had been totally normal since that day. I was feeling so good, 
  I think I was learning how to take part in the fun. Better, I was taking part 
  in it as one of the main characters. Everything that happened just helped my 
  self-confidence to be higher. Soon the vacation on the campground would come 
  to its end, and I'd miss it so much. After our fight, Nic and I were closer 
  than ever. Not even Adriana could bother me anymore. She and Alice would normally 
  sleep with us in the chalet, just like Jo&atilde;o and Cl&aacute;udio with Nic 
  and Guilherme, and everything was at peace. Our friendship with Alice was back 
  to normal, we only wouldn&#8217;t talk much to Adriana. Just when it was necessary, 
  to be polite. Things were so good that Val&eacute;ria even got what she wanted 
  before.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, Cl&aacute;udio is so handsome, he&#8217;s so hot, sweet, the best! 
  We stayed together all night long at the dancing club!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say anything except congratulations, I'm happy 
  for you!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I have something more to say: you woke up early today, aren&#8217;t 
  you sleepy?&#8221;, we laughed. No one at the pool seemed to notice Val&eacute;ria&#8217;s 
  excitement.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I have to thank you... If you and Nic hadn&#8217;t fixed things, 
  we&#8217;d have never talked to Alice again and she&#8217;d have never helped 
  me like that!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, stop, I didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it, girly! We all 
  know that Cl&aacute;udio wasn&#8217;t exactly ignoring you!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But, hey, are you going to go out again?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know... but I'd love to!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, you wish...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What are these three pretty girls doing here, alone?&#8221;, Nic, Guilherme, 
  Jo&atilde;o and Cl&aacute;udio arrived. &#8220;I think we should stay here, 
  maybe there is a shark, an alligator, and...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I can take care of them! There won&#8217;t be a scale left!&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa pretended she was doing some kind of martial arts fight &#8211; 
  I think it only looked like something like that in her mind, actually.</p>
<p> &#8220;They&#8217;ll die of laughter!&#8221;</p>
<p> She pulled Nic, who fell into the pool.</p>
<p> He got out and sat beside me. Guilherme was hugging Lu&iacute;sa. Cl&aacute;udio 
  looked around, not knowing what to do, and finally decided to sit beside Val&eacute;ria.</p>
<p> &#8220;Watch what you&#8217;re doing with my sister, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Shut up, Guilherme!&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria was red with embarrassment, 
  Lu&iacute;sa and I were staring at her, holding a smile.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, I feel out of place here...&#8221;, Jo&atilde;o scratched his 
  head, looking at the pool. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go take a walk. If you guys need 
  me, I&#8217;ll probably be somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Really? I thought you liked to change dimensions from time to time!&#8221;</p>
<p> The conversation between us didn&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm going to the snack bar, I'm hungry. Anyone wanna come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Me!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa and Guilherme left.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re coming too!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;So come on, you goobers!&#8221;</p>
<p> I grabbed Nic, and we ran to the snack bar. In one second, we had disappeared. 
  Or almost...</p>
<p> &#8220;We can see them if we stay right here, and they can&#8217;t see us 
  because of all these people!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, easy! No need to hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Haha, who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa, Nic and I were looking for the best place, the best view, just 
  like we were watching a soccer game. Only Guilherme hesitated.</p>
<p> &#8220;Leave them alone, what if one of them sees us here...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria always tells us everything afterwards anyway, right 
  Paula? What will be the difference, if we can watch it live?&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Val&eacute;ria, are you sure you won&#8217;t get sick after we go back 
  home? Won&#8217;t you miss Cl&aacute;udio? You two are together all the time! 
  And Sorocaba and Rio de Janeiro are kilometers apart!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Sick, Lu&iacute;sa? Not me! We&#8217;re only going out, having fun... 
  It&#8217;s vacation, I'm far from home, I can do whatever I want without having 
  to explain it to anyone! And this night has to be special... very special! Tomorrow 
  afternoon we&#8217;ll be going back home...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re right... Man, it&#8217;s so good to be here!&#8221;, I 
  was upset for having to leave. &#8220;But Val&eacute;ria, what it is that&#8217;s 
  so special that you intend to do? Will you need the chalet empty or something 
  like that?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I'm not going that far... definitely!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, no offense...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm sorry, Lu&iacute;sa...&#8221;, patiently, Val&eacute;ria explained 
  the obvious to her. &#8220;Nothing you did even came to my mind now. I can even 
  say the opposite, if I dated someone like Guilherme or Nic I'd probably do the 
  same!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, hey... now, I didn&#8217;t like it... Are you calling me silly 
  or what?&#8221;, I said.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh Christ, everyone is so sensitive today! What&#8217;s this, the next 
  to last day&#8217;s syndrom?&#8221;</p>
<p> We laughed.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s be serious. What are you going to do after all?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, the guys are going to the dancing club.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;As always. Man, that place is so... I don&#8217;t know, I didn&#8217;t 
  like it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, Lu&iacute;sa, they do like it, so what? Well, as I was saying, 
  I'm going with him, and then we&#8217;ll get out and go to the lake and hang 
  out there...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;If anyone finds you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;There&#8217;s no one there at that time, everyone will probably be 
  sleeping!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hmm, okay, what time will they go back to sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, you are not going to...&#8221;</p>
<p> She gave me a roguish smile and sat on the bed, jumping.</p>
