<p><strong>THE SERIES </strong></p>
<p>I gave these stories a special section because they're my favorite ones. I 
  created five main characters and I've written two stories with them so far, 
  and that's what you'll find here. There will be more. Reading in order is better, 
  but not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>A Mistake in the Dark<br>
  </strong>Status: finished<br>
The first story from a series that has now 3 novels was written when I was 14 years old. It's the story of five friends that, due to a sucession of coincidences, have to face death, kidnapping and dangerous people, by themselves, without knowing who else they can trust.

<p><strong>Between Him and Me<br>
  </strong>Status: finished <br>
The second part of the series was written a couple months after the first. Here, Nic and Ana Paula have their relationship ruined by a girl who's come from nowhere and seemed determined to stay. With that, they split their friends' group in two and face tough situations, until the moment they have to decide what's really worth caring about.
