<p><strong>ADVICES</strong></p>
<p>A window, by my side, shows me the night<br>
  A starlit and magical night<br>
  With a moon and a mystery<br>
  The silence of the night knocks, announces itself<br>
  Speaks<br>
  The heart listens to its words<br>
  Wise words, words that say<br>
  That it's not late<br>
  That inside me there is still hope<br>
  Sweet words that say that I still can<br>
  That I'm still able<br>
  That I'll find the way<br>
  To your heart<br>
  My soul clamors, calls out<br>
  It knows<br>
  Quietly it understands<br>
  Your soul that is hidden<br>
  covered, silenced<br>
  Your heart that weakly and sorrowfully beats<br>
  Lonely<br>
  Your mouth lies to the world<br>
  Your eyes lie to yourself<br>
  Your ears insist not to hear my calling<br>
  My request for a chance<br>
  To set you free<br>
  To make you happy<br>
  To bring you back to the world<br>
  Back to life, back to the music<br>
  Back to the colors<br>
  Back to the night, back to the light<br>
  To the pure and bright light<br>
  Of my sweet heart.</p>
