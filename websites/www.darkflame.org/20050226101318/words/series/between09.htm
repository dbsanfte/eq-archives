<p><strong>CHAPTER 9 - IT'S ALL OVER</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Paula!&#8221;, they both got scared when I yelled.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, what&#8217;s this?&#8221;, I said softly. I was stuck at the door, 
  frozen, shocked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Adriana, what are you doing?&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria got into the room 
  and rushed right to Adriana. The two of them were still quiet. Nic kept switching 
  his gaze between me and Adriana, confused.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, what are you doing?&#8221;, I was crying. I still had the soft 
  tone of voice, I just couldn&#8217;t believe what I had just seen.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, Nic already knows what you did, he&#8217;s angry with you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Shut up, Adriana! Get out of here! Get out of this room!&#8221; she 
  got scared with Nic&#8217;s scream.</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria, tell Nic...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You heard him, just get out of here!&#8221; Adriana was violently thrown 
  out of the room by Val&eacute;ria, who shut the door.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, just tell me that what I&#8217;ve just seen here is a lie, an 
  illusion...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I... I don&#8217;t know why I did this...&#8221; Nic was up, 
  gesturing, confused.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, she came here to apologize for what she said, and you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I thought you were waiting for me! I thought you couldn&#8217;t wait 
  for me to open this door and say &#8216;Nic, I'm sorry, I love you&#8217;! I 
  never thought you&#8217;d just give yourself up to the first girl you saw, because 
  of the first stupid fight we had!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, stay calm, it&#8217;s not like that, I don&#8217;t know what 
  I was thinking. This crazy girl came here with no warning, trying to seduce 
  me, I...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I noticed, and I am sure you did too, that this bitch has had her eye 
  on you since the very first day we arrived here!&#8221;, I paused to catch my 
  breath. I think I had never yelled so angrily before. I continued, lowering 
  my voice, staring at Nic: &#8220;Is one bitchy girl enough to make you lose 
  control of your senses? Do you have this disgusting side that I didn&#8217;t 
  know about? Nic, couldn&#8217;t you have thought just for a moment about me, 
  about us, before grabbing that... that...&#8221;, I didn&#8217;t even know what 
  to say. Nic would never have a good excuse for that, since Adriana didn&#8217;t 
  force him or anything like that. &#8220;Nic, I... I don&#8217;t want to see 
  you anymore, I don&#8217;t want to hear your voice, in fact, to me we were never 
  boyfriend and girlfriend!&#8221;</p>
<p> With no regret, just anger, I opened the door and ran, my mind numb. Just 
  ran, ran to some place far from there, to some place where I would be able to 
  forget all that. Val&eacute;ria hesitated, she didn&#8217;t know whether to 
  stay with Nic, who was beside himself, crying, or to run after me. She decided 
  on the second choice.</p>
<p> I reached the entrance to the ward, Guilherme and Lu&iacute;sa were arriving. 
  I could barely see anything, because of the tears. I couldn&#8217;t help it, 
  I couldn&#8217;t stop, I couldn&#8217;t control it. Right at the time Val&eacute;ria 
  reached me, I threw myself at Lu&iacute;sa, hugging her.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa, confused, hugged me back. She looked at Guilherme and then at 
  Val&eacute;ria, who pointed to the ward. Guilherme ran inside there.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic! Nic, you...&#8221;</p>
<p> Guilherme entered the room and saw Nic full of anger, taking off the sheets 
  from the bed. It was the only thing he found that he could grab and throw. He 
  was saying Adriana&#8217;s name, with rage.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, calm down, stop!&#8221; Guilherme held his arms. Nic gave up, 
  falling down on the messed bed, without looking at his friend.</p>
<p> &#8220;Come on, Nic, tell me, what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, I can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; I was still crying. I 
  was whimpering, in the chalet, just the three of us in there.</p>
<p> &#8220;Stay calm, Paula, stay calm... This... This cannot be true, I mean, 
  Nic would never cheat on you!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I used to think that too, Lu&iacute;sa, but he did cheat on me! We 
  just argued once, and he went looking for someone else!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, calm down...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No &#8216;calm down, Lu&iacute;sa, I saw it, I saw Nic kissing Adriana 
  without even holding back! And this... bitch was looking forward to it, I know 
  it! That rainy day, at the snack bar, I thought she&#8217;d ask Nic for his 
  wet T-shirt, so she could keep a memory of him!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I don&#8217;t know what to say. I do recognize that this time 
  Nic&#8217;s gone too far, I think I'd think the same if I were you... But Nic 
  would tell you if he didn&#8217;t want to date you anymore, he wouldn&#8217;t 
  do this to get rid of you. Look, I know it will be hard for you two to get back 
  together, but...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, who&#8217;s saying I want to get back together with him 
  again?&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa remained silent. Maybe she didn&#8217;t believe that the fairy 
  tale between her brother and I had finally come to an end. And the most unbelievable 
  part: because of a cheating from him.</p>
<p> &#8220;Look, Paula&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria said, for the first time. &#8220;I 
  think that it was my fault. I... I told a lot of bullshit to the guys, then 
  they told Nic, you two fought and all this happened. Maybe if I hadn&#8217;t 
  lied, if I didn&#8217;t want Cl&aacute;udio&#8217;s attention that much, things 
  would be okay now...&#8221;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria was ashamed, but for me, none of that was news.</p>
<p> &#8220;So, if that&#8217;s how things are, it&#8217;s actually my fault&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa said, almost yelling, as if she were saying &#8216;let&#8217;s 
  stop with all this bullshit&#8217;. &#8220;I decided to sleep with Guilherme 
  the same night Nic went to the hospital, that drove everyone crazy, you fought, 
  and here we are now!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Stop, please!&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t hear those things anymore. Everything 
  inside me hurt so much, everything that reminded me of those past few hours 
  hurt me. Everything I never wanted to happen was happening at the same time, 
  during the vacation I had dreamed so much about.</p>
<p> We stayed in silence for some minutes, I was a little calm, wasn&#8217;t crying 
  anymore, until Guilherme showed up.</p>
<p> &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d be here&#8221;, and, after a short pause: &#8220;Paula, 
  I spoke with Nic.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention his name! I won&#8217;t hear a single word!&#8221;, 
  I yelled. I layed on the bed, put my face against the pillow and tightened it 
  the most that I could.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, stop acting like a child!&#8221; Lu&iacute;sa pulled off the 
  pillow.</p>
<p> &#8220;Leave me alone!&#8221;, I closed my ears with my hands and started 
  crying again.</p>
<p> &#8220;This is going to be hard...&#8221; the three of them looked at each 
  other.</p>
