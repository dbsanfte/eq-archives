<p><strong>CHAPTER 7 - SOMETHING IS WRONG</strong></p>
<p>During the following week, Lu&iacute;sa missed school two days and came back 
  there only after Nic insisted a lot. Joana&#8217;s burial, on Saturday, was 
  the most difficult moment for the two of them. Augusto didn&#8217;t know what 
  to do to comfort his children, but slowly &#8211; really slowly &#8211; everything 
  came back to normal. Augusto was working, Nic and Lu&iacute;sa studying. Lu&iacute;sa 
  would go to the cemetery every weekend. Sometimes, Guilherme picked up his sister 
  and her friends at the English school by car, and everyone went to the cemetery 
  with Lu&iacute;sa. Guilherme was now closer to the group, much more than he 
  was before.</p>
<p> Almost three months had passed, and vacation was approaching. During one afternoon 
  at the end of June, Lu&iacute;sa found her father looking for something in Joana&#8217;s 
  purse, which had been kept with all her things, in a specific room they&#8217;d 
  set aside.</p>
<p> &#8220;Dad, what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for something... I can&#8217;t find it... The silver 
  necklace I gave to your mother on our 10th anniversary.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Can&#8217;t you find it? Isn&#8217;t it with her other jewelry?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No... but, that&#8217;s okay&#8221;, Augusto gave up, upset. &#8220;I&#8217;d 
  like to keep it with me... But that&#8217;s okay, I&#8217;ll look for it later.&#8221;</p>
<p> He left. &#8216;The silver necklace...&#8217;, Lu&iacute;sa thought. &#8216;I 
  wonder if it&#8217;s the one she was wearing that day? Hmm... no, I don&#8217;t 
  think so, I think she wasn&#8217;t wearing anything that day.&#8217; Lu&iacute;sa 
  continued studying. The finals were finally approaching.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Two days later, on Saturday, Lu&iacute;sa called Val&eacute;ria and &Aacute;lvaro 
  her father answered the phone:</p>
<p> &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, is Val&eacute;ria there?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's Lu&iacute;sa.&quot;</p>
<p> &Aacute;lvaro was quiet. Lu&iacute;sa asked again:</p>
<p> &quot;Please, can you call Val&eacute;ria...?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I... Well...&quot;, his voice was trembling. &quot;I'll go check if 
  she's here... I mean, if she's busy.&quot;</p>
<p> After a moment, he was back:</p>
<p> &quot;Val&eacute;ria is busy with... the English homework.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But... Well, we don't have any English homework, English classes are 
  over.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I... ahn...&quot;, now, he seemed embarrassed, plus he was trembling. 
  &quot;That's what she told me...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know... But, please, could you call her anyway? I'll be quick, 
  it's just a moment!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry, but she asked not to be... bothered.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Does she have a problem?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry, Lu&iacute;sa, but if she's not busy, I don't know why she 
  doesn't want to talk.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry again. Bye.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hello? Hello? Damn! What's going on with Val&eacute;ria?&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa called Ana Paula:</p>
<p> &quot;I tried to talk to Val&eacute;ria, but she didn't want to talk to me. 
  Her father was acting weird, and when I started insisting, he hung up on me. 
  Do you know if something happened to her?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No... Not that I know of...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Call her yourself, maybe the problem is me and I don't know it...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You? No way!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, anyway, could you do this favor for me? Try talking to her. It's 
  about the party for the first semester ending, she&#8217;s supposed to give 
  me the details...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, I'll do it.&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula hung up and called Val&eacute;ria. &Aacute;lvaro answered again:</p>
<p> &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I want to talk to Val&eacute;ria, please.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;She's not home.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Not home? But Lu&iacute;sa just called you and she didn't want to talk, 
  she thought Val&eacute;ria was angry or something, and asked me to call...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;She doesn't want to talk. Sorry.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But... Hello? &Aacute;lvaro? Hello?&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula called Lu&iacute;sa again:</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, she doesn't want to talk. I mean, first, her father said 
  she wasn&#8217;t home, and then he said she didn't want to talk...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's weird...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;&Aacute;lvaro is even weirder! He sounded nervous, like he suddenly 
  developed a stutter! He sounded scared...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa thought for a moment.</p>
<p> &quot;Come here, Paula, we can talk about it...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, I don't know what you want to talk about, Val&eacute;ria must 
  have had a fight with &Aacute;lvaro, and now she doesn't want to talk to anyone...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Is it that serious, that &Aacute;lvaro would act so strangely? Hey Paula, 
  I don't think so! Come here, we'll find out what's happening.&quot;</p>
<p> A couple minutes later, Ana Paula was at Lu&iacute;sa's.</p>
<p> &quot;Let's try again&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said, holding the phone.</p>
<p> She dialed. No one answered. She tried again. Nothing happened.</p>
<p> &quot;Could they leave home that quick?&quot;</p>
<p> On the third try, Val&eacute;ria answered.</p>
<p> &quot;He... Hello? Who is it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Val&eacute;ria, it's Lu&iacute;sa. What happened? I tried to talk to 
  you, but your father said that...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa was interrupted by a rough voice, which was speaking to Val&eacute;ria. 
  It wasn't loud, but Lu&iacute;sa shut up, told Ana Paula to do the same, and 
  she could hear the conversation:</p>
<p> &quot;Hey girl, who is it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's a friend of mine, she doesn't want nothing special, let me...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hang up!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Please, I just...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;HANG UP! Come on, kid, do what I tell you to do, or else you know what's 
  going to happen! Docka doesn't want...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa couldn't hear more because Val&eacute;ria started crying. The 
  phone was violently hung up, probably taken off Val&eacute;ria's hand. Lu&iacute;sa 
  still held her phone for a moment, like she was trying to understand what had 
  just happened. Then, Ana Paula spoke to her:</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, Lu&iacute;sa! What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You don't know? What did Val&eacute;ria say?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It wasn't her...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No? Didn't she answer the call?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes, but...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Come on, tell me!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... Val&eacute;ria answered, and while I was asking her why she 
  didn't want to talk to me, a rough voice came from the back and asked her who 
  was on the phone, and told her to hang up... Before she did, she started crying 
  and the voice told her to obey, or else she knew what would happen. Then he 
  said 'Docka doesn't want' and that was all, I didn't hear anything else.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That was all, you say? You think it's not enough?&quot;, Ana Paula asked.</p>
<p> &quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's weird, of course... I'll call her again to check it out.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Are you crazy? What if that guy does something to them? Maybe he has 
  caller ID, and...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, don't be a chicken! Do you want to know what's going on 
  out there or not?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course I do!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So, let me call her.&quot;</p>
<p> Reluctant, Lu&iacute;sa gave up. Ana Paula dialed, and after some minutes, 
  someone answered. This time, it was Guilherme.</p>
<p> &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Guilherme? This is Paula. May I talk to you for a second?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, I... Hold on just a minute, please.&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula could hear the voices through the phone. They were distant, like 
  Guilherme had put his hand on the receiver. She heard the &#8216;rough voice' 
  arguing with him, and Val&eacute;ria interrupted:</p>
<p> &quot;Who is it, boy?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;A friend.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You have too many friends calling. Hang up now.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I need to talk to her.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Guilherme, please, do what he wants...&quot; Val&eacute;ria said, with 
  a scared voice.</p>
<p> &quot;Stay out of this, girl! And you, kid, hang up now! Go!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't call me a kid. Let me talk to her, then I'll hang up, and the 
  problem is solved! No one will ever call us!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Do what I say... or you know what will happen!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Just a minute!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;NO!&quot; and Ana Paula heard a shot, and Val&eacute;ria screamed. She 
  screamed too, scaring Lu&iacute;sa. Silence. The phone on the other end fell 
  down, but the line was still open. Ana Paula was terrified, and put her hand 
  on the receiver when she heard that voice grab it and ask, insistently, who 
  wanted to talk to Guilherme. Since he didn't get any answer, he hung up the 
  phone violently, but before he did that, Ana Paula could hear him saying 'enough 
  phone calls now'. Only after that, Ana Paula hung up too, and Lu&iacute;sa asked 
  what she had heard.</p>
<p> &quot;Screams...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Screams?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;A shot...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That voice wanted to talk to me...&quot;</p>
<p> But Lu&iacute;sa didn't seem to be worried either about voices or about screams.</p>
<p> &quot;Paula, tell me exactly what you heard. Did you hear a shot?&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula told her everything she had heard. Then, they heard Augusto's voice:</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, could you do me a favor? I need...&quot; he entered the 
  room, but when he saw the girls' scared faces, he switched his question. &quot;What 
  happened?&quot;</p>
<p> Nic showed up too. Lu&iacute;sa had just said:</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know...&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula explained everything. Nic was looking around, suspicious, Augusto 
  was paying attention to her. Finally she finished, and Nic said:</p>
<p> &quot;Could that &#8216;voice&#8217; be some friend or relative of theirs?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't think so... What kind of friend or relative would do something 
  like that?&quot; Augusto said, thinking.</p>
<p> &quot;Call them again and ask!&quot;, said Nic, sounding like he thought it 
  was obvious.</p>
<p> &quot;No&quot;, Augusto said. &quot;Didn't you say that the man complained 
  about the calls? Who knows what's going on there? They might be being robbed 
  or something...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He threatened everyone...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Call the police, Dad!&quot;, said Nic.</p>
<p> &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh God, why not?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, it's better that we don't mess with them. If the police 
  suddenly arrive there, who knows what might happen. We don't know either who 
  or how many of them are there!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But they're our friends...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;This is a tough situation, honey. But let things go on, as soon as those 
  people get what they want, they'll leave everyone in peace. Whatever it is that 
  they want... I don't think &Aacute;lvaro, Val&eacute;ria or Guilherme would 
  react to them.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Yes, okay, alright... But what if that 'voice' is a murderer, a kidnapper, 
  or...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course he's a bandit. And if I call the police, God only knows what 
  he could do.&quot;</p>
<p> Everyone was silent, exchanging glances, thinking. If anyone had payed a little 
  more attention to Lu&iacute;sa, they would&#8217;ve seen fear on her face. And 
  she was really worried: 'I buried my mother. I don't want to do the same to 
  my friend's family'. Lu&iacute;sa was thinking about her mother. About her mother's 
  stupid death. 'I so wish to see a scamp like that getting what he deserves!' 
  she thought. Then she got an idea, and before thinking more carefully about 
  the bullshit she was about to say, she said it:</p>
<p> &quot;Why don't we go to their house? No one would suspect us, a group of 
  teenagers on a Saturday night, right? That man would never imagine we were the 
  ones who called!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No way!&quot; Augusto yelled. &quot;Have you gone nuts? You don't know 
  what kind of people are there! What if it's a murderer, who has a furious attack 
  at the same time you're there, then he goes out and kills everyone?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Dad!&quot;, Nic said. &quot;Don't be so pessimistic! Don't worry, we 
  won't do anything. But, they're our friends, and they might be in serious trouble.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I wonder if they did something wrong to someone?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't think so. Maybe that guy just wants to rob the house in peace.&quot;</p>
<p> Suddenly, a horrifying thought came to Ana Paula's mind:</p>
<p> &quot;After that shot, Guilherme's voice disappeared, the phone fell down. 
  I wonder if Guilherme... if that guy... killed him?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't even think about it!&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa yelled. &quot;No one 
  is going to die!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Wait, I just thought that...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I told you, shut up! Something bad may really happen, because of your 
  curse!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay! I didn't say anything. That's it.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I wanted to know what's going on there...&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa groaned.</p>
<p> &quot;Well&quot;, Augusto said. &quot;You did, but you won't do anything. 
  I won't admit that you got into this, okay? Don't even think about playing detective, 
  all right?&quot;</p>
<p> No one answered. Augusto left the room. Lu&iacute;sa sat on the floor, held 
  her legs and, with her forehead on her knees, she said, whispering, weeping:</p>
<p> &quot;No one can die there... No way!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Calm down, Lu&iacute;sa&quot;, Ana Paula tried to comfort her friend.</p>
<p> &quot;Paula, I've already lost my mother...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I know, I know...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;If something happens to... to some of them...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;To Guilherme... I understand you, Lu&iacute;sa...&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula and Nic looked at each other. They felt pity for Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> &quot;I'll find out what's happening, and it'll be tomorrow, as soon as I 
  wake up!&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said.</p>
<p> &quot;Don't even think about playing detective...&quot; Ana Paula said, remembering 
  Augusto's words.</p>
<p> &quot;But we've already thought about it, right?&quot;, Nic said, hugging 
  his sister.</p>
