  ABOUT ME &gt; BIO <img src="square.jpg" width="7" height="7"></font></strong></font></p>
<p>I'm an average girl. I'm not a prep, and not a rebel. I have a family, friends, 
  and problems. I'm happy and satisfied with my own life, but I always want more. 
  Sometimes, I don't work hard enough for it, but things changed in a short time 
  and I'm sure they will always get better.</p>
<p>I love the nature and I hate violence. I don't like being afraid of walking 
  on the streets late at night.</p>
<p>I&#146;m 21 and live in Brazil. I work in a telecommunication company, go to 
  college (last year, finally), and share an apartment with 2 other girls, in 
  a city 30 minutes away from the one where my family lives. I love this city 
  more than my hometown and I don&#146;t want to go back. I want to have a life 
  of my own here. And so far, I've done pretty good.</p>
<p>I love reading, writing, watching movies, listening to music, photographing, 
  surfing the internet, playing with cats. These are things I do with passion.</p>
<p>I don't care about giving out my home address or showing my picture on the 
  internet. Many parts of my life are distributed among my various websites &#150; 
  it's one of my favorite ways to express myself. But there are things I never 
  share with anyone. There are things that are mine. I have a blog and an online 
  photo album and many other public things, but I know how to keep the important 
  things to myself. In fact, there's only one person in this world who knows me 
  entirely: my boyfriend. He can talk about me better than I can. I don't have 
  big secrets or fears; I just don't like showing my worst weakness and my best 
  achievements to people, and I have my own reasons to act like that.</p>
<p>I have a hard time when it comes to forgive and forget. I usually don't do 
  either. It's not good, but it makes me feel safe.</p>
<p>I love languages. I speak Portuguese, English and some German. I'm taking Spanish 
  classes now. I will learn Italian. And more German. And more more German. If 
  you're German, I&#146;ll let you know that I love your language, I envy you 
  because you can speak it fluently, and I want to visit your country so badly. 
  And you can e-mail me and leave a message because I want to always learn German.</p>
<p>And, finally&#133; I'm just a girl, who can't express herself in just a couple 
  paragraphs, in a foreign language. I'm a girl who has a lot of feelings inside, 
  not always ready to deal with them. I'm a girl who's proud of herself sometimes, 
  and sometimes not. I&#146;m a girl who still have a lot of things to learn, 
  but who also has a lot of things to teach.</p>
