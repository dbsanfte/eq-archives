<p><strong>CHAPTER 5 - INSEPARABLE</strong></p>
<p>Classes finally started. Nic, Lu&iacute;sa and Ana Paula could meet each other 
  every night at school, besides the time during the day they spent together. 
  Nic and Lu&iacute;sa helped their mother with her work, but they still could 
  find free time to spend with hanging out and talking.</p>
<p> With the beginning of the school year, Val&eacute;ria started showing interest 
  and sympathy for them. In the first days, Ana Paula tried to approach the girl, 
  who seemed very friendly that day she went to school to enroll. As the two of 
  them were studying in the same classroom, it was easier for them to become friends, 
  and soon Val&eacute;ria was friends with Nic and Lu&iacute;sa too.</p>
<p> &quot;My parents are getting divorced&quot;, she said, while they were waiting 
  for the next class to start, some days later. &quot;Things between them got 
  worse after we moved here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It must be terrible for you&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said. &quot;Can't you 
  go back there and things can get good again?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No. Well, we can, but my dad doesn't want to go back, and neither do 
  I. I&#8217;ve liked this city since the very first time I've been here. And 
  I believe that a little thing would be enough for them to fight, and this moving 
  was this little thing. They would get divorced anyway, sooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I can't even think of my parents fighting, getting a divorce...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;My parents actually don't fight... not like this. They don't yell at 
  each other or anything. It's a silence war, if you get what I mean. I think 
  that's why I&#8217;m not afraid or worried about it. I don't think they'll stop 
  talking to each other at all.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Man... your calmness scares me!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Anyone would be calm if they saw that the bad atmosphere in their own 
  home is about to end... you know? Even if it happens this way. I like both my 
  parents a lot, and I don't mind seeing them apart if that's what's needed to 
  improve our relationship.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And what's going to happen when it's all done? I mean, when one of them 
  is about to leave home...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;My mom's going back to Porto Alegre. My brother and I will stay here 
  with my dad.&quot;</p>
<p> No one said anything. Val&eacute;ria didn't care to talk about this subject, 
  but the others were too embarrassed to ask her about it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>And although Val&eacute;ria didn't live near the other guys and couldn't see 
  them everyday, she became a frequent person among them. Besides regular school, 
  she studied English in the same languages school as Lu&iacute;sa and Ana Paula, 
  not in the same class, but at the same time.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;What about your brother, Val&eacute;ria? I remember you once said he 
  was starting some college course...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Administration. It's near here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And doesn't he hang out with you?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... he always had his own friends, but he's not going out a lot 
  for the time being. Yes, we do hang out together sometimes. We became really 
  close after this whole problem between my parents started.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You have to introduce him to us. We've known you for over a month, and 
  never saw your brother!&quot;, Ana Paula laughed. &quot;If he's afraid he'll 
  become a babysitter, tell him Nic is almost the same age as him.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I guess you're going to like him. I do. And you'll meet them as soon 
  as possible!&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>And so it was done. The next Saturday, a sunny day, Nic, Lu&iacute;sa and Ana 
  Paula went to Solar FastFood, a restaurant near their house. They waited for 
  Val&eacute;ria and her brother there, and it took them a half hour to arrive. 
  They sat at the same table, in a corner, three in one side, two in the other.</p>
<p> After being properly introduced, they ordered some food, and ate while talking.</p>
<p> &quot;It's a nice city. We used to come here a lot when my grandfather was 
  still alive, Val&eacute;ria and I, to spend our vacation here, and stuff like 
  that. I like coming here to live definitely, but I miss my old life.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, Guilherme&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa smiled. &quot;You'll enjoy 
  your new life here. I think we'll run into each other a lot from now on.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That would be good!&quot;, he laughed. &quot;People at college are not 
  that friendly, everyone either works all day, or has their own date to go out 
  with... But it's been cool, so far.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I have some friends in S&atilde;o Lucas that play basketball together, 
  they practice on the weekends&quot;, Nic said. &quot;They're nice guys, and 
  sometimes I play with them. I can take you there with me, if you want. Do you 
  play basketball?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Rarely... I don't have many opportunities to play it. I like basketball, 
  I actually practiced it for some weeks once, but decided to quit. The guys were 
  not nice. It's been, like, two years maybe?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So exercise your bones before going there&quot;, Val&eacute;ria said. 
  &quot;Nic's friends play seriously!&quot;</p>
<p> They talked for the rest of the day, and went to Nic's house when it was already 
  dark. And during the following days, they were together as often as they could. 
  In fact, they became inseparable.</p>
