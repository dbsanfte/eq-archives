Join form and members list FIXED! Thanks to my dear boyfriend, who fixed everything to me. You can now join using the form and will be added very soon. But, I'm so sorry I lost the old members. Some of them, I may find them myself again, some of them I may not. Please be patient while I work on it, and if you joined and your name just disappeared, please re-join. I'll work hard on not letting this happen again.

<br>
This is really important. I have made a stupid mistake this weekend, and accidentaly deleted the members list database. That means I have lost the members list *again*. I'm so sorry I did that. I will try to find the people who had joined, but I don't know how I'll do this. I'm ashamed to say that you will have to join again. I really am! The joining form is not working though, so e-mail your info and I will add you when everything's fixed. I will do my best to find some time to work on the members list again next weekend, but so far, please keep emailing and joining. I will fix the problems soon and hopefully will never do this kind of mistake again.

There is some problem with the members list, and the names are not showing up. I will take a look at it this week, and soon it will be fixed. You still can join and be added, your name will be saved in the servers and as soon as the list problem is fixed, the names will all show up again.<br />I also have registered to a GuestMap account. There is a link to it on the bottom of the menu (where the 'guestbook' link used to be). Go leave a message! :-)

Hey, we're still here!<br />I still didn't have the time to make some modifications on the members list (such as total members count) and I have to work on the links, affiliates and things like that. But we're always gaining new members and the list is growing, and I believe that we'll reach the 1,000 members mark sooner than the couple years needed before :-)<br />I also would like to say a big thank you to the people who donated so far. Because of them, it's a lot easier keeping this site up and working on it. Thank you! (and if you didn't <a href="http://darkflame.org/prolife/help.htm">donate</a> yet, please consider doing so!) ;-)

I'm adding the people who joined while the join form wasn't up. If you join now, you'll notice that you are automatically added to the members list. It's a problem I will fix soon.<br />Just stopped by to say that I'm always here working on the clique!

The new join form and members list have finally been launched.<br />There are still a few problems though, and they will hopefully be fixed until the end of this week. But it's already working, and anyone can join.
