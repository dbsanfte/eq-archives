<p><strong>PART 1 - MEMORIES<br>
  CHAPTER 3 - MEETING THE FRIENDS AGAIN... THE FRIENDS?</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hey, wait, what are you doing? Let me go!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;One... two... three... now!&quot;</p>
<p> Michael had just arrived at his father's house and was promptly thrown at 
  the pool by his brothers, still in his clothes and everything. The &quot;party&quot; 
  started, and they actually did some dangerous things, but they were all used 
  to it, including Randy. He had the opinion that it was just a teen way to have 
  fun. Clara would worry if she was there, watching them.</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, boys, now let's eat and...&quot; Randy had barely put the snacks 
  on the plastic table near the pool. Before he could end the phrase, Stuart got 
  pushed and hit his father, who hit the table and all the snacks went to the 
  water.</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry, dad!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Stu, are you a cockeyed, can't you see things in front of you?&quot;, 
  Lucas threw a piece of bread at Stuart, who threw a hamburger back at him. Some 
  minutes after the food war started, the pool was mucky.</p>
<p> &quot;Man, look at what we have done&quot;, they looked at the water around 
  them and laughed. Randy had watched everything, sitting on a chair far from 
  them.</p>
<p> &quot;Let's turn the filter on!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Are you crazy?&quot;, Randy got up. &quot;All this stuff will obstruct 
  the filter. Clean all this with your own hands, and later you can filter the 
  water.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay... Have you already noticed how disgusting wet bread can be?&quot;, 
  the three of them started to clean the water.<br>
  When they were done, Lucas and Michael went to their room to sleep, and Stuart 
  went to the club near Randy's house, the place he knew he could find his american 
  friends at that time of the day.</p>
<p> &quot;Stu!&quot;, from inside a small cement field, a guy yelled in the middle 
  of a soccer game.</p>
<p> &quot;Rich!&quot;</p>
<p> The first friend met in Boston was Richard, an eighteen years old boy who 
  was always training at the club. He interrupted the game to say hello to Stuart, 
  speaking always in english:</p>
<p> &quot;It's been a long time! Man, look, they changed all the club, it's bigger, 
  with a bigger pool...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I need to stay in Brazil during the school time, right?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course, absolutely... Well, you already know John and Brian, this 
  is Kevin, this is Josh, and you can see Mary and Angela at the bleachers.&quot;</p>
<p> Stuart waved. When the girls saw him, they ran to meet him and gave him hugs.</p>
<p> &quot;Stu, it's been so long!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;We missed you...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I missed you too.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;We miss you and your brothers a lot when you're not here. Speaking about 
  them... where are they?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;They're home, sleeping with the angels&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So, tell us the news!&quot;</p>
<p> The eight of them walked to the big snack bar, beside the cloakrooms, where 
  the boys entered to clean themselves after the game. They left Stuart, Mary 
  and Angela waiting outside for some moments.</p>
<p> &quot;So how long will you still live in Brazil?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know. I have no plans to move here with my father, Lucas is 
  already in college and won't quit because of a moving thing. But I'm seriously 
  thinking about attending college here, to change things a little, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Stu! I didn't know about your college plans!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No? I thought I had told you&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, you hadn't&#8230; are you serious, do you really want to study out 
  there? And leave us?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, Mike&#8230; We'll always be brothers!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's not what I meant&#8230; Forget it, you're on a trip&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, unfortunately, I'm not!&quot;, they half-smiled, without really 
  enjoying the comment.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>They were all together again, and the conversation was cheerful. Some hamburgers 
  and sodas later, Stuart said he wanted to see the new things on the club. That 
  was, definitely, one of the three brothers' favourite places, where there were 
  most of their friends from Boston.</p>
<p> &quot;There are some basketball fields in there, and now there's also a baseball 
  field&quot;, Richard pointed, while speaking. &quot;Those closed places over 
  there are still under construction, it seems they're constructing a playgroung 
  and some other stuff for the kids. The baby nursery will be transferred to there, 
  and I guess that will be an only-children place. That'd be nice. There is a 
  running runway over there&quot; and he pointed the other side of the club, &quot;a 
  salon that's rented for parties, and on the back of the club there is a convenience 
  store, you can access it from the street too.&quot;</p>
<p> That place was really huge. You couldn't see its end. It was an incredible 
  place, especially when seen through aerial pictures. It was a big club, well 
  cared, and attended by people of all ages.</p>
<p> &quot;What's that?&quot;, Stuart pointed to a crowd, from where some music 
  came.</p>
<p> &quot;There is a little stage there, and some rock bands play here from time 
  to time. This one is a cover of some old rock band.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Let's see, they sound good.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry to disappoint you, but John, Brian and I can't give you the 
  honor of our presences&#8230; We have to go.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, Kev&#8230; Don't worry about us&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> Richard, Josh, Stuart and the girls went to watch the band. It was a simple 
  stage, without lights and any other special effects, it was low and not very 
  big, and it had the club's logo in it. But people seemed to like that sound, 
  made by six young musicians.</p>
<p> &quot;Hum, there it is. Skill, it's the name of the band.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Cool&#8230; They are good.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, Stu, don't you want to go to that side, it's less crowded&#8230;&quot;, 
  Angela asked, with am uncommon sweet voice.<br>
  Stuart looked at his friends. Nobody said anything. It was better not to disappoint 
  the girl.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, guys, I'm back&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Come in, Lucas. Stu is almost there&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Cool! He looks silly in that part!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You're a silly, you gay!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Shut up, Lucas&#8230; he's sensitive today.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Look, stupid, can you just close your big mouth? If you don't want to 
  listen, at least pretend you're hearing!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I am, loggerhead&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, we laughed, we said what we really think of each other, now let's 
  continue, Stu.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Angela, isn't it better to stay here? We'll lose the others!&quot;<br>
  After walking for some moments among the crowd, Stuart decided to stop.<br>
  &quot;Okay. It's better in here.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Why did you bring me here?&quot;, he tried to look ingenuous.<br>
  &quot;To talk to you, just that, it's been so long since&#8230; Stu&#8230; What 
  are you looking at?&quot;<br>
  &quot;I&#8230; I think I saw someone I know&#8230;&quot;<br>
  &quot;Who?&quot;<br>
  He kept looking, the eyes trying to find that face again.<br>
  &quot;Angela, can you give me a second?&quot;, without deviating his eyes from 
  a certain place, Stuart left Angela and went to the direction where he had seen 
  that face. He saw his friends, at the same time he saw the person he was looking 
  for, some meters from him:</p>
<p> &quot;Stu, what happened? Where's Angela?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;She's still there&#8230; Does any of you know that girl?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What girl?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That blonde one, wearing a bikini, talking to the short girl&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, okay, we saw her. I think I've never seen her&#8230; Who is she?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I think I know who she is. I just wanted to be sure&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Go ask her.&quot;</p>
<p> Stuart hesitated. He looked at her again. Yes, it was her.</p>
<p> &quot;If you want to talk to her, go ahead, because Angela is coming. I don't 
  know if you noticed, but she has a crush on you. She've had it for months.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hein?!&quot;</p>
<p> That sentence brought Stuart back to Earth. Back to that crowd. He wasn't 
  expecting for that. Angela?! Now, what would he do to tell her she was nothing 
  but a good friend to him?</p>
<p> 'If I don't go talk to her now, I can never see her again. But if I do, and 
  Angela sees it, she'll be so upset&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> But Stuart knew that he had other good friends, who distracted Angela while 
  he talked to that girl.</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, excuse me&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> She turned to her back, looked at him for a second and recognized him:</p>
<p> &quot;I have already seen you somewhere&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p> Stuart smiled, inside and outside. That friendly voice made him feel comfortable, 
  forget Angela and all the rest.</p>
<p> &quot;Enny!&quot;</p>
