<p><strong>CORRODING</strong>
<p>It's the imagination that afflicts me<br>
  The view deceives me, it's not like it looks<br>
  But I let being convinced<br>
  And the emotion transforms it all.
<p>The joy, the friendship<br>
  The way of being, the way of acting</p>
<p>I know little, and I add to it<br>
  what I imagine.</p>
<p>And it looks better, happier</p>
<p>More than me.</p>
<p>And I'm afraid, afraid of losing myself<br>
  Afraid of losing what I have<br>
  For not being the best<br>
  I'm afraid because I consider I'm not the best.</p>
<p>My thoughts lead me to tears.<br>
  I want to cry...</p>
<p>And I wish it was possible<br>
  that things could change<br>
  And they wouldn't be the way they have been.</p>
<p>I wish everything was perfect and easy,<br>
  without those threats...<br>
  That exist only in my imagination<br>
  And they control me, even not being real.</p>
<p>After all, they're all there.</p>
<p>I wish magic existed<br>
  and the past was as I wanted it to be.</p>
