<p><strong>CHAPTER 3 - EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT </strong></p>
<p>After the unfortunate incident at the snack bar, it seemed like everything 
  went back to normal again. At the chalet, Adriana's behavior was like normal, 
  even with me. It was actually fun, that night we stayed up late listening to 
  music and having a 'party', with some food we had brought from the snack bar. 
  We didn't invite the guys, because they weren't allowed in the womens' area.</p>
<p>For some days, everything went just fine. A couple days later, we were putting 
  our chalet in order, it was all messed up, when someone knocked at the door:</p>
<p>&quot;Guilherme, Jo&atilde;o, Nic and Cl&aacute;udio, what a surprise!&quot;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa opened the door, with that casual way that she has, just like Nic. 
  &quot;But what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well&quot;, Nic said, coming in &quot;we were waiting for you at the 
  pool, since lunch time&quot;, Nic called the others, who were still outside 
  waiting for an invitation from us to enter. &quot;You didn't show up, so we 
  came here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't remember inviting you in&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa hit Nic's arms, 
  joking. &quot;We told you we'd take this beautiful afternoon to clear up our 
  chalet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ohh... you're right. I forgot. But you can keep doing your job, we won't 
  bother you at all&quot;, Nic showed us what Guilherme had with him.</p>
<p>&quot;The laptop?&quot;, Val&eacute;ria laughed. Lu&iacute;sa and I just smiled. 
  &quot;Guilherme, did you bring your laptop? I can't believe it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yo, what's the problem?&quot;, Adriana asked. &quot;Why did you laugh 
  like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just forget about it...&quot;</p>
<p>We looked at Nic and laughed. The other four guys didn't get it at all.</p>
<p>Ever since the day Guilherme made all the college computers freeze trying to 
  get the results of a test they'd taken for a friend, and then had to stay there 
  all night fixing the machines in the last month of classes and his father still 
  had to pay for the rest of the repairs, he promised he wouldn't touch a computer 
  for a long time. That had been the base of all kinds of jokes from his friends, 
  and of course Nic couldn't avoid taking part in it. Joking with friends was 
  his favorite hobby, and the incredible thing is that this was the thing that 
  his friends liked the most in him: the capacity Nic had to make people laugh. 
  And without offending anyone.</p>
<p>Well, while we tried to clean up the rest of the chalet, the guys turned on 
  the computer and sat at the table. They started making so much noise because 
  of the game, we would look at them and laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;How can such an idiotic game make these guys so happy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it was some soccer game, I would totally understand...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is soccer, Alice!&quot;, Guilherme yelled, without looking at her. 
  From what I could understand, the competition was between him and Nic, as always.</p>
<p>&quot;You were listening to us, weren't you?&quot;, the guys laughed. &quot;I 
  mean real soccer...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These guys are going to drive Cl&aacute;udio and Jo&atilde;o crazy too&quot;, 
  Adriana said, jokingly. &quot;They were such nice guys too!&quot;</p>
<p>They started getting even louder. Lu&iacute;sa and Alice soon approached them 
  and joined the game too. Then, Adriana, Val&eacute;ria and I too. It looked 
  fun, at least more fun than cleaning up the chalet.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you they wouldn't be able to resist!&quot;, Nic said, and they 
  laughed. &quot;Look at them, having fun with the computer soccer too!&quot;</p>
<p>We got a little embarrassed, but that didn't last long. The laptop froze, and 
  Guilherme had to reset it. Then, Alice and Adriana discovered the big amount 
  of games Guilherme had there.</p>
<p>&quot;Carmen Sandiego! You have Carmen Sandiego! Why didn't you tell us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, easy! You don't have to run over me! You can play... before you 
  have some kind of heart attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Val&eacute;ria whispered to me and Lu&iacute;sa:</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe they still play that, it's so old! It's a children's 
  game!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Val, you can play it everyday if you want, it's your brother's computer, 
  but, who knows about them? Maybe they have never seen one in their lives...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, are you done?&quot;, Guilherme interrupted us, and looked around. 
  &quot;It looks like there's still a lot of things to be taken care of. Do you 
  want some help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a miracle, someone offered some help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Guilherme is so sweet...&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said, hugging him.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Well, not that the chalet ended up that clean, but it was better than before. 
  The guys would laugh and make jokes with every object of ours they found, but 
  actually they helped us a lot. As for the jokes, I guess I don't need to repeat 
  again that Nic, the king of the world, was the pioneer. He's always been the 
  more talkative one, but Guilherme had been acting more and more casual than 
  normal. Maybe it was his friendship with Nic, or maybe one month in a place 
  like that really changes us... Jo&atilde;o and Cl&aacute;udio were still a bit 
  shy and would make jokes only with Adriana and Alice, but they were getting 
  familiar with us too. I concluded that Nic was really contagious.</p>
<p>One night, we were still there talking at the door of the chalet. Jo&atilde;o 
  went away, sleepy. A fresh wind started to blow, and the night turned even more 
  enjoyable. A grasshopper jumped near Adriana, and she screamed. We laughed, 
  and I even felt proud of myself, because I wasn't afraid of bugs. I have always 
  thought it was ridiculous, those people who can't get close to a butterfly... 
  Once, a guy in my classroom took some buzzer skin to school, that skin some 
  animals shed from time to time, and he just had so much fun with them. One of 
  the girls even stayed outside the classroom because no one would take the skin 
  out of her desk. By the way, some of them were delegated to Lu&iacute;sa and 
  me...</p>
<p>&quot;So you failed eighth grade, Lu&iacute;sa? That's so bad...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes... I'm going to high school this year. Val&eacute;ria and Paula are 
  sophomores already...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We really miss Lu&iacute;sa in class...&quot;, said Val&eacute;ria. &quot;You 
  remember that day we got the answers to the History test and gave a copy of 
  them to everyone? The guys would take notes of it in their shoes, in their desk, 
  in their pencil case, anywhere... Everyone got good grades and was done with 
  the test in one minute. The teacher suspected something and, the next class, 
  she gave us the same test and no one could do it. She was really angry at us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're wrong Val, I did the test...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've always been the best student, Paula, it's different! No one had 
  studied anything, and those asshole guys didn't even try not to act suspicious...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alice did something like that&quot;, Cl&aacute;udio said. &quot;That's 
  what Drica* told me...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but it was different. I only gave the answers to a few people, we 
  had the highest grades, the teacher was so happy with us! I was laughing a lot 
  and she didn't notice anything...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about that day I got the test, and wrote the answers I had on the 
  corner of it, and then forgot to erase it? Man, from that day on, I never cheated 
  on a test again...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guilherme has been traumatized since then...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about you, Nic? Are you an angel at school?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nic? Nic is so smart! Really intelligent. How many awards do you got, 
  huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know... All I know is that I'm sleepy and I'm going to bed...&quot;</p>
<p>The conversation ended at that point, and everyone went to sleep.</p>
