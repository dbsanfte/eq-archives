<p><strong>NOVELS </strong></p>
<p>These are my novels, beyond my series. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Where can my baby be - I - Three Lives<br>
  </strong>Status: unfinished<br>
This is the story of three brothers whose lives are divided between Brazil (where their mother lives) and United States (where their father lives). They are best friends, but university, girls and different interests begin to take them apart of each other, and it's not easy to decide what to do and where to live, because so many things will be left behind, no matter what they choose.
