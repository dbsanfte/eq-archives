<p><strong>IN VAIN</strong></p>
<p>In this torn society<br>
  There is no longer pain.</p>
<p>No more pain!... because there is no longer life.</p>
<p>Taken by their destiny,<br>
  Laughing at their past<br>
  Playing with their present<br>
  Fooling with their future</p>
<p>Fight for the future<br>
  No.<br>
  When did it seem real?<br>
  Is it worth to suffer for the unknown?<br>
  No.</p>
<p>Nothing comes, nothings cheers.<br>
  But it exist.<br>
  And waits.<br>
  Waits for what?<br>
  If there is no life anymore?<br>
  Because life understood that fighting...<br>
  Leads to nothing.</p>
<p>Only the desire, it is not enough.</p>
<p>It's a vain effort.<br>
  Always.<br>
  Absolutely, totally, effectively...<br>
  Always.</p>
