<p><strong>CHAPTER 8 - BETWEEN HIM AND ME</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Paula! I finally found you! What were you thinking, locking yourself 
  in like that? I mean, I kind of know what happened, I just wanted you to tell 
  me exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;They already told you bullshit, didn't they?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, Paula, I was in the ward and Nic told me some things, but I want 
  you to tell me the whole story, he was too messed up to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Alright, since you promise you'll believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course I believe you, Paula! I'm your friend...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria's friend too...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, first you talk to me, then I'll decide who&#8217;s the right 
  one to me.&#8221;</p>
<p> I told her everything, from the argument until that very moment. I was much 
  calmer. I was even ready to talk to Val&eacute;ria.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I think this is all so ridiculous. You should never have argued, 
  but... Val&eacute;ria isn't like that either, how could she say that to you, 
  hit you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What if she told the others the story the way she wanted it to look 
  like?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;This is also so weird... Look, I promised Nic I would fix it. He's 
  devastated because you left the ward crying, if I were you I'd go there to talk 
  to him.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;How can I even look at Nic, I acted worse than a little kid would!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, Nic loves you and he won't care what you do.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;All right, I can try...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Great, that's it. While you talk to Nic, I'll go look for Val&eacute;ria. 
  But don't worry, I'll do something about it. Maybe people just misunderstood 
  each other...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I hope so...&#8221;, I said, leaving the chalet. &#8220;Oh, one more 
  thing... Did you... have sex with Guilherme?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well... let's not talk about it right now, okay?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa 
  was kind of embarrassed. &#8220;After all, if I had stayed at my place, nothing 
  would have happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Paulinha, you finally showed up!&#8221;, Guilherme was leaving the ward, 
  and smiled when he saw me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Whoa, you&#8217;re sure in a good mood!&#8221;, I smiled too. &#8220;Were 
  you talking to Nic?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, I was... Poor Nic, he&#8217;s so sorry...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know why, I was the one at fault! Well, I&#8217;m 
  going to talk to him now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Cool. Do you know where Lu&iacute;sa is?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Looking for Val&eacute;ria. She&#8217;s crazy, wanting to fix the whole 
  mess by herself.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Uhn... I&#8217;m thirsty, do you wanna come for a soda with me?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Guilherme, I have to go see Nic...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s just one minute, Nic&#8217;s fine now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay... but it has to be really quick!&#8221;</p>
<p> We arrived at the snack bar, and stayed at the counter. After a couple minutes, 
  Lu&iacute;sa, smiling, showed up with Val&eacute;ria.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s alright now, guys, everything&#8217;s okay now!&#8221;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria and I looked at each other, kind of embarrassed. She was more 
  embarrassed than me, obviously.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I... I'm sorry...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;She changed some details of the story so Cl&aacute;udio wouldn&#8217;t 
  think anything bad of her!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa whispered to me, laughing. I 
  smiled. How could such a stupid thing like that make Val&eacute;ria and I fight?</p>
<p> &#8220;That&#8217;s okay, Val&eacute;ria. I'm going to see Nic now, Guilherme 
  just slowed down my plans a little&#8221;, I pointed to the soda. &#8220;But 
  I'm going there right now&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;Can I go with you? I think I owe Nic some apologies too.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course, Val&eacute;ria, let&#8217;s go. What about the rest of the 
  guys, did anyone talk to them?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I was with them. Only Adriana was missing&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay...&#8221;</p>
<p> We got into the ward, I was walking ahead Val&eacute;ria, anxious. So anxious, 
  that I even forgot to knock on the door and entered the room without announcing 
  myself. And that was when I saw it.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic and Adriana were kissing.</p>
