<p><strong>REQUESTS</strong></p>
<p>What are their<br>
  Our, yours<br>
  Our requests?<br>
  Renegated by the ignorant mind<br>
  That blocks the culture and the wisdom<br>
  And is satisfied with so little<br>
  Which conformism is that?<br>
  We want a fair world! We want a world<br>
  That fits us, them<br>
  Let's make protests<br>
  Restart revolutions<br>
  In the name of those who did so much for that<br>
  And now, they're forgotten<br>
  Let's become public enemies<br>
  Let's fight against the exploration<br>
  Against the lies and the badness<br>
  And the illusion that this world is perfect<br>
  Let's unmask the powerful<br>
  Let's unmask all the mistakes<br>
  Throw the rotten fruits in the garbage<br>
  Call for us that good things are made<br>
  Let's end the greediness,<br>
  Let's support our ideal<br>
  Let's revive minds!<br>
  What's wrong<br>
  Is what we're going to eradicate<br>
  We're going to destroy<br>
  Let's show our suggestions<br>
  Let's convince of what's correct<br>
  End with all the manipulation!<br>
  Destroy all the advertising<br>
  All the repetition, all the marketing<br>
  Let's ban stereotypes, let's create<br>
  Our self conscience<br>
  Let's valorize what should be accepted<br>
  Let's ignore the poverty of spirit<br>
  And end with the commercial culture<br>
  Let's teach people how to think!<br>
  Let's ask for our rights<br>
  Do our duties<br>
  Work out<br>
  Fight for a cause<br>
  Fight with all our forces<br>
  To end with all that's bad<br>
  To destroy the appearances<br>
  And build a real world.</p>
