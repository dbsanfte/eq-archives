<p><strong>CHAPTER 12 - FAREWELL</strong></p>
<p>It was around ten at night. I was sitting at the door to the chalet, the weather 
  was hot. Val&eacute;ria had already gone to the dancing club, and Lu&iacute;sa 
  had also &#8220;gone out&#8221;.</p>
<p> I looked at the other chalets. Open windows, music, people outside... I joined 
  the group who didn&#8217;t care about the night bugs &#8211; the difference 
  between me and them was that I was alone.</p>
<p> &#8220;Beautiful night, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic?!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic arrived so quietly, I didn&#8217;t even notice it. He was wearing shorts, 
  hands in his pockets, a very cute face. He sat beside me.</p>
<p> &#8220;I had to find something to do, since my chalet is being used... I imagined 
  that maybe you would be abandoned too.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Did I have any choice?&#8221;, I smiled.</p>
<p> A nearby disturbance drew my attention. I took a couple steps ahead, and saw 
  one of the campground monitors coming, after stopping in one of the chalets 
  to eat something.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, go inside, hurry! The woman is coming, she cannot see you here!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t worry! So many people break the rules...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Your sister, for example...&#8221;, I closed the door and locked it. 
  &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to take the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, anyway, I'm already here, I can&#8217;t go away... don&#8217;t 
  you think it&#8217;s better to close the windows too?&#8221;, before I answered, 
  he had already closed them.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s hot in here... You could stay right here, no one would 
  see you.&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic was up, beside the window.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I was thinking...&#8221;, he paused.</p>
<p> &#8220;...about?&#8221;, something in his voice made me stay where I was, 
  distant from him. I sat on a chair, but we didn&#8217;t look into each other&#8217;s 
  eyes. &#8216;This is becoming dangerous...&#8217;, I thought.</p>
<p> &#8220;About... About us, about how we&#8217;re so happy together, this vacation 
  brought good things for everyone, especially us, we&#8217;re going home tomorrow 
  and I thought... why not...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic... please...&#8221;</p>
<p> He looked at me. I didn&#8217;t look back at him. I wouldn&#8217;t resist, 
  but I wasn&#8217;t ready.</p>
<p> &#8220;Look, if you are worried about condoms, don&#8217;t be afraid, I have 
  one here...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, Nic, it&#8217;s not that, I mean... I... I am not ready for that 
  yet...&#8221;, I felt like I was so stupid saying that. &#8216;Being not ready&#8217; 
  sounded so... idiotic...</p>
<p> After a short pause, Nic smiled, kind of disappointed:</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s what you want...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm sorry... I ruined your expectations!&#8221;, I smiled back.</p>
<p> &#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t&#8221;, he sat on the bed. &#8220;The thing is, 
  I never thought it&#8217;d be so hard to tell you all this.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8216;It wasn&#8217;t easy for me either&#8217;, I thought. I sat beside 
  him.</p>
<p> &#8220;I must have done something spectacular in my past life to deserve somone 
  like you&#8221;, and we kissed each other. He hugged me, tight; we didn&#8217;t 
  think about anything else, we just wished that moment could last forever, so 
  we would be able to get to know each other more and more...</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! Open the door, Paula!&#8221;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria and the others arrived, around four in the morning.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, we&#8217;re all sleepy, the other chalet is locked!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Give us some time, Val!&#8221;, Nic yelled.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh... yeah... I think I get it.&#8221;</p>
<p> If I knew Val&eacute;ria well enough, I could be sure that she was smiling. 
  But she must have gone away, because of the silence outside. I looked at Nic 
  and laughed.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo&atilde;o, what time is it?&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria asked, yawning, 
  with her head laying on Cl&aacute;udio&#8217;s shoulders. They were all still 
  outside.</p>
<p> &#8220;Five o&#8217;clock&#8221;, he was sleepy too.</p>
<p> &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, we thought you&#8217;d spend the whole night with Guilherme!&#8221;</p>
<p> She hit Val&eacute;ria, she didn&#8217;t appreciate the joke.</p>
<p> &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get inside? Where&#8217;s Nic?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Aaaaah!&#8221; Alice yawned. &#8220;He&#8217;s in there...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;With Paula?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Bingo...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, what... Paula?!&#8221;, she got more excited &#8211; or awake 
  &#8211; than the others, and tried to see something through the closed window.</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, leave them alone!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay...&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Perfect! Shall we let them come in now?&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic looked at me and smiled.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Five-thirty...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, this wait is killing me...&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa was now almost 
  sleeping, like the others. &#8220;Did they forget about us here?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What about Guilherme? He&#8217;s alone in his chalet!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You can go there if you want...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hehe, not now, we&#8217;re going to wait!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey... they opened the door!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;, they all got up, Lu&iacute;sa and Val&eacute;ria 
  walked in front of the others. The door was only partially opened, they pushed 
  it almost at the same time, and then...</p>
<p> &#8220;You son of a...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic!&#8221;, the two of them screamed, they could have woken up the 
  whole campground. A bucket full of water that was above the door fell all over 
  them.</p>
<p> Still outside, the others laughed. Nic and I, laying on the bed, laughed even 
  more.</p>
<p> &#8220;Why &#8216;Nic&#8217;? Why me? BatNic here wouldn&#8217;t do anything 
  without the help from the WonderPaula!</p>
<p> &#8220;Nothing&#8217;s like a cold bath after a &#8216;hot&#8217; night!&#8221;, 
  I was almost choking from laughing. I had never done anything like that!</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm gonna kill you both!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa jumped over us, laughing, 
  and we got a little wet too. I was having a laughing attack, I couldn&#8217;t 
  even move. Lu&iacute;sa gave up, because Nic was stronger than her.</p>
<p> All the excitement caused by Nic and me finally ended, and the guys went to 
  the other chalet. Adriana fell asleep, Alice and Val&eacute;ria were almost 
  sleeping and Lu&iacute;sa, after changing her clothes, sat beside me on the 
  bed.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, Paula, now tell me. It didn&#8217;t take you and Nic the whole 
  night to set up that bucket. What did you do the rest of the time?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa&#8217;s 
  odd tone demanded an answer. I laughed.</p>
<p> &#8220;It was really fast to set up the bucket.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;And what else did you do, tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, we did lots of things...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Did you have sex?&#8221; her expectation was enormous.</p>
<p> &#8220;Noooo!&#8221;, I laughed, laughed and laughed. I couldn&#8217;t stop 
  laughing.</p>
<p> &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it! Tell me the truth!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s true! We can go to a doctor if you want me to prove it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, Paula, why not?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria is asleep...&#8221;, I looked around, as if I hadn&#8217;t 
  heard Lu&iacute;sa&#8217;s question. At that time, I felt some regret, and suddenly 
  stopped laughing. &#8220;Nic... he did try it...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What did he do?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He didn&#8217;t do anything bad, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re 
  thinking!&#8221;, I smiled. &#8220;He just spoke to me, two meters away from 
  me... Lu&iacute;sa... I did want it, but at the same time, I didn&#8217;t, you 
  know?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He&#8217;s so sweet... I feel so bad...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He&#8217;s really sweet... sometimes I just forget we&#8217;re brother 
  and sister to each other!&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p> A scream. What a good way of waking up... I looked at the clock. Almost ten 
  in the morning. I intended to sleep at least until two in the afternoon, and 
  then would wake up just in time to pack and go home, but Alice woke me up before 
  that, and I realized I was the only one who was still sleeping. I smiled, no, 
  I laughed to myself.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic had to have just been here now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What happened?&#8221; Adriana left the room in a towel, Val&eacute;ria 
  and Lu&iacute;sa came running from outside. &#8220;Is anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;There&#8217;s... there&#8217;s a frog in my suitcase!!!&#8221; she 
  put her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you nauseous, or just afraid of it?&#8221;, I joined them, slowly, 
  with a sleepy smile on my face.</p>
<p> They looked at me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221;, Alice ran after me, I started 
  laughing while I escaped from her. We got out of the chalet, I was still in 
  my pajamas, people started staring at us. &#8220;You and Nic put that disgusting 
  animal in my suitcase!&#8221;</p>
<p> I didn&#8217;t answer, I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.</p>
<p> &#8220;Take it out of there now!&#8221;, Alice couldn&#8217;t help laughing 
  too, like the others.</p>
<p> I went inside and soon came back out with the frog in my hand, I was holding 
  it with a paper, because, after all, I didn&#8217;t know it very well.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I can&#8217;t believe you did that! You never do things like 
  that!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm just having fun... We&#8217;re on vacation, I'm far from home, 
  I can do whatever I want without having to explain it to anyone!&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa and Val&eacute;ria laughed. Adriana and Alice didn&#8217;t understand, 
  but that was okay.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hehe, okay... What else did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t knooow...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic&#8217;s really changing you! He looks serious, but he sure loves 
  a little trouble...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I must agree that he can have fun without looking vulgar, like most 
  18-year-old guys!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Irk, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p> We looked to the chalet. Adriana was in there. We went inside.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, did you put a balloon in the freezer?&#8221;, she was holding 
  the &#8216;balloon&#8217;.</p>
<p> &#8220;Balloon?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa laughed. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that 
  this is a condom that&#8217;s filled with air? It&#8217;s Nic&#8217;s, I bet!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh my God, this is just disgusting!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You fool, it&#8217;s not used, can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa 
  and I were laughing to death. Val&eacute;ria was laughing &#8216;a little&#8217; 
  less than us.</p>
<p> &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you, I just can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I can see it takes people more than just one month to get used to us. 
  Especially with Nicolas Porter!&#8221;, a familiar voice said.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, it&#8217;s early, you&#8217;re already here?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I came to see how things are.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Everything&#8217;s just fine.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Do you have any more gifts for us?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, how many did you get so far?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Two of them&#8221;, I answered.</p>
<p> &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember, maybe there is, maybe there isn&#8217;t&#8221;, 
  Nic didn&#8217;t care much about that, and we laughed again. Then he grabbed 
  my hand: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go for a walk.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Won&#8217;t you stay to see what happens next?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I know how it&#8217;s gonna be. Some screams, some 
  cursing, and that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p> We left. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any need to say so, but we were 
  laughing.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Nic, how did you find this place?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I heard someone talking about it and came to check it out.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful! Wonderful! But what if someone sees us here?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;If that happens, we just run. But it won&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic had taken me to an enormous field, very beautiful, just like a field out 
  of a dream. It took us fifteen minutes to get there, it was outside the campground, 
  a private farm, I guess, but we were near the campground yet and very few people 
  went there. We were sitting, hugging each other, near a little lake, full of 
  flowers around it. It was a high place, so we could see a big part of the farm, 
  the plantations, the cattle, the house, a big house, some not-so-big trees and 
  the grass, which was a little taller than normal.</p>
<p> &#8220;I wanted to spend our last few hours here with you...&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic kissed me. I felt like in those movies when someone dies and goes to heaven, 
  to a wonderful, quiet and peaceful place...</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, about last night... I'm sorry...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Forget about it. It was nice, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p> I smiled, and laid my head down on his shoulders. He threw some stones in 
  the water, and I looked at the little waves that were formed.</p>
<p> Our silence made that moment magical. The birds&#8217; singing, the light 
  breeze, all the shapes of the white clouds, the movement of the employees in 
  the farm, so small, far from us, just like little toys, an angry voice right 
  behind us...</p>
<p> &#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p> We got up and looked behind, scared. A man with an old smock and a hat was 
  looking at us, upset:</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know this is private property?&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic and I looked at each other. The man was probably an employee on the farm.</p>
<p> &#8220;Run!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic grabbed my hand suddenly, and we ran off there. We passed through the 
  campground fence at the same point we did to go to the farm, a broken point. 
  We didn&#8217;t even look behind to see if the man had followed us, but we ran, 
  ran, until we reached the back of the campground forest. We stopped at the clearing, 
  the same one from the day Nic got sick. I was exhausted. We were laughing.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you&#8217;re so crazy! You told me no one would be there!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been there once! And just for a few minutes!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I never thought I could run like I did... among the trees!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic let himself drop to the ground.</p>
<p> &#8220;Come on, sit here&#8221;, and then &#8220;so, did you like the place?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I loved it. That nice farm man could have left us there a little more... 
  we didn&#8217;t mess with the flowers, didn&#8217;t steal the cattle, didn&#8217;t 
  do anything wrong!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Forget it, Paula! It was fun!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, it was... Nic, did you bring your watch?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Uhn... No...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;We left at noon, stayed there for a long time, and the buses leave 
  at six! I don&#8217;t even have one T-shirt in my suitcase yet!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back, then.&#8221;</p>
<p> I knew the way back pretty well. When we reached the lake, at the end of the 
  forest, I discretely smiled.</p>
<p> Nic asked a boy for the time. Two-thirty in the afternoon.</p>
<p> &#8220;My God, look at what you do! Over two hours passed and I didn&#8217;t 
  even feel it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I did that, Nic? I don&#8217;t think so. If it wasn&#8217;t for that 
  ugly man, we&#8217;d have to catch the next bus, next year!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re right... Let&#8217;s go back to say thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, Nic... Sometimes you are so silly... so cute...&#8221;</p>
<p> We arrived at the chalet. Everyone was there.</p>
<p> &#8220;Finished packing?&#8221;, I asked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, only your things are waiting for you, ma&#8217;am...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, what&#8217;s the problem? What have I done?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nothing, you just put bugs and animals inside our suitcases, put hair 
  gel into the jam pot...</p>
<p> &#8220;Anyone eat it?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Almost. Right, Val&eacute;ria?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;...you hid the toilet paper, put toothpaste inside the cabinet&#8217;s 
  handle, changed the way the freezer door opened...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Poor Adriana was having a fit, trying to open it, when she found the 
  condom! Then she realized it might be one of your jokes...&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria 
  interrupted Lu&iacute;sa, they both smiled, like they had done all the jokes 
  themselves.</p>
<p> &#8220;...and some other things. What&#8217;s the point, that&#8217;s so childish!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;We wanted to do it, that&#8217;s it! And I can say from your tone of 
  voice that you did something to me too...&#8221;, I entered the chalet, suspicious.</p>
<p> &#8220;We&#8217;re going to the snack bar!&#8221;, they yelled.</p>
<p> An hour later, I joined them.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, what happened? We thought you were dead in that chalet!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I was just packing&#8221;, I answered, in a perfectly normal voice. 
  &#8220;I'm going to get something to eat, I&#8217;ll be back soon.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What did they do?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you scared me! Are you some killer, coming from behind? Well&#8221;, 
  I answered his question, getting the sandwich I had ordered. &#8220;They turned 
  all my clothes inside out, and locked my suitcase zipper, but I put everything 
  in order, pretend nothing was wrong, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;They&#8217;re evil... why do so much work? Well, are you planning to 
  do something by pretending it&#8217;s alright, or are you just embarrassed?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Neither. I'm just tired of it. I'm really starting to think we&#8217;re 
  acting like kids.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh no, it&#8217;s just having fun. My friends and I always do those 
  things on our last day somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What an interesting tradition...&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodbye, guys...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Bye! We&#8217;re gonna miss you all!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;We&#8217;re going to write!&#8221;</p>
<p> Our last moments together. Everyone saying goodbye, getting on the buses, 
  which started to leave, through every possible way.</p>
<p> &#8220;I wish I had my car now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, Guilherme, don&#8217;t be selfish... Buses are a lot more fun!&#8221;</p>
<p> Adriana and Alice made a sign to Lu&iacute;sa, asking about me. She answered 
  with &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what happened&#8217; with a gesture.</p>
<p> &#8220;Anything wrong with your luggage, Paula?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, everything&#8217;s alright... why, should anything be wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Forget about it...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, our bus is leaving right now&#8221;, Guilherme said, starting 
  the last goodbye sayings.</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria kissed Cl&aacute;udio quickly, we all hugged and got on the 
  bus. I only waved goobye to Adriana, nothing more, just like Nic did. </p>
<p>The bus left. It crossed a small dirt road, until it reached the main road. 
  Another bus followed us.</p>
<p> In a few hours, we&#8217;d be home again.</p>
