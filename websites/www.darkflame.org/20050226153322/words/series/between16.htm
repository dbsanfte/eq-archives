<p><strong>CHAPTER 16 - SNOOPY, POSTERS AND SOMETHING MORE</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Paulaaaa!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic was in front of my house, calling me, ringing the bell insistently. I 
  quickly opened the door.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh my God, what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm late for training... and I think Snoopy is having a convulsion, 
  do you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Snoopy?&#8221;, I looked, not believing a single word he said.</p>
<p> &#8220;Snoopy, my uncle&#8217;s dog, we&#8217;re taking care of him while 
  my uncle is on a trip, remember?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh... yes. So, he&#8217;s having a convulsion, and...?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;This is serious, Paula. He&#8217;s acting really strange, could you 
  please help Lu&iacute;sa to take him to the vet? It&#8217;s near here, she knows 
  where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you really serious?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;m not kidding. Go there... I have to go train.&#8221;</p>
<p> He quickly kissed me and ran. Augusto had forbidden him to use the car before 
  he got his driver&#8217;s licence, because Nic once sent the poor Tempra to 
  the mechanics.</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa?&#8221;</p>
<p> I looked through the opened gate and saw Lu&iacute;sa. She told me to enter.</p>
<p> She was in the backyard looking at Snoopy. An adult Dalmatian, a heavy one.</p>
<p> &#8220;Ah... he&#8217;s really bad... What do we do now?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Let me see... I think we can carry him...&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa started 
  to get the dog up. He was calmer now, but limp.</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, I have never seen a dog like that...&#8221;</p>
<p> With some difficulty, we arrived at the vet, who promptly attended to us.</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t look like he has anything serious&#8221;, he said. &#8220;Maybe 
  he ate something rotten or contaminated with something. If it ever happens again, 
  give him this medicine and he&#8217;ll calm down.&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa got the little glass and gave it to me. Snoopy was already walking, 
  and we prepared to leave.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, look at this. Isn&#8217;t this the tournament Nic&#8217;s in?&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa was looking at a poster on the wall.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It starts on the 18th. The day after tomorrow. Tomorrow will be the 
  opening, are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course! Nic&#8217;s gonna play!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Not tomorrow... In the opening there will be some dancing presentations 
  and some other things.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I understand... Let&#8217;s go, this dog is getting hyper so fast&#8221;, 
  I grabbed Lu&iacute;sa, not looking at the poster closely.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Lu&iacute;sa?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, Val&eacute;ria&#8221;, on the other end of the line, Lu&iacute;sa 
  was trying to talk while eating a piece of bread. It was nine in the morning 
  and she was still having breakfast.</p>
<p> &#8220;The opening is today, isn&#8217;t it? What time can we meet at?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, it starts at seven, let&#8217;s go... to Solar 
  at six-thirty, okay? So we can get something to eat before going there.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay... But, do you know, I mean, anything else about this opening?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Something else? What do you mean?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa stopped chewing.</p>
<p> &#8220;There will be some I don&#8217;t know what of Olympic gym, with gymnasts 
  from the southeast.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;So...?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s on the list yet.&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa listened, without moving.</p>
<p> &#8220;Why do these things always happen to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Paulinha, you&#8217;re just so beautiful!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Me? Nic, I'm just normal, jeans, T-shirt...&#8221;</p>
<p> We were already late. We arrived at Solar at almost seven o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, do you think they&#8217;re going to wait for us? They aren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t stress! We can run and get there on time!&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa and Val&eacute;ria exchanged glances. I saw that. I knew that 
  glance. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The opening was in the gymnasium itself, a big place, a covered field.</p>
<p> &#8220;Thanks God those monkey-men stopped playing with the balls...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;They were from some gym center. You know, lots of them are trying to 
  promote themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p> A thirty-year-old woman positioned herself in front of the microphone. She 
  announced that about eight or ten gymnasts that would take part in a few tournament 
  partials. The acoustics were awful, we could not hear her at all. The woman 
  made the microphone whistle about three times before she finished speaking.</p>
<p> The girls entered the field and did the presentations, one by one. Five of 
  them were chosen and then they left. They went to the restrooms, but had to 
  climb up the bleachers, near us, to reach the upper restrooms, since the downstairs 
  ones were occupied by the people who would enter the field next.</p>
<p> One of them accidentally hit Guilherme. We immediately recognized her.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh no... please, no...&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa cried.</p>
<p> &#8220;But... it&#8217;s Adriana!&#8221;, I spoke, looking at the restrooms, 
  where the girls were in already. &#8220;What&#8217;s she doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;From what I can understand, she&#8217;s participating in this gymnast 
  thing...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I know that! But why her? Everything was so great so far!&#8221;</p>
<p> A couple minutes later, with normal clothes on instead of gym clothes, the 
  girls took seats three rows below us.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, if you ever want to go home...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, would it bother you if I said I did?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course not. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Wait, guys! Paula, you remember that everything was fixed before, and...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I thought it was definitely fixed when everyone went home. Now it&#8217;s 
  different.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s not argue, I just don&#8217;t understand you... Well, 
  so where are we going? It&#8217;s early yet, let&#8217;s go to Solar.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why do your games have to take place in another city?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, don&#8217;t worry!&#8221;, Nic laughed. &#8220;There will be 
  three games here. If we win everything, maybe the finals will be here too!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s just that I wanted to go with you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine, I promise&#8221;, he kissed me, and left. It was 
  morning, and the first game would be in the following afternoon. It was not 
  far, but I couldn&#8217;t go. To any of them.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;The game&#8217;s on the 10th, two days from now! The deciding game, 
  Lu&iacute;sa! If we win this one, we&#8217;ll be at the quarter finals!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;If &#8216;we&#8217; win? You&#8217;re not even playing, Paula!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You knew what I meant...&#8221;</p>
<p> From the six games, Nic&#8217;s team lost only one. They had to win the next 
  one, or else they were out. But everything was for them, they&#8217;d play at 
  home, and Nic was so calm, even with all the college things to do, that you&#8217;d 
  never say he had an important game to play.</p>
<p> The telephone interrupted my conversation with Lu&iacute;sa. She answered.</p>
<p> &#8220;No, Nic&#8217;s not here... A message? Sure, say it... okay... WHO??&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa quickly hung up the phone.</p>
<p> &#8220;Who was it? Why did you scream?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t anything important... It was... A friend of Nic&#8217;s, 
  I just misunderstood his name. I thought it was someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p> I wasn&#8217;t convinced, but that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, what about us making a cake? A chocolate cake.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>One day left.</p>
<p> It was Friday, in the middle of February. I had a math test to study for that 
  night and went to look for Nic&#8217;s help, at his house.</p>
<p> Again, the phone interrupted us. Lu&iacute;sa answered.</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you calling again?&#8221;, she spoke quietly, but I could hear 
  from where I was. I started paying attention to Lu&iacute;sa instead of Nic, 
  who didn&#8217;t notice it and continued explaining to me how to solve that 
  Mars&#8217; equation. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you have any shame? Stop calling, he&#8217;s 
  busy! By the way... how did you get my phone number?&#8221;</p>
<p> She hung up. Called Val&eacute;ria.</p>
<p> &#8220;Did you give Cl&aacute;udio my phone number, Val&eacute;ria? Why did 
  you do that, you fuck! No, that was not him who called. Yes... Apologize! I&#8217;ll 
  forgive you when I find out what&#8217;s gonna happen from all this!&#8221;</p>
<p> She hung up and went to her room. I was curious... Who was calling?</p>
<p> &#8220;Wait... Val&eacute;ria gave Cl&aacute;udio Lu&iacute;sa&#8217;s number, 
  but he didn&#8217;t call her, and Val&eacute;ria knows who did... Cl&aacute;udio... 
  Wait! No! Not Adriana!&#8221;</p>
