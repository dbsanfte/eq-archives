<p><strong>FRIENDS</strong></p>
<p>When you need help, don't look for friends.<br>
  The true ones will show up for themselves.</p>
<p>When you need a shoulder to cry on, don't ask for one.<br>
  The true comfort will come from someone who sees your wet eyes without the need 
  of a word.</p>
<p>Don't tell your secrets to careless ears.<br>
  Share them with someone who really worries about you - even if it's only yourself.</p>
<p>Don't prostitute your feelings.</p>
<p>There is someone who deserves to know them.<br>
  There is someone who is willing to understand them.<br>
  And there is someone who will give a hand to help you, even if it's needed to 
  let go of his own support.</p>
<p>Look for your real friend.<br>
  *Don't take immitations!*</p>
