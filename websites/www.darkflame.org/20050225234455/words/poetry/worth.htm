<p> <strong>IT'S WORTH IT</strong></p>
<p>This is wrong.<br>
  It's wrong, wrong, wrong.<br>
  But I don't care - it's for you.<br>
  I'd do anything to have your love<br>
  I'd go through anything to get your affection.<br>
  This is risky<br>
  I know - but it doesn't matter<br>
  Doesn't matter how far I need to go<br>
  How high I need to climb<br>
  I'd do everything for you.<br>
  I'd live in an island<br>
  I'd count all the stars<br>
  I'd steal your heart<br>
  And would keep it with me<br>
  Then, I'd have it forever.</p>
