<p><strong>CHAPTER 7 - JUST AN ARGUMENT</strong></p>
<p>It was already morning. Without realizing it, I had fallen asleep there, beside 
  the pool. When I woke up the sun had already risen and lots of people were swimming. 
  Luckily, the place I&#8217;d chosen to feel sorry for myself at wasn&#8217;t 
  usually frequented.</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh my God, it's probably around ten in the morning... What do I do 
  now?&#8221;, I started crying again.</p>
<p> I was wearing my pajamas, and didn't really care about what others might be 
  thinking about it, seeing me there, sitting and crying and sneezing all the 
  time because I had slept outdoors.</p>
<p> I dried my tears, got up and ran to the chalet. No one was there. I quickly 
  changed my clothes and ran to the boys' chalet. It was locked, so I thought 
  that maybe Guilherme and Lu&iacute;sa were still there..</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic! Nic might be already here! He will help me out!&#8221;</p>
<p> I ran to the ward. It was easy to find him, even with the nurse not remembering 
  his name, since it wasn&#8217;t normal to find people recovering from apendicitis 
  in the campground.</p>
<p> I hurriedly opened the door to his room.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic! Nic, are you there? I need...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you, Paula&#8221;, Nic had a serious look 
  in his face, which wasn&#8217;t his usual one.</p>
<p> &#8220;What... What happened, Nic?&#8221;, I stopped, holding the door handle.</p>
<p> He was sitting on the bed. Without looking at me, he said, softly:</p>
<p> &#8220;I heard what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p> I didn't say anything.</p>
<p> &#8220;Cl&aacute;udio and Jo&atilde;o have been here. They told me you fought 
  with Val&eacute;ria. Paula, I... I'm so disappointed with you!&#8221;, now he 
  was staring at me, but it would&#8217;ve been better if he&#8217;d have kept 
  looking at the sheet. The expression on his face was disgusted, sad. Finally, 
  I managed to say something:</p>
<p> &#8220;Disappointed?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, why did you hit Val&eacute;ria like that?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, let me explain, I...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, there's no explanation for this! You started arguing, and then 
  you hit her, right when the others came back from the dancing club!&#8221;</p>
<p> I couldn't believe it. Val&eacute;ria just distorted the whole story. No, 
  that was not my friend, that was someone else.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, take it easy, things did not happen like that...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;How did things happen then? Paula, how could you hit Val&eacute;ria...?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Wait. Let me explain first, it seems like what they told you was wrong...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I know you were upset, but this is not the right way to relieve 
  your stress!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, she got me mad because I didn't want to agree with her. I thought 
  that Lu&iacute;sa shouldn't have slept with Guilherme last night, and...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What?&#8221;, he said, surprised.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, that's it, they... didn't they tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No... Are you saying that Guilherme...&#8221;</p>
<p> I nodded.</p>
<p> &#8220;Guilherme...&#8221;, Nic half smiled. But before I could continue speaking, 
  he started again: &#8220;Paula, look, I swear I don&#8217;t understand why you 
  fought.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, let me finish it, she got me mad, I said something without thinking, 
  she hit me and then...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Then you hit her back. I know all this, Paula! But I could understand 
  if Val&eacute;ria or Lu&iacute;sa ever did it, not you!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You've always been the calm one!&#8221;</p>
<p> I don't know what was happening to me, I was extremely upset. When I heard 
  Nic's last words, I just forgot to continue my explanations and exploded:</p>
<p> &#8220;Do you know why I&#8217;ve always been the calm one? Do you know why 
  I always seemed that way? Nic, I can&#8217;t deal with an argument, I ran out 
  of the chalet and spent the whole night beside the pool! I can't accept a normal 
  problem like what happened to you, even if someone says it's not serious, Nic! 
  I almost couldn't go on that damn slide!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, it's not that! You think it is, but...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But what? If you want to say that I&#8217;m a fool, go ahead! That's 
  okay, just say it! I know I am!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You've never been and never will be a fool or anything like that, I'm 
  just saying that I never imagined you could fight with one of your best friends 
  like that, Paula! I can't believe you could hurt Val&eacute;ria!&#8221;</p>
<p> I hurt Val&eacute;ria? What about all those things she told me, didn't they 
  hurt me?</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you're wrong! I... I...&#8221;</p>
<p> Once again, I couldn't deal with the situation. I ran out from the room, crying, 
  slamming the door.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, come back!&#8221;</p>
<p> I barely heard Nic yelling. At the ward's front door, I found Lu&iacute;sa 
  and Guilherme, who had just arrived there.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, what happened, why...&#8221;</p>
<p> I didn't wait for Lu&iacute;sa to speak, I didn't answer her. I was distraught, 
  and in a couple minutes I reached the chalet. It was empty. I closed the windows 
  and locked myself in there.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa looked at Guilherme.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic!&#8221;, they both said at the same time, and ran to his room.</p>
<p> Since no one answered the door knocks, they entered.</p>
<p> &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;, the bed was empty.</p>
<p> Guilherme went to the bathroom, the door was half opened. Nic was under the 
  cold shower water, with his head tilted up and his hands on the wall, still 
  in his clothes and all.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, what happened?&#8221;, he asked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa yelled, going to the bathroom. &#8220;Are 
  you crazy? I heard the doctor saying that you needed to rest!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I can't believe it, I just can't believe it!&#8221;, Nic yelled, hitting 
  the wall. By the way, it was his mark: hitting the first thing he could when 
  he was upset.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, get out of there now!&#8221;, Guilherme pulled Nic out of the 
  water. Lu&iacute;sa handed him a towel and the three of them sat on the bed.</p>
<p> &#8220;That's it. Now, could you please explain all this? Why are you so upset? 
  Why did Paula leave crying?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Crying? Shit, I'm just so stupid...&#8221;, Nic seemed to be calmer.</p>
<p> &#8220;What happened, for God&#8217;s sake? Did you break up?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, I mean, no... I don't know! Paula and Val&eacute;ria had a fight 
  last night, they hit each other, and I was mad at Paula because of it, but she 
  was upset, she said that she was a fool, a lot of bullshit, and I just lost 
  my patience, oh my God, I can't believe I did that!&#8221;, Nic was upset again, 
  speaking loudly.</p>
<p> &#8220;That's not possible...&#8221;, the two still didn't know what had happened 
  between the girls. &#8220;Nic, how could you do this, you love each other!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don't know, she was really mad, she said what they told me was wrong, 
  and I ended up not letting her explain herself!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'll look for her&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa said. &#8220;Nic, I promise 
  you I'll fix all this, ok? Just don't leave this bed again!&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa left running. Guilherme stayed awhile longer.</p>
<p> &#8220;Guilherme, is it true that you and Lu&iacute;sa...&#8221;, Nic said, 
  lightly. Guilherme smiled, embarrassed because Nic was his girlfriend's older 
  brother...</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa and Paula are so different... But Paula... I don't know, 
  I'd never leave her for anyone like Lu&iacute;sa...&#8221;</p>
