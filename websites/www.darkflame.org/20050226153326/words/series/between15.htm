<p><strong>CHAPTER 15 - MAGIC NIC</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Ten, nine, eight...&#8221;</p>
<p> A distant chorus, coming from the backyard, made us silent in the living room. 
  No, it was not a miracle, because the silence lasted only a couple microseconds.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s midnight and no one told us about it!&#8221;, one of the 
  cousins near the door yelled, and ran to the backyard. We all did the same, 
  and we still could get the &#8216;three, two...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;ONEEEE!&#8221;, we yelled louder.</p>
<p> Someone lit up a match and many rockets started to pop. We were all hugging, 
  happy.</p>
<p> &#8220;Happy New Year!&#8221;, one voice said. All the others answered in 
  a chorus:</p>
<p> &#8220;Happy New Year!&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going out, Nic?&#8221;</p>
<p> I was sitting in front of my house, admiring the beautiful January 4th morning.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going to my college to check it out, you know, registration, 
  books, and everything else. I can&#8217;t risk not having a place, right? Wanna 
  come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Sure, I sure have nothing else to do...&#8221;</p>
<p> We walked for a few minutes, the college Nic would be attending this year 
  was not far from home. Halfway there, he stopped.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, come here for a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nothing at all. I just want to know when the second part of the driving 
  school starts.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hmm, good, that what&#8217;s missing so everything would be perfect! 
  My boyfriend is getting his driver&#8217;s license!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, but I'm not going to be a taxi driver!&#8221;, he got some papers 
  in the school and looked at them. &#8220;But now that I'm over 18, anything 
  we do, I&#8217;ll be the one responsible for you.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What? Are you crazy? Did you drink alcohol, eat a banana...?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about bananas!&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, sorry...&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic got the information he needed and we left. In a few minutes, we reached 
  the college.</p>
<p> &#8220;I came to enroll...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;For...?&#8221;, the receptionist asked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Journalism. First year.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Fill this form out, this one too, and give me a copy of your ID.&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic did everything the woman told him to do, got the list of books he&#8217;d 
  have to read, and before we left, the woman looked at me, with a friendly face.</p>
<p> &#8220;What are you enrolling for?&#8221;</p>
<p> I looked at Nic and smiled.</p>
<p> &#8220;Look, I'd really like to, but unfortunately I'm still in high school...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, buddy!&#8221;, someone yelled from the end of the corridor, and 
  the yell echoed.</p>
<p> &#8220;J&eacute;! What are you doing here?&#8221;, the two of them approach, 
  I follow Nic.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hi Paula.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hi J&eacute;.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;ve just finished college, didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course I did... but I thought you&#8217;d want to be far from here 
  once you finished it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I did, but I have some documents here to get, and the guys set up a 
  basketball game here today.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But why do you have to go to college if you&#8217;re going to be a 
  basketball player?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to be a stupid player!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, cool. Well, I have already done what I was supposed to do, I 
  guess I'm leaving now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey Nic, stay here, play with us, how about it?&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic looked at me. I smiled and nodded.</p>
<p> It was a normal game, I mean, just for fun. Only Jefferson&#8217;s college 
  friends and some of his official team&#8217;s folks. Nic substituted for one 
  of them, and did pretty well, he played very nicely.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay guys, let&#8217;s have a break now!&#8221;, Jefferson climbed 
  up the bleachers to the restrooms. Nic sat beside me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you&#8217;re just disgusting!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, do I play that bad?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, look at you, all this sweat...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Ohh... I played well, didn&#8217;t you see?&#8221;, he hugged me and 
  tried to kiss me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Uck, don&#8217;t! Go take a shower or something...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll go home totally wet then...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;, I smiled.</p>
<p> A couple minutes later, Jefferson came over to Nic.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, tell them to continue the game without me, I have to eat something. 
  My stomach is yelling, &#8216;food, food!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic got up, talked to the guys and the game continued. Jefferson soon came 
  back and sat beside me, eating a big sandwich.</p>
<p> &#8220;Go, Nic, go, make a three-pointer and decide this game!&#8221;, Jefferson 
  yelled like crazy. Inside the game, he was just like that too. He had the throat 
  of a coach...</p>
<p> &#8220;This one is for Paula!&#8221;, and Nic scored three points. I smiled.</p>
<p> A few minutes later, Nic was near the basket again with the ball.</p>
<p> &#8220;And this one is for J&eacute;!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic scored again. I laughed.</p>
<p> &#8220;Wow, two-points. Thanks a lot, Nic! </p>
<p>After some time one of the players got hurt, and after a quick break the game 
  continued, with Jefferson in the team again. Soon, the sky got all clouded and 
  it started to rain. Light rain at first, harder afterwards, and the game would 
  have continued if the field hadn&#8217;t been so slippery. So, everyone decided 
  to go home.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you&#8217;re such a good player! I thought you&#8217;d spend all 
  your time on books...&#8221;, Jefferson walked with us through the corridors 
  to the street.</p>
<p> &#8220;Books, ha! Well, I always played games, people would pray for me to 
  play anything...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, he won the S&atilde;o Lucas&#8217; chess contest last year!&#8221;, 
  I announced. </p>
<p>&#8220;And my basketball team won the school tournament two years ago. Last 
  year, I didn&#8217;t play with them.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes... Okay, stop advertising yourself, I have something to ask you. 
  They&#8217;re looking for some guys for the basketball team in the gymnasium, 
  I'd suggest some friends of mine who were here, but they just left... I&#8217;ll 
  talk to them later. But, are you interested in joining the team?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Me? Well... when?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s for the regional tournament that ends in two months. But 
  the training starts next week.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Regional? I didn&#8217;t even know we had regional basketball games 
  here...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But we do. And it&#8217;s so popular that the team is not even completed 
  yet. Show up there tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be there and I&#8217;ll talk to the 
  coach.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay... but I'm a little untrained for this, don&#8217;t you think? 
  I&#8217;ve only played in high school and...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You know how to play, and you do it pretty well, that&#8217;s what 
  counts! Well, if you want, go there&#8221;, we were talking near the college&#8217;s 
  front gate, the rain had almost stopped and we decided to go home.</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll be there!&#8221; Nic yelled, now far from him. Then, 
  he turned to me: &#8220;Well, what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;ll be wonderful, Magic Nic!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Cool. What an idea of J&eacute;&#8217;s! Well, in two months... March. 
  I can stop to study.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you making plans already?&#8221;</p>
<p> He laughed.</p>
<p> &#8220;No! I'm going there just for fun...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But you&#8217;re really good at this.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>
<p> Capital Sin number eight: to praise Nicolas Porter. If someone is around, 
  it&#8217;s dangerous. He won&#8217;t stop feeling he&#8217;s the greatest.</p>
