<p><strong>WANNA HELP?</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in helping me with my site, here's what I need.</p>
<p>I don't have a very fluent English, so I have some difficult to translate my 
  stories. I make a lot of mistakes and I often don't know how to express myself 
  in English.</p>
<p>Ally is a very nice person and she's helped me a lot here. She's reviewed a 
  lot of things for me to make sure most error are eliminated. But there is still 
  a lot of texts left and I would love to have some other person to help me. All 
  you have to do is choose a text, read it, correct the errors and send it to 
  me.</p>
<p>Want more details? words@darkflame.org.</p>
<p>And thank you for your interest.</p>
