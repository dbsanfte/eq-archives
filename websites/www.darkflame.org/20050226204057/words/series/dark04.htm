<p><strong>CHAPTER 4 - CUPID'S ARROW</strong></p>
<p>End of January, Monday. Nic, Lu&iacute;sa and Ana Paula went to the school 
  to register with their mothers, Joana and Carolina. The three of them would 
  then study at night, Lu&iacute;sa in eight grade, Ana Paula in the first year 
  of high school, and Nic in the third -and last- year.</p>
<p> &quot;Where were you, Paula?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Sorry, Mom&quot;, she answered, and turned to Lu&iacute;sa. She continued 
  talking, while she was filling out the papers the secretary handed her. &quot;I 
  went to drink some water, and found a new girl who will be at my class. We talked 
  a little, she looks cool. Her name is Val&eacute;ria, and she moved here from 
  Porto Alegre a few days ago, with her parents and brother, who is attending 
  the first year of Administration college here. She didn't look upset about moving, 
  though.&#8221;</p>
<p> &quot;That's good&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said. &quot;We usually don't see new 
  people here, who want to be here! Oh, the classes start in two weeks, by the 
  way.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was a morning of a sunny and hot weekend. Lu&iacute;sa was talking to Ana 
  Paula in front of her house, while waiting for lunch to be ready.</p>
<p> &quot;Now I'll have to deal with him calling me Luzinha at school too...&quot;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Don't say that, Nicolas is a fine guy...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I know, I'm kidding. We used to go to school at the same time before 
  he started high school. But... Paula... tell me something... is it just my impression, 
  or, since Nic arrived from England do you always take him as the subject of 
  our conversations?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, it was you who talked about him first!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, it was me this time, but I've noticed it a lot of times. You're 
  always saying something about him, asking about him.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's just your impression, I think...&quot;</p>
<p> At that moment, they were interrupted by Nic, who had been yelling since before 
  leaving the house.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa! Hey, Lu&iacute;sa... Oh, hi, Paula! I didn't know you 
  were here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's no problem, I was going home already... My mother might be needing 
  some help in the kitchen... Bye, Lu&iacute;sa, bye, Nicolas.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Bye, Paula&quot;, the two of them answered.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa went inside the house with Nic.</p>
<p> &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Mom wants your help with some cards. Some baby souvenirs, I'm going 
  to buy the little plaster dolls to be glued in the cards.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, I'm going there right now. And hurry up, you, because the stores 
  will be closing soon, it's Saturday!&quot;</p>
<p> Nic left and Lu&iacute;sa walked inside, slowly, thinking. &quot;Well, Nic 
  is just like he's always been, he's always nice to everyone, but Paula... she's 
  so weird... I think there is something happening here...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa!!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm coming, Mom!&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>&quot;January twenty-fifth.<br>
  Blonde, glossy hair right above the eyes, blue eyes, tall, 1.80 meter or so, 
  seventeen years old, future journalism student. Smart, strong, cute, living 
  next door, and most importantly: single. I'm in love with Nicolas. Since when, 
  I don't really know. I thought about him a bit when he was away, and now he's 
  back and he's so different (better, of course). Something in this transformation 
  drew my attention. But I don't care what it may be. Today, instead of calling 
  me Ana Paula, he called me just Paula. Twice. I wonder what he thinks about 
  me? I&#8217;ve always called him Nicolas, I'm embarrassed to call him by his 
  nickname, Nic. No one knows about it yet, I didn't want to tell Lu&iacute;sa, 
  I'm such a chicken when it comes to love. But she suspects something, because 
  she said I'm weird and all I talk about is Nicolas. Some days ago, she told 
  me that he threatened Juliana when she started arguing with Lu&iacute;sa. But 
  he wouldn't hit her. He would never hit a girl, he did it just to scare her. 
  But I know that he could hit his best friend to defend someone. When he is around 
  me I get so nervous, I wonder if he notices it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p> Ana Paula was absorbed in her thoughts, writing, on her bed. Her mother called 
  her, and she left the diary there. Lu&iacute;sa was on the phone. She went to 
  the living room to answer to the call:</p>
<p> &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Paula?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Paula, I have something to tell you. Tomorrow is my mom's birthday and 
  she's going to be having a barbecue here. Your family is invited. I'm sorry 
  for telling you this late, but my mom just told me it.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's ok. At what time?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Around ten in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, thanks for inviting us. You can count on us tomorrow!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;We will. Now, I have got to talk to my uncles. I don't know why my mother 
  didn't decide on the barbecue earlier...&quot;</p>
<p> While they talked, Carolina had went to clean Ana Paula's room, and found 
  the open diary on the bed. She took it to put it on the bookcase and, involuntarily, 
  read what her daughter had just written.</p>
<p> &quot;She's in love...&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula went back and could see that her mother still had the diary in her 
  hands:</p>
<p> &quot;Mom!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry, it was open here and...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Did you read it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Only what you wrote today...&quot;</p>
<p> The girl blushed, and didn't say a word. Her mother noticed it, and said, 
  smiling:</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Mom, do you think I should go talk to Lu&iacute;sa about this?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa? Go straight to Nicolas!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, great idea! How? When he gets around me I get so nervous and can't 
  even say 'hi' like I should!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, so... If you think that it may help you, talk to Lu&iacute;sa.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Uh, I don't know... Speaking of Lu&iacute;sa, she said that tomorrow 
  is her mother's birthday and she invited us all to a barbecue at her house.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Great! A party is always nice, that's how I started dating your father.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, with his whole family around us.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, don't worry&quot;, still smiling. &quot;Talk to Lu&iacute;sa.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know, I get nervous...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, it's up to you. I won't get involved in it!&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Sunday, half past eleven in the morning. At Lu&iacute;sa's house, all her family 
  was together, and Ana Paula and her parents were there too.</p>
<p> &quot;I'm getting hungry&quot;, said Lu&iacute;sa. &quot;I'll go see if they 
  already started to bake the meat.&quot;</p>
<p> She got up and left her brother and cousins, who continued talking. Ana Paula 
  was with them, and decided to follow Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, wait! I'm coming with you...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I want to talk to you&quot;, she stopped in an empty corridor. Lu&iacute;sa 
  stopped too. &quot;I would like you to do me a... favor...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What favor?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... I mean, I wanted to tell you something, and I...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Come on, just tell me!&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula was anxious and couldn't speak, and she was looking around pointingly. 
  Lu&iacute;sa followed her gaze and ended up speaking herself: </p>
<p>&quot;Hold up, I got it. It's Nic, isn't it? I knew that... Do you want me 
  to go talk to him?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes I do, but...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't blush. I'll talk to him&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa didn't wait for Ana 
  Paula's answer, and went back with the others. She discretely spoke with Nic, 
  and no one paid attention to it. Only Ana Paula was looking at them, and she 
  saw it when Nic got up and went right to her. He approached, and said:</p>
<p> &quot;Say it, Paula.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Say it? Well, I...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know... What... did Lu&iacute;sa tell you?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;She said you wanted to talk to me... You can talk now.&quot;</p>
<p> 'Shit', Ana Paula thought. 'She should have told him everything. I don't even 
  want to think of myself screwing this all up!'</p>
<p> &quot;Talk to me, Paula&quot;, Nic said, touching her arm. &quot;Don't be 
  afraid of me.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm not afraid of you...&quot;, she answered, with a nervous smile.</p>
<p> &quot;So...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know how to say it... , are you sure Lu&iacute;sa didn't tell 
  you?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, man... I think I tricked you, didn't I? Yes, she told me everything&quot;, 
  now, he touched her hair.</p>
<p> Ana Paula smiled, when she saw his reaction to it:</p>
<p> &quot;That's good...&quot;</p>
<p> Nic kissed her. Carolina, watching the scene from the backyard, smiled. Her 
  husband noticed it and asked the reason for the happiness.</p>
<p> &quot;Look&quot;, she said. &quot;Paulinha must be happy now...&quot;</p>
<p> From the other side, Lu&iacute;sa was watching them too. She saw Nic saying 
  something to Ana Paula, and they went back to the group. After lunch, Nic left 
  with Ana Paula to the streets, to take a walk. But they didn't go very far, 
  because it started raining. At the house, Lu&iacute;sa was talking to her mother, 
  at the exact moment the couple arrived, holding hands.</p>
<p> &quot;Mom, what do you want for your birthday?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know, sweetie, I've got some gifts... Why?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;How about a daughter-in-law?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa pointed Nic and Ana 
  Paula.</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, look at that!&quot;, she laughed. &quot;What a nice surprise...&quot;</p>
<p> Before the night came, Ana Paula's parents went home, and she stayed there. 
  Hours passed, and soon it was dark.</p>
<p> &quot;Nicolas, it's getting late...&quot;, Ana Paula said.</p>
<p> &quot;So...? Your house is right beside mine... And I think you can call me 
  Nic now, right?&quot;, he kissed her.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>&quot;January, twenty-seventh.<br>
  Yesterday everything has been elucidated. Lu&iacute;sa did suspect I liked Nicolas, 
  and I found out that he likes me too. I was so nervous when he went to talk 
  to me, but everything went just fine. He's my boyfriend now.&quot;</em></p>
