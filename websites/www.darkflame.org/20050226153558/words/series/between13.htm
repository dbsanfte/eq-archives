<p><strong>CHAPTER 13 - COMING BACK</strong></p>
<p> &#8220;Home, sweet home...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Vacation, sweet vacation...&#8221;</p>
<p> We arrived at the bus station. It was already dark and the bus would take 
  some people to other cities around. My father was traveling for work, as always, 
  but my mother, Carolina, and &Aacute;lvaro and Augusto, the fathers of Guilherme 
  and Val&eacute;ria and Nic and Lu&iacute;sa, were there waiting for us.</p>
<p> &#8220;So, how did your vacation go?&#8221;, my mother asked, while helping 
  us put our luggage in the car.</p>
<p> &#8220;Great&#8221;, I looked at Nic and smiled. &#8220;Despite a little trouble 
  that we had...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What about you, Nic, did you get better?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do it again! If it weren&#8217;t for the scar, I'd 
  never remember I even had surgery!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Where&#8217;s Dad?&#8221;, I asked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Curitiba. He&#8217;ll be home for Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p> We all went to Nic&#8217;s house. Him, Lu&iacute;sa, my mother and I in a 
  car, and &Aacute;lvaro and their kids in another one.</p>
<p> We arrived and went into the house, leaving the luggage in the cars. We were 
  all in the living room, drinking soda and talking about the trip. Nic said something 
  about our misunderstanding, and instead of getting upset because of the memory 
  of it, I laughed. Now, it was only a memory, and it was fun remembering it.</p>
<p> &#8220;Some things happened here too, while you were out. Some important things&#8221;, 
  &Aacute;lvaro showed us a newspaper from a week ago.</p>
<p> &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Rubens, Joel, whatever, killed himself in the jail. He hung himself...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Irck, that&#8217;s awful...&#8221;, we looked at the paper.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s really awful, they should have put it on the front page!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;The press &#8216;remembered&#8217; you, and came to interview, photograph... 
  If you were here, it&#8217;d sure be on the front page.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220; &#8216;A bunch of kids capture a kidnapper who hangs himself in jail&#8217; 
  !&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It was not our fault, he was the crazy one!&#8221;, we laughed.</p>
<p> A half hour later...</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm going home, are you staying?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria asked his father, who got up.</p>
<p> &#8220;We&#8217;ll show up there later...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I hope so, it&#8217;s your home!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, I'm going to take a walk, see some friends&#8221;, Nic announced, 
  getting up too. &#8220;Anyone going with me?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Me&#8221;, Guilherme and Nic left.</p>
<p> My mother went home too, Augusto went to the cars to get the suitcases, and 
  Lu&iacute;sa, Val&eacute;ria and I stayed in the living room, talking.</p>
<p> &#8220;Christmas is the day after tomorrow, what are you going to do? </p>
<p>&#8220;I think my family is going to meet, just like last year, but only at 
  night, without a barbecue&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa said. &#8220;On New Year too... 
  you&#8217;re coming with us this year, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Of course...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;If anything goes wrong, we can celebrate somewhere else... I don&#8217;t 
  want to spend Christmas and New Year without Guilherme!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Me neither about Nic!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;And about Val&eacute;ria...&#8221; we looked at her.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, why are you looking at me like that...?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to have a boyfriend anytime soon?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s your problem, you&#8217;re going to be among two couples...&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, I'm exhausted, I&#8217;m going home to sleep...&#8221; Val&eacute;ria 
  could barely talk, because she was sleepy. It was one in the morning, and we 
  had been watching some videos for about an hour.</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re going alone?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Do I have any other choice? I don&#8217;t know where Guilherme is, 
  he didn&#8217;t come back yet...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Neither did Nic...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;They must be at someone&#8217;s house, some pub, don&#8217;t worry. 
  If you want, you can sleep here, we&#8217;ll wake you up when he&#8217;s here&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa offered the guestroom to her, and she accepted it.</p>
<p>Lu&iacute;sa and I finished the movie, and then fell asleep on the living room 
  floor.</p>
