<p><strong>CHAPTER 1 - IT HAPPENS</strong></p>
<p>That day, everything seemed to be going wrong for Lu&iacute;sa. Right after 
  lunch, she went to her school to get the results of her final exams, and had 
  an unpleasant surprise. She had failed.</p>
<p> 'Well... it was not actually a surpriiise... I was expecting that...', she 
  thought, while drinking some water, in the school yard.</p>
<p> Juliana, one of her classmates, approached her:</p>
<p> &quot;Hi Lu&iacute;sa! So, how did you do on your exams?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I failed&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said, coldly. &quot;And you knew that, 
  you've seen my results already. I think you saw everyone's results.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh... Man, what&#8217;s eating you? You don't need to jump on me, calling 
  me nosy. Ah, I've failed once too, that's not the end of the world!</p>
<p> &quot;And who said it is?&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa left. She was not in the best of moods, and didn't like the sarcastic 
  tone of the girl, who followed her to the school gardens outside.</p>
<p> &quot;All the guys are here, won't you stay and talk a little?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, thanks. I have better things to do&quot;, and still walking, without 
  looking back, Lu&iacute;sa answered dryly.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, what happened? Is it because of the results? What, people 
  who fail a grade now attack their friends too?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Damn, Lu&iacute;sa, I&#8217;m just kidding around! I never thought that 
  passing to the next school year was so important to you! Let's talk, maybe...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You thought it wasn&#8217;t important? Listen, what do you have in your 
  head where your brain should be? Of course it's important to me! I want something 
  from life, I'm not like you, a bitch!&quot;</p>
<p> Juliana stopped, surprised at Lu&iacute;sa's words. Lu&iacute;sa didn't stop 
  walking, and for a quick moment Juliana saw her going away, and then ran to 
  catch up to her, irritated.</p>
<p> &quot;What did you just say?&quot;, Juliana grabbed Lu&iacute;sa's shouder 
  and turned her around, staring at her.</p>
<p> &quot;The one who should do this&quot; and Lu&iacute;sa imitated her gesture, 
  violently, &quot;is me! You jerk, you still have the guts to come over here 
  to talk to me after all you have done?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What have I done? I can't understand, you must be...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh you can't? If you have already forgotten, the scatterbrain that you 
  are, let me refresh your memory: you met Douglas this morning in the gymnasium, 
  didn't you?&quot; And, yelling: &quot;You two stayed with each other the whole 
  time, did you not?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What?! Who made this up?&quot;, Juliana seemed embarrassed.</p>
<p> &quot;No one made it up! I SAW the two of you there! 'You're just the cutest 
  couple I've ever seen, Lu&iacute;sa', you used to tell me. This is so incredible! 
  I should have realized that you had a good reason to become friends with Douglas... 
  what a character! Dating your so-called friend's boyfriend, in front of everyone!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Particularly, I mean you're rotten, but you can take it as you like! 
  I don't care! I knew you would be there today, and I had such a surprise when 
  I arrived there and saw your deplorable self right in the place where I was 
  supposed to be! You still have the gall to come here and throw in my face the 
  fact that I failed in school and you didn&#8217;t!&quot;</p>
<p> Some people who were still around the garden, attracted by the argument, started 
  paying attention to the scene, but Lu&iacute;sa didn't seem to care. Juliana 
  didn't feel the same, though.</p>
<p> &quot;Who told you all this bullshit, Lu&iacute;sa?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I told you I saw it, no one told me. And it may be bullshit on your 
  planet, not here! Go away from me, you bitch...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You don't have the right to talk to me like that!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, yes I do&quot;. Some friends of the girls arrived, trying to end 
  the argument before they started to fight. But Lu&iacute;sa seemed to want to 
  fix things with Juliana by herself:</p>
<p> &quot;Leave us alone&quot;, she rolled her eyes at the boy who was trying 
  to calm her down. &quot;I have some things to resolve here, since she decided 
  to participate in my life more than she was allowed to.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;My opinion&quot;, Juliana instigated, with some fear in her voice, &quot;is 
  that all you are is jealous, because I passed the exams and you didn't, and 
  then you made up this slander!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Jealousy is the last thing on Earth I will ever feel about you! You 
  have absolutely nothing to be envied&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa lowered her voice, 
  speaking roughly. Juliana didn't answer immediately. Instead, she bent down 
  in a quick movement, filled her hand with sand and was about to throw it at 
  Lu&iacute;sa when someone who was right behind her grabbed her arm, and the 
  sand fell all over herself.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa held a delighted laugh, just like some others who were around.</p>
<p> &quot;You silly girl! You're the shame of our class! The only one who repeated! 
  You should not be studying at S&atilde;o Lucas! It's too much school for you!&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa smiled, driving Juliana even crazier. She watched other people 
  laughing too, while her arms were held by two boys.</p>
<p> &quot;I'll see you at S&atilde;o Lucas next year&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said, 
  turned around and left, in a better mood.</p>
<p> 'But there is still one thing left', she thought, annoyed. 'I still have a 
  couple things to tell Douglas, although I'd prefer not to look at him ever again.'</p>
<p> She walked for about fifteen minutes, followed a small street which led her 
  to a bigger one, parallel to the avenue she had just left, and stopped in front 
  of a corner house. With her hands in her pockets, she observed for a moment, 
  and stretched her neck forward, looking at the blind alley that came from the 
  side of that house. There were a few guys talking there, sitting on the sidewalk, 
  and among them, there was Douglas.</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, Lu&iacute;sa!&quot;, he saw her, and approached her, happily. She 
  dodged from the hug and the kiss. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What happened is over now. I don't want to see you anymore&quot;, she 
  said, with the most normal voice she could. &quot;You lied to me, and did that 
  to cheat on me. Look, sincerely, I feel so bad for being replaced by her. Terrible 
  choice.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What? I...&quot;</p>
<p> While he was thinking about a good thing to say, confused, she waved to the 
  other boys and said hello. She looked back at Douglas and, saying goodbye coldly, 
  turned back and left. From the corner, she still could hear laughs and someone 
  saying 'you're fucked up' to Douglas.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A half hour later, she was home. Not exactly home, but at her neighbor's, Ana 
  Paula, who was patiently listening to Lu&iacute;sa. Laying down on the girl's 
  bed, Lu&iacute;sa was telling her everything that had just happened.</p>
<p> &quot;I had an argument with Juliana and broke up with Douglas.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, I'm so sorry...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't feel sorry, Paula. Feel happy, because I owe you a big favor...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Aren't you upset?&quot;, Ana Paula looked at her, suspicious.</p>
<p> &quot;No... I think. I mean, I don't give a damn about Juliana. About Douglas... 
  well, yes, I feel upset, but I feel better when I think of what he has done 
  to me, he didn't like me.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Actually, liking both Juliana and you sounds impossible.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He was not worth my attention. He was playing with me the whole time. 
  Of course, it would&#8217;ve been worse if I had found everything out months 
  later... especially knowing that you could have helped me before, and you didn't!&quot;, 
  she laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;You're welcome. Actually I was afraid of telling you that. I hate gossip. 
  Especially when gossip may ruin something.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;... that would be ruined anyway, right? I bet he'll do the same to Juliana, 
  and she'll pretend not to see it. But I won't admit anyone doing that to me.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's good! Now I don't feel guilty for having heard his conversation 
  with her during class yesterday&quot;, they laughed.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa said she was hungry, and Ana Paula gave her a cake that she had 
  made that morning. They ate quietly, until the moment Lu&iacute;sa restarted 
  the conversation, like she was speaking to herself:</p>
<p> &quot;Isn't it incredible&quot;, a little bit of cake fell out of her mouth, 
  &quot;how Juliana made herself look bad. I agree that I went too far with that, 
  I yelled and stuff, but she was just worse... She was about to hit me...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry about her. She's weird like that. Just raise your hand to 
  see her running away.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I think everyone knows that by now.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Ah, let&#8217;s change the subject... did you get your results? How 
  did you do, did you pass the exams?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... no&quot;, she was clearly upset about that. &quot;But I knew 
  that. I totally blew off school this year. And besides, I think my mother is 
  waiting for me at my house. I left a long time ago. I'll talk to you later, 
  Paula.</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, good luck with your parents&quot;, the two of them got up and 
  went to the front gate. Ana Paula, inside, and Lu&iacute;sa, outside, still 
  talked a bit. &quot;If you have a problem, you can come hide here&quot;, she 
  smiled.</p>
<p> &quot;Thanks, but nothing will ease my death sentence...&quot;, and, trying 
  to look funny, Lu&iacute;sa made a gesture of a knife cutting her throat and, 
  upset, went home.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>She didn't make noise coming in, and found Joana, her mother, in the backyard, 
  taking care of some plants.</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, Mom&quot;, said Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, you finally arrived... I was starting to get worried! 
  I thought you'd go to the school and would be back soon...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yeah, I ended up meeting some friends before I got home, and went to 
  Paula's too. I just came from there.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's okay. Now, tell me how did you do in the exams?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well, I...&quot;</p>
<p> A voice coming from inside the house interrupted her:</p>
<p> &quot;Honey, where is the phone book?&quot;</p>
<p> It was Augusto, Lu&iacute;sa's father. Suddenly, she became afraid. She was 
  afraid her father would not react well to her school news, and was hoping that 
  she wouldn't tell it to him directly, but to her mother. She could tell him 
  when he got home from work, but he was home at that time.</p>
<p> &quot;Mom, what's Dad doing here? Shouldn't he be working?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes, but my car broke down when I was coming back from the doctor and 
  I called him to pick me up, and now he's looking for the mechanic's number...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I didn't see his car out there...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's in the garage.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh... right.&quot;</p>
<p> Just then, Augusto showed up in the backyard.</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, sweetie.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Honey&quot;, said Joana, and Lu&iacute;sa noticed from her voice that 
  she was expecting some good news. &quot;Lu&iacute;sa just arrived from school 
  with the exams results. Come on, Lu&iacute;sa, tell us how did you do on them&quot;, 
  she smiled at her daughter.</p>
<p> &quot;Well, I...&quot;, she looked at her father, and then at her mother. 
  &quot;I didn't get enough good grades. I failed.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What do you mean, failed?&quot; asked Augusto. Joana was not smiling 
  anymore.</p>
<p> &quot;I didn't do well on the tests. I have to repeat my grade!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You failed... But you were such a great student!&quot;, her mother said, 
  like she was waiting for someone to tell her the school was wrong with Lu&iacute;sa's 
  grades or something like that.</p>
<p> &quot;I've never been a great student, Mom... And this year I wasn&#8217;t 
  that good either, you knew that already.&quot;</p>
<p> A compelling silence took place. Lu&iacute;sa tried to break it, uncomfortably, 
  saying the first thing that came to her mind:</p>
<p> &quot;Well... so... ehh... About the next year's enrolling... At the school, 
  they told me that...&#8221;</p>
<p> &quot;You're going to another school&quot;, Augusto interrupted.</p>
<p> A pause. Lu&iacute;sa and Joana looked at each other.</p>
<p> &quot;What?&quot;, she asked.</p>
<p> &quot;That's it. S&atilde;o Lucas is too expensive. I spent a fortune this 
  year and I'm not going to do it again for you to do the same thing next year. 
  We'll look for a cheaper school.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But, Dad, I won't do this anymore, I was so close to passing, I don't 
  want to go to another school, all my friends are in S&atilde;o Lucas and I like 
  it there a lot!&quot;, her eyes were wet.</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, he said, without looking at her. &quot;I like S&atilde;o 
  Lucas very much too, you and your brother have studied there since you were 
  just kids, but our financial situation is not the same as a few years ago, and 
  I feel that all the effort I have put in your school year brought us no positive 
  result. I can't do this again, sweetie. I'd like to, but I can't. And maybe, 
  with all this, you&#8217;ll finally change your studying habits. You only got 
  worse and worse these years!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm sorry...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I have to go back to my office. I have the number, and I'll call them 
  when I get there, I have no more free time. Bye&quot;, he kissed his wife and 
  daughter and left.</p>
<p> &quot;Mom&quot;, cried Lu&iacute;sa, &quot;I don't want to go to another school...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Sweetie&quot;, Joana said, after being quiet the whole time. &quot;Your 
  father is right. He doesn't want to take you out of your school. He needs to 
  do that. We can't spend all this money anymore. I'm sorry, but if you had worked 
  harder, it wouldn't have happened.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Do something, Mom!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I can't do anything, I won't contradict your father!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... okay, just forget about it&quot;, she dried a tear. &quot;I'll 
  try to get used to this idea.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't be sad. I know it will be harder for you not to study with your 
  friends, but you'll make new ones... Even your boyfriend, he'll remain yours, 
  even if he's away...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't have a boyfriend anymore&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa interrupted.</p>
<p> &quot;...you don't?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No. I broke up with Douglas today, he cheated on me, he had a date with 
  Juliana.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, I'm so sorry...&quot;, Joana hugged Lu&iacute;sa, motherly.</p>
<p> &quot;That's no problem, Mom. It's better this way. He was not a nice guy. 
  I'm not sad.&quot;</p>
<p> They smiled, and Lu&iacute;sa left her mom to the plants and entered the house.</p>
