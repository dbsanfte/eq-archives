<p><strong>CHAPTER 3 - END OF YEAR</strong></p>
<p>It was the 25th of December. Joana's big family would celebrate Christmas with 
  a barbecue, at the house of one of her brothers.</p>
<p> At seven in the morning everyone was up already. Joana was defrosting some 
  meat, Lu&iacute;sa was helping Nic to wrap some gifts and Augusto was trying 
  to figure out, among the 400 Christmas tree lights, which was the one that was 
  not working. At nine o'clock, just like they had previously agreed, Augusto 
  went to his brother-in-law's house with his kids, and waited there for Joana, 
  who still had some things to do before leaving.</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know why she didn't do it before...&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa complained.</p>
<p> &quot;Take it easy. She is probably taking care of the food. It&#8217;s worth 
  the wait.&quot;</p>
<p> Joana soon arrived, with the food that they were waiting for. At three in 
  the afternoon everyone had had lunch. The men were talking in the living room, 
  the women were talking somewhere else, the kids were playing everywhere with 
  their Christmas gifts, and Nic and Lu&iacute;sa went to the streets to take 
  a walk with the rest of the older cousins. They weren&#8217;t used to hanging 
  out together, except on special occasions, but they were all good friends anyway.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>They talked, in a square, for hours. The sky started to cloud up, and they 
  decided to go home. When they arrived, it started raining. Some meat was being 
  baked again and people were eating, without waiting for them. The get-together 
  lasted until the night, when most of the people went home, including Lu&iacute;sa 
  and her family.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>After the first week of January went by, Lu&iacute;sa's father went back to 
  work and she felt obligated to ask him about her future school, because he hadn't 
  mentioned it yet. But she didn't even have to ask. One night, during dinner, 
  with all the family at the table, he announced:</p>
<p> &quot;I have decided where Lu&iacute;sa is going to study this year. She'll 
  attend eight grade again, at night, in S&atilde;o Lucas.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Really, Dad? Thanks! Thanks, Mom!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Congratulations, Luzinha, you lost the battle, but won the war!&quot;, 
  Nic said, hitting her on her back.</p>
<p> &quot;Don't call me Luzinha! Am I speaking Greek or something?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay. I give up. For now.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;We'll see.&quot;</p>
<p> After the dinner, Augusto went to the living room to watch TV, Joana left 
  for the kitchen. Nic knelt down in front of Lu&iacute;sa and, holding her hand, 
  he spoke, looking at the astonished face she had:</p>
<p> &quot;I am so sorry for having offended you, milady. Because of that, but 
  also because milady has achieved a great victory in the war, I want to have 
  the honor of taking milady to the movies this night. Milady Lu&iacute;sa Porter 
  is Sir Nicolas Porter's special guest.&quot;</p>
<p> She laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Um, that's right. Let's do it. I&#8217;m broke, so I will take your 
  invitation.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You selfish...&quot;, he got up and turned back to her, forgetting about 
  the staging.</p>
<p> &quot;You invited me!&quot;, she laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Okay&quot;, he looked at her again, standing up, in an polite position. 
  &quot;My carriage will catch milady in your room at eight o'clock.&quot;</p>
<p> Joana, who was coming back from the kitchen, heard Nic's last words, and laughed, 
  just like Lu&iacute;sa. Nic ended up laughing too.</p>
<p> &quot;My son is an actor!&quot;, Joana said.</p>
<p> &quot;So why are you laughing instead of applauding?&quot;, he asked.</p>
<p> &quot;Ok, superstar!&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa clapped once or twice.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A candidate to acting, but so unpunctual. Nic and Lu&iacute;sa arrived at the 
  theater over ten minutes late. Lu&iacute;sa didn't say anything, because she 
  was just a guest. But the part of the movie they missed didn't make any difference 
  in the end. They left walking slowly, talking and laughing, when it ended. Outside, 
  in the street, Nic said to Lu&iacute;sa:</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, isn't that guy...?&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa looked where Nic was pointing, and saw Douglas. More than that, 
  she saw a scene that made her feel like laughing. Juliana was sitting on the 
  sidewalk, crying, throwing all the mean names she knew at Douglas face.</p>
<p> &quot;It's just a pity that that idiot always ends up with a good deal...&quot;</p>
<p> And she was right, because Douglas left with another girl, leaving Juliana 
  alone.</p>
<p> Nic and his sister walked through her. Lu&iacute;sa gave her an evil smile.</p>
<p> &quot;What's your problem? Why are you looking at me like that?&quot;, she 
  spoke, with a red and wet face, and got up. &quot;What's the matter now?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I think this is not a good time to talk to me like that, you fool...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes&quot;, Nic said. &quot;Look, girl, I never liked you before, and 
  I think Douglas did so well on leaving you to be with that girl, because she's 
  prettier than you. I believe that's the only reason, though, because she must 
  be as superficial as you are. Don't come threatening Lu&iacute;sa.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What's that? What do you have to do with my life? What are you going 
  to do if I threaten your little sister, Nicolas? Are you going to hit me?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;If you really want to know, go ahead&quot;, he held Juliana's collar, 
  and then let her go. She looked at them, angry, and left.</p>
<p> &quot;Would you really hit her?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa asked, when Juliana was 
  far enough not to hear them talking.</p>
<p> &quot;Man, of course I wouldn't! I'd never hit a girl. Even if it's someone 
  like her. But there is something really true here: she's such a chicken, I can't 
  believe it!&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa laughed, agreeing, and thanked her brother with a handshake, 
  and they went back home.</p>
