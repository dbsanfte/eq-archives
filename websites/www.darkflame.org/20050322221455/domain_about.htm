  DOMAIN &gt; ABOUT <img src="square.jpg" width="7" height="7"></strong></font></p>
<p>This domain was registered in July 2004 because I always wanted to have a domain 
  and when I finally got a job and my own money, I bought it. It's for my own 
  pleasure, work and improvement. Unfortunately, I don't have time to update my 
  pages often, so they may seem a little neglected, but I'm always working on 
  them when I can. The domain expires in July 2005, but I plan to renew it until 
  the day I can't pay for it anymore.</p>
<p>The name Darkflame was chosen by both me and my boyfriend, when we were trying 
  to pick a name for the domain, and there is no special reason for the name, 
  other than it sounded nice. We even created a logo for it. My boyfriend actually 
  was the one who paid for the domain registration (and I pay for the host), so 
  this domain belongs to both of us. He barely uses it, but has free access to 
  it when he wants.</p>
<p>The layout is not darkflame-related, because I couldn't find anything on this 
  subject that looked nice. The picture is from <a href="http://www.corbis.com" target="_blank">Corbis</a>, 
  and the fonts used are Alladin and Verdana. Version 1 &quot;Changing Attitude&quot; 
  was lauched on February 14, 2005.</p>
<p>Domain registered at: <a href="http://www.100br.com.br" target="_blank">100br</a><br>
  Hosted at: <a href="http://www.hostnet.com.br" target="_blank">Hostnet</a></p>
<p>If you live in Brazil, I highly recommend 100br, because they register .com, 
  .org and .net domains for a very low price, in the local currency. As for the 
  host, it's very nice, no downtimes, but nothing particularly spectacular about 
  it.<br>
