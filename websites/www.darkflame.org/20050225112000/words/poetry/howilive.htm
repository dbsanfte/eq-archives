<p><strong>THAT'S HOW I LIVE</strong></p>
<p>That's how I live</p>
<p>There is not a way not to notice the sun, each time its rays lighten my way.<br>
  There is not a way not to notice a bird, each time my ears are delighted by 
  its singing.<br>
  There is not a way to pretend not to see the green, in this world in need of 
  forests.<br>
  There is not a way to pretend not to see the fruits, in this world in need of 
  food.</p>
<p>There is not a way to avoid a smile when a child is seen<br>
  In these days in need of affection.<br>
  There is not a way to avoid a tear dropping<br>
  In these days when your life is not yours.</p>
<p>It's impossible to look at the sky full of stars without feeling amazed with 
  the bigness of this glorious creation...</p>
<p>There is not a way not to notice.<br>
  There is not a way to pretend not to see.<br>
  There is not a way to avoid.</p>
<p>It's impossible not to think about you, each time I feel your presence in my 
  life.<br>
  It's impossible not to think about you, each time I see your importance in my 
  life.</p>
<p>It's impossible not to think about you<br>
  All the time.</p>
