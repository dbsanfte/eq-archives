<p><strong>CHAPTER 10 - A NICE BATH</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Paula, please listen to me... Nic cares about you so much, can&#8217;t 
  you see that that happened in a moment of weakness, it could&#8217;ve happened 
  to anyone!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Guilherme, I'm sorry, but I'm really not interested in any of this. 
  There&#8217;s nothing Nic can say to change what I&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Give him another chance. Everything was so confused, Nic couldn&#8217;t 
  get out of that room, he didn&#8217;t know where you were, what you were thinking, 
  I... If I were him, I would have probably done something irrational too...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I did irrational things, Val&eacute;ria! I slept outside beside the 
  pool, I fought with Nic for no reason. But if he did this, it was because he 
  didn&#8217;t really trust me, he didn&#8217;t think I'd come back to apologize!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, come on!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa was upset. &#8220;Can&#8217;t 
  you stop talking crazy and think about what&#8217;s really happening? Put yourself 
  in Nic&#8217;s place! You could leave this chalet right now and kiss the first 
  guy you saw, and that would certainly not change what you feel about Nic!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm disappointed in Nic!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s stop with all this&#8221;, Guilherme got up from the 
  chair he was sitting on and looked at me, then glanced at Lu&iacute;sa and continued 
  walking through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more fights here. Let&#8217;s at least try to have a decent conversation. 
  Look, Paula, if you don&#8217;t want to hear it, we understand. Think a little 
  about what you&#8217;re doing and come to a conclusion by yourself. But there 
  is one thing: the nurse said that tomorrow Nic may leave the ward.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He&#8217;s fine, won&#8217;t be staying there anymore. So you better 
  get ready because he will do anything and everything to have you back with him.&#8221;</p>
<p> That could only be a dream. Looking at Nic was the last thing I wanted. I 
  wasn&#8217;t prepared for the amount of trouble this vacation brought to me. 
  And if we were home, nothing would have happened.</p>
<p> We stayed at the chalet for a long time, maybe hours. Guilherme, Lu&iacute;sa 
  and Val&eacute;ria talked, but nothing relating to Nic or me.</p>
<p> Guilherme was looking at a perfume bottle that was laying on the table, Lu&iacute;sa 
  and Val&eacute;ria were looking at me, when someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, let us come in!&#8221;, Alice&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p> &#8220;Open the door!&#8221;, Adriana&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p> Hysterically, Lu&iacute;sa went near the door and yelled:</p>
<p> &#8220;Get out of there, Adriana, if I ever see your face I will hit you like 
  you never thought you could be hit!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, take it easy, it&#8217;s dark, it&#8217;s late, it&#8217;s going 
  to rain soon, where are we going to sleep?&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa hesitated for a moment, and opened the door, letting only Alice 
  in.</p>
<p> &#8220;What&#8217;s this? Let me in!&#8221;</p>
<p> A thunder preceded Alice&#8217;s words:</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you gonna leave Adriana outside?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You guys inside&#8221;, Adriana yelled, becoming desperate with the 
  idea of spending the night outside in the rain. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget my 
  things are in there, and I need some place to sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Shut up, Adriana! You are not coming in, fuck your things, fuck where 
  you&#8217;re going to sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, Lu&iacute;sa, you can&#8217;t do this! She&#8217;s my friend and 
  it&#8217;s our chalet too!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Do you know what she did?&#8221;</p>
<p> Alice hesitated. As if she had not heard Lu&iacute;sa, she continued:</p>
<p> &#8220;If she&#8217;s going to be outside, I'm going too&#8221;, Alice opened 
  the door and left the chalet. &#8220;And if we decide to talk about it with 
  the campground&#8217;s directors, your vacation will end right now!&#8221; she 
  shut the door. Val&eacute;ria ran after Alice.</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria, don&#8217;t go!&#8221; Lu&iacute;sa was watching from 
  the door.</p>
<p> &#8220;You two&#8221; Adriana and Alice turned back. &#8220;If anyone ever 
  gets to know what happened here, you&#8217;ll regret it. Don&#8217;t you dare 
  tell this to anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re afraid now, huh? Listen, Adriana likes Nic and she&#8217;s 
  fighting for him, you don&#8217;t have anything to say about it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it fighting, just being manipulative. There&#8217;s 
  never been any cheating between us, until now! So it will be very difficult 
  to forget what you did, Adriana... It figures it had to be someone from outside 
  to ruin our relationships!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re so perfect, and anyone who does not have blue blood 
  breaks the harmony!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Anyone who doesn&#8217;t have any sense of shame, you mean!&#8221;</p>
<p> The first drops of water began to fall. Val&eacute;ria didn&#8217;t say anything 
  else, and went back to the chalet.</p>
<p> &#8220;Just forget about that help we promised you about Cl&aacute;udio, Val&eacute;ria, 
  until the day you come to say you&#8217;re sorry for everything you just told 
  us!&#8221;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria stopped at the door, without turning around. Without a word, 
  she entered.</p>
<p> Guilherme and I looked at each other, and then we looked at Val&eacute;ria 
  and Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm sorry, Val&eacute;ria&#8221;, I said. She was looking at the ground 
  and didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p> After that, we fell asleep.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have slept in our chalet, with Cl&aacute;udio and Jo&atilde;o&#8221;, 
  said Guilherme, who had slept with us. Everyone was up already.<br>
  &#8220;And the confusion must be calming down by now...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria... forgive me, please... I know you liked Cl&aacute;udio, 
  but it couldn&#8217;t just stay like that...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault. Adriana screwed everything up&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;We still have almost two entire weeks here&#8221;, Guilherme spoke, 
  with a scratchy voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re enjoying it this 
  way. So, if you want, we can go back home tomorrow...&#8221; Lu&iacute;sa looked 
  at him, getting his point. To fix it all, put a finger right on my bruise: the 
  guilt.</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to end your vacation!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa and I started it all off. Our vacation is gone, too&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;I told you that you have nothing to do with it, not you or anyone else 
  here, oh shit! If Adriana really wanted to do what she did, she&#8217;d do it, 
  with a sick Nic, with a healthy Nic, with an upset me, with a happy me! SHE 
  screwed up our vacation!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I think that if you talk to Nic, we can still have some good moments 
  without them here&#8221; Lu&iacute;sa looked at me. I didn&#8217;t answer. We 
  were all quiet.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula! Open this door!&#8221;</p>
<p> We got scared. It was Nic.</p>
<p> &#8220;I know you&#8217;re there, Paula, open the door!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm opening it&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa got up and opened the door. Before 
  she did that, I had already ran and locked myself in the bathroom.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you&#8217;ll need to use all your skills if you want to have Paula 
  back...&#8221;, Guilherme looked at him out of the corner of his eyes.</p>
<p> &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;In the bathroom. She won&#8217;t leave any time soon.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;We&#8217;ll let you guys alone&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria left the chalet, 
  the others went with her.</p>
<p> &#8220;Stay around, in case I need someone to help me take the knife out of 
  her hand&#8221;, Nic said, motionless.</p>
<p> &#8216;Nic, how can you say jokes at a time like this?&#8217;, I thought.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, come out, I want to talk to you&#8221;, he knocked on the door, 
  softly. I didn&#8217;t answer. I was crying. &#8220;Paula... all right, you 
  can stay there, but you&#8217;re going to hear me anyway. I don&#8217;t have 
  much to say, as you must be thinking, but... please, stop crucifying me!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8216;Stop, Nic, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8217;, I was with my hands on my 
  ears, but his voice kept going through my fingers.</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm so sorry, Paula, I didn&#8217;t know what I was...&#8221; I suddenly 
  opened the door, interrupting him. I slipped through the space between Nic and 
  the door, trying not to touch him. He followed me, at a certain distance.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, wait!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hun, things are getting worse&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa, Guilherme and Val&eacute;ria 
  were watching us. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s better we go after them.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I think it&#8217;s better we don&#8217;t. Maybe alone, Nic might manage 
  to talk to her&#8221;, and the three of them went to the snack bar.</p>
<p> I walked, and walked, until I reached the lake in front of the forest and 
  stopped, turned back to face Nic. He stopped too, but didn&#8217;t approach 
  me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, I know you&#8217;re upset with me, but you have no idea how 
  I am feeling myself. I'm so bad, I'm making an enormous effort to talk to you, 
  because the truth is I don&#8217;t know where to hide...&#8221; he was gesturing, 
  somewhat between confused and upset.</p>
<p> I fell on the ground, in tears.</p>
<p> Nic approached me, but stayed up, waiting for me to get up.</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm sorry, once more.&#8221;</p>
<p> I got up when he said that. I got up and ran to the woods. Nic didn&#8217;t 
  say a word. He didn&#8217;t follow me either.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The others talked at the snack bar.</p>
<p> &#8220;Look... I&#8217;ll talk to Paula, I&#8217;ll try making her think differently, 
  but I can&#8217;t believe Nic cheated on her myself.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Lu&iacute;sa, that happens...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I know, but... Nic? Nic is not like that... He&#8217;s one of the few 
  guys I know who take things so seriously, who is so sincere...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Really? Who are the other ones?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re one of them, of course...&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa hugged Guilherme. He looked at Val&eacute;ria, who smiled, and 
  said:</p>
<p> &#8220;She loves me, look at that! If I climbed up on a stage, she&#8217;d 
  make the noise of an entire crowd crazy for me!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re spoiling my brother, Lu&iacute;sa! He thinks he&#8217;s 
  just the best, the king of the world!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;At least I'm the king of this little heart that&#8217;s beating inside 
  Lu&iacute;sa, carrying her blood and food to her cells, and giving her the energy 
  needed to hug me!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He has a different concept than other lovers&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa explains, 
  laughing. &#8220;The heart is not the home of love, but the place where energy 
  comes from to make the brain able to love! I mean, totally important for the 
  whole process. If Guilherme wrote a poem, he&#8217;d win the Nobel for Medicine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Paula&#8217;s heart is out of order?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No!&#8221;, everybody laughs. &#8220;She&#8217;s crazy, that&#8217;s 
  it. My God, she may not know why Nic did that, but how can she not realize he&#8217;s 
  sorry for it?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;She built a wall in her mind, subconsciously, which prevents her from 
  realizing anything, and all she can think about is the bad things, the worse 
  things, the terrible things...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Holy Christ, stop with this bullshit!&#8221;</p>
<p> The three of them continued talking randomly for a couple minutes, when Val&eacute;ria 
  looked behind Lu&iacute;sa and Guilherme and totally changed the expression 
  on her face. From happy, she went to sad, upset, disappointed.</p>
<p> Guilherme and Lu&iacute;sa turned back right in time to see Alice, Jo&atilde;o 
  and Cl&aacute;udio. In time to see Cl&aacute;udio turning his back to them. 
  Or more specifically, to Val&eacute;ria. She got up and ran to the bathroom.</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa ran after her, leaving Guilherme 
  alone. &#8220;Val&eacute;ria, please, don&#8217;t do this...&#8221;</p>
<p> In an isolated place, Val&eacute;ria cries.</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria... don&#8217;t cry... Look... If Cl&aacute;udio is doing 
  this to you, it&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t want anything with you, I mean...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I know what&#8217;s happening! They told him what I wanted and now 
  he&#8217;s ignoring me! And it&#8217;s not because he doesn&#8217;t want anything 
  with me, like you said... He&#8217;s doing it for the same reason we are! Because 
  of friendship! To them, we are the ones at fault...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Val&eacute;ria, do you think I'm happy for having fought with them? 
  It could last only one month, it could definitely end when we leave this place, 
  but we were still friends! But we can&#8217;t, not like this. They are supporting 
  Adriana, we are not, and I don&#8217;t want to talk to one of them and pretend 
  everything is okay. Don&#8217;t think I'm against you too, but it&#8217;s better 
  that you lose the opportunity to give Cl&aacute;udio some kisses, than doing 
  it and messing with Paula and Nic&#8217;s relationship forever.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I know. How do you think I'm feeling? I pissed off Paula and...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;For the last time, stop blaming yourself! Are you obsessed or what?&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa yelled, and then spoke softly. &#8220;This all began after your 
  fight, and, even if it didn&#8217;t, the trouble is there and now the ones who 
  need to fix it are Paula and Nic, only the two of them. Do you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, okay...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Great. Let&#8217;s go back to the table now. Look right in the eyes 
  of whoever you need to, show everyone that much more is needed than a &#8216;no&#8217; 
  from a guy to upset you!&#8221; Guilherme was still at the table. He was holding 
  his head with one hand, and the other was playing with a piece of paper.</p>
<p> &#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Might have gone to the pool.&#8221;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria looked at the part of the pool we could see from the snack 
  bar. It was full of people, it&#8217;d be hard finding someone specific there.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey guys...&#8221;, Guilherme stopped playing with the paper and raised 
  his head, confused. &#8220;Adriana was not with them!&#8221;</p>
<p> They looked at each other, puzzled. All of a sudden, at the same time, they 
  got up in a hurry and ran to the woods.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I guess it was actually better that I ran from Nic. I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t 
  have been able to listen to him there. Maybe it was better to run than keep 
  looking at him, hidden, listening to him.</p>
<p> Right after I entered the forest, I leaned on a tree and cried. I had never 
  cried like that in my whole life, but the idea of losing Nic was just killing 
  me. This, added to the fact that I didn&#8217;t have any courage to admit that 
  I loved him and to forgive him, like Nic did, made my lachrymal glands work 
  like never before. The one in this whole story who I should blame for that was 
  myself, I knew Nic wouldn&#8217;t cheat on me anymore if we got back, but I 
  just couldn&#8217;t do it. In fact, I don&#8217;t know what I was afraid of. 
  While thinking about all this, I started going back to Nic&#8217;s place, slowly, 
  ready to forget everything and make things back to normal again. &#8216;Within 
  a few days, no one will remember anything&#8217;, I thought.</p>
<p> When I was almost at the edge of the forest, I stopped and observed. Nic couldn&#8217;t 
  see me, he was looking at the lake, sometimes he would throw a little stone 
  on the water. I took a step in his direction, but receded. Someone was coming 
  and I knew exactly who it was, to my despair.</p>
<p> &#8220;Niiiic... are you there?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8216;Bitch&#8217;, I thought. I hid myself behind a big tree. Nic didn&#8217;t 
  move.</p>
<p> &#8220;I finally found you!&#8221;, a sweet, malicious voice. &#8220;I thought 
  you had disappeared, evaporated... You are a good hider, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What do you want, Adriana? Wasn&#8217;t it enough for you, ruining 
  my relationship, my vacation, what&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You know what&#8217;s next...&#8221;, she held him from his back, caressing 
  his chest. If there weren&#8217;t so many bugs in that tree, I would have pulled 
  a piece of it with my teeth, I was feeling so angry.</p>
<p> &#8220;Get out of my life, Adriana!&#8221;, Nic got up abruptly, throwing 
  her to the ground.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hey, take it easy! I won&#8217;t bite you... And keep in mind there&#8217;s 
  only two weeks left, you wouldn&#8217;t wanna waste them, would you? I can give 
  you what Paula never did...&#8221;</p>
<p> I wanted to kill her right then. In the worst way I could think of.</p>
<p> &#8220;You&#8217;re such a whore, Adriana&#8221;, Nic grabbed her shoulders, 
  and pushed her to the lake. In this very moment, Lu&iacute;sa, Val&eacute;ria 
  and Guilherme arrived.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic! What have you done?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa smiled. Adriana looked 
  at them, angry and embarrassed, from the lake, totally wet. Seeing her, they 
  started laughing. Including Nic. Including me.</p>
<p> I left my hideout and ran to him. I hugged him as tight as I could.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, I'm sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I love you, Paula!&#8221;</p>
<p> That&#8217;s it. It was over. Just a little gesture, a simple gesture, gave 
  me back my happiness. Nic was mine again.</p>
