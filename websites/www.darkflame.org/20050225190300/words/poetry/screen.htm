<p><strong>SCREENPLAY</strong></p>
<p>There's no use in trying to sleep<br>
  Trying to dream<br>
  Trying to forget<br>
  A poem if everything I can get<br>
  To express my feelings<br>
  To show the world who I am<br>
  How I am<br>
  To show who you were<br>
  Who you are not anymore<br>
  Not here<br>
  To show the magic of a bird<br>
  Of a soft feather that landed on my window<br>
  To show the magic of the world<br>
  That walks, that lives, that runs<br>
  That doesn't see me<br>
  That doesn't care<br>
  That is touched by the story<br>
  Of the poor woman, the poor man<br>
  The poor world<br>
  The poor world that watches me<br>
  Watches, cries<br>
  Like my life was like a movie<br>
  My sadness, a song<br>
  Its name, a big sign<br>
  When the night comes, the lights turn on<br>
  Stopping the magic<br>
  Abandoning me once again<br>
  To my deepest sorrow.<br>
  Where's the world?<br>
  The world sleeps... the world dreams... the world forgets...</p>
