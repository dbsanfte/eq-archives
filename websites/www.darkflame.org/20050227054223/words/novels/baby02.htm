<p><strong>PART 1 - MEMORIES<br>
  CHAPTER 2 - ARRIVING</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Enny... I had never met any girl with this name...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I admit it's a beautiful name, just like it's owner!&quot;, Lucas wasn't 
  playing anymore. Like Michael, now he was only eating the cookies and listening 
  to Stuart, who was still looking at the street, from the window. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Stu, we thought you had died in there!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Give me a break! Hey... Can you see that girl over there? The blonde 
  one, with the little boy...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes, so what?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;She's so pretty, she has some beautiful blue eyes... She bumped into 
  me in the plane. Her name is Enny Hills.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Stu, you already know her name?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes... I wonder if I will ever see her again?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;If I were you, I wouldn't count on it. See, that's dad.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Mr. Wire, nice to see you!&quot;, Lucas opened his arms and his father 
  received him with joy.</p>
<p> &quot;Hello, Lucas! Hello, Stu, hello, Mike!&quot;, Randy had a tiny accent. 
  He've known the Portuguese language perfectly for over 20 years, and that was 
  how he liked to spoke with his sons.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Stu, it started raining, can't you see? Stop talking and close this window, 
  the radio is getting wet!&quot;</p>
<p> Michael got up and ran to the window, closing it. The rain noise sounds more 
  distant.</p>
<p> &quot;Mike, sorry, I didn't see... I didn't see the radio, the rain is so 
  nice...&quot;</p>
<p> Lucas laughed.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Randy got in the car with his sons, a brand new Mercedes Benz, bought not so 
  long ago.</p>
<p> &quot;Things seem to be good, uhn, dad? New car...&quot; the boys would look 
  every single detail of the seats, the panel, all those little buttons distributed 
  around the car.</p>
<p> &quot;Thanks God things are always getting better! Maybe you guys can come 
  live with me some day?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Dad, we've already talked about that...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, forget it...&quot;, the semaphore green light turned on, and Randy 
  continued driving.</p>
<p> The first and only experience with the boys living in the USA, about a year 
  before, was not very pleasing. During the six months the boys lived there, the 
  contact with Clara was more intense than normal, and it ended up annoying Randy 
  a lot. Then they decided to come back to Brazil and not to talk about moving 
  again, for some time.</p>
<p> &quot;Dad, where are we going?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I want you to go to the new mall that's been built near my house. You'll 
  love the McDonald's things there. I personally cannot understand how you never 
  get tired of those snacks...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't pretend you don't understand, dad! We all know you're such a kid, 
  love to go out and have fun with the other kids... And you don't miss McDonald's 
  either.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Ok... Well, can you see that building, full of glass windows? It's there. 
  It's some blocks from home, so you can finally walk here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It depends... is this place full of nice people?&quot;, Stuart looked 
  at every face he could, in the crowded sidewalks, while the car passed by.</p>
<p> &quot;You'll see it! Well, here we are. The parking lot is in the subsoil, 
  you stay here and I'll be right back.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;You remember? Stuart wouldn't miss any cute face that day!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He was discovering the goodies of life. But he just 'looked', didn't 
  'act'!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't mess with me, Mike! I always liked girls!&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Man, what a place!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's really cool! Look at that...&quot;, from the third floor, Lucas 
  looked at the July 4th decoration. &quot;They do like this day...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Independence day is beautiful here, Lucas... I know you know it...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I can't get tired of it.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course, he dates the Miss Summer every year!&quot;</p>
<p> Lucas hits Michael, and they laugh. Indeed, Lucas was kind of popular among 
  the girls. The three boys looked like their father, who looked like he was 30, 
  when he was actually 45.</p>
<p> &quot;There!&quot;, Stuart interrupts the conversation, looking ahead. The 
  rest of them do the same.</p>
<p> An enormous plaque tells them that some meters from them there is the always 
  crowded and colorful place they loved: McDonald's.</p>
<p> &quot;Attack!&quot; Stuart runs first, like a little kid, Lucas and Michael 
  exchange glances, laughing.</p>
<p> &quot;Hey boy, wait for me!&quot; Randy ran after Stuart, being followed by 
  the other two sons.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;That place looked like hell, so crowded, we couldn't even walk!&quot; 
  Lucas remembered, laughing, of the moment she accidentaly hit Michael, who threw 
  his Coke all over two girls who were near him. 'Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean 
  it, do you want some napkin?' Man you're such a gentleman!&quot;, he said, ironically. 
  &quot;Mike, you could at least have made a serious face while apologizing!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, you were all dying of laugher, how could I hold myself?&quot;, Mike 
  was laughing.</p>
<p> &quot;Lucas, there's a call for you&quot;, Clara knocked the door, and opened 
  it enough to give him the phone.</p>
<p> &quot;Ok guys, excuse me, this may be important&quot;, Lucas left, a serious 
  face.</p>
<p> A brief silence is broke by Michael:</p>
<p> &quot;So, Stu? Go on.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The three of them, along with Randy, left the snack bar, laughing.</p>
<p> &quot;Did you see their faces? 'Oh my God, what a shame, three cute guys laughing 
  at us, and we're all wet, shy, mute!'&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Mike, that's why you don't have any girl! You should offer the girls 
  a tube bath instead of a napkin!&quot;, Stuart barely spoke, laughing.</p>
<p> &quot;Who told you I don't have any girl? I ensure you that if I want to date...&quot; 
  Michael looked around, and pointed to a group of girls who were talking, &quot;any 
  of those girls, I will do it!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What I meant was that you never last long with any girl, but anyway... 
  Go, Mr. Perfect!&quot;, Lucas pulled him.</p>
<p> &quot;Take it easy, I have my own legs and I know the way...&quot;</p>
<p> Michael approached the girls and started talking to the brunette one. A couple 
  minutes later, she left her friends, and went downstairs with him. He discretly 
  looked at the others and laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Something's not right, I want to see it by myself!&quot; Stuart ran 
  to the elevator.</p>
<p> &quot;Go with him, Lucas, if you want to&quot;, Randy said. &quot;I don't 
  want to participate in my sons' dates! And it's hard to follow you everywhere 
  you go...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, so do this, dad: go home, get the pool ready with some stuff for 
  us to eat, we'll soon be there!&quot;, Lucas ran, so he wouldn't miss the elevator. 
  Randy smiled, shook his head, turned back and went away.</p>
<p> Michael is soon being watched by his brothers.</p>
<p> &quot;Son of a bitch he is, he actually did it!&quot;, Stuart and Lucas observed 
  Michael, who was holding and kissing the girl, in a bench near the bathrooms.</p>
<p> &quot;Well, I really don't feel like watching this&quot; Lucas turned back.</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, let's go home then&quot;, Stuart took a couple steps aside, making 
  himself visible to Michael. &quot;Hey, Michael!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What are you doing?&quot;, Lucas laughed, and joined Stuart, who kept 
  yelling, in English, when Michael saw him.</p>
<p> &quot;We're going home, and we'll wait for you there! Don't be late!&quot;</p>
<p> He answered with an 'okay' sign, kind of unquiet. The others left, still laughing.</p>
<p> &quot;Your friends?&quot;, Lucy asked Michael.</p>
<p> &quot;Brothers... Well, Lucy, I've got to go now...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's up to you... Look, here's my phone number.&quot;, she scribbled 
  a number in a piece of paper.</p>
<p> &quot;Thanks!&quot;, one last kiss, and Michael left.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't even call the poor girl!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I told you I did that because you dared me to!&quot;</p>
