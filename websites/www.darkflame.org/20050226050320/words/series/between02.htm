<p><strong>CHAPTER 2 - THE FIRST IMPRESSION</strong></p>
<p>A half hour later, a cold wind started blowing, so we went to the snack bar. 
  We had just a towel over our swimwear, the guys had T-shirts, and the wind was 
  getting harder. So we sat at one of the few remaining tables inside the snack 
  bar, beside a glass window, which we could see a part of the pool and some huge 
  trees from, which were swinging harder and harder.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the weather doesn't change and mess up our vacation&quot;, Jo&atilde;o 
  said, kind of worried.<br>
  All of a sudden... Broom! Thunder. The first drops of water began to fall, quickly 
  turning into a big rain. The people who were outside had to run inside and there 
  was almost no room for everyone. The wind was so hard that we had to close all 
  the windows. The rain was getting harder, and everyone in the camp, which was 
  probably everyone in the snack bar at that moment, couldn't stop complaining.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh man, our first day here and it rains like this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything always happens to us...&quot;, moaned Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck one of the pine trees across the little lake 
  some meters from us, burning the poor tree and making a very big noise. Some 
  scared people screamed, some others were shaking, I just couldn't watch it. 
  I found my place beside Nic, and held him. We wanted to go somewhere else because 
  the noise was incredibly loud near the windows, but we just had nowhere to go. 
  Another thunder, and all the lights went off. We stayed there in the partial 
  darkness. The sky was dark, which was normal in this type of summer storm. Suddenly 
  someone leaned on me, and I lost my balance. Nic hit Adriana, who was sitting 
  beside him, and she fell down. Trying not to fall, she grabbed Nic's shirt and 
  he almost fell too.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Adriana!&quot;, said Nic, helping her to get up.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Nic, I'm the one who should be sorry, I think I ripped your shirt...&quot;, 
  she said, in a weird tone of voice, looking into Nic's eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then... I think... I think you can let go of my shirt now...&quot;, 
  he said, trying to smile, kind of disconcertedly, when he saw my face, looking 
  at Adriana. Man, was she arrogant. After getting up she was still holding my 
  boyfriend's shirt!</p>
<p>I decided to forget about that. I didn't want to get in trouble with my roommate 
  in the very first day. But her tone of voice when she apologized never left 
  my mind...</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It rained for about an hour. Half of the afternoon was lost. At four-thirty 
  the weather calmed down, but outside, mainly near the snack bar, everything 
  was dirty and messed up. Obviously no one remembered to take their snacks and 
  drinks inside, and the wind had blown it all on the floor. Some people went 
  back to the pool. We did too, but the water was so cold after the rain and we 
  stayed outside, talking. Nic was making his usual jokes, that weren't that funny, 
  but we laughed remembering other funnier situations. Obviously, Adriana, Alice, 
  Cl&aacute;udio, and Jo&atilde;o wouldn't understand anything...</p>
<p>We were having fun, the sun was shining again and there were almost no clouds 
  in the sky. These were signs that that had really been just a summer storm.
