<p><strong>SELF-PORTRAIT</strong></p>
<p>Since forever procrastinating, but now learning<br>
  The silence giving room to long thoughts<br>
  Two routines intersperse as the months go by<br>
  Days full of promises, nights full of desires</p>
<p>Few movements, the always friendly sight<br>
  Sight that, as all friends, get boring<br>
  In the shelter finds the wind, the light, and the song of free birds<br>
  And reassure to herself that one day everything will change</p>
<p>Fear and courage intermix, and none of them wins the battle<br>
  But each new day shows that things solve by themselves<br>
  As best friends, understanding creatures</p>
<p>Seven times a week, comes the sun and comes the moon<br>
  The life runs and gets old, mistreats but teaches<br>
  And like a miracle, always leave hope behind.</p>
