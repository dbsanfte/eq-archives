<H2>Thanks to all those who joined us in Kedge and in the slaying of Vance Bearstalker</H2>

It was a long busy weekend for most of us, made even more special by the company of the Knights of Marik and our friends in House of Reverie.  For this first time since I have been a part of the Darkflame Knights, we have rid the seas of Estrella of Gloomwater.  There were many casualties, and in the end, the only ones left standing where a few Knights who were pulled from the brink of certain death by their druid saviour to the safety of butcherblock.  But before we left, we saw the body of Estrella laying at our feet, a beaten lifeless look in her eyes.<P>

And the next day saw us marching out with the help of the House of Reverie and Tryston to take out the vile poacher Vance Bearstalker (after I saved a rare endangered species of snake /shrug).  Though the citizens of East Karana where not too impressed with some of our members (ooc: the quest takes place waaaaay too close to a group of human and barbarian guards/merchants and several died repeatedly from them as we were gathering *makes a mental note not to stand near there next time*), when Vance finally showed his face, we made quick work of him, sadly at the loss of the dear enchantress Dalla /salute.<P>

I hope that our guilds can work together more in the future, as I have enjoyed myself beyond measure in all of your company.<P>

Regards,<P>

<H2>Alumar Ventrue’s Bachelor Party of Champions</H2>
Saturday, 26th August <P>


Event: Alumar Ventrue’s Bachelor Party of Champions  <BR>
Time: 3:00pm EST to 12:00am EST  <BR>
Zones: Freeport – East Commonlands – West Commonlands – North Ro  <P>


What to expect: - Dueling Fest 2000 –  <P>

One on One Competition –  <P>

Best Server Dueler –  <P>

This is going to be bracket based – I will advertise all this week for everyone to sign up and they will be issued a number. This number will be in a database of mine for I can set up a bracket base system. The deadline for this sign up will be on Friday Night. There by I will post the Bracket tournament on http://www.merchantsalliance.org for you can see who your dueling. I will implore that once this is set Late Friday night, I can not except any late entrée’s.  <P>

This dueling should last at least 2 – 3 hours for the event. The winner of this event will be crowned the Duel King of Rodcet Nife and be awarded 10,000pp. (Sponcered by Alumar Ventrue Enterprises)  <P>

The later part of the evening will be the true fun of the night. There are 2 guilds that are in process of being created to host the guildwar. We will break the teams up into these 2 guilds for that one night and have the largest guild war imaginable across FP – E.Commonlands – W.Commonlands – North Ro. I will post the names of these 2 temp guilds and the leaders to contact once the server approves them. You will just need to /guildremove yourself for the night for this event. I understand a lot of you will not attend this event just for the inconvenience of this. I do highly encourage everyone that can actually attend this to let down your guard and have some fun. Stop with the daily grind and lets kick each others arses! I hopefully will have the 2 guild names tonight or tommorow (Tuesday 22nd). I will start the sign up for this tonight as also the dueling contest. All you have to do is give me a /tell or an email saying you want to be part of either one or both. I will give you a number to write down. This number is your registration for the event. If this event is a huge success there will be several more.  <P>

Rules of war:  <P>

There is only one. If a character dies and is on a CR and is naked DO NOT engage him with DOT or PET. Let the person start to loot corpse so he has at least something on his corpse. Otherwise PETS and DOTS are 100% a go. That is why there are several clerics attending this event. Understand that if you get dot’d or killed by a pet and you die with experience lost just let your guild know in the guild chat. One person will be appointed to each guild to write down who needs ress’s. WE will get your res’d. I will make sure of this by hiring (2-4) 50th + level clerics for the nights end to make sure you get your res. It will be a very intense night of pure guerrilla warfare.  <P>

I know a lot of you are very excited about this and NOTE there are only light level requirements for this event: Levels 12 and UP!  <P>


Lastly when signing up for this event – in tell with me or in a email. I need to know your level and class.  <P>

Please give response in this thread to any thoughts.  <P>


P.S – Once guilds are approved this notice will hit every website I possibly can throw it on.  <P>

<H2>Droga Gathering</H2>
The guild will be gathering together tonight at 8PM CST near the bridge to Firiona Vie (you evil folk will probably need to wait near the lake of ill omen zone) and then heading to Droga.  I ask all to please be there by 8PM CST so we can head out immediately, ports will be made available starting around 7PM CST.  Any guild friends are more than welcome to come as well, just be there by 8PM =0P.  Due to the layout of the zone, it will be VERY difficult to come back for latecomers, if not impossible.  This is horribly short notice for a gathering, but it is long over due and very important.  Please do what you can to be there.

<H2>Patch Message for August 9th, 2000</H2>

August 9th, 7:00am <BR>
------------------ <P>

*Guide Application* <P>

The Guide Application is now back up at http://guideapp.everquest.com.  If you are over 18 years of age, have a good customer-oriented attitude, enjoy helping your fellow player, and are interested in joining the Guide Program, we will be pleased to review your application. <P>

*Kunark Users* <P>

A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of todays patch.  This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest. <P>

*Patch Day* <P>

Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. <P>

*General Enhancements* <P>

- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<BR>
- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate. <BR>
- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<BR>
- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<BR>
- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<BR>
- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<BR>
- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<BR>

*Changes/Fixes* <P>

- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works <BR>
- Scaler recipe now works <BR>
- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<BR>
- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<BR>
- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<BR>
- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<BR>
- Elven Wine can now be brewed<BR>
- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<BR>
- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<BR>
- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<BR>
- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<BR>
- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<BR>
- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<BR>

*Dragons?*<P>

Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.  Enjoy :)<P>


*New Command For Tracking*<P>

New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<P>

- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the tracking window.<BR>
- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<P>

*Client Customizations*<P>

Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<P>

- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<BR>
- Default screen viewing mode<BR>
- Default travel speed (run or walk)<BR>

The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them.<P>

Modifying this file is optional.<P>

*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<P>

The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode.<P>

Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:
<P>
1 - Say<BR>
2 - Tell<BR>
3 - Group<BR>
4 - Guild<BR>
5 - OOC<BR>
6 - Auction<BR>
7 - Shout<BR>
8 - Emote<BR>
9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<BR>
10 - You hit other<BR>
11 - Other hits you<BR>
12 - You miss other<BR>
13 - Other misses you<BR>
14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<BR>
15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<BR>
18 - Default text and stuff you type<BR>
20 - Merchant Offer Price<BR>
21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<BR>
22 - Your death message<BR>
23 - Others death message<BR>
24 - Other damage other<BR>
25 - Other miss other<BR>
26 - /who command<P>

The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings:<P>

RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<BR>
ScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<P>

<H3> Kaesora Multi Guild Gathering</H3>

I would like to thank all of you who showed up to our Kaesora gathering.  We had members from Harbingers of Storms, House of Reverie, Vikings, and a few others (who can kill me for not remembering their guild names).  Though it was off to a rough start due to a few deaths, the further we pushed into the heart of Kaesora, the stronger and more tuned our groups became to one another.<br>
In the end (at around 4am central) we had broken the Cathedral twice, claimed 2 blades of xalgoz, sundry ransackers packs (we must have let 20 rot), several Xalgozian fangs (one of which I master looted... oooppss, it's no drop...), tombcarvers, a blade of firey lamentations, and a few other things.  All of this could not have been possible without the help and companionship of all those involved.<br>
To our new friends, my blade is always at your becon call *salute*<P>

<H2>Patch Message for June 15, 2000</H2>
June 15th, 8:00am <BR>
----------------- <P>

*Patch Day* <P>

Hello everyone, <P>

Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests: <P>

- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed <BR>
- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath. <BR>
- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly. <BR>
- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently. <BR>
- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle. <P>

A few items have also been changed this week: <P>

- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced. <BR>
- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below). <BR>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.) <P>


*Casting Times on Staff and Rod* <P>

We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you. <P>

The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now. <P>

*Gunthak Harpoon* <P>

In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it. <P>

For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon. <P>

*Chat / Login Process* <P>

The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of people in the chat server. <P>

<A NAME=TALTROG1 HREF=dump.cgi/index#top>TOP</A>
<H2>Talisman of Trog part 1</H2>

<DIV align = "justify">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Trog paced his room pondering the disturbing news he was hearing. It seems that people were disappearing and evil was infiltrating the guild. Constant rumors were heard of a group of necromancers, shadow knights, and enchanters were organizing and planning a take over of the Darkflame Knights. He had hoped that he would have been able to locate the talisman from the days of old to be able to rally the guild and give them hope, but the riddles seem to be almost impossible to solve and it was taking way too long. The last riddle was almost completely solved except for the word to trigger what he was hoping to be the location of the famed talisman. He wished that he knew what the talisman was. If he knew then possibly he would have a better chance of locating it. The worse news was that the descendent pointed to Strumm and he has since disappeared. It seems that foul play was running rampant in the kingdom.<P>

Trog had consulted his most valued advisors. His trusted friend Aeaeren was off trying to figure out what the root of the dissension was, but Trog had not heard from him in a while. Davaren the other half of the “Danger Rangers” had been following leads but all had turned up to be dead ends. Kud one of his most valued officers was trying to rally troops to defend the kingdom but it appeared that an army was not going to solve this problem. He had gone to his strategy officer Aael (against some peoples wishes as they felt that as a dark elf she may have been the leader of the opposition) but as of yet she had not come up with a plan to avert the upcoming disaster. Like many of the great kingdoms of old it seemed like the Darkflame Knights were destined to be destroyed from within. Trog’s only hope was that he could get the talisman and bring them together.<P>

Trog longed for the old days when the group gathered and explored the world. The old danger and thrill of the hunt seemed to be long gone. His younger cousin Smurg, who was turning into a fine warrior was still having his adventures and traveling around the world. Trog tried to keep up with his accomplishments but like himself in his younger days Smurg traveled a lot and news from him was scarce. Smurg in the confidence of youth seemed to be determined to find the talisman himself. The younger heroes seemed to have a little more hope then the older more experienced people. The older people while very skilled was infected with the inevitable disease of “remember when”. The key seemed to be with the younger people. They in the brashness of youth had not known of defeat. They still thought of themselves as invincible. Maybe it was possible that he could use this passion of theirs to his advantage. It would only take a small victory to give the people hope for the future. If there were some way that we could locate the talisman that would provide the hope that the people needed.<P>

<H2>Patch Message for Jan 20, 2000</H2>
January 20th, 7:00am<BR>
--------------------<P>
<DIV align = "justify">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*Announcements*<P>

The Plane of Sky is now open!!!  As a reminder to our customers, the alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical or ethereal rules as Norrath proper.  Enjoy!<P>

Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with the following changes:<P>


*General Changes / Fixes*<P>

- Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen's Lair into the Lavastorm Mountains.  This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug that causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen's Lair.  Please let us know how this goes.<P>

- Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density of fog during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.<P>

- All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality fine-steel weapons of the same type.  This change was made to reduce the amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper levels.  The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the steel weapons that were dropping, they just sell to vendors for less money.<P>

- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.   This was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting these items. <P>

- The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below the world) in Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to Rivervale, a safer part of the zone.<P>

- Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for higher level
  characters.  Your AC should now reflect all of your items.<P>

Additional Bug Fixes:<P>

- Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you were spammed with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<BR>
- Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<BR>
- Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if dropped on the ground.<BR>
- Fire Giants in Nagafen's Lair should now recover properly when stuck in lava.  Consider yourself warned.<BR>
- The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.<BR>


*Spell Changes*<P>

- Shadow Vortex is now a "drain" spell.<BR>
- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<BR>
- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced.  In addition, the spell is less resistable.<BR>
- Angstlich's Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<BR>
- All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly increased
- Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<BR>
- Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<BR>
- Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<BR>
- New magician's spells have been added.  Check your spell vendors.<BR>
- Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<BR>
- NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile.  Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs before attacking.  Now they will.<BR>
- The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster when they break.  No, seriously, we're certain this time. <BR>
- Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.<P>


*Levitation Changed*<P>

Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the code that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was active is no longer necessary and has been backed out.  The Levitate spell may now be refreshed while the spell is in use.  <P>


*Quests and Items*<P>

- The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable.  We will continue to evaluate and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor components to make the pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount of time.<P>

- We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from a level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll.  The issuance of a level 49 scroll was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an abnormally large amount of currency. <P>

- The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have been increased to make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon for the level range.<P>

- Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale items.<P>

- The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate races.<P>


*Fletching Update*<P>

All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly the Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used versus magical creatures.  All existing items in your possession will automatically morph into the new magical items.  Additionally, each successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10 arrows instead of the previous 5.  As such, the vendor buy-back value has been decreased accordingly.  <P>


*Paw*<P>

The difficulty of Paw has been decreased.  We found that many of the gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more difficult than it should have been for the desired level target.  Please let us know how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.<P>


*The Plane of Fear*<P>

The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased.  This change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the data was not exported.  It has been tested and equipment drops are now occurring at a much higher rate.<P>


*The Plane of Hate*<P>

The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane of Hate have been decreased.  Previously, these NPCs used the same drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop percentages to be extremely high.<P>

Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions, and tend to "Hate" everyone. <P>


*Monk Enhancement*<P>

A monk's speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level, beginning in the high 20s. This will result in higher level monks doing substantially more damage in a given time-frame.  <P>

Though this change does increase the power of the average monk, it should be stressed that the monk is now even more in need of true tank classes who have the ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We want to stress that the "taunt factor" of a monks fist has NOT been increased, though it may appear so due to your increased damage.<P>


*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*<P>

Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill caps on Bash and Taunt.
<P>
The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over level 25.  This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP base, which upon further consideration is not compatible with our vision of those classes' roles.  This change will basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of the same race. <P>

The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output.  Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks. <P>

Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching to two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only characters who use a shield throughout their lives.<P>


*Rogue Enhancement*
<P>
Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill, they are now also invisible to undead.  <P>

This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the rogue, allowing them to do something that no other class could do.  It is the first step in a multi-step process to improve the rogue class. 

*Wizard Enhancement*<P>

Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or Fire) much less likely to be resisted.  This effect stacks with the Staff of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance debuffs.<P>

This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance rates go up.  Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense that they should be better at causing that damage than the other classes.  <P>


*Bard Enhancement*
<P>
Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level.  This skill will be granted automatically the first time a bard zones after reaching 10th level, and cannot be trained further.  It will have the effect of decreasing the amount of time that it takes a Bard to memorize their songs.  Previously, it would take 50th level bards upwards of 2 minutes to memorize a song.  Now it is much faster.<P>


*Druid Enhancement*
<P>
The skill cap on a Druid's tracking skill has been increased.  This change was implemented based upon general public opinion that the former cap was far too low for the skill to be even marginally viable.  <P>


*Feign Death and Pets*<P>

After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer's Feign Death tactic, as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we have implemented a change.  As we would like everyone to understand why we feel this change was necessary, here is a summary of the i</TD></TR></TABLE></body></html>
