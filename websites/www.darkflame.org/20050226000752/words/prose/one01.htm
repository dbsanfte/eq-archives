<p><strong>ONEWORD - JUNE 2003</strong><a href="one01.htm"></a></p>
<p><strong>24th - PENDANT</strong><br>
  She held the necklace tight with her hands. It was a memory of him. A memory 
  she wanted to keep forever, the only think that had left&#8230; Because he was 
  gone. And she wanted his memory to be always alive, always present, guiding 
  her, orienting her. That's why the necklace would go with her wherever she went. 
  The necklace, along with its pendant.</p>
<p> <strong>25th - WINE</strong><br>
  He was not everything he talked about, no way. He was exhibitionist, he always 
  wanted all the attention to him, and made stupid jokes. He was not what she 
  was waiting for, not what her friends and family were waiting for. Because of 
  that, she gave up. She wouldn't bear for much long with bullshit from a little 
  kid that acted like he was half the age he actually was. She didn't want to 
  be a babysitter.</p>
<p> <strong>26th - ANGLE</strong><br>
  She flew free, in the blue sky. Getting off from a high cliff, she observed 
  the waves that broke in the acclivitous rock, and a boat, far in the sea&#8230; 
  Then she looked cautiously to the ground, to the leaves&#8230; She got what 
  she wanted and went back. Three little birds were waiting for her, in the nest, 
  hungry.</p>
<p> <strong>27th - GUARD</strong><br>
  He was standing in front of the other man, who threatened to kill him. Because 
  of an undermost motive, I must say. And he would get it over with him, oh he 
  would. The guard showed up, uniformed guards, uppish, respectiful. And the man 
  ran away. He just disappeared. Never went back to that city again.</p>
<p> <strong>29th - BEAM</strong><br>
  In the middle of the stadium, the boys were playing and running to the ball, 
  like crazy. The girls in the edge of the field were jumping, screaming and singing, 
  trying to encourage them, despite the enormous disadvantage in the counter. 
  It was just a school game, but so important to those boys.</p>
<p> <strong>30th - TOWER</strong><br>
  He looked ahead, as soon as he reached the peak. Down there, in a plateau, he 
  saw a tower, a high, thin, round and rustic tower&#8230; beautiful. A tower 
  that didn't reach the sky, but could, with all that majesty. He thought that 
  he had never seen anything so wonderful in his life.</p>
