<p><strong>THE BLACK FLOWER</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, that view<br>
  of the sky full of stars<br>
  once beautiful<br>
  makes no sense anymore.</p>
<p>The flower, the flight, the birds, the moon<br>
  no longer have a meaning<br>
  they're beings like me, lost<br>
  brought to the world to fill the emptiness.</p>
<p>My life oscillates<br>
  like the waves formed by the stone on the river<br>
  water that is no longer calm<br>
  and is now wild, sinking me...</p>
<p>The ridiculous love song<br>
  carefree, happy<br>
  awakens in me the anger<br>
  and nobody knows, nobody sees.</p>
<p>Nobody notices that all this happiness in the world don't exist to me.<br>
  Surrounded by my own problems, I look for and I'm attracted by the hardest ways.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because everything I desire is to come back<br>
  To come back in time, back to being a child<br>
  for whom everything is easy and beautiful<br>
  It's very hard to be strong.</p>
<p>And you'll never understand.<br>
  So, stay away from me.<br>
  You're happy, live your life<br>
  With me, I want people like me.</p>
<p>People who, uncounciously, found out where the black flower has been seeded.</p>
