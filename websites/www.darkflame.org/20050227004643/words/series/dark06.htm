<p><strong>CHAPTER 6 - THE BREATH OF DEATH</strong></p>
<p> April fifth, Friday. Val&eacute;ria's mother would be moving in one week, 
  and she hadn't gotten the divorce yet. She was going everywhere with papers, 
  documents, while she was packing her things. &Aacute;lvaro, the future ex-husband, 
  didn't help her much, because he had a full-time job. That day, Joana was taking 
  Ana Paula and Lu&iacute;sa to the languages school by car, and stopped by Val&eacute;ria's.</p>
<p> &quot;Val&eacute;ria, let's go!&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa yelled, after she rang 
  the bell.</p>
<p> &quot;Take it easy, daughter, there is no need to yell...&quot;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria showed up with her mother.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa... I'm sorry, but I was about to leave with my mother, 
  she needs to go to some stores near the school and I thought...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Come on, go with us&quot;, Joana said. She already knew M&aacute;rcia, 
  from some past meetings.</p>
<p> The five of them went to the school, where Lu&iacute;sa, Ana Paula and Val&eacute;ria 
  stayed. Joana parked, and left with M&aacute;rcia to look for suitcases and 
  some other things she needed; Joana would now have someone to talk to while 
  she waited for the girls' classes to end.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Is it that woman?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Which one?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;The one on the right, with the red dress...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I know, I know. I saw it...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't fail.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, I won't.&quot;</p>
<p> The two man finished the masked conversation, and took different ways out.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you a lot for your help, Joana. I didn't know half of these stores... 
  Great!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You're welcome. And I ended up making wrong things too...&quot; Joana 
  smiled, with some bags in her hands.</p>
<p> &quot;I have to go now&quot;, M&aacute;rcia was ready to say goodbye.</p>
<p> &quot;Won't you come back with us?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, thanks. I'll try to talk to my lawyer before going home. We're having 
  some trouble in this divorcing thing, and I don't want to delay my trip.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay. If we don't talk these days, have a good trip!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Thank you&quot;, M&aacute;rcia walked to the next corner, and soon disappeared. 
  Joana continued walking straight to the car, which was a little away from her, 
  without noticing she was being followed by a strong and slovenly man.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;I can't stand Edson in my class anymore. I just can't.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Take it easy, Val&eacute;ria. He'll stop bugging you, as soon as he 
  realizes you don't like his jokes...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hmm, I think our mothers haven't come back yet&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa saw 
  the empty car, and didn't see any of the mothers around. The three girls sat 
  on the sidewalk and continued talking, while they waited.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Joana sighed when she saw that the usually crowded streets were even worse 
  now. Maybe it was the time &#8211; it was half past six in the afternoon, time 
  to go home from work, time to go to school for the night period. There were 
  two big schools around there. She stopped, with all her bags, among a lot of 
  people who were waiting for the traffic signals to show them they could cross 
  the street.</p>
<p> &quot;Man, I'm late... the girls must be waiting for me...&quot;, she thought.</p>
<p> It happened so fast. The man who was following her put on a black ski mask 
  that covered all of his face, approached her quietly, took a gun out of his 
  pocket and, in an agile movement, pointed it to Joana's back and shot her. With 
  the other hand, he violently pulled off the silver necklace she was wearing. 
  And, like magic, he disappeared, while Joana fell on the ground, dropping all 
  the bags, and the people around screamed when they noticed what had just happened.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to them? They should have come back an hour ago!&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa was impatient. She didn't mind having to wait with her friends, 
  but she wanted to go home. It was ten past seven at night, and it was totally 
  dark already.</p>
<p> &quot;Hold on&quot;, Val&eacute;ria said, and got up.</p>
<p> She went straight to the public phone near there, and made a quick call. Soon 
  she was back.</p>
<p> &quot;My mother is already home... She went on foot, and left your mother 
  not far from here. She was coming to pick us up because it was already six o'clock 
  and we had already left class...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I wonder if something happened to Joana?&quot;, Ana Paula asked, confused.</p>
<p> &quot;I'll call home&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa went to the same phone.</p>
<p> Her call lasted a little longer than Val&eacute;ria's. The other two girls 
  waited quietly, concerned. They didn't even notice when two old women passed 
  near them, talking, terrified, saying that that shot woman probably wouldn&#8217;t 
  survive, and the killer was so fast and no one saw him.</p>
<p> &quot;She's not home. Neither is my father. No one answered. Nic must be training.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Do you think we should go home without waiting for her?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes, but give me a second...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa ripped a piece of paper from her book, and scribbled a note. 
  She attached it on her mother's car's windshield, and the three of them started 
  walking towards home.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Man, where is everybody? My dad should have been home since before I 
  called! What's going on?&quot; Lu&iacute;sa was already home with her friends, 
  and her voice showed she was getting really worried.</p>
<p> &quot;Stay calm, Lu&iacute;sa, nothing happened, your mother probably found 
  some friend and...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't think she'd forget about us, she knew we were waiting for her...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Let's go ask my mother&quot;, Ana Paula suggested, and they went to 
  the next house.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;WHERE?!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;In the hospital, Lu&iacute;sa. Well, at least, it was what your father 
  told me. Stay calm&quot; Lu&iacute;sa was now totally distraught. &quot;Augusto 
  came home, and called me right after saying he had to go to the hospital.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But... what happened, Carolina, for God's sake, what happened to her?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know, Lu&iacute;sa, your father didn't tell me...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What about Nic?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't think he knows. He hasn&#8217;t come home yet.&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula and Val&eacute;ria looked at Lu&iacute;sa, who was about to cry, 
  not knowing what to do. They all wanted to know what happened. Joana hadn&#8217;t 
  been ill. She was in perfect health.</p>
<p> The phone rang. Carolina answered it and soon she was back:</p>
<p> &quot;It was Augusto.&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa got up from the chair.</p>
<p> &quot;How's my mother?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Not that good, as he told me...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I want to go there!&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said with a crying voice.</p>
<p> &quot;Okay... go with her, girls. The hospital is not far, I can't go out 
  right now to take you there...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;If Nic shows up, tell him all this&quot;, Ana Paula asked her mother, 
  and left running after Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa ran for the first block, and after that she was walking very 
  fast and her friends could barely follow her. It took them fifteen minutes to 
  reach the hospital.</p>
<p> &quot;I want to see my mother. She's here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What's her name, please?&quot;, the receptionist asked.</p>
<p> &quot;Joana Porter.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Third floor, room five.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Thanks! Let's go!&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa grabbed Ana Paula's arm, and Val&eacute;ria followed them. A 
  nurse saw them and asked them to stop running, but they didn't listened to her. 
  Lu&iacute;sa found the room easily, and her father was outside, having a cup 
  of tea, coffee, whatever.</p>
<p> &quot;Dad...&quot;</p>
<p> He nodded, saying that Joana was not okay.</p>
<p> &quot;But, what happened, Dad?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well... no one knows for sure... your mother was on the street, in the 
  middle of lots of other people, and a man approached and shot her...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Shot?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;The man had a ski mask on, and left in a hurry, no one saw who he was. 
  She was brought here quickly, but she's in great danger, according to the doctor...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Has she been robbed?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No... I mean, I think she hasn't, everyone who was around her said the 
  man just shot and left, without a word.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That's why she didn&#8217;t come to pick us up...&quot; Val&eacute;ria 
  observed, in vain.</p>
<p> &quot;Where... has she been shot?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;In the middle of her back... the bullet hit a lung.&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa shut up. She opened the door to the room slowly, trying not to 
  make any noise. There was a weak light on, and Lu&iacute;sa didn't want to turn 
  on the brighter light because Joana could wake up &#8211; but actually she knew 
  that she was probably sedated and wouldn't wake up anyway.</p>
<p> &quot;They took out the bullet, but great damage has been already done&quot;, 
  Augusto said, to her back.</p>
<p> When Lu&iacute;sa got in, she saw Joana laying down on the bed, pale, breathing 
  with the help of the machines, with a serum connected to her left arm. She was 
  shocked, and one reluctant tear fell down on her face...</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, my God, Mom... what has he done to you...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;This is terrible&quot;, Val&eacute;ria whispered.</p>
<p> &quot;Is she going to be all right, Dad?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa couldn't stop 
  looking at her mother, and she was now holding her hand.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, try to understand... The doctor told me she is in danger, 
  they stopped the hemorrhage in her lung, but it came back once and it can come 
  back once more... and it's very dangerous...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Is she going to be all right, Dad?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa repeated her 
  question, now with a firmer voice. She didn't want inaccurate answers.</p>
<p> &quot;I... She...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa dried another tear, and spoke, almost with no voice:</p>
<p> &quot;She's going to die, isn't she?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't say that, Lu&iacute;sa!&quot;, Ana Paula said, speaking for the 
  first time, since they left home.</p>
<p> &quot;Paula, maybe it's a little late to be superstitious&quot;, Augusto looked 
  at the floor.</p>
<p> &quot;When, Dad? Is she going to wake up? Is she going home?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know. I don't know anything. But I believe she won't leave this 
  hospital... well... to go home.&quot;</p>
<p> A doctor came to examine Joana. The girls left the room and waited in the 
  corridor.</p>
<p> &quot;Why, God, why? She didn't do anything! Why? If we had gone home by ourselves, 
  it wouldn't have happened!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, stay calm... And get this, now: it was not our fault. 
  Not your fault, no one's fault. It was that miserable man's fault.&quot; Val&eacute;ria 
  tried to calm Lu&iacute;sa down, not being able to avoid thinking that if her 
  mother hadn't left Joana alone, maybe it wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p> &quot;I don't want her to die...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Enough, Lu&iacute;sa&quot;, Ana Paula said. &quot;None of us want that. 
  Now, let's go home.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No! I want to stay with my mother!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, you'll make things worse if you stay here! Let's go home! 
  You'll stay with me, in my house!&quot;, Ana Paula insisted.</p>
<p> &quot;No!&quot; Lu&iacute;sa yelled. &quot;I don't want to leave this hospital! 
  I want to stay with my mother! I want to be with her when she wakes up!&quot;</p>
<p> They heard a noise and the door to the room opened.</p>
<p> &quot;She won't wake up, Lu&iacute;sa&quot;, Augusto said, with swollen eyes. 
  &quot;I think she won't wake up anymore.&quot;</p>
<p> Silence.</p>
<p> &quot;She... died?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa's voice was strangely weak.</p>
<p> &quot;No... not yet. The doctor has just confirmed something through an exam. 
  Your mother is in coma. And we have all reasons to think she'll not wake up 
  from it.&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa didn't answer. Her eyes got full of tears, and the first one 
  fell. With that, she broke into tears.</p>
<p> Ana Paula hugged her.</p>
<p> &quot;Let's go home, Lu&iacute;sa...&quot;</p>
<p> She didn't resist this time. She left with the girls, without saying goodbye 
  to her mother. When they were in front of the hospital, Augusto showed up, to 
  give them a ride home, because it was dark and dangerous outside.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa didn't say a word while going home. Augusto went back to the 
  hospital. She was in shock; wouldn't speak, wouldn't look at anything in particular... 
  While Ana Paula was giving her a glass of water with sugar, Val&eacute;ria was 
  telling Carolina all she knew.</p>
<p> &quot;My God... That's just absurd! Why did this man do that? I just don't 
  understand!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Neither do we...&quot;</p>
<p> The bell rang. Carolina got up to answer and some seconds later she was back 
  with Nic.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa was calmer. She had stopped crying. But she had a swollen face, 
  which was saying she had been through a hard time.</p>
<p> &quot;What happened?&quot;, Nic asked, cautiously. He had been worried since 
  he first saw Carolina's face.</p>
<p> When Lu&iacute;sa saw Nic, she ran to him, and hugged him, starting to cry 
  again.</p>
<p> &quot;What happened, Lu&iacute;sa? Tell me!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Nic, Mom&#8217;s going to die! She's going to die!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, calm down, let's explain things to him correctly...&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula started speaking, telling Nic what had happened.</p>
<p> &quot;I don't believe that&quot;, Nic said, astonished, after listening to 
  the whole story. Then, he became a mix of anger and desperation. &quot;I... 
  It's not possible! How?! I never saw something like this happening! Never!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Stay calm, Nic... we all think the same as you... But, stay calm, there 
  is no use in being upset now&quot;, Ana Paula tried to comfort her boyfriend.</p>
<p> &quot;Help us calm down your sister&quot;, Val&eacute;ria spoke with her lips, 
  pointing to Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> Nic looked at her. She couldn't stop crying, with her hair on his chest. He 
  felt he needed to comfort her, no matter how upset he was.</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa... hey, stay calm... calm down... I... Look, I don't think 
  crying will help us... If this thing really happens, we'll have to deal with 
  Mom being away from us...&quot;, the words came out, and he didn't even know 
  how. They were not his own words, because he couldn't agree with them, but he 
  was hoping they would make some effect in Lu&iacute;sa.</p>
<p> &quot;I can't do it, Nic...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes, you can, and I can too! Think about all the things we still have 
  to go through... all the time we have to live... We can't spend this time weeping 
  and crying... And besides that... Mom won't be like, far... She'll only be... 
  well... in another place. She will never fade away, never, and she'll be with 
  us even if we can't see her.&#8221;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, Nic...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Come on, let's show everyone we can make it when we have a hard time. 
  It will do us good. Show them you can! We love Mom, no one wanted this to happen, 
  it was a fatality... We'll find this guy... But anyway, it's done, let's not 
  think about how we wished things were different, because they aren't. We have 
  to face it...&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa dried her tears.</p>
<p> &quot;Nic... are you going to the hospital now?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I... don't think it's a good thing to do. It's late, I'm tired, and 
  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for that... I'll go there tomorrow... What 
  about Dad?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He'll spend the night with her.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;While he's there&quot;, Carolina said. &quot;You'll stay here, okay?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria looked at the clock. Nine-thirty. She had to go home. Carolina 
  gave her a ride, and when she came back, everyone was in their pajamas &#8211; 
  Nic and Lu&iacute;sa had gone to their house to get some clothes. They talked 
  for some time, and slept.</p>
<p> &quot;This boy, Nic... he's incredible&quot;, Carolina thought. &quot;How 
  can he be so strong in a situation like that? You'd never say that tomorrow, 
  when he wakes up, his mother might not be alive anymore...&quot;</p>
<p> Carolina gulped. She stopped thinking about it, and slept.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The next morning, Nic woke up and went to the hospital. He didn't want to wake 
  Lu&iacute;sa up to go with him. She needed to rest. Lu&iacute;sa woke up two 
  hours later, and she was leaving the house when Nic arrived, running. He was 
  sweaty, pale, with an expression on his face that didn't fit the one of the 
  previous day. It looked like he had been crying. Lu&iacute;sa asked, afraid 
  of the answer:</p>
<p> &quot;Nic, what happened?&quot;</p>
<p> He didn't answer. He entered the house upset, went to the kitchen, sat down 
  and ran his fingers through his hair. He suddenly got up, angry, and hit the 
  wall:</p>
<p> &quot;No! No!!&quot;, he yelled.</p>
<p> &quot;What happened, for God's sake?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa said, impatient. 
  &quot;Come on, Nic, say it!&quot;</p>
<p> Nic fell on chair again, with his hands on his face. He was crying, whimpering. 
  Then he threw his head back and finally said, in a distraught yell:</p>
<p> &quot;My mom is dead!&quot;</p>
<p> Silence.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa couldn't move. Carolina was thinking; yesterday, all Nic wanted 
  to do was make his sister feel better. It was like nothing was happening to 
  him. He'd been incredibly strong. And now, he was there, distraught, like Joana's 
  death was unexpected. All his strength had disappeared, and he fell into a huge 
  depression.</p>
<p> She was looking at him, on the chair, crying like a child, trying to imagine 
  how Nic must have fought with himself to remain lucid last night. Finally, someone 
  moved: Lu&iacute;sa was crying too, now hugging her brother. Ana Paula hugged 
  the two of them, and Carolina did the same. They cried in silence for a long 
  five minutes. The phone rang, and it was Augusto, saying that the funeral was 
  being prepared.</p>
