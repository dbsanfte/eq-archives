<p><strong>PART 1 - MEMORIES<br>
  CHAPTER 1 - THE BEGINNING</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Thinking, Stu?&quot; Lucas asked as he entered their bedroom, and saw 
  his youngest brother sitting near the window.</p>
<p> &quot;No... Just remembering... remembering our farewell at Planet Hollywood, 
  before we came back to Brazil...&quot;</p>
<p> Three boys were lying on their beds, in the same bedroom. Stuart was the only 
  one of the three boys born in the United States. His father, an American, had 
  moved the whole family there for business. When Stuart was just two years old, 
  he and his brothers came back to Brazil with their mother, newly divorced. Michael 
  had been three and Lucas had been five at the time. After that, the boys would 
  visit their father during their yearly vacation. It was the last trip that Stuart, 
  now sixteen years old, remembered the most.</p>
<p> Lucas sat on the bed and started to play some chords on his eletric guitar.</p>
<p> &quot;He won't forget it, will he?&quot; Michael asked as he came in. </p>
<p>Lucas was playing an old rock song, the same song that played in Stuart's heart 
  during those four amazing weeks in Boston, with that beautiful fifteen year 
  old American girl, whose memory those two months apart did not let fade away.</p>
<p> &quot;I will never forget...&quot; </p>
<p>Carried away by the music, Stuart remembered every single detail of that unforgettable 
  vacation. His brothers listened, attentive, for the thousandth time. After all 
  those trips together, they learned how to be each other's best friend.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>June 30, 1997 afternoon - </p>
<p>The brothers were getting ready for another trip. On the way to the airport, 
  like every year, a humorous atmosphere filled the car; they joked around with 
  each other and laughed, while their mother, who was driving, got impatient.</p>
<p> &quot;For the love of God, stop now! You're driving me crazy!&quot;</p>
<p> But Clara considered herself a very lucky person, even with a divorce in her 
  history. Not all mothers would be proud of having three teenage sons who could 
  get along so well.</p>
<p> At the airport, the &quot;fraternal love demonstration&quot; ended. All those 
  lines, the waiting time; they could ruin anybody&#8217;s good mood.</p>
<p> After setting up the last details of the flight, the four of them took their 
  seats in the waiting area. Fifteen minutes later, the boy's flight was being 
  announced,</p>
<p> &quot;Flight 382 to Boston with stopover in Orlando...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, we'll have a stopover!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, Mike! Orlando is cool!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I know, it will be great seeing Disney World from the plane's windows, 
  while those fat foreign tourists &#8211; &#8220;</p>
<p> &quot;Wait, wait... I&#8217;m foreign... and I&#8217;m not fat!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You don't have to remind us of it every ten minutes, Stu!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Stu, forget it and let's go, or else we'll miss the fight!&quot; 
  Michael got up, hugged and kissed his mother, followed by his brothers.</p>
<p> &quot;Have a good trip, guys...&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;So the three of you are locked in here once again!&quot; Clara said entering 
  the room. She was carrying some cookies she had just made, a jar of orange juice 
  and a smile. &quot;Let me guess...&#8221; She started.</p>
<p> &#8220;'The Unlucky July Trip'!&quot; Michael and Lucas finished for her.</p>
<p> &quot;I told you this was going to be an unlucky trip...,&quot; Stuart complained.</p>
<p> &quot;I am starting to think it is,&quot; she said, walking out of the room, 
  after leaving the snack on the bedside table. &quot;You can't stop thinking 
  about this trip!&quot; </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The stewardess announced calmly in a clear voice that the plane was preparing 
  to land. Everyone put on their seattbelts. It was still dark outside, and only 
  Lucas had stayed awake during the trip.</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, you guys!&quot; he shook his brothers. &quot;Wake up, because were 
  going to land!&#8221;</p>
<p> &quot;Woah, this soon? I barely slept,&quot; Michael said, yawning and opening 
  his eyes.</p>
<p> &quot;We&#8217;ll be leaving the plane in a few minutes and dad's waiting 
  for us!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay... man, it's hot in here!&quot; Stuart said.</p>
<p> &quot;Obviously... it's summer here, and you had this big bag sitting on you 
  all this time,&quot; replied Lucas.</p>
<p> The planesoon landed. The passengers were already getting up to leave when 
  Stuart decided to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p> &quot;Be quick, or else you'll be left behind,&quot; Lucas said. &quot;We'll 
  be waiting for you at the gate.&quot;</p>
<p> When Stuart was nearing the plane's exit with the last few passengers on the 
  plane, a girl bumped into him, and her purse fell spewing its contents all over 
  the floor.</p>
<p> &quot;Oh, I'm sorry...,&quot; she apologized.</p>
<p> Stuart turned and looked at her. She had long, straight blonde hair past her 
  shoulders, which was falling over one of her beautiful blue eyes. She didn't 
  look older than fifteen or sixteen. She looked embarrassed, so Stuart bent down 
  to help her with her things.</p>
<p> &quot;Let me help you,&quot; he said, trying to be quiet since the girl seemed 
  a little shy. When he had handed her the last of her things, she apologized 
  again.</p>
<p> &quot;Thank you, I'm so sorry...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, it's okay... it happens!&quot; Stuart smiled. </p>
<p>English was familiar to him and his brothers just like Portuguese was.</p>
<p> They looked at each other for a moment, before she turned away and left the 
  plane. She was headed to the same gate Stuart was but before she could get away, 
  he yelled to her.</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, girl!&quot;</p>
<p> She turned back to see him.</p>
<p> &quot;What's your name?&quot;</p>
<p> The girl smiled. &quot;Hills! Enny Hills!&quot; and then turned and walked 
  away.</p>
