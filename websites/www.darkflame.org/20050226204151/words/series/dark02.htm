<p><strong>CHAPTER 2 - NIC</strong></p>
<p>A couple days later, everything seemed to be back to normal. No one said anything 
  about the school issue. Lu&iacute;sa, on the other hand, spent her days helping 
  her mother, who made and sold breakfast baskets by ordering, and in her free 
  time &#8211; which was often &#8211; she was always with Ana Paula.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Paula, this is Lu&iacute;sa here!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa, where are you? I&#8217;ve been looking for you since I 
  woke up!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm here, in S&atilde;o Paulo. I haven't been able to call you before. 
  We left in a hurry, I just managed to call you now!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What are you doing there?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm at the airport!&quot;, talking in a public phone, Lu&iacute;sa was 
  yelling, so her friend could hear her voice among all the noise.</p>
<p> &quot;What are you doing at the airport? Christ, tell me!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Nic, Paula! Nic arrives today! Man, you forgot? I told you so many times!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Nic... It's true! He'll be home today, that's so good! And how is he, 
  speaking good English*, Lu&iacute;sa? Have you talked to him?&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><em>* (This story is originally written in Portuguese. The characters live 
    in Brazil and speak Portuguese as their first language)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> &quot;I talked to him by phone a few days ago. He says he's good at English, 
  but didn't speak a single word of it to me.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And you're coming home right after he arrives, or no?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I think we are. Paula, I've got to go, my dad is calling me!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, I'm waiting for you, bye!&quot;</p>
<p> Ana Paula hung up the phone with a smile on her face.</p>
<p> &quot;Who were you talking to, so happy?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It was Lu&iacute;sa, Mom. She's at the airport, waiting for Nicolas.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So he's arriving today? Lu&iacute;sa must be really happy, it&#8217;s 
  been five months since she last saw her brother.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Happy? Much more than that! You know how she loves her brother... Besides, 
  he promised to bring her some stuff...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And what did he do with his studying, so he could be away all this time?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;This guy is crazy. When he was informed that he had won this English 
  course in some contest, he talked to his teachers and started studying like 
  crazy so he wouldn't fail the year. Extra classes and things like that. He finished 
  his sophomore year months before the others, and went to England. He said he 
  needed to learn English so badly. It's exaggeration, we all know that. All he 
  wanted was to have the chance to go on a trip.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And did he learn English after all?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He says so. He's so smart, he would be able to learn anything.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I bet he is.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;He is. I saw his school exercise books, his tests from eight grade in 
  S&atilde;o Lucas, the ones which I had totally failed... I envy him...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Why did you want to see his tests? To know exactly what you would have 
  to study?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, I saw them one day when I went to Lu&iacute;sa's and he was explaining 
  some Math things to me... back in the first semester, when he was still here.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So you have a certain free teacher?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No, that was just a favor from him to me.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;With a brother like that, tell me, how did Lu&iacute;sa fail the school 
  year?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;They are different, Mom. And I don't think Lu&iacute;sa was interested 
  in asking him for help.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, so, let's stop talking, your father is coming home for lunch and 
  I haven&#8217;t made lunch yet. By the way, Carol called and told me to tell 
  you to go pick up your book at her house.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Thanks, Mom. I'll be right back.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&quot;Lu&iacute;sa, come here! You never stop talking on that phone!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I was talking to Paula, Dad. What's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Your brother's plane has just arrived.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It did? Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes. Look at the number of the flight.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And how long it will take him to get off of the plane?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Not much time, I guess. I'm hungry, I'm going to the snack bar with 
  your mom. Are you coming with us, or do you want us to get something for you?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm staying here. I don't want anything.&quot;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa's parents went away, she was looking everywhere, she didn't know 
  what gate her brother would come from. Suddenly, she heard a loud voice behind 
  her:</p>
<p> &quot;Lu&iacute;sa!&quot;</p>
<p> She turned back and saw her brother, with luggage all around him. She ran 
  forward to him, and they gave each other a big hug.</p>
<p> &quot;I missed you so much, Nic!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I missed you too, Lu! How are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I'm fine, Nic! Man, you look different, your hair!&quot;, she messed 
  up his hair, which fell, glossy, just above his eyes.</p>
<p> &quot;Dad and Mom, where are they?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;In the snack bar. Let's go.&quot;</p>
<p> Nic walked silently behind them, and scared them. They hugged each other, 
  and Nic complained that he was hungry.</p>
<p> &quot;I ate something at the airport, before we took off. The plane's food 
  was terrible&quot;, at the table, he was talking about his trip, while eating 
  a sandwich. &quot;Actually, the trip back was totally awful. Bad seats, heat... 
  But I'm here!&quot;</p>
<p> He grabbed a french fry, and continued talking.</p>
<p> &quot;Look, I want to go home and ask you something, Mom... Make some food 
  for me! Make me rice, beans, that good food of yours! I missed it so much out 
  there!&quot;</p>
<p> They laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Don't worry, son&quot;, Joana said. &quot;But now, tell us how it was 
  out there, how was the family who hosted you, how was the school you attended, 
  you can talk for however long you want because we don't have a phone bill to 
  pay now! Did you enjoy the English course?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course&quot;, Nic said, drinking some soda. &quot;It was worth it.&quot;</p>
<p> Augusto had got up to go take the snacks. Joana utilized that time to tell 
  Nic:</p>
<p> &quot;You see, son, things are so different... You were studying English abroad, 
  and your sister just failed the school year here.&quot;</p>
<p> He was surprised.</p>
<p> &quot;What? Luzinha, did you fail?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I did, Nic... And don't call me Luzinha, okay?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Of course... but what are you going to do now?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Dad's taking me to another school. Against my wishes, of course&quot;, 
  she made a face.</p>
<p> &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Because S&atilde;o Lucas is so expensive, and I'm not worth the sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hey, stay calm... I have an idea, Lu&iacute;sa. Why don't you go take 
  the night classes? At S&atilde;o Lucas, just like I did. It's cheaper, and isn't 
  Paula going to take night classes too? You can still see your friends there. 
  And I know that you didn't study this year, but you're going to do it right 
  next year, aren't you?&quot;, he said, like he was forcing her to agree.</p>
<p> &quot;Yes... It's a good idea... Will Dad agree, Mom?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don't know, we have to talk to him. I hadn't thought about it either...&quot;</p>
<p> Augusto came back, calling everyone:</p>
<p> &quot;Come on, family, let's go. Do you want to go straight home, or want 
  to stay here some more, Nic?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Home. I can't wait to get back home and meet my friends again!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You're so cheerful, ain't you Nic? What did you do back in England?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Nothing so special... I think the trip itself was a good thing to me...&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At home, Nic went to his room and, before he laid down on the bed, he complained 
  because while he was absent, his room had been used as some kind of depository 
  of food and other things. Joana promised she would take the things out of there 
  as soon as she found some other place to put them. Nic left his luggage on the 
  floor, untouched, and fell on the bed, with his face on the pillow.</p>
<p> &quot;Nic?&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa showed up, stretching out her neck inside her 
  brother's room.</p>
<p> &quot;Hi, Luzinha. Come in.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Nic, I told you, please, don't call me like that! I don't like it!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, sorry...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Did you bring me what I asked you to?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What? All those pencils, pens, diaries, CDs, T-shirts, and this camera 
  right here? Sorry, I forgot...&quot;, he pointed to an opened suitcase that 
  was lying on the floor, waiting to be unpacked.</p>
<p> &quot;Nic! You... you bought this camera for me?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes. Do you like it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Do I like it? You're crazy, of course I like it! It's a digital camera, 
  I wanted one like that so bad! Thanks, Nic!&quot;, happily, she hugged her brother, 
  who smiled, and then she looked at the other things he had brought for her.</p>
<p> &quot;This is a cool T-shirt!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It is, isn't it? But, sorry, it's mine. So, Lu&iacute;sa, how are things 
  going in your life? What about Ana Paula, and your boyfriend... Douglas, right?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Um, Ana Paula is fine, as always... I talk to her everyday... And Douglas, 
  well, it's been about two weeks since I broke up with him.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You broke up? Why?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Because he's such an idiot, a liar, a pig, a jerk. He cheated on me 
  with Juliana!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That ridiculous friend of yours? Keep in mind that's just my opinion, 
  by the way.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Ex-friend, you mean. You had to be there... I argued with her in front 
  of the whole school...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I believe you did. I know you well!&quot;, Nic laughed. &quot;So, you 
  can defend yourself without me now? I think me not being here did you good.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;First of all, my dear&quot;, she looked him in the eyes, talking in 
  a funny tone of voice. &quot;I always knew how to defend myself without you. 
  Lastly, my dear, you have no idea how I missed you, all the bullshit you used 
  to say, everything!&quot;, they laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;I&#8217;m only a bullshitter to you, huh?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Well Nic, I'm going to leave you alone now. Unpack, sleep, do whatever 
  you want. I have to...&quot;</p>
<p> At that moment, the bell rang. The two of them heard Joana opening the door 
  and saying hello to Ana Paula, who soon showed up at Nic's room.</p>
<p> &quot;... as I said, I was going to leave you alone, unpacking, sleeping...&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Hello, you guys&quot;, Ana Paula said hello, timidly, and looked at 
  Nic like she was looking at something different from what she expected. He got 
  up and hugged her.</p>
<p> &quot;It's been so long, little girl!&quot;, he said. &quot;How are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Things are alright with me. How was your trip? What about England? Did 
  you do a lot of different things there?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Sure. Before I came back, I could see the snow. There is a lot of different 
  things you can do with the snow that you can't do here, without it&quot;, he 
  said. &quot;I took lots of pictures, my parents are seeing them, I'll go there 
  soon get them to show you. All the hard work I had to do before traveling was 
  definitely worth it.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And look at all the stuff he brought me&quot;, Lu&iacute;sa showed a 
  lot of things among some clothes that would soon have a place with the other 
  piles of things she already had.</p>
<p> &quot;Whoa, Lu&iacute;sa... Particularly, I think this is exploration, I knew 
  you had asked Nic for some gifts, but I thought that it would be something symbolic...&quot; 
  she laughed.</p>
<p> &quot;Speaking of gifts, I brought something for you too&quot;, Nic said, 
  searching in the suitcase. &quot;I'm sorry if this is a little more symbolic 
  than Lu&iacute;sa's gifts, but I hope you like it!&quot; he gave her two T-shirts, 
  a diary and a colored pen.</p>
<p> &quot;Nicolas... man, you shouldn't have... Thank you!&quot; Ana Paula felt 
  embarrassed, and spoke while she was looking at the T-shirts. &quot;They're 
  so beautiful! Thanks!&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You're welcome. I couldn't forget you, you're like my sister too! You're 
  always with my sister...&quot;</p>
<p> She smiled a weak smile. 'Like his sister...', he said...</p>
<p> While the three of them talked in Nic's room, Augusto and Joana were talking 
  in the kitchen, while seeing Nic's pictures. Joana had tried every way to make 
  her husband change his mind about their daughter's school, with no progress. 
  She would now try to convince him to let Lu&iacute;sa study at S&atilde;o Lucas, 
  night classes, since the girl seemed happy when she heard about this idea.</p>
<p> &quot;At night?&quot;, Augusto said.</p>
<p> &quot;Yes... Maybe it&#8217;ll be better, she could help me with the baskets 
  during the day. I have had more orders than usual, and I'm thinking about making 
  invitation cards too. It would be nice if Lu&iacute;sa could stay here with 
  me, and it would be easier if Nic and her studied at the same place, at the 
  same time.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, I promise I'll think about it. But I don't know if she'll stay 
  in S&atilde;o Lucas. That school is too expensive, and increasing every year.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It's cheaper at night.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Okay, okay. I'll think about it.&quot;</p>
<p> Joana gave Nic the pictures and he started showing them to the girls. He had 
  taken a lot of pictures while he was living in England, but Lu&iacute;sa made 
  it clear that he could have taken even more. Nic was telling them the story 
  behind every single picture, where it had been taken, who the people were that 
  were in it, and they talked for a long time. When they were done with the pictures, 
  Nic said he had to go see some friends, changed his clothes and left. Ana Paula 
  said, when she was alone with Lu&iacute;sa:</p>
<p> &quot;Your brother didn't speak a single word in English, did you notice?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;But it's impossible that he didn't learn it in five months... I know 
  he did! Because there was no other way to communicate there!&#8221;</p>
