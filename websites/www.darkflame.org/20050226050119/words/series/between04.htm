<p><strong>CHAPTER 4 - IT HAPPENED AGAIN</strong></p>
<p>The next few days were wonderful. We had so much fun together, wherever we 
  went. But, two weeks later, I got worried again.</p>
<p>We were at the pool. Nic and Guilherme had just came back with some juices 
  from the snack bar, when a little boy passed by, running, and hit Nic. The juice 
  he was handing to Adriana flew right on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God...&quot;, I instantly remembered the snack bar incident.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Adriana, that boy...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's okay... Alice, give me the towel...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, so... Do you want me to go get you another juice?&quot;, Nic pointed 
  to the snack bar, kind of confused about what to do.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no! That's okay, I'll go get one myself...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... I'm really sorry, though.&quot;</p>
<p>When Nic turned back to sit down, he stepped on Alice's foot, who yelled:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Nic, you're not exactly light as a feather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, Alicinha, are you hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Nic, lucky you...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're so crazy, haha...&quot;</p>
<p>Why did he get that nervous when talking to Adriana, and he acted totally normal 
  with Alice?</p>
<p>&quot;Let me sit here, Paula!&quot;, he pushed me off the chair so he could 
  sit with me.</p>
<p>&quot;Nic, there's no room for the two of us here! Don't you think it'd be 
  better to sit on the ground?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea&quot;, he sat, looking somewhat zen, I don't know, it was funny.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, are you going to do some yoga at the pool?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way, that's so gay...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No it's not! My dad used to do yoga with me, he's not gay!&quot;, Alice 
  complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Alice, I'm sorry, that was just a joke...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You aren't really used to Nic... That's how he is, he would never say 
  something to offend anyone...&quot;, I said, hugging Nic like he were a little 
  baby. He got disappointed because Alice did not understand his joke, while everyone 
  always did so well.</p>
<p>He was running his fingers through my hair distractedly with a serious look 
  on his face, and then I realized Adriana was looking at him. I know it's natural 
  to want to hug such a cute guy when he's upset, but that was something only 
  I could do and she knew that! But her look was like, I don't know, malicious... 
  &quot;This girl doesn't realize when she's being a pain... I'm staring at her 
  and she doesn't stop looking at Nic. It's lucky he didn't see that but is still 
  looking out into space&quot;.</p>
<p>Ah, why did I say that! I mean, think that... Just then, he came back to Earth 
  and the first thing he saw here was Adriana. With the same shy and disconcerted 
  look from some minutes ago... Maybe he was really feeling upset about her - 
  or, worse, about me - but it was not like that, he wouldn't even move! So, I 
  decided to take action.</p>
<p>&quot;Come here, Nic!&quot;</p>
<p>I grabbed his arm and took him somewhere else, without giving him any time 
  to say anything. I took him to the side of the snack bar, where the guys couldn't 
  see us, a place where people didn't usually to go.</p>
<p>&quot;What's this, are you crazy, pulling me like that? Why?&quot;, at least 
  he had a normal tone of voice, the same funny tone as always, that everyone 
  loved.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Nic, can't I be alone with my own boyfriend anymore?&quot;, I put 
  my arms around his neck, gazing into his eyes.</p>
<p>He smiled beautifully and kissed me.</p>
