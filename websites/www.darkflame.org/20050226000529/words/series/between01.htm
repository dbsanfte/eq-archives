<p><strong>CHAPTER 1 - VACATION, AT LAST</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hi mom! I have just arrived here! It&#8217;s a wonderful place, with 
  lots of people...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, come on! Look at the size of the line!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Take it easy, Lu&iacute;sa! I'm almost done... Mom, I have to go, there's 
  someone else who wants to use the phone. Kisses. Okay, Lu&iacute;sa, you can 
  make your call now... &#8221;</p>
<p> It was paradise. I had just arrived in a campground to spend one month of 
  summer vacation, from the end of November until nearly Christmas, and everything 
  was just amazing. I had never been in a campground before, particularly without 
  my parents. I went with Nic, my boyfriend; Lu&iacute;sa, his sister; and my 
  neighbors-- Guilherme, her boyfriend; and Val&eacute;ria, Guilherme's sister. 
  It&#8217;s amazing that my parents let me travel with only my friends and, especially, 
  with my boyfriend... There were dozens of people there, whom I had never seen 
  before, but that wouldn't be a problem. The chalets weren't big, and I would 
  share mine with Lu&iacute;sa and Val&eacute;ria and two other girls, Adriana 
  and Alice. Nic and Guilherme would share another chalet with two other guys, 
  Jo&atilde;o and Cl&aacute;udio, at the male area.</p>
<p> While putting our things in order in the chalet, we started talking to Adriana 
  and Alice:</p>
<p> &#8220;So where are you from?&#8221;, said Alice, the most cheerful one.</p>
<p> &#8220;Sorocaba&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa answered, picking up the mood.</p>
<p> &#8220;We've been there once, in a gym competition. &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Are you gymnasts? &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes. I mean, I still am...&#8221;, said Adriana, joining the conversation.</p>
<p> &#8220;I had a problem with my ankle and had to quit the gym... &#8221;, Alice 
  explained. &#8220;It was a shame, I loved it more than anything. But I play 
  volleyball now from time to time! &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Gymnast... aren't you a little &quot;old&quot; for that? &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, but I'm still in shape. I can still pull it off! &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;And where are you two from? &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Rio de Janeiro. &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You came here from Rio to spend your vacation in the middle of nowhere?&#8221; 
  , Val&eacute;ria laughed. &#8220;If I lived anywhere on the coast, I would never 
  leave the beach! &#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, you get tired of something if it's too much... Don&#8217;t even 
  mention the beach to me!&#8221;, said Adriana, on her way to the bathroom to 
  put on her bikini.</p>
<p> &#8220;The guys in my brother's chalet... do you know them?&#8221;, Val&eacute;ria 
  asked.</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, they're from Rio too. Cl&aacute;udio is Adriana's neighbor, and 
  Jo&atilde;o is his friend. I don't know how we ended up together, though.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Did you like them, Val&eacute;ria?&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa instigated, 
  while arranging some clothes in the suitcase. &#8220;You can't live alone forever, 
  you know!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I loved them both, Lu&iacute;sa, you can't imagine how much!&#8221;, 
  Val&eacute;ria answered sarcastically, since she didn't like the insinuation. 
  Lu&iacute;sa laughed.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The pool was immense. With two platforms in the middle, which water fell from, 
  and a waterfall in a corner that leaned on a wall of stones. On the other side, 
  two water slides. Four changing rooms, a snack bar near the pool and a restaurant 
  across it, along with the mini dancing club. It didn't look like a campground, 
  actually... But that was ok. The entire place was really huge, with lakes, woodlands 
  full of trails, and some of those gorgeous places that no one knows exists.</p>
<p> Well, the guys were already in the pool waiting for us. We introduced each 
  other, and conversation began cheerfully, showing that the vacation would probably 
  be really enjoyable. Nic challenged Guilherme, Cl&aacute;udio, and Jo&atilde;o 
  to a swimming race. Trying to show off more than the other one, they jumped 
  in the pool. It's incredible how guys like to compete for everything, to show 
  off for no apparent reason! Well, Nic wouldn't challenge anyone if he weren't 
  sure he'd win. And that's just what happened: Nic, winner and very proud of 
  himself, sat beside me and a couple minutes later led me... to the slides.</p>
<p> Nic knew that I was very afraid of those high, fast and &#8211; from the look 
  of them - dangerous things, and I think that was just why he wanted me to go. 
  When we were far enough from the others, I told him there was no way I would 
  go.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, you know I don't want to go...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Why, Paulinha? Look at all those people who are going, it&#8217;s really 
  fun...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;But I don't want to go, I don't like it!&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic is not the kind of person who, in this case, would call me a wimp and 
  grab my arm and lead me to where he wanted. But he was stubborn, and wouldn't 
  give up:</p>
<p> &#8220;Paulinha, it's just a slide... And do you remember all those things 
  we've been through six months ago? You risked yourself to save Lu&iacute;sa 
  from those kidnappers and you did it just fine. Why would you be afraid of a 
  slide now?&#8221;</p>
<p> I just couldn't find an answer to a plea like that. Six months ago, Lu&iacute;sa 
  had been kidnapped because of a mistake, after having her mother killed also 
  by mistake, and we saved her by ourselves. And I did the worst part, the most 
  difficult one, and everything went just fine. But I envied Lu&iacute;sa-- she 
  was right there, happy, telling everyone about that episode like it was something 
  normal, or at least a bit exciting. I was afraid of a simple slide and always 
  felt ridiculous because of it. Nic tried everything he could think of to turn 
  me into a more &quot;courageous&quot; girl. At his side, I thought, I could 
  at least look courageous...</p>
<p> The line was enormous, and it took forever for us to climb up all the stairs. 
  Nic had the brilliant idea of taking me to the higher one. I did not want to 
  go, but he made me go. The wait was killing me, because I had to do my best 
  not to look down. I had never been afraid of heights, but knowing that I would 
  throw myself down there on a fast, curvy slide was terrible. Well, some decades 
  later, we reached the platform. There, while waiting for the others to go down, 
  I accidentally looked to the sides and saw the pool, the little pool, down there. 
  I was shaking. Nic noticed it, and said &quot;calm down...&quot; holding me 
  by my waist. Before I knew it, I was already sliding. Nic was coming right after 
  me and I had this bad feeling that he was faster than me and would run me over.</p>
<p> It was actually really fast coming down, and when I opened my eyes, I was 
  already in the pool. I almost hit a little girl. Nic was laughing, happy, and 
  suddenly hugged me and called me to swim with him. At that point I was already 
  laughing too. It was impossible to get nervous around Nic. After a couple minutes, 
  we went back with the others. Lu&iacute;sa asked me if the slide was fun, if 
  it was worth the time spent in the line. I said it was, and noticed that Nic 
  was holding a smile. If it were anybody else, he would be making jokes, and 
  the funny thing is that no one ever felt offended by his jokes. But maybe he 
  knew I'd get upset and remained quiet.</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa grabbed Guilherme's hand, and they ran to the slides. <em>Lu&iacute;sa</em> 
  grabbed Guilherme, not the other way around... I wish I was just like her!</p>
<p> Cl&aacute;udio had just arrived with some juices, and we stayed in the pool 
  drinking and talking until Lu&iacute;sa and Guilherme showed up again, it looked 
  like they took longer to slide. Since they started dating, after we rescued 
  Lu&iacute;sa, the two of them were inseparable. They adored each other, maybe 
  more than Nic and me. People even asked me sometimes if they ever got tired 
  of each other's faces, even for a couple minutes...</p>
