<p><strong>CHAPTER 14 - HOLY NIGHT</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up, Sleeping Beauties!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic?! Ah, I'm sleepy...&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa rubbed her eyes. Nic was 
  opening the curtains, and a big light filled the room. I tried to smile, still 
  not moving.</p>
<p> &#8220;Where were you? We were waiting for you...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I'm sorry... We met some people, walked around...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Where&#8217;s Guilherme?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;He went home...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Poor Val&eacute;ria slept in our guestroom...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, I told him we&#8217;d meet him at Solar this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;We are?! Cool... Thanks for not asking us about it!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Sorry... But you&#8217;re going, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p> Lu&iacute;sa got up and went to change clothes. My clothes were all messed 
  up too, so I went home.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic, it&#8217;s me. Are you going to Solar?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Val&eacute;ria called and said Guilherme&#8217;s 
  still sleeping...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hehe, cool. But I can&#8217;t go anyway, I'm going out with my mother 
  for some Christmas shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Hmm, that&#8217;s right, Christmas is tomorrow. What are you getting 
  for me?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;A piranha for your aquarium, is that okay?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, just let me go get some insurance first...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, well I'm not telling you anyway. Actually I still don&#8217;t 
  know what I'm getting for you... I&#8217;ll look for it today.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Wow, I'm really impressed! Well, Lu&iacute;sa and my father went to 
  buy the remaining gifts, but don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve bought yours already.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Cool. I'm not worried. Well, I&#8217;ve got to go now. Goodbye!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Kisses...&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic hung up and thought.</p>
<p> &#8220;How many 18 years old guys I know are in love like I am? Guilherme 
  doesn&#8217;t count, because he&#8217;s 19 already...&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom, we&#8217;ve been walking for decades with all these bags... Are 
  you sure something&#8217;s missing?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Your aunt L&uacute;cia, from Fortaleza, is spending Christmas day with 
  us this year, and she has &#8216;a couple&#8217; kids...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I know, &#8216;a couple&#8217;... Z&eacute;, Mu, Rafa, Pat, J&eacute; 
  and Kel...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;And Juninho, who was born on the 4th of last month.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;God, what a zoo! Well, okay... Um, Lu&iacute;sa invited me to go to 
  her family&#8217;s house on Christmas and New Year. Even if she hadn&#8217;t 
  invited me, Nic would&#8217;ve...</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay, but go home the next day to say hello to everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Is everyone staying in our house?!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes... We&#8217;re going to borrow some mattresses, and we&#8217;ll 
  put them where we can.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, that&#8217;s going to look like a beehive, with people falling 
  out of the windows!&quot;</p>
<p> And we kept walking, talking...</p>
<p> &#8220;Mom! Mom! Mom! Stop!&#8221;, I pulled her inside a store. &#8220;Look 
  at this jacket, it&#8217;s perfect for Nic...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Which one?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;The black one, with the &#8216;Bad Boy&#8217; symbol on the back...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;, a saleman approached.</p>
<p> &#8220;How much does this jacket cost?&#8221;</p>
<p> I could feel my mother&#8217;s wallet calling for help.</p>
<p> But we bought the jacket, after some negotiation. After all, Nic deserved 
  it...</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Hellooo...&#8221;, I said, still sleepy, I had just been woken up by 
  the phone ringing.</p>
<p> &#8220;Paula, it&#8217;s me, Lu&iacute;sa. Are you coming with us today?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Yes, I'm coming... I mean, going!&#8221; the laugh on the other side 
  of the line woke me up a little.</p>
<p> &#8220;So be here tonight, we&#8217;re leaving at eight o&#8217;clock, we&#8217;ll 
  go to my aunt&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Okay... what about Val&eacute;ria and Guilherme?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;They&#8217;re coming too. So will &Aacute;lvaro, because the only relatives 
  they have in this city are out on some trip.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I understand... You can wait for me, I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, gifts for me!&#8221;, Nic wanted to get the gifts I had with me.</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about it, only at midnight!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Let&#8217;s go, we&#8217;re late!&#8221;</p>
<p> Everyone got in the car. &Aacute;lvaro, Val&eacute;ria and Guilherme followed 
  us, in their own car. In a couple minutes we reached the block, which had the 
  most cars I&#8217;d ever seen.</p>
<p> &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the house we&#8217;re going to&#8221;, I pointed 
  to a big, noisy house, which was full of people.</p>
<p> &#8220;You guess well. Well, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have any problem 
  if we park in the middle of the street.&#8221;, Augusto was driving, leaving 
  enough space for a car to pass, if needed.</p>
<p> We got out of the car. I had done this before, because I already knew some 
  of Lu&iacute;sa&#8217;s relatives from her mother&#8217;s birthday &#8211; her 
  last one, by the way. Guilherme was calm around Lu&iacute;sa, but Val&eacute;ria 
  seemed a little nervous, maybe she was thinking we would leave her alone with 
  those people she didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hi, everybody!&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa was the first one to enter, saying 
  hello to the people as she was finding them, and introducing Guilherme and Val&eacute;ria. 
  And me too, obviously, many of her relatives still didn&#8217;t know me. Augusto 
  followed us, with the bags full of gifts.</p>
<p> &#8220;May I help you?&#8221;, the host offered. It was almost nine o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p> We were all in the living room, us and Lu&iacute;sa&#8217;s cousins who were 
  about our age. Over the next hour, more people arrived.</p>
<p> &#8220;Hello, hello... Um, I can see there are new people in here...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh&#8221;, Lu&iacute;sa got up and hugged her cousin, who did the same. 
  &#8220;This is Guilherme, my boyfriend, Val&eacute;ria and Ana Paula. This is 
  my favorite cousin, Jefferson, known throughout our family as Magic J&eacute;...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Magic J&eacute;? You play basketball, I bet...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Exactly. Next year I&#8217;ll be moving to the capital to play professionally.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;How old are you?&#8221;, I was astonished.</p>
<p> &#8220;Twenty-two. Okay, okay, you don&#8217;t need to say I look seventeen, 
  but that means that I&#8217;ll look twenty-eight when I'm really forty...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Man, you really are from Nic&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;What can we do? The Porter family kids are perfect!&#8221;, Nic didn&#8217;t 
  even open his mouth to speak. He got hit by some people, and that was all.</p>
<p> &#8220;But why is Jefferson your favorite cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Because he made a three-pointer for me, and a two-pointer for Nic&#8221;, 
  Lu&iacute;sa explained.</p>
<p> I realized that putting Nic, Lu&iacute;sa and &#8216;Magic J&eacute;&#8217; 
  together could result in only one thing: an explicit demonstration of self-pride. 
  It was funny. We were talking and soon it seemed like Val&eacute;ria, Guilherme 
  and I were talking to old friends.</p>
<p> &#8220;Guys, come on have supper!&#8221;, someone called to us.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s midnight already?&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;No, it&#8217;s eleven-thirty.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, huge difference...&#8221;</p>
<p> The food was all on a big table, people would serve themselves and go eat 
  on the little tables on the backyard. It was likely it would rain, but everything 
  was under a roof.</p>
<p> The clocks said midnight, everyone wished Merry Christmas to each other. A 
  little boy wanted to see the gifts, and the dinner was interrupted.</p>
<p> There were tons of gifts there. I&#8217;d never seen anything like it, everyone 
  gave presents to everyone else. It looked like a Christmas movie, just that 
  the snow was missing.</p>
<p> Val&eacute;ria, Guilherme and I only brought gifts for each other, but I bet 
  no one else would care about it. So, after the rush ended, the five of us traded 
  gifts peacefully. Nic wanted us to exchange gifts alone.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing spectacular, but I thought we could make this moment 
  special...&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;You just did...&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic opened the gift I gave him first. I think he loved the jacket, because 
  he wore it immediately, and it wasn&#8217;t cold at all. He couldn&#8217;t stop 
  saying good things about it.</p>
<p> &#8220;As soon as I put my eyes on it, I knew it was made for you.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Ah, I didn&#8217;t know I looked like a Bad Boy&#8221;, he turned his 
  back to me, showing the image. I smiled. &#8220;Look, this is my gift for you...&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic gave me the little box he had left on the table. I opened it. There were 
  two gold necklaces, very beautiful.</p>
<p> &#8220;Nic... they&#8217;re so wonderful...&#8221;, I looked at them, feeling 
  every little ring it had.</p>
<p> &#8220;I thought about a pair of rings, but I liked these necklaces so much&#8221;, 
  he explained, while he put one of them on my neck. &#8220;This one is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p> I looked at the pendant. It was a heart crossed by an arrow, with Nic&#8217;s 
  name written on the back.</p>
<p> &#8220;And this one&#8221;, he put the other on his own neck, and held the 
  pendant, it was just like mine. &#8220;is mine. It has your name on it. Be sure, 
  that for the time I'm wearing it, it&#8217;s because I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p> Nic never looked so sincere to me. If he proposed at that moment, I'd say 
  yes immediately, certain that our happines would be eternal.</p>
<p> &#8220;So do I&#8221;, that was all I could say. We hugged each other, in 
  a long, deep kiss.</p>
