<p><strong>FREEDOM</strong></p>
<p>Our choices give directions to the destiny.</p>
<p>It walks with its own legs.<br>
  If we don't stop it, it doesn't stop.<br>
  If we don't care for it, it doesn't heal by itself.<br>
  If we don't hold it, it falls.</p>
<p>And when it does...</p>
<p>The first falling may be light.<br>
  Just a hole dig by a dog.</p>
<p>The second one hurts more.<br>
  Not only dogs dig holes.</p>
<p>The third one is mortal.<br>
  It may be from a cliff. From a tower.<br>
  From a plane.</p>
<p>It doesn't help crying. Cliffs are cruel.<br>
  Regret doesn't kill, but also doesn't give life back.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>I didn't cry.</p>
<p>I let it go. So simple.</p>
<p>I stopped it. I cared for it.<br>
  But I didn't hold it.</p>
<p>After so many fallings, it was too much hurt.<br>
  No magic could heal it.<br>
  Why would I suffer?</p>
<p>We approached the cliff.<br>
  And I let it fall.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>I'm free.<br>
  And it was a big relief, so big.</p>
<p>I did my part.<br>
  I stopped, I cared.<br>
  But all the time they held out a leg, and the falling took place.<br>
  So I let go, when there wasn't any more medication to that trouble.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Relief. Lightness. Relief. Freedom. Relief.</p>
<p>And the lesson is left.<br>
  The story.<br>
  To tell<br>
  - not to everyone.</p>
<p>Did I lose something?<br>
  No... I didn't.<br>
  What was there to be lost?</p>
<p>But I learned:</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Never again.<br>
  Down there in the cliff, it will remain.</p>
