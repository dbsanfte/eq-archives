<p><strong>BEYOND THE WALLS</strong></p>
<p> There is not a way to get away from this thing that blocks me<br>
  This loneliness that tightens and mistreats me<br>
  I see that face in every thing,<br>
  I feel your eyes in every thing.<br>
  Nothing can fill this space<br>
  This emptiness that was left when you went away.<br>
  I still wait for your return<br>
  Still count on it to end my torture<br>
  But I can't<br>
  your voice calls me<br>
  and I can't do it, I can't hold it<br>
  It's a pain, a deep agony this waiting<br>
  And the loneliness takes me<br>
  Consumes me, destroys me<br>
  Maddens me.<br>
  Nothing exists, nothing sings<br>
  Only your voice, far, distant<br>
  that calls me and at the same time tells me<br>
  not to wait for you anymore<br>
  Nothing makes sense<br>
  While the loneliness and the distance are so big and obscure.</p>
