<p>I give special attention to comments about my english and my stories. They 
  are very important to me, because if I know what people are thinking about my 
  writing, I can improve it, and I think that's the main purpose of this site: 
  self-improvement.</p>
<p>Feel free to e-mail me about anything and everything, reply will be sent shortly.</p>
