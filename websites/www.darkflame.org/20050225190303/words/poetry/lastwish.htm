<p><strong>LAST WISH</strong></p>
<p> When I die, I want to be happy.<br>
  To die as an old and peaceful lady, like all I was waiting for<br>
  was my heart to stop beating, and my lungs to stop breathing.<br>
  To die in the winter, on my warm bed<br>
  May my death be like a sleep with no waking up. With no pain.</p>
<p>Will I have by my side someone who loves me in that moment?<br>
  Maybe.<br>
  It would be better to pass away first, so I wouldn't suffer for the loss.<br>
  But I'd rather go last, so the one I love wouldn't suffer.</p>
<p>When I die, I want a beautiful coffin.<br>
  But before that, I want to give to use what might have an utility in me.<br>
  May other people see with my eyes, purify their blood with my kidney<br>
  I want to be given the gift of this so special help.<br>
  I want, in my viewing, all the attentions to me;<br>
  I want, in my funeral, caution;<br>
  and the chance to rest in peace with my already gone loving ones, whom I missed 
  so much.<br>
  And after all this is done<br>
  I want people, at home, living their lives<br>
  Remember me with no sorrow, but with love.<br>
  With affection.<br>
  Just like I always remembered my dead ones.</p>
<p>I want to die, knowing that I lived.<br>
  With no regrets for having not done what I may have once desired.<br>
  To die satisfied, thinking that, despite the brevity of life,<br>
  I lived.<br>
  I want to die, certain that I have known love<br>
  That I have known happiness, even if it was momentary<br>
  That I have known perseverance, joy, realization<br>
  And also pain, sadness, indignation, pity<br>
  because these are the things that keep us away from the egoism.</p>
<p>I want to remember, in my last moments<br>
  The trips, the different places I have been on. The cultures I learned to live 
  together with, and that brought me unforgettable lessons of life.<br>
  I want to remember the people I helped.<br>
  The people to whom something I teached, even if I had never known that.<br>
  The people who smiled when I told them something; the people who cried when 
  I cried with them.<br>
  I want to remember the people I didn't like,<br>
  think that I never saw them again, and imagine that their lives changed, and 
  that one day they may have become important to someone.<br>
  I want to remember my negative experiences<br>
  And all the positive things I got from them.<br>
  To remember of my mistakes<br>
  and also that I learned with them not to do them again.</p>
<p>I want to die with a clear conscience,<br>
  certain that I leave no enemies.<br>
  Or, at least, certain that I always said what had to be said<br>
  so the people could judge me based on my real life, being fair.<br>
  Misunderstandings may ruin a friendship. A life. And I don't want to think I 
  had some participation in it.</p>
<p>Yet, if there is something to be ruined, let it ruin, with no laments.<br>
  After all, many people don't have the same thoughts I do.</p>
<p>When I die, I don't want to think about the future I won't live.<br>
  The discoveries I won't know about.<br>
  the new things I won't use<br>
  the people I won't meet<br>
  the life improvements I won't share</p>
<p>The wars I won't watch.<br>
  The intolerance I won't see.<br>
  The egoism I won't find out.</p>
<p>But, when I die, I'll have the hope that this will be a better world for the 
  ones who stay. And the ones who will come. And come.</p>
<p>When I die, I don't want to have my things thrown in the garbage.<br>
  My belongings only exist because they're important to me.<br>
  And what's important to me should be kept - this is my wish.<br>
  My story must be preserved, so my memory can be preserved.<br>
  I didn't live my whole life to die and to be forgotten.<br>
  I want to be admired. I want my experiences to be useful.<br>
  I want to remain alive in the memory of the ones I gave life to.<br>
  I want to die certain that my expeciences and my knowledge<br>
  Won't die with me.<br>
  I want to die looking at some box<br>
  which will have inside everything I could register while I was healthy.<br>
  I want my grandchildren to see my pictures<br>
  to read my diaries and my poetry<br>
  to utilize my knowledge in their lives<br>
  and, this way, don't let me to die completely.</p>
<p>I want die, finally<br>
  With the certainty that I have been important to someone.<br>
  That my staying in this world has not been for nothing.<br>
  To die knowing that, if nothing exists afterwards<br>
  I have done my part here.</p>
