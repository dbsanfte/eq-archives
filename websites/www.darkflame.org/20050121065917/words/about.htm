<p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p>This website is dedicated to one of the things I love the most: writing. I 
  write because I like, because it does me good. I write to myself, to my self 
  pleasure, but I love when people read and give me their opinions. I publish 
  my writings on the web as an exercise, so everything is available to whoever 
  wants to read.</p>
<p>I'm brazilian, 21 years old, female, Renata, college, work, boyfriend, internet, 
  books, movies, photography, happy, worried. Want more? <a href="mailto:words@darkflame.org"><br>
  words@darkflame.org</a>.</p>
<p>Sugestions, criticism, greetings, comments, problems, ideas, friendship:<br>
  <a href="mailto:words@darkflame.org">words@darkflame.org</a>.</p>
<p>As a warning, I should say that since I'm brazilian, I speak and write in Portuguese. 
  When you find a mistake, please consider that I'm not that fluent in English. 
  I translated most of my writings with <a href="http://geocities.com/allyswritings" target="new">Ally</a>'s 
  help (thanks a lot!), but if you feel like helping or even telling me about 
  a specific error, please: <a href="mailto:words@darkflame.org">words@darkflame.org</a>. 
  You won't sound mean, you will actually be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>This site have been constructed by me, so the layout and everything that's 
  inside belongs to me. I don&acute;t like people who copy. If you liked something, 
  just ask me for permission to post somewhere else. It doesn&acute;t hurt, <i>stealing</i> 
  does.</p>
<p>And if you write too, get in contact. I'd love to exchange some texts and ideas.</p>
<p>What else... have fun.</p>
