<p>I don't host. It's not because it's a personal domain - I don't use half of 
  the space and would be very glad to host a couple people, but I don't do it 
  only because I don't have private ftp access and I don't want to give people 
  my ftp password. Maybe in July I'll look for another host that offers this feature, 
  and then I'll offer some space to people. Please don't email me asking for hosting, 
  because it's a no-no.</p>
