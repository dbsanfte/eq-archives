in joining a guild full of great people that have tons of fun playing&nbsp;<br>
EQ on the Cazic-Thule server then post a message in the General forum&nbsp;<br>
on the
<a href="board.html"> message board</a> and a couple of our members will make arrangements&nbsp;<br>
to meet you in-game and get to know you.  If you have any questions about&nbsp;<br>
guild membership, events, policies or anything else,  just post your&nbsp;<br>
question in the general forum on the
<a href="board.html"> message board</a> and one of our members&nbsp;<br>
will be glad to reply with an answer.<br>
