</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Guild Class Definitions / Responsibilities</P>
<P>Guild Leadership</I><BR>
The guild leadership consists of the Guild Leader and the Guild First Officer (if one is appointed.)</P>
<P>The guild leadership is responsible for guiding the general direction of the guild and speaking on behalf of the guild when appropriate. The guild leadership also maintains final and ultimate responsibility for the guild and its members.</P>
<I><P>Guild Officership<BR>
</I>The guild officership consists of all officers within the guild. </P>
<P>The guild officership is responsible for performing invitations to the guild, assisting the membership through education of the guild and the Code, and assisting the Guild Leadership in directing the guild.<BR>
<BR>
Guild Officers are either Senior Officers or regular Officers. Certain Officers may have specific duties (such as Banker, Events Coordinator, etc.) Those duties will be reflected on the guild roster.</P>
<I><P>Guild Membership<BR>
</I>The guild membership consists of all persons carrying the Advocacy of Shadows guild tag.</P>
<P>The guild membership is responsible for upholding the Code of Conduct and supporting fellow guild members.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Code of Conduct</P>
</I><P>Every member of the Advocacy of Shadows represents the guilds through their actions. With this understanding, a code of conduct has been established. The Code of Conduct is based on a set of common-sense rules and is the foundation upon which we operate.</P>
<P>(1) Members shall abide by the EverQuest "play nice" policy which includes such matters as kill stealing, fast "ninja" looting, creating trains, etc.<BR>
(2) Members shall refrain from communications that violate community standards (ex. extremely profane language)<BR>
(3) Members are expected to show an acceptance of persons that are different from themselves and shall not show acts of discriminatory bias. Further, members are encouraged to speak up against acts of discrimination or prejudice in any way.<BR>
(4) Members are encouraged to become involved in both our community, and communities abroad.<BR>
(5) Members are strongly encouraged to read and post on the AOS forums. This includes<BR>
posting their current levels as they progress, so that our roster may be as accurate as possible.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Violations of the Code of Conduct</P>
</I><P>Should a member perceive any violation of the Code of Conduct, or a violation of the spirit which our guild is founded upon, the member is encouraged to discuss their concern with the member involved and/or the guild leadership/officership.</P>
<P>When a possible violation is presented, the guild leadership will review the alleged violation. During this review, the guild leadership may request input from the officership and/or the membership</P>
<P>Should the review by the leadership find that the member was in violation of the Code of Conduct, actions may be taken against the member, include warning, temporary suspension, temporary deguilding, or permanent deguilding.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Requirements for Membership</P>
</I><P>It is preferred that all members entering the guild are of level 20 and above. The person being guilded must have the support of an officer and/or a member.</P>
<P>Exceptions to this requirement are as follows:<BR>
(1) real life friends and/or family members<BR>
(2) alternate accounts, when the primary account is guilded<BR>
(3) special circumstances, following a review by a member of the guild leadership.</P>
