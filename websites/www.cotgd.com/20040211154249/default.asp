								      <td align="left" colspan=2><span class="newsbody">Circle of the Golden Dragon (called “Circle” from here on) started off as a family guild.  Our purpose was to create a family atmosphere for members to play in, and be greeted by friends in.  We achieved this goal and then some.  We have focused on the guild as individuals, and have tried to meet as many individual needs as we could.<BR><BR>But we have reached a point in Circle where better gear and an increase in raiding is needed to grow the guild.  People want the gear drops from mobs in the higher tiers.  Others just want to be able to attend these types of raids.  Circle has come to another path on the road we chose a long time ago, one that veers into a different direction.  The choice to continue down the road we are on or to take this new path needs to be made.  If we stay on our current path, there is little room for future growth or to reach the new goals set before us.  To take this new path, will lead us to these goals and allow us the growth ability the guild needs to become stronger and more defined.  However, this means we must scale down a few other aspects of the guild to accommodate this growth.  We will not abandon them, but a balance must be struck to obtain our goals.<BR><BR>Circle is embarking on becoming a raiding guild.  And in this choice there will be changes and stricter requirements.  Our primary focus will be on our main characters.  Alternates will only be considered as a distant secondary focus when they are able to raid and of use to the guild.  Epics and quests are important, but will not be as important as the need to be raiding.  We are still embracing the guild as a family, but certain things must change.  First and foremost will be raid attendance.  If your guild plans a raid, you must attempt to make it to the raid, and be on time.  You will be required to know how to play your character.  There will be little room for mistakes as these mistakes can cost the guild greatly in lost time, drops, and money for corpse runs.  You will be required to understand “How” to raid, not just attend.  You will also be required to follow directions of the raid leader and your group leaders, for failure to do this will result in the possible loss of raiding privileges with your guild.  Raid attendance will be monitored and those who attend will be rewarded with points with which to use to bid on items that drop during the raid.  If you are online during a raid, you will be expected to attend that raid if you are of sufficient level to attend.  Quests and grouping for experience will be considered secondary in importance to raiding with the guild, so you will need to drop what you are doing and help your guild raid.<BR><BR>This is just a brief explanation of what is to come.  We are not abandoning the family atmosphere and play-as-you-will fun factor, just scaling it down to allow raiding a chance to grow.<BR><BR>Everyone will be required to have a character account on our guild’s website; read and acknowledge as such, the raiding guidelines and any other documentation thought to be important; and have their main character up to date on the guild website.  There will most likely be more.  A new site is being designed to accommodate the requirements and features we discussed here.  It will be up to you to keep up to date on the raids and to attend.  We *WILL* be watching…<BR><BR>Aliseisu Dryaden<BR><font size=1><i>CotGD Webmaster/Guild Leader</i></font></span><br><br></td>

I am going to cut a few options from the new site and maybe add them in later if the options are that useful.<BR>My main goal is to provide the guild with a place to link to our forum, provide a guild roster, and keep the guild up to date on the raids and events we are holding.
