																	<p>For many months Circle of the Golden Dragon had been the home to, who we think of as, the best people in the game.  Many of which had become dear friends of Kiyra and I (Aliseisu).  I had played Everquest for 5 years, ever since Beta Test Phase 4.  Our guild lasted through many phases of the game.  The recent announcement of Everquest 2 and the lack of entertaining content from Sony has led us to this point.</p>
																	<p>This point, or crossroad as I like to think of it, is the lack of interest in EQ1 and playing on the Rathe Server.  What exactly does this mean.  As far as the Rather Server and EQ1 is concerned, CotGD is no longer inviting members and those that wish to stay can do so till Sony catches on that the guild is faltering in attendance.</p>
																	<p>This website will still be here so you can see if we intend to move to EQ2 when it is released.</p>
																	<p>Everquest has just become the same old thing to Kiyra and I.  Even the new expansions that were relesased, Gates of Discord and the new Omens of War, hold nothing of interest for us.  So it is with sad regret and a heavy heart that we have decided to downsize our playing to a few days a month or even to change servers and play low level characters again when we do play since the Rathe server contains many guilds who's focus is to reach the "End Game" content.  In all seriousness, the high end of the game is not how we met you all, nor is it how we see us spending our valuable time.  We met most of you when you were low level and built our friendships over time.  The high end of the game is nothing but a boring grind with high end requirements that are accompanied by high end disappointments and frustration.  That is just how we see it.</p>
																	<p>The guild and it's tag is there for those that simply will never leave for end game content.  My characters will be on from time to time as will Kiyra.  If you see us on, Hail us and say "Hi!", as we are only looking to enjoy our time spent in EQ by not grinding it away by getting experience and AA points.</p>
																	<p>Cya all around!</p>
