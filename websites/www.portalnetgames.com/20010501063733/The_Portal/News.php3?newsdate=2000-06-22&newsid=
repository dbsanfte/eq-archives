  <br>
  ***Todays Updates***<br>
  <br>
  *The Hole*<br>
  <br>
  We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on
  the continent of Odus. The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest,
  available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status. The files
  necessary to enter The Hole are available via the &quot;Optional Patch&quot;
  button at the bottom of the patch program interface. The files are quite large
  (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to
  postpone downloading the files until later.<br>
  <br>
  As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support
  characters starting at about level 40. It should be regarded as extremely
  dangerous. As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT
  TO TOXXULIA FOREST. The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or
  jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br>
  <br>
  As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying
  interest in &quot;coin-only&quot; loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to
  retain item- loot, we have implemented &quot;coin-only&quot; looting rules for
  PvP combat on Vallon Zek.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Resurrection*<br>
  <br>
  Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in
  order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection. Due to the
  increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, weve raised this
  limit from two hours to three. This should assist players and make it easier
  for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Warping*<br>
  <br>
  We put in some code that should help decrease the &quot;ghosting&quot; (NPCs
  appearing to be some place they arent) being reported in some of the larger
  Kunark zones. Please let us know how this goes.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Locked Doors*<br>
  <br>
  We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked
  doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks.
  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the
  lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked
  doors without opening them.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Vox and Nagafen*<br>
  <br>
  Over the past couple of weeks, weve received more and more reports of these
  dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s)
  adventurers. As weve always felt that Dragons should be special encounters
  that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br>
  <br>
  One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level
  where the level 60 folks would find them challenging. This would have the
  disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy
  Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just
  now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another
  possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more
  powerful group of people. This would have the undesired effect of allowing
  some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br>
  <br>
  Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, weve instead decided that
  dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to
  pick their own fights. Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some
  difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons. This should
  help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon
  without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players. In addition,
  it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the
  younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br>
