  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063211.html"><b>Karana
    Split</b></a><br>
    I do find it strange that your guild wasnt moved. The second attempt only
    netted 169 accounts wishing to move. Though I was pleased to see that we did
    get most of the people who wanted to move in the first attempt, even given
    the short notice, I was still quite surprised to find it so small.<br>
    <br>
    Have your friends kick an email to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>.
    Theyll see what they can do.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063241.html"><b>Lack
    of Plane of Sky Items in Last Patch</b></a><br>
    Im not sure what items your guild has, however, it was the end result of
    quests in the Plane of Sky that received some enhancements. Intermediate
    items didnt, since most of those are components for the quests themselves.
    Most of the quests in the Plane of Sky have yet to be completed, so the
    number of people who saw increases might be pretty small.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Your branch will remain
    in game as is That decision has not been made yet.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    It is true that this decision hasnt been made yet. We stopped the drops of
    the items pending the decision of what we are going to do with the existing
    ones, if anything. Well probably discuss it Monday in the tuning meeting.<br>
    <br>
    As you know, we seriously dislike making changes to items that already exist
    in game. However there are exceptions where we must for game balance. Were
    also considering the twig that everyone likes as well.<br>

    Tables/Foraging Bug: Blackout</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Actually i doubt youve
    missed it as in havent seen or heard of it, just that it appears youve made
    afternoon rounds for posting on the boards and Ive seen no response to what
    is obviously a very heated issue.<br>
    <br>
    Namely, the bug with the loot tables and foraging last night. The worst
    thing to do is to leave us in the dark about this. It has been okay for us
    to debate it this morning while Im sure you had many other things going on
    but now that you have seen fit to post on other topics some sort of update
    would be really appreciated.<br>
    <br>
    What is Verants current stance on what happened? We know there was a loot
    bug, we know it has happened before, we have heard rumors of the scope of
    this problem (large and disturbing), and heard rumors that no corrective
    action is planned by Verant to restore the state of the game prior to the
    &quot;incident&quot;. Does/has Verant taken any action to correct this? What
    would really help is some solid facts, and those are only going to come from
    one person. You.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue.<br>
    <br>
    The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In
    addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available
    within the zone, not just random in nature. Its not like level 60 gear was
    showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone
    where the equipment was found normally.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback,
    the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss
    of experinece and play time, weve decided not to pursue it further.<br>
    <br>
    We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063082.html"><b>/Roleplay
    Bug</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: No Aixsponsa. You are
    mistaken. In a recent post by Abashi. Two days ago. He specifically stated
    that the bug would be fixed in this patch.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    No, I stated that it wouldnt be in this patch, but the one after that, with
    the ability to use emotes on NPCs. The thread is at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062206.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062206.html</a><br>
    <br>
    But as long as this came up, I should probably clarify that it will be in
    the next client patch. Well probably be patching the servers again either
    today or tomorrow, but this stuff is part of the client.</li>
