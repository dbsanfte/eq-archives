    Posts</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Have you ever noticed
    that almost all the topics in this forum are negative! Nothing seems to be
    done. Its always complaints, or people saying theyre quitting because of
    poor customer services... What do you think about US? I just dont get it...]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    People stop complaining when their issues are addressed. Often this is
    preceded by a few posts of praise, but those are quickly drowned out by the
    next group of people with issues that they feel need to be resolved. No one
    feels any reason to keep responding to praise threads because they feel that
    nothing good will come of them, afterall, their issue is resolved.<br>
    <br>
    This is just the way human psychology works. We do address a great number of
    issues from week to week. Its just hard to get people as worked up about
    being happy.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056995.html"><b>&quot;What
    does it mean to play EQ?&quot;</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: First, what is VIs
    &quot;vision&quot; for EQ? Personally, I have no idea what it is. Evidently
    it is important to VI, so why are they so shy about fully and completely
    saying what it is? Shouldnt it be in the manual? What about on this site?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Well other people actually mention the &quot;vision&quot; more often than
    what we do. Its not exactly something that can easily be quantified and
    placed on a web-site for open viewing. Its the culmination of everything
    that weve planned, expected, and learned about EQ throughout development and
    later into production. Its how we want EQ to be.<br>
    <br>
    People often say that ClassX should be able to do &quot;X, Y, and Z&quot;
    (what X, Y, and Z are varies from class to class and person to person). In
    some cases, these ideas are contrary to what we had planned for the class
    (e.g. our vision for the class). Theres no document that we can open up that
    tells us what we can or cannot do in all cases. Sure, we have the several
    hundred page EQ design doc (which will never be public), but it of course
    doesnt cover anything.<br>
    <br>
    When an issue comes up that hadnt been previously considered, we (the design
    team) sit down and decide whether that issue merits some kind of action,
    based upon whether there is a problem to be solved, whether a solution is
    viable, and whether that solution fits into what we had in mind for the
    game. If we can come to some sort of agreement, we modify the
    &quot;vision&quot; (e.g. In this case, our thoughts and feelings about the
    way things should be).<br>
    <br>
    A lot of people who read the board and the news sites on the Net probably
    can give you a pretty good idea as to what our response will be to any
    particular issue. Overall, we want to provide people with a challenging and
    fun game, to the extent that it encourages them to play the game for a long
    time.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Second, what does EQ
    want to be when it grows up, besides being EQ2? The issue here is it a FPS
    with some community interaction or is it a CRPG?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Were obviously going for RPG :) But being an RPG doesnt mean that we can
    force people to &quot;roleplay&quot;, as people have differing ideas as to
    what &quot;roleplay&quot; is. Furthermore, there are players that no matter
    what environment they are in, will never &quot;roleplay&quot; as a matter of
    choice. What we can do is provide everyone with options. Whether or not they
    pursue those options are up to them. I would love to see a world where
    everyone acts &quot;in character&quot;, I just dont think that theres any
    way that this could be enforced.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Roleplaying requires a
    certain amount of interaction beyond &quot;Where do you want to camp? ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I would certainly agree with that. Of course, people have to make the
    decision engage in things other than camping. If everyone chooses to play
    the game in the fashion of choosing the quickest path to advancement
    regardless of the amount of fun that they have *during* that process, then
    that is their choice to make. You, as a roleplayer, can choose not to camp.
    You can choose to take actions other than that being taken by the people who
    are only interested in advancement. Sure, both options are valid gameplay
    styles, and we support it for that reason, but at some point people have to
    be responsible for thier own choices.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: There is no real growth
    in a character that I can associate with camping on trainer hill in CB
    waiting for the SBS to drop ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    The easy solution here is: Just dont do it. Choose to take actions that
    support &quot;real growth in a character&quot; in your opinion.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Well, you say, what
    about the powergamers? What about them? The game as it currently is is
    geared towards them. To them, EQ is an FPS. More involved than most, but
    still just a hack-n-slash for exp and loot. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Only if people *choose* to play it that way. Again, its in your hands.
    Choose to play it in a different manner. MMORPGs are not single-player games
    that can provide a single plot with some minor subplots, and expect everyone
    to follow them. MMORPGs have to provide all possible content up front and
    allow people make their own decisions in regard to how they are going to
    choose to play the game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: If they want to develop
    a true roleplaying community, they desperately need to add some human
    intervention on the back side. What this means is that GMs and/or guides
    establish quests and storylines and get people involved in them. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    These can and do occur, quite regularly. Of course, unlike pen and paper
    games where four or five people are sitting around a table with one guy
    directing the dynamic content, EQ has 265K+ subscribers in nearly every
    country in the world. Though wed like to be able to provide a &quot;DM&quot;
    to every group of people for the purpose of generating dynamic content
    directly for them, finances dont allow it, at least not for $10 per month.
    The Holy Grail for every MMORPG, both present and future, is to give people
    the feeling of a dedicated DM. Small MUDs can sometimes do it, but no game
    of this scale really can. This is one of the reasons that player-run events
    are so popular. The player can create their own dynamic content for
    themselves and their fellow players. Check out some of the news sites. There
    are usually a dozen or so player-groups doing this every week.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Next, hybrids. Why is
    this concept so difficult in EQ? When I first signed up, it never even
    occurred to me to be anything but a ranger. Ever since I started reading the
    boards, I have seen very little to show me that this was a smart choice. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Id recommend against letting others on the internet decide for you how you
    feel about things. I read a post from a guy here a couple of weeks ago. Hed
    played the game for three months, had a wonderful time the entire time he
    was playing. Someone referred him to the boards, and a couple of weeks later
    he quit. He got the impression that somehow something must have been wrong
    with him judging by the amount of negativity on these boards. He was having
    the time of his life, until he let someone else tell him how he should feel.
    Decide for yourself.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Nerfing - Why does this
    even occur? If there is a problem with a certain class/object/spell/race,
    fix it. Lessening a skill/ability/person because there is a problem does not
    address the problem.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Sometimes nerfing is the *result* of fixing the problem. Nerfing is simply
    making something less powerful or useful than it was in the past. Though
    painful, it is sometimes necessary. As game designers, though it would be
    more popular, we cannot allow ourselves to get into a situation where we
    exclusively *UP* the power of things in the game in order to make up for an
    imbalance. If one item is too powerful, we often won’t get into a
    situation where we have to A) provide weapons of higher power to everyone
    else in the game B) then up the power of the NPCs in the game to make up for
    the fact that everyone is now more powerful. Nerfing is sometimes the best
    choice for the health of the game. At other times, the best choice is
    enhancement.<br>
    <br>
    We will do whatever we feel is the best choice for the issue at hand, and it
    will usually be the choice that affects the least number of people.<br>
    <br>
    As an example of how perceived “mudflation” occurs, take a look at the
    “rangers plight”. Six months ago, everyone (meaning, other melee
    characters) were all complaining about how powerful the ranger was, and how
    it was our “pet class” since it’s fairly well known that Brad plays
    one. Six months later, rangers are now complaining about how bad they are.
    No negative change has been made to the core ranger class. What happened?
    Some other classes received enhancements whereas the rangers didn’t. This
    “imbalanced” the ranger class in the eyes of many who play them. They
    feel that they’ve been nerfed even though no negative change has been made
    to the class. They now want to be enhanced based upon the perception that
    they are no longer as powerful in relation to other classes as they once
    were. This is the danger of mudflation.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Customer service - It
    seems to border somewhere between being a sick joke and an active campaign
    by VI to tick as many people off as possible. I got stuck in a doorway in
    Felwithe because of some glitch. I could not do anything. I petitioned and
    it took almost 1/2 hour before a GM showed up. They did nothing. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    If a GM showed up and “did nothing”, there’s a good chance that it was
    an apprentice guide, since they do not have the powers that a full Guide or
    GM does (e.g. the power to unstick you). I do apologize for it taking a half
    an hour to “show up”. Keep in mind that there are a bunch of people on
    the server, all of them expecting the same level of service as the next guy.
    Though you’ve only petitioned two times in your EQ career, there are many
    that petition hourly for one issue or another.<br>
    <br>
    We do the best that we can to provide you with the best customer service we
    can for a $10 per month fee, and we continue to improve the service
    regularly. Though I wish we could change this, there will always, however,
    be people who feel that they have received poor service, and will take their
    issue to the public. Many of these situations arise out of unrealistic
    expectations about what GMs and Guides can or should do. I think that
    perhaps one of the more pressing issues to be addressed by customer-service
    at this time is to help the players understand the situations in which they
    can expect customer-service help. Hopefully if we can do this, we can cut
    down the number of requests that we have to deny, giving more time to
    address the issues that we have some control over.<br>

    <br>
    We have the ability to attach level restrictions to effects on items,
    whether those items proc (fire randomly, like when a weapon strikes the
    target), or the item is activatable (like jboots). The &quot;effect
    limit&quot; on items is seperate from the level requirements (and race/class
