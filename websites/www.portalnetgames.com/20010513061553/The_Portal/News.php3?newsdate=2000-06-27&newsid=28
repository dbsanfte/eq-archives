    Scroll Idea</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: If you play a druid, you
    are constantly asked to sow people. If you are an enchanter, legions of
    players ask to be breezed/claritied. If you play a wizard, armies flock to
    you for taxi services and binding.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    We dont view these things as bad. Quite to the contrary, players relying on
    other players is a big part of the game by design.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: This causes a lot of
    wasted time for those that can provide these types of services. For example,
    if a wizard is asked to teleport, the wizard has to meet the person
    somewhere, he has to memorize the spell, he has to cast it, he then needs to
    get back to where he wants to be and finally, at some point, he has to
    meditate to regain the mana lost by teleporting someone]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Very true, but there must be some cost to the dependence otherwise it is
    trivial. For instance, if there was an item in game that created unlimited
    money, the value of money would drop significantly as these items showed up
    in game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: When it comes to SOW,
    breeze/clarity, teleport, and binding, I think other solutions should be
    available.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Some other solutions for some of these are available in the form of Alchemy.
    Not for everything of course as we wouldnt want to destroy class
    interdependance, or turn one class (shamans) into the class that replaces
    all others.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: How about giving casters
    a new skill called ‘spell scroll’ or something to that affect. The
    ‘spell scroll’ skill could then be learned like any other skill. Using
    the ‘spell scroll’ skill, casters could create single-use spell scrolls
    ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Any further expansions in the area of providing a craftable item that
    invokes a spell will be made via alchemy. Though I appreciate your opinion,
    we dont want to see classes excluded from a group on the basis of the people
    in the group being able to cast a bunch of those spells.<br>

    We had a company thing going on this morning. I didnt get into the office
    until shorly after 1pm my time, which would be after 4 yours. Then I found
    over 150 emails, most of which were about the PvP thread posted yesterday.
    People are quite passionate about the issue :)<br>

    Bertoxxulous) that a split is coming soon.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    The /movelog command can always be executed. We just clear the file that is
    generated at the time that registration for a move is officially opened.<br>

    Its in our network room now undergoing setup and configuration. It looks
    like well probably be taking registration either later this week or early
    next week.<br>

    Elves &amp; Rods</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant half elves
    equip mod rods ? it seems that they should be all all . Half elves are the
    only race that cannot equip.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I dont have the stats on the item handy, but if it is available to all
    classes, theres no reason to exclude half-elves from the list of races. Ill
    check into this tomorrow and see if we can get it in for the next item
    update after this Thursdays patch.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/057142.html"><b>Does
    Abashi defend and protect EQ or listen to the customers?</b></a><br>
    I dont think that the two concepts are mutually exclusive. We want EQ to
    remain successful and to do that we need to keep our players happy. Of
    course keeping players happy isnt as simple as granting &quot;wants&quot;.
    Its not about &quot;defending and protecting&quot; EQ, its about keeping the
    game fun and exciting.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes that requires doing things that might not seem to make a whole lot
    of sense until I have a chance to explain it. Even then, Ill surely be
    unable to explain it, or &quot;convince&quot; everyone that the chosen
    course is the best course of action. Heck, sometimes the chosen course *isnt*
    the best course of action. In these cases weve consistantly shown that we
    listen to the players concerns and act upon them.</li>
