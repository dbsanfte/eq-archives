here is a summary:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061142.html"><b>New
    Q&amp;A Forum</b></a><br>
    Hello all,
    <p>We have added a Quality Assurance forum to the forum list to allow players
    to chat directly with the Test team concerning bugs in the game. Both Ester
    and &quot;Hobart&quot; will be posting in the forum, and I imagine that they will
    be posting an intro soon.
    <p>As a reminder, the forum there to assist the Test team with the
    documentation of bugs in game. We will continue to post there as long as the
    forum serves its purpose. I ask for everyones assistance in keeping it
    flame-free. If it turns into Gameplay, we will scrap the idea until we have
    the boards shifted over to allow only active subscribers the ability to
    post.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061133.html"><b>Karana
    Split</b></a><br>
    We have decided to do a secondary split on Karana, moving another batch of
    players off to Terris-Thule. /Movelog registration will open Friday around
    7pm and will remain open for 24 hours.
    <p>Please check the patch message for details. The message should be up
    shortly.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061063.html"><b>Soloing</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: refer to the link, long
    post]</i></font>
    <p>As I have mentioned before, there are classes that can solo in certain
    situations. However if you are looking for a server setup where anyone can
    solo for experience, at any time, and in any situation, thats not something
    that we will see in EverQuest. Soloing requires reduced dependence on other
    classes, so giving everyone the ability to solo means that we would have to
    eliminate class dependency.I am sure that it is a valid niche, and I am sure
    that other game companies will make games to fill that niche, however we
    prefer to produce games that encourage interaction.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061055.html"><b>Superior
    Healing</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: But ACK.. that means
    paladins are left out??? Thats the main thing I do nowadays.. HEAL. And
    casters are welcome to the damage I deal out. So can paladins get superior
    heal at 53 as well, please?]</i></font>
    <p>This is not a change that we would consider making at this point. Druids
    and shaman are supposed to be better healers than Paladins, since paladins
    have such an advantage in the melee and &quot;tanking&quot; areas.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060999.html"><b>Monk
    Damage</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I think Abashi stated,
    pre-Kunark, it was a 15% boost in damage over a comparably equipped and
    leveled warrior]</i></font>
    <p>Actually, the only time that I believe I made any statement in the form
    of a percentage was when we put in the innate haste for monk hand speeds. As
    I recall, the statement was something along the lines of High level monks
    should now do roughly 15% more damage. I do not believe I ever made a
    statement comparing them to a similarly equipped warrior, other than to
    state that they should generally do more damage. Correct me if I am wrong.
    <p>That said, monks are still the best toe-to-toe melee damage dealer, which
    is right where they are supposed to be. Monks rock.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060532.html"><b>Band
    of Eternal Flame</b></a><br>
    You would be in a better position to answer if it is still dropping than I. I
    generally do not go for answering questions of this nature unless the item
    was so common or in for so long that it had become &quot;expected&quot;.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058408-2.html"><b>Jolt
    Improvements</b></a><br>
    It was a 1 second improvement, or roughly a 30% improvement in casting time.
    I would call that &quot;real&quot;. Perhaps the misunderstanding is the typical
    one on this board, that an enhancement is &quot;useless&quot; unless it
    unbalances the class. Of course since we try not to make changes that do
    that, we are in a bit of a catch-22.
    <p>We are considering upping damage output for rangers though.</p>

<span class="newstext">
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060784.html"><b>Welcome
    Back Gordon!</b></a><br>
    <br>
    Hello all,<br>
    Weve all returned from EQ Gathering III in sunny (and hot) Las Vegas. The
    event went *very* well and Id like to extend thanks to all of those who
    attended. I imagine that those who didnt go will be able to view reports
    being given by various web sites, many of whom were in attendance.
    <p>Several events took place at the gathering, including a Trivia Contest
    and the &quot;RealLife Quest&quot;, an EQ oriented scavenger hunt. Kudos
    goes to one of the groups of Rangers for winning the Trivia Contest, and to
    a team from Povar who took the &quot;RealLife Quest&quot; by gathering
    nearly 80 items found regularly within the game. One of the more creative
    items turned in was a real human tooth submitted to represent the
    &quot;Giant Elephant Tusk&quot; in the scavenger hunt.
    <p>Overall, the Team here at Verant enjoyed the chance to meet the players
    and discuss the issues at hand. I personally had the chance to speak with
    several hundred people, quite a few here from the boards, and found the
    whole experience very positive and refreshing. We definitely look forward to
    going to the next one.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060819.html"><b>On
    Dwarf Paladins</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: According to EQ lore.
    Brell created many things. Among them are the so called good races such as
    Dwarves and Gnomes. However he also created the Splitpaw Gnolls, Runnyeye
    Goblins and also created those elementals who run amuk in Tox forest killing
    Erudites.]</i></font><br>
    Well, Teerog covered it pretty well. Its certainly a valid way to look at
    everything. One question I would like to ask however, who said Brell created
    the Gnolls and Goblins? Now before someone follows up, I invite you to read
    the deity description when creating a dwarven paladin *closely*.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060814.html"><b>Angry
    Clerics</b></a><br>
    Ive read the posts, and havent found the issue that you cite to be any more
    pronounced than for any other class. As most people cite clerics as one of
    the most desirable group members, I doubt that theyll be going anywhere
    soon. There will always be some people who do not enjoy the life of a cleric
    and they will move on.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060797.html"><b>Forum
    Posts and IP Tracking</b></a><br>
    Thanks for the heads-up. The work to restrict posting on these boards for
    anyone but active EQ subscribers is finally moving forward, and I imagine
    that well see it in a couple of weeks. Following that change, well begin
    strictly moderating the boards.
    <p>As it is now, about all we can do is delete the wholly offensive posts
    and cross-reference IP addresses with those used to log into the game. Were
    committed for these boards to once again be a useful tool. Those who have
    nothing better to do than issue flames and personal attacks can move on.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060796.html"><b>More
    on the Boards</b></a><br>
    I believe the concern is that if we limit it to active subscribers, were
    giving people who are trying to hack accounts real station names. Weve
    actually got that problem solved. The implementation will link the Stations
    authentication servers into our (EQs) login database. Instead of displaying
    the Station name, well display the Chat Handle. Being one company now
    certainly has its advantages
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060781.html"><b>Necklace
    of Superiority</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Been trying to get
    information for days...Does anyone know if necklace of superiority is still
    dropping even rarely? Heard it drops in howling stones, heard it drops
    rarely or not at all in Dalnir]</i></font>
    <p>This item was originally dropping off of the wrong creature. It has been
    moved to a new location in game.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060697.html"><b>Really
    Long Bug List</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:1)The Random Faction hit
    bug in Kunark is still around. Mobs are still charging at people from
    rediculous distances. The odd thing is, if you stun a mob and run away with
    sow, it will not follow you, yet if a mob is aggro on you in some different
    case, it can charge at you from the other side of the zone. The aggro list
    is bugged still.]</i></font>
    <p>These arent random, and have to do with the propagation of the hate list.
    If you cast a beneficial spell upon someone who is on a hatelist, you are
    also added to that hatelist, and will receive a faction adjustment when that
    creature is finally killed. As for this and the pursuit issue that youve
    outlined, weve labeled these issues as &quot;features&quot; associated with
    the large Kunark zones.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:2)The boat is going in
    the wrong direction in OOT. When you are heading east your sense heading
    says west and vice versa]</i></font>
    <p>Its a known issue, and cant be fixed without rebuilding the zone, tying
    up level-designers for man-months. Given that, weve waived this bug.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:3)Mobs in Qeynos Hills
    literally teleport. Anyone who has hunted Tovax Vmar knows exactly what I
    mean. Test it yourself with a low level character...when he starts to run,
    he vanishes.]</i></font>
    <p>The &quot;Start to flee and disappear&quot; teleport bug was fixed
    several months ago. If you are certain that it has resurfaced, please let me
    know.]
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:4)When a PC goes LD,
    the pet becomes rogue. If the party is fighting a mob and the &quot;rogue
    pet&quot; kills the mob, no one is awarded xp and the fallen monsters body
    vanishes.]</i></font>
    <p>The pet isnt completely rogue, but it does become the &quot;pet of an NPC&quot;,
    presenting the issue that youve described. This is a known issue, works as
    designed, and weve no short term plans to make changes to these mechanics.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:5)Enchanter Illusions
    do not show size correctly. As a gnome, all my illusions show me gnome
    sized, even ogres. This would be deadly in PVP since enchanters can no
    longer cast mez in cities.]</i></font>
    <p>Were aware about the size issue. The only people who see you as your
    original height are the ones that are zoning as you cast the spell. This
    issue cannot be fixed due to the way height changes are reported to clients.
    The issue has been waived.As for not being able to cast Mez in cities, I
    dont know what you are refering to.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:6)Sometimes illusions
    wont break, and one is forced to stay in a particular form until one zones
    or logs.]</i></font>
    <p>Ive had this happen to me a couple of times, but we dont have a way to
    reproduce it. Once we can find a way to reproduce it we should be able to
    make some progress on it.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:7)Standing too close
    to a wall makes you invisible to players zoning in. You have to relog to
    clear it.]</i></font>
    <p>I dont think that this is attributable to being next to a wall, but
    rather is associated with packetloss issues. The system only updates who is
    visible or not when there is a change in status. When zoning in, for some
    reason the visibility flag isnt set properly. You would be able to see them
    if they were to cast invisibility on themselves then cancel it, but would
    otherwise have to log/zone out and back in. This is another issue where a
    reproduction method is lacking, and where we might be able to take some
    action if we can find out what is causing it. Its rather intermittent, but
    Ill ask Ester the Tester to take a look.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:8)Many times if you
    are hit while zoning, you can pop up into the same zone you were zoning
    from, with full health, at usually loc 0,0. I have had this happen to me in
    Mistmoore and Crushbone multiple times.]</i></font>
    <p>Youre actually put back at the last save-point. Its a feature to handle
    cases where you are killed between the time that your client thinks you
    start zoning and the time that the zoneserver gets the message that you are
    zoning. Its one of the downsides of internet latency. The &quot;pop back at
    savepoint&quot; is a second chance to get out of the zone. The other option,
    and some will remember when this was in, was to leave your dead corpse
    behind the zoneline.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:9)Stronger members of
    the &quot;Slow&quot; line of spells are overwritten by weaker ones. Not sure
    if this is a bug, but all the other spells seem to follow the &quot;Stronger
    Replaces Weaker&quot; trend.]</i></font>
    <p>Yes, its a bug. We hope to make some headway in fixing it soon.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:10)Clipping Plane
    still not set to full value in zones. This can be seen when it was raining
    in the Old World and Kunark.]</i></font>
    <p>Brad explained this as a &quot;feeling&quot; that the players were
    getting when rain or fog was stopping, that it would momentarily extend
    sight beyond the distance where it was normally available with the max
    distance set on the clipping plane. Were still looking into whether that
    additional distance is actually viewable or not.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:11)In Dalnir, the Kly
    Imprecator on the 2nd floor, or anything that spawns in his spot, can pop up
    through the ceiling and shortly despawn after that. ]</i></font>
    <p>Im not familiar with this NPC popping through the ceiling, but the
    despawn is intended. Ill forward this to the Test Team.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:12)When Someone
    invites you into a group, if you dont reject their offer you are bugged

    list.

    This is invariably 2 mobs attempting to occupy the same space in the game,

    the ground, and more often than not, you end up with 2 on you.]</i></font>
    <p>Its a known issue created by static (non-moving) spawns occuring at the
    same location. It typically happens in Newbie zones because they have a very
    high concentration of critters in a smaller area. This could probably be
    fixed but would take quite a while to do. As such, higher priority things
    usually take precedence. Thankfully newbies learn pretty quickly that

    The argument that &quot;they can /ignore&quot; or &quot;they can turn the

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello all,<br>
  Theres been a bit of misconceptions lately about the function of our Quality
  Assurance department. One of our QA Reps, affectionatly known as Ester the
  Tester, asked me to post this for her.<br>
  <br>
  -Gordon<br>
  <br>
  --------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  Hello!<br>
  <br>
  Let me introduce myself. I am ‘Ester the Tester’ (yes it rhymes) and I
  have asked Abashi to post a letter from the testing department to all of our
  players. I attended the EQGathering this weekend and spent quite a bit of time
  listening to players concerns. I felt that having Abashi put up a post
  detailing what the testing department is and is not may help the communication
  process between us and you the players.<br>
  <br>
  What we do:<br>
  1. We read each and every email sent to eqtesting@verant.com<br>
  2. We read the bug reports as often as we can<br>
  3. We attempt to the best of our abilities to reproduce the bugs the players
  send us<br>
  4. We assign bugs to the Development Team.<br>
  <br>
  What we do not do:<br>
  1. We do not have creative control over anything in game<br>
  2. We do not continue reading emails if they are abusive or flames<br>
  3. We do not do reimbursals<br>
  4. We do not respond to any emails, if we did this nothing else would get done<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I would like to list a few things that if included in the emails and bug
  reports that would make it much easier for us to reproduce the situations.<br>
  1. Zone name<br>
  2. Location -- /loc<br>
  3. Full names of NPC’s<br>
  4. Full names of items - not abbreviations, I don’t know all of them!!<br>
  5. Location<br>
  6. Any mitigating circumstances even if they seem trivial (you’d be
  surprised)<br>
  7. Location<br>
  8. Server - even on bug reports, some times they get shuffled<br>
  9. Location<br>
  10. Did I mention Location???<br>
  11. Server name<br>
  12. Location<br>
  <br>
  If you are reporting a broken quest PLEASE include the starting NPC’s full
  name, the zone it is in, the NPC’s loc, and the phrase used to trigger the
  quest. This will save us SO much time when reproducing these bugs.<br>
  <br>
  Something else that is useful is the threads that talk about broken quests, or
  bugs in the game. It is a little difficult to sort out the wish lists, flames,
  complaints, but we have pulled bugs out of those threads and some of them are
  already fixed.<br>
  <br>
  I am a firm believer in communication. I as also a firm believer in EverQuest,
  and the team of testers I work with. There are some things we just don’t
  catch. We haven’t played every class race combination to 60, so we
  desperately need your input. Please remember that the testing department can
  not change anything fundamental in the game, so the rants and flames are a
  waste of your and my time. To be honest, when I get an email that is offensive
  I stop reading right there. It is the same with posts.<br>
  I do lurk on these boards, and I communicate frequently with Abashi. Sometimes
  he will ask for more information and clarification. This is usually me asking
  him to find me some more information so we can reproduce whatever bug you are
  talking about.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you for playing EverQuest and caring so much about this game. I do
  promise to lurk and read. I’ll never post, but if Abashi says Ester the
  Tester said well that was me.<br>
