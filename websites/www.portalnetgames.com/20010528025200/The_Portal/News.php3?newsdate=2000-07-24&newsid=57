  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064461.html"><b>More
    Rallos Zek Issues</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: There is NO WAY AT ALL
    that this can be implemented! The gankers just die, then come back again and
    again. They get an item then either bag or bank it. Theres no way at all to
    &quot;outlaw&quot; the practice.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    You can start. Refuse to take them on plane runs. Spread their name across
    the server. Dont socialize with them. Refuse to trade with them. Turn them
    into social Pariahs.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Secondly, you mention
    that the POD can only control one flag and that flag is already set for all
    Rallos players. Then PLEASE tell me why the POD is even there? He serves no
    purpose whatsoever.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    You are correct, he serves no purpose on Rallos Zek. NPC spawns are not
    configured on a per-server basis. It wouldnt make much sense for us to
    maintain 34 different sets of spawn data to cover each server.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: You yourself know that
    programmers can do anything and everything with the code. So, the POD can be
    changed to control other flags.Its that simple.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Its not that simple. Sure, a programmer can do anything. However doing it in
    a reasonable amount of time without affecting anything else isnt always
    possible, nor in the best interest of the game. In this case, there is no
    &quot;other flags&quot;. Creating &quot;other flags&quot; would require a
    pwipe. Creating &quot;other flags&quot; without a pwipe would require more
    time than is feasible.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064451.html"><b>How
    much do un-nerfed Pumice Stones go for?</b></a><br>
    I doubt that the change has been in long enough for a stable market to form.
    Its pretty likely that when we missed a few vendors the first time that we
    were trying to implement the change that people rushed out and bought tons
    of the things. In any case, Im pretty sure that the value will be severely
    limited due to the fact that it is still a 5 charge item.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064452.html"><b>Whats
    the scoop on todays Tuning Meeting?</b></a><br>
    Hasnt happened yet :)<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064446.html"><b>Karana
    Still Overpopulated</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Any chance of getting
    another split to TT off Karana?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    At this point that wouldnt be fruitful. Weve already split them off a second
    time, leaving /movelog registration open for 24 hours, and only 169 accounts
    chose to move. It appears that everyone, or most everyone, on Karana at this
    point wants to be there.<br>
    <br>
    If we were going to take another group, it would probably be from one of the
    other servers, but nothing along those lines is planned at present.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064423.html"><b>Monk
    Posts on Gameplay Board</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Good lord 17 monk posts
    on page 1?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Thats interesting. For the past several months, monk posts havent been out
    of the ordinary in number. It sounds as if this &quot;drive&quot; is being
    organized from an external source. I guess Ill take this opportunity to
    mention again that attempting to monopolize the front page with a specific
    issue will just lead to the posts being closed.<br>
    <br>
    I havent read any of the posts yet, but my guess is that they make note of
    specific issues relative to monks. Things such as &quot;Thunderous Kick is
    too weak&quot;, &quot;Flying kick should have some minimum damage&quot;,
    &quot;Shiverback armor is low in AC&quot;, &quot;Our Kunark armor isnt very
    good&quot;, etc.<br>
    <br>
    While those might be good and accurate observations about some specific
    issues, stepping back and taking the entire class, even with its faults
    (which every class must have), leads to the inevitable conclusion that monks
    still rock despite their faults.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064442.html"><b>Monks
    Lose Power Post 50</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: The gap, apparently,
    closes GREATLY.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Yes, the gap closes. Monks go up. Warriors and Rogues go up faster. No one
    &quot;loses&quot; relative power.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: How can you keep calling
    monks the best toe to toe fighters? Perhaps pre 51 this was true, as we had
    a huge bonus in skill over other classes. But now that youve made Warriors
    and Rogues *nearly* equal in skill to Monks AND given them triple attack and
    double backstab ... there is NO way monks are still the best toe to toe
    melee damage.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Backstab is not a &quot;toe-to-toe&quot; situation. Yes, monks still do more
    damage in a toe-to-toe situation over a given timeframe than the other melee
    classes. Not as much as they used to, but they still do more than the others
    given appropriate equipment.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064416.html"><b>Invis
    Bug?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I was invis in CB throne
    room looking to see how full room was so that I would not start train. Since
    when can Orc Legos see invis? I was standing there looking at them when one
    somehow saw me and attacked. I still had the &quot;invis&quot; icon on my
    screen and had just casted at steps to castle. Please explain ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Theres at least one thing that could have happened making it possible for a
    creature in there to see invis. Some creatures also have a chance, however
    miniscule, to see through invis regardless.<br>
    <br>
    In any case, NPCs gaining or losing abilities that they had or didnt have in
    previous weeks is one of the things that can change in the game.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060259.html"><b>Wrongfully
    Suspended?</b></a><br>
    Though I cant speak to your specific issue, its not at all unusual for
    suspensions or bannings to affect every account registered to a person or on
    the same credit card. This is particularly true if the suspended person logs
    on to the other account to contest the action.<br>
    <br>
    For instance, if I have 4 accounts in my family, get suspended in one, then
    procede to log on to each of the others and contact a GM, they will all end
    up suspended.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I just have to laugh. In
    several years of running BBSes, every time someone tried to hack something
    or create multiple accounts or some stupid thing they got caught at, it was
    always &quot;my little brother did it&quot;]</i></font><br>

    Hehe, youd be surprised how unruly those &quot;little brothers&quot; are.</li>
