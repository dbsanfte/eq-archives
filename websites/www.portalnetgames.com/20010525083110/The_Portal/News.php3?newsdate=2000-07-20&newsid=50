    the total of group damages (if you dont believe me i post you logs). ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Even if true, it only puts the class a few percentage points below an equal
    contrabution. Of course, equality in damage dealt isnt a goal when in a
    group. I doubt that a group would expect a bard, for instance, to even do
    that much damage. Overall it depends on the makeup of a group.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We dont have decent
    Kunark weapons.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I guess thats subjective. Theres definitely some good paladin weapons out
    there, and your skill with them is nearly equal to that of a warrior.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We take more xp than
    others class.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Depends on what the other classes are. Also remember that race figures into
    the formula as well. Anyone who groups with an ogre or troll warrior
    shouldnt disparage, for instance, a human paladin.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We are not done for
    decent pulling.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    But you can certainly take damage, decrease the groups downtime, and perhaps
    you also have a good reputation and personality, which are the primary
    factors that determine who gets into a group.<br>

    <br>
    Thanks for the note. This is the first post Ive seen where someone noticed
    that he resurrection problem had been fixed to the level that was suggested.
    Not only do we keep experience from being lost until you agree to the Res,
    but we also tell you whos casting it and what they are casting. Both of
    those were as suggested.<br>

    <br>
    Im not sure what you mean by &quot;say no now, say yes later&quot;, are you
    referring to the dragging, or where the resurrection issue wasnt considered
    a bug? Our &quot;Vision&quot; must be somewhat flexible due to constant
    changes and new content thats put into the game. Theres only a relatively
    small number of issues that we are absolutely firm on. The others take the
    form of there being &quot;no short term plan&quot; to implement a particular

    Theres no problem with the amount of damage being done by monks at this
    time. Though a flying kick of 3 points of damage does sound a little

    the monk overall, which isnt warranted at this time.<br>

    Actually this has been ruled out. Melee types are already as good with their

    the specialization something to do.<br>

    Yeah, we know. Try some of the Kunark dungeons which were built to encourage
    people to move through them. Of course we cant stop people from camping
    entirely should they choose to do that. Luckily there are dungeons that
    people dont camp. Perhaps you could try some of those.<br>

    <br>
    That would be cool, but we probably wouldnt attach a particle effect to a
    weapon of that caliber. Particle effects are reserved for the really nifty
    items. You should start seeing more of them show up in the game in the near
    future.<br>

    <br>
    The classes in PvP werent setup so that theyd be equal. Perhaps you might
    not stand a chance in one-on-one combat in PvP (Im not an experienced
    enchanter). *Someone*, or some class in this case has to be at the bottom of
    the heap for certain situations. If enchanters &quot;certain situation&quot;
    is PCs with 130 MR, that seems fair from my point of view. You might
    consider going &quot;pking&quot; with a shaman.<br>

    <br>
    The way the illusion spells are currently set up doesnt rob you of the
    &quot;element of surprise&quot;, merely the &quot;element of confusion&quot;
    once that attack has begun assuming you are using a racial illusion.<br>

    Cant really do that without affecting the PvE aspect of the game, so its not
    at all likely. Enchanters are certainly strong enough in that area.<br>

    Helm</b></a><br>
    Since I notice that a number of threads are popping up on the subject, I
    thought Id address the issue here:<br>
    <br>
    The change really only affects those who were using the helm for healing. I
    think that its fairly obvious that the helm was intended as a buff, rather
    than a way to heal. Whens the last time you saw a cleric healing someone
    with Daring?<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, we considered replacing the spell effect with one that increased
    MaxHP but not current HP (thus removing the &quot;healing&quot; affect), but
    decided that increasing the casting time should address the main part of the
    problem. We will, however, leave this option open as a possibility.<br>

    <br>
    Actually our playerbase is up since it came out. Max users at peak dropped a
    little under 10 percent for the first few days than began rising again once
    people had checked out the game. Total number playing in any 24 hour period
    is up due to the number of new users from Europe.<br>
    <br>
    The changes that we have been making has been due to the fact that weve had
    the opportunity to step back and seriously analyse some of the things that
    were doing. We also had some personnel shifts that bolstered the EQ Live
    team.<br>

    In other words, were improving things not because of influence from some
