  Emergency Patch Update <br>
  <br>
  Were sorry that we have had to patch again so quickly. We found a problem with
  the change we made to the Red Scabbard. This patch is intended primarily to
  fix that issue.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
   Bug Fixes <br>
  <br>
  - Buying a duplicate lore item will no longer cause you to crash.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  -- Clarification --<br>
  <br>
  To clear up some confusion, we wanted to let everyone know that we have
  changed the timing of the spawn of the Venril Sathir remains. It no longer
  appears directly after the death of Venril Sathir. And we also urge you to
  read the patch message below about the changes to this creature.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Also since were patching to fix bugs, we decided to throw in a new feature.<br>
  <br>
  - M used in a macro will now place the name of your pet (if you have one) in
  the text of your macro.<br>
  <br>
  - Bag Positioning: Now bags will stay where you put them. Simply open a bag
  and move it to where you want it. The bag will remember its location and open
  up there again next time. This will be persistent and will be remembered when
  you log out.<br>
  <br>
  There are two things to know about this new feature. The first is that the
  default position of every bag is going to be the same. So if you open one bag
  and then another, their windows will stack on top of each other. Dont let this
  alarm you, the first bag window didnt close. Just move the top bag to the
  desired location and youll see the bottom one.<br>
  <br>
  The other thing to know is a bit more complicated.<br>
  <br>
  The saved locations for opening bags are linked to the bank or inventory slot
  that the bag is in, not to the bag itself. So if you open a bag that is
  sitting in your first inventory slot and move the bag window to a new
  location, it is the inventory slot that remembers the position and any bag
  opened from that inventory slot will open in the saved position. Take that bag
  from the first slot and move it to the second inventory slot and it will open
  in the location set for the second inventory slot. It will not remember where
  it was opened before.<br>
  <br>
  Experiment with it, it will make more sense once you try it.<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  -- Cosmic Rift Enters Beta Testing --<br>
  <br>
  Sony Online Entertainments latest massively multiplayer game Cosmic Rift
  enters open beta testing today, April 17. Cosmic rift is a multiplayer space
  action game where you take command of a star fighter and wage war with
  hundreds of other players. To take part in the beta testing, visit the Cosmic
  Rift web page (at <a href="http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/">http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/</a>)
  to get started.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  --- Patch Message Addendum ---<br>
  <br>
  Just a few notes to clear up some questions and some errors in the patch
  message.<br>
  <br>
  -- Food Changes --<br>
  <br>
  Along with the other changes mentioned in the patch message, some player-made
  food items will now have an effect on your character beyond just keeping him
  from being hungry. Well leave it up to you to discover the rest.<br>
  <br>
  Weve also added the ability to right-click food to force your character to eat
  it. This will cause the food to be eaten immediately (though your character
  can only eat so much food at one time). Food eaten this way will only last
  half as long as food eaten naturally by the character.<br>
  <br>
  -- Run the Velious Patch --<br>
  <br>
  If you want to see the new Monk textures you will need to make the changes
  mentioned in the patch message. But you will also need to run the Velious
  Patch in order to get those textures to show up.<br>
  <br>
  -- Skewer Change --<br>
  <br>
  We didnt actually change the weight of Skewers, we changed the weight of
  Spits. Sorry for the confusion.
