    Nice</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, this maybe shoulda
    been on the rants board, but perhaps GW will come down and answer this mere
    mortal....why why why do you create rules that are detrimental to the
    players? Play nice started off as a way to prevent KSing and verbal abuse.
    Play nice should not be exploited as a means of allowing everyone the same
    chance at a spot in line for toilet paper...err...getting xp.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers
    were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players. These
    other groups would claim &quot;ownership&quot; of spawns, loot drops, and
    even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience
    them. On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7.<br>
    <br>
    The play nice policies, in regards to spawns and camping, are designed to
    promote equal access to the areas. If a group can get into a room, they have
    as much right to be there as anyone else. Are the policies perfect? No, of
    course what is? No matter what policy we adopt, there will be people who are
    helped by the policy, and others that are hurt. Sometimes the policy may
    help them in one instance and hurt in another.<br>
    <br>
    As Ive mentioned in the past, if anyone has any ideas for policies that are
    easy to understand, are enforcable, do not require a larger CS team than
    before or after the Play nice policies, and will please everyone, Id be
    happy to discuss them.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004665.html"><b>Reimbursement
    For Next Patch Spell Change?</b></a><br>
    Were fairly open about the fact that things in game are subject to change at
    any time. This includes the prospect of both positive and negative changes.
    People making trades in game need to be aware that that there exists a
    chance that any item is likely to drop in value or usefulness after you buy
    it. Its sort of like buying stock in a company in that regard.<br>
    <br>
    The spell was never supposed to be usable by magicians, who ended up able to
    use it only because the level restriction was transposed by the designer. I
    really wish wed caught this sooner.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004601.html"><b>&quot;Witch&quot;
    Post Removed</b></a><br>
    Hello all, I just deleted a post suggesting that a new class
    (&quot;Witch&quot;) be created. The thread was deleted because it
    degenerated into the disparaging of practiced religion (Wicca).<br>
    <br>
    As a note to the original author of that post, as that certainly wasnt his
    intention, we wouldnt create a class by that name due to the fact that it
    does apply to a currently practiced religion. The same doesnt apply to
    reference to &quot;priests&quot; or &quot;monks&quot;, as those are
    nondescript titles in nature, and as such not indicative of any particular
    religion.<br>

    Nicolbolas,<br>
    <br>
    Im sorry that I cant address all of your issues, but I cant address *every*
    issue here on the boards. Besides the fact that there are 300-400 new
    threads per day, theres another 4000 posts to go with them. This means that
    chances are your *post* wont be addressed. However, if you stick around long
    enough, your *issue* probably will. Of course, if your issue has already
    been addressed, it might be a while before Ill come back to it. There are
    issues on this board that we could debate full-time for months and never
    reach any agreeable resolution. I however cant devote all of my time to any
    one issue.<br>
    <br>
    You might notice however that I addressed your post on the
    &quot;Draught&quot; line 20 minutes before you wrote this post.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004818.html"><b>&quot;Esters
    affront to all dwarves!&quot;</b></a><br>
    GASP! :)<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000745.html"><b>Wizard
    Draughts</b></a><br>
    The Draught line was created to give wizards the option of doing less damage
    at similar mana/damage ratio compared to ice comet, and also to give them
    similar spells across the three elements that the wizards control. The
    reasoning behind &quot;less damage&quot; was to reduce the amount that the
    wizard would aggro the target. Had we wanted to continue along the same
    lines as ice comet, we could have given similar damage spells with equal
    damage, mana, and casting time requirements.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, the additional time required to stack two draughts versus one
    ice comet is what you &quot;pay&quot; for the reduced amount that you aggro
    the target.<br>
