>From the folks at Safkas Lore

Since we were very public in announcing our suspension of postings we felt 
it only honourable that we should make our position on Verants response 
equally public.

Firstly Mr Smedly has been straight forward enough to put his hands up and 
admit that errors were made in the way in which the Mystere situation was 
handled. Fair enough, an apology has been made, likewise they have stated 
that they will NOT be pursuing fan fiction as an unacceptable result of 
peoples participation in EQ (as they do with auctions and hacking).

I feel we, as a community of active fan fiction authors should be big enough 
to accept the apology and move on. If any further instance of heavy handed 
enforcements come to light each should be dealt with appropriately and with 
the full facts to hand.

We suspended service on the site awaiting guidelines on what is acceptable, 
and while Verants answer was not categorical, it made the point saliently. 
They will not pursue authors for breach of intellectual copyright, (which is 
what we were concerned about), but they will be forced to consider their 
options should the boundaries of good taste be crossed by any given piece of 
EQ fiction.

That we feel, is fair enough, that is their right, they have to act to 
protect their brand image. Fan fiction helps to build and shape that image. 
We take pride in writing pieces that are suitable for all ages, and 
appealing to all ages, and that build upon the magical world of Norrath, we 
would like to think that is the goal of all good fan fiction authors.

We all as authors have a responsibility to consider our audience. All the 
tales on Safkas Lore are written always bearing in mind that our 
prospective audience can contain minors. If that requires toning down an 
episode from time to time, we do so. Writing has the power to be subtle and 
suggestive rather than in your face nasty or dangerous. (often it is all the 
better for such subtlety)

Roleplaying, and specifically the role playing of evil has its place, but 
must be tempered with common sense. There are various means by which authors 
can ensure that, should they wish to publish a piece that they know could be 
considered risqué they can take steps to try (to the best of their 
ability) to ensure that the work is unavailable to minors. Likewise they 
will have to consider if the piece is worth bringing possible censure from 
Verant. The responsibility is with the author here, not all will agree with 
this but that is our view.

Thank you all for listening and the support you showed during the recent 
situation, your kind words were much appreciated. (Although we did not close 
in specific support of Mystere, just to highlight the point that Verant 
needed to do some talking) Let us now move on and begin to rebuild the magic 
that fan fiction and roleplaying can bring to the world of EQ

The site will re-open next weekend with new episodes

Many thanks

Safka Fairheart
