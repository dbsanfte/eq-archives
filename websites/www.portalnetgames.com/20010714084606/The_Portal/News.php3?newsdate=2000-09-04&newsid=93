    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Peak hours: Over 100
    people in Oasis and SK, over 90 people in Lake of Ill Omen, over 80 people
    in Overthere,.....]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    And many other zones that support the same level ranges that are near empty.
    You cant make a case for a &quot;crowded server&quot; by quoting the number
    of people in an overly populated zone. We could probably remove 500 people
    from peak, and those three zones would probably have roughly the same number
    of people in them.<br>
    <br>
    Simply, the zones are crowded because people would rather go to them (even
    with them being crowded) than somewhere else that isnt. There are plenty of
    areas for people who want to go places that arent crowded.<br>
    <br>
    Thats not to say that population on SolRo *isnt* above where it should be.
    When we bring up the next split server well certainly look at SolRo as a
    potential candidate. However, there certainly *are* things to do that do not
    involve crowds on that server. After all, it is less crowded than some
    servers were pre-Kunark, and now theres many more zones out there.<br>

    Stab Broken?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I dont think this is
    right - why should one weapon with exactly the same ration be a much more
    horrible backstab over something else with the exact same ratio?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Youve answered your own question in your post: Because the damage of the
    weapon is all that is used in calculating damage from a backstab, and the
    delay isnt taken into account. What youve described above is how backstab is
    designed to work, and it works correctly given that design. Indeed, a higher
    damage weapon of a given ratio, backstabs included, will typicaly do more
    damage than a lower damage weapon with a delay of the same ratio.<br>
    <br>
    Of course we could get into damage bonuses on the primary melee slot and how
    they affect damage output, favoring the faster weapons, however I would
    imagine that two points of damage would offset that.<br>

    <br>
    Listening, just not commenting any more. Ive posted in several ranger
    threads since the boards were converted, and each post led to follow-up
    flames, personal attacks, profanity, and other things that are no longer
    allowed on these boards. Class-specific threads in general are very
    inflamatory since people are very passionate about what they play, so Ill
    probably not be commenting in those threads very much unless I can add
    something positive to them, rather than constantly telling them no.</li>

    <br>
    Indeed. Pressing the button issues a full CRC check of every file on the
    required files list for EverQuest and downloads a new version if the local
    and remote CRCs differ. We found that a few people were suffering some file
    corruption that wasnt being noticed by our normal method of version control,
    so implemented this method for those cases.<br>

    Cant really say due to our agreement with LucasArts. However, we are

    on the 3D Engine</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Since the graphics
    engine should be entirely abstract from any gameplay and networking (for the
    most part) issues why cant the engine simply be upgraded and the old engine
    still be available for those who use lesser hardware]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Its not so much &quot;cant&quot; as it is &quot;cant feasibly be done with
    reasonable time and resources&quot;. The art used in EverQuest represents
    nearly 4 years of work for a team of artists. Going through and revamping
    all of EQ proper with updated textures would take roughly half that time for
    a full team. Now, if you are talking about a completely new engine, it would
    then take additional man-years of work by programmers.<br>
    <br>
    New zone geometry, though not being possible for a platform that has to be
    backward compatible for people using the current engine, would have to match
    up in every way at every coordinate, so there wouldnt be much of a benefit
    there either.<br>
    <br>
    Basically, its not feasible because by the time wed get EQ rebuilt in the
    suggested fashion, all of the next-generation games would be out, and wed
    have an old game with a fresh look. Wed rather, when that time comes, have a
    new game with a fresh look.<br>

    The resistability or lack thereof of any spell is subject to the immunity of
    the target. In other words, even the &quot;nearly unresistable&quot; lifetap
    isnt going to work against a creature that is immune to magic.<br>

    <br>
    My company let us off early for the weekend as well :) I believe that the
    only patch that went up was a new patch program to enable some more verbose
    file checking.<br>
    <br>
    Previously, wed heard of some people experience some file corruption
    problems that arent caught by the standard version-control procedure. This
    patch gives an option for a more thorough check (a full CRC check) on the
    installed files. In other words it should not longer be necessary for tech
    support to recommend a full re-install to people who are reporting strange
    problems.<br>
    <br>
    The patch shouldnt at all affect gameplay, so theres really no issue with
    the timing for when it was put up. Im sorry you are upset, but did this
    patch reduce your ability to play the game at all?<br>

    The poll question you suggest is pretty broad and would be hard to cover in

    <br>
    I do understand the desire to complete both quests as soon as one has all of
    the quest items for either. That said its not really something that were
    planning to change. People are completing both quests, and the items to be
    garnered from either are nice enough to warrant an added level of

    Even though he posted it in jest, Dranthors reply is pretty much right on
    target. The length of the boat rides are indeed related to adding some
    realism to the process. If wed wanted something akin to teleports from one
    continent to the other, we would have went that route. The second thing
    about class-interdependence is also right on target. If the boat rides are
    too long, you have a method at your disposal to reduce the amount of time
    taken for travel.</li>

    <br>
    Hello again Robert,<br>
    <br>
    I hope that youll appreciate my being blunt. Im not really sure that I can
    tell you. The groups &quot;everywhere&quot; are not saying &quot;I am
    full&quot;. The groups in 3 areas in the game, known to be heavily camped,
    are telling you &quot;I am full&quot;. You might consider going someplace
    that isnt known to be heavily camped. You might consider trying to form a
    group of your own.<br>
    <br>
    Also, considering that you are level 48, do you not have any friends online
    who will invite you to their group? For instance, most people jump on line,
    check the friends list, find out where everyone is, and go join a friend. Do
    you not have any friends who make room and time for you?<br>
    <br>
    Last week you chose to do something very dangerous without the support of
    friends or a cleric and were upset when you died. This week you chose to go
    to 3 areas famous for being crowded/camped. You keep choosing to set
    yourself up for failure, and then cast blame upon the game.<br>
    <br>
    The game is designed to punish people who run into dangerous areas
    ill-prepared. The game is supposed to motivate people to go places less
    crowded with more opportunities by only supporting so many people in a given
    area. The game is supposed to reward people for making friends who will bend
    over backwards for them.<br>
    <br>
    The game is working fine in the situations that youve brought up. The best
    advice that I can offer is that you step outside the box and try doing
    something different from what &quot;everyone else&quot; does. I think that
    if you look around, you can probably find other people who went to Lower Guk,
    Karnors, and Rathe Mountains that night and had the same problem that you
    did. Try hooking up with those folks and going someplace else.<br>
    <br>
    On a slightly different note, make friends with people. Go out of your way
    to help others out. Theyll remember it, and will make room for you when you
    need a hand. So often I hear from people who primarily solo from 1 to 50 or
    so and then get upset that no one will group with them for the harder
    encounters. No one wants to walk into a level 40+ dungeon with someone who
    is having their first dungeon experience. Grouping skills and relationships
    are formed early on.<br>

    I really think that there must be more to this story. Any time I see
    something presented that makes it appear that the action taken by a CS Rep

    were it so clear when it occurred, theres no way that the person would have

    Youre reading a bit too much into it.<br>
    <br>
    And MMOG is just a broader description of what we make. Yes, EverQuest is an
    MMORPG. Sovereign will be a MMORTS. We have a MMOAG (action game) in
    development that we havent announced yet (other than the fact that we have
    one in development). We have a couple other MMORPGs in development as well.

    The last two &quot;new&quot; servers are still hanging around 1400-1500

    It is possible to do this, however its not really what we had in mind for
    teleportation. Wizards and Druids are supposed to take others to the
    destination, not send them to the destination. The power of teleportation is
    in the druid/wizard, and they just have the ability to extend their aura, if
    you will, to include others.<br>

    We dont sit around trying to come up with ways to make the LIVES of the

    balanced in order for the game to be challenging. If it werent challenging,
    no one would play.<br>
    <br>
    Sure, this means that certain aspects of the game are made more difficult in
    nature. An encounter might become harder to overcome. A weapon that does far
    too much damage may be weakened. A pathing issue that allows people to
    slaugther without risk will be fixed. Though these things might make one
    particular aspect of gameplay more difficult in nature, that doesnt

    place the level restriction on those encounters.<br>

    The same situation is present with the deities, and the solution that we
    have is a compromise. Vox and Nagafen remained the same yet higher level
    folks cant attack them, and the deities will increase in power, so the lower
    level folks wont be able to attack them. At the same time we are taking the

    From an RP perspective, across many fantasy worlds created in novels and

    followers. Thats basically whats happening in Norrath, a combination of
    both.<br>
    <br>
    From a loot perspective, we will indeed be moving thier current loot down to
    creatures powered similarly to what the deities are now. The deities will be
    populated with level 60 loot and become an appropriate encounter for a large
    group in that level range. Indeed, this will raise the bar for encountering
    a deity, however killing deities is supposed to be the pinnacle of success
    in EverQuest. So is encountering dragons, however in that case we decided to
    place the level cap on the old dragons to keep them within reach.<br>

    These are very different situations, and Im sorry but I cant explain it much

    loot that is dropped could hurt your chances of getting a rez in the future.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Can you tell me if
    Verant has any near-future plans to add a new zone or two to the established
    world via an optional two hour patch :P that would let us explore the new
    zone? Kudos on Paineel and recently The Hole.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    We do have additional free zones planned, with the Warrens being the next
    one on the list. Ill have to check on Tuesday to see how this is coming
    along. I think that it will still be a few weeks before well see this go
    live.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: 2) If you do implement a
    new zone, could you please just announce &quot;A new zone is available via
    the optional patch, and that no new information is to be released about this
    area. Explore!]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I like the sound of that, of course it would only be a secret until it ended
    up on the Test server :)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: There are no new zones
    for the lower levels. Can you bring this up at the next tuning meeting??
    (Please?)]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    The issue here is that there is already a vast number of areas for the lower
    level folks out there. They are not the ones who are running out of content.
    Furthermore, since they are low level, they progress rather quickly from one
    set of zones to another, meaning that enjoyment of any new specifically
    low-level zone would be fleeting. Its the mid and upper levels that are
    typically most in need of new content.<br>

    that I have faith that Verant will (eventually) address this issue.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Thanks for bringing the issue back up, and I can let you know that there is
    forward progress being made on this issue. The biggest problem that weve
    identified and taken steps to correct is a gap between smithed armor, and
    Jarsath, that is at around 20 levels wide.<br>
    <br>
    I reviewed the item list for 3 sets of class-specific armor three days ago,
    and the quests are now being written.<br>
    <br>
    As for planar type equivalents, evalutation of that end of item availability
    is behind the mid-level stuff in priority. One we get these quests in well
    start looking at the other end of the spectrum.</li>
