today that the Donals Breastplate will be changed in the near future:
<blockquote>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">We have changed this item before because we thought it was overpowered. Unfortunately, it is still overpowered. Let me
 explain why.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">This item is a breastplate that is only usable by clerics. If you right click this item, it will cast a Complete Heal on
 your target with a casting time of 30 seconds. It uses no mana to produce this effect.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">A group of two characters, one cleric wearing this breastplate and one warrior, can defeat any opponent, as long as that
 opponent can not kill the warrior in under 30 seconds.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">Let me restate that.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not
 capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone. If we allow this item to remain in the
 game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds. 15 seconds if the group consists of
 two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there...</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful, we would have to, essentially,
 rebuild the game, rebalance the classes… No single item should be so powerful that the balance of the game revolves around it. Adjusting the game
 to fit this item is not a choice. We need to change the item to fit the game.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">We have had a fair amount of internal debate over this item. It really comes down to two choices. Eliminate the item
 entirely, or change the way it works. We would rather change the way it works. After much debate and some conversations with players that have
 characters that use this item, we decided on the following change.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">The item will cast a new spell (to be named later). The effect of this spell will be to completely heal the target. The
 spell will also leave a buff on the recipient that lasts somewhere between five and ten minutes (we are leaning toward a compromise of 7.5 minutes).
 This buff will have some small positive effect (perhaps a 1 point regenerative effect), but as long as this buff is on a character, he can not
 receive the effect of this spell again. This buff will not be removable until its duration runs out.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">In practice, what this will mean is that the cleric with a Donals Breastplate will be able to heal anyone he wants every 30
 seconds. But he will not be able to heal the same person twice unless 7.5 minutes has passed between healings. The breastplate will still almost
 completely eliminate downtime due to hit point loss, and it will no longer destroy the game dynamic of EverQuest.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">There is one concern that we have as to this implementation, and Id like your feedback on it.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff. This new
 Donals effect would be, essentially, a buff. We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load
 of buffs on him. I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it.</font>
 </p>
 <p><font color="#FFFF99">Yes, we know this is a nerf. And, frankly, were willing to nerf this item to save the game as a whole. We are sorry about
 ever creating an item that is so easily unbalancing to the game, and were sorry that we have to change it again. For now, I cant tell you when this
 change will take place. It wont be until after weve finished the work that has us on hold for updating the game. When I have a better timeframe, Ill
 certainly let you all know.</font>
