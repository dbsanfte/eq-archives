    Experience Loss</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I believe this is a side
    effect of the Kunark patch that made it so people wouldnt immediately start
    at level 51 (they started like one pixel away from 51, a kill or two). As it
    is now, you get stopped w/ a pixel left (to &quot;61&quot;) and cannot gain
    anymore. This is especially harsh considering that a meager 5 deaths will
    set you back to level 59 (yes, 5 deaths will take away 5 bubbles of EXP). At
    level 50 w/ a full bar (minus a pixel) you could die about 10 times. It
    would be nice to continue to get buffer XP rather than being stopped. Any
    chance of this being changed?]</i></font>
    <p>No plans along these lines. We have to stop experience gain somewhere,
    and about 100 XP points below &quot;Maxlevel + 1&quot; is a good place to do
    it. Certainly you have less of a &quot;buffer&quot; per se, but 5 deaths
    seems pretty substantial. That said, are you sure its only 5 deaths? At 60th
    level, max experience loss on death has been capped for several levels.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061345.html"><b>Rangers</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: now correct me if Im
    wrong, but wouldnt higher dmg output make it WORSE for us?]</i></font>
    <p>It depends on how we do it. In this case the plan is to enhance damage
    output from archery under certain conditions, giving rangers an incentive to
    back out of melee range for a few seconds.
    <p>If rangers can make a *big* hit from time to time at a greater delay
    rather than a *bunch* of smaller hits at a lesser delay, the desired affects
    might be obtainable.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061342.html"><b>Bugs</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: The specific instance
    may have been solved but you are wrong about them being fixed. Head out to
    Timirous Deep, and druid-style quad-kite the raptors. Within a few trials,
    when the raptors are low health (ie fleeing range) sometimes they stop, and
    then vanish. They dont vanish really so much as they teleport back to their
    spawn points and begin regaining health rapidly. (similar to when they are
    not engaged in combat, npc regen). This is the primary instance I can cite
    off hand that is easily reproduceable.]</i></font>
    <p>This might have to do with them entering the water, or getting close
    enough to it that they think theyve entered it. Pathing behaves differently
    there. Can anyone reproduce flee-warping away from water?
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Recently, due to
    abuse of mez lines and illusions, a change was made such that any time you
    cast an offensive spell in a city on a pvp server, your illusion drops(you
    _should_ know this). If you are a gnome enchanter, in oggok, and you try to
    cast mez, guess what? GANKAGE. So yes, you CAN cast mez, but in essence, you
    cant.]</i></font>
    <p>OHHHH... *thats* what you were talking about :-)
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Very simple. Equip
    your primary and off hands with stuff. Then equip something in range slot.
    Example: Bard wields 2 swords, then equips spectral bow into range slot, now
    he is holding a bow on the character model. (Granted, bow has been changed,
    but it is just an example, reproducable with any range weapon equipped.)]</i></font>
    <p>This is as intended. Its what makes the bow appear when its used. When
    you close to melee, your character doesnt actually melee with the bow like
    the message suggested. The bow should disappear and he should pull out his
    melee weapons.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Two things. On a
    philosophical note, A shark, on top of the mast of a boat, NOT a bug!?!?!?]</i></font>
    <p>A bug is something that doesnt work as designed, not something that
    doesnt work as expected, nor something that doesnt work in accordance with
    reality. With the way that pathing works, the possibility of a shark going
    for a ride on top of a boat does exist, and is not a bug. Its certainly not
    *desirable* given infinite processing power, bandwidth, and manpower, but in
    the absence of those, its acceptable.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: This is sort of a
    philosophical gripe. You are asking your players to begin the debugging
    process of your product. WE report the bugs, its YOUR job to fix them. ]</i></font>
    <p>Thanks for the note, however, bugs that we *can* reproduce will always
    have higher priority than bugs we cant. If you want to have your issue moved
    up the chain so to speak, let us know how to reproduce it. We dont assign
    people to relatively harmless (in the big picture) bugs and have them work
    full time on it until theyve found a way to reproduce it. Perhaps if we run
    out of reproducable ones we might do that.

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061352.html"><b>Stars</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Whats the point of a
    star system? Would Abashi rather read a thread started by someone with 0
    stars, or a veteran, someone with 3+ stars? Would people rather believe
    someone with 0 stars, or someone with 3 stars?]</i></font>
    <p>Actually Id rather read posts from people who are courteous, regardless
    how many posts total they have. In any case, Im not sure if this particular
    board script supports &quot;stars&quot;, or whether our implementation of
    this board script would (since we dont use UBBs security).
    <p>It might be a neat thing to do. Perhaps we can look at it after we get
    the forums shifted over to allow only current subscribers the opportunity to
    post.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060924.html"><b>QA
    Forum</b></a><br>
    Ester and Hobart have been confining their activities to the QA forum.
    Theres quite a bit of activity there which is taking most of their time.
    Please keep in mind that Ester and Hobart also have to document and in some
    cases fix the bugs that are presented there.
    <p>On one note, Id like to thank everyone whos been submitting things such
    as spelling and grammar errors in that forum. Weve another person here whos
    been working non-stop on them since the forum opened.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060798-2.html"><b>Magician
    Pets</b></a><br>
    That does sound like it might be a bit excessive to me. Having not played a
    magician into the &quot;research&quot; levels, I wasnt aware that this was a
    requirement. Of course, I do have to ask at this point, is a change in this
    area really *necessary* (again... *necessary*). Magicians have been
    succeeding since the game launched. To my knowledge, they can buy at least
    one pet every spell circle. Should there not be an additional and difficult
    requirement to get all 4 pets at every circle?
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058690-2.html"><b>Shadow
    Knight Population</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why do you think are so
    few people playing shadow knights? I am very interested in your theories.]</i></font>
    <p>Good question. I was quite surprised to only see one SK at the gathering.
    Weve several people playing them here and they are typically enjoyed by all.
    Id guess that its primarily the faction issue.
    <p>Id like to see a lot more people playing them. People frequently ask for
    a melee character that can solo, and the SK is certainly more capable of
    that than any of the others.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546-7.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br>
    Though I do completely understand and appreciate the desire for roleplayers
    to be *exclusively* around other roleplayers, its not something that is
    really quantifiable. People already have a fair number of complaints about
    the judgements made by the GM/Guide staff. I can only imagine what level
    those complaints would reach if people started being thrown off of a server
    on the basis of &quot;not roleplaying&quot;. Id personally really like the
    idea of being in a roleplay-only environment, however even I am not
    comfortable with the thought of others judging whether or not I am
    roleplaying. The suggestions of removing /ooc and other zone-wide
    communicationd does not necessarily mean that a roleplaying environment will
    be further fostered, only that communications might be more difficult
    overall.
    <p>Im sorry guys, but an enforced &quot;roleplay only&quot;
    environment&quot; is not something that we can implement fairly.</p>
