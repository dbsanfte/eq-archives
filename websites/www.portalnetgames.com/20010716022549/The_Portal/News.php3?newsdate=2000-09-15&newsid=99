    Our servers are all in basically the same location geographically (which

    Coast/West Coast/Overseas etc. While I definitely see your point, people
    playing at different times will probably always be an issue. Since the

    It depends on what IRC Network you are on. The big international ones are
    probably listed in your IRC client (such as Efnet). Some of the EQ-related
    news sites also run their own IRC servers, but youll have to go to those
    sites to get their address.<br>
    <br>
    Also, EQ channels are not necessarily specifically labeled as such. I know

    I definitely agree with this statement. The players are the ones receiving
    the support, so should be involved in the process.<br>
    <br>
    However, from your story, I really dont see anything being done wrong.
    These cases are often subjective and we have to trust the judgement of each
    GM involved. It sounds like the GMs bent over backwards to spend the hours
    you mention rectifying the situation. The actions and decision of the first
    GM were appropriate given the circumstances, and the second was most likely
    a lead who decided that it was taking too long to render good support in

<p><b>More from Brad. Response to the Lum Vs Abashi Thread (see EQ Message Boards)</b></p>
   <i>Very interesting thread.<br>
<br>
   Ive debated myself for some time as to what good these boards do... Changing
  the boards to active accounts only with poster accountability was and is an
  attempt to make them constructive and both a benefit to Verant and our
  customers.<br>
<br>
  So many positive game changes have occurred because of these boards. Also,
  because of the official posts here appearing on boards everywhere, I really
  think its a fairly efficient way to get the word out on issues.<br>
<br>
  But, then, theres the negativity. The posts that we should replace people, or
  that we never listen, or that our PR and CS is horrible, all on a board that
   weve put up and maintain. The generalizations are ludicrous (were it all true,
  of course, then there wouldnt be a board, nor an internet relations manager,
  and you wouldnt see many, many changes that originated from our customers
  implemented), but its there. Does it hurt the game? Does it hurt Verant?<br>
<br>
  I dont know. Its hard to measure.<br>
<br>
  We do know that the vast majority of players dont read the boards themselves.
  Significantly more read the headlines summarized elsewhere, but even all the
  people who read all the fan sites related to EQ dont total to that many
  relative to our subscription base. But then, most of the people who do post play
  the game a LOT, know it very well, and have excellent insight.<br>
<br>
  We also know that the game continues to sell extremely well, that relatively
  VERY few people are leaving. The interactions with people in game, the emails
  and other feedback we get, is generally very positive.<br>
<br>
  So, I dont know. I do know that if I felt they were doing more harm then good,
   Id shut them down. But its pretty hard to do an empirical analysis given how
  many variables are involved as well as many subjective aspects.<br>
<br>
  In my opinion, overall, Abashi does a good job. Sometimes he doesnt handle a
  situation optimally, and well, neither do I. Were human, after all. But his
  general policy has been to be blunt and to the point and to try NOT to spin
  things. Its confusing sometimes, reading the criticisms, because I see people
  claiming hes spinning issues, but then I see other complaints that hes not
  taking the side of the player and being positive.<br>
<br>
  Which is best? Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting? Or Im
  your friend, Ill represent your side to those developer guys and seem all
  disappointed if they dont agree with you?<br>
<br>
  If you prefer the latter, then your dissatisfaction is probably my fault,
  because I prefer the former and Im the guy who worked with Abashi in terms of
  how and what we wanted posted early on. I dont care for politicians, and people
  who pretend, and people who spin things because I guess I generally see through
  it.<br>
<br>
  Anyway, well continue to listen. Well continue to post and to communicate.
   Well continue to take good ideas and implement them if possible. And well
  continue to do our best to correct aspects of the game that could be improved.<br>
<br>
  I think, overall, that the game is better because of the boards despite the
  negativity and unrealistic expectations that continue to appear. The genre is
  relatively new, as are forums where developers are so accessible. And, as Ive
  posted before, there arent many MMORPGs so theres less choice. While I
  disagree with the assertions that we have a monopoly, I do think that there will
  be less complaining in the future due to more choice as well as the fact that
  the player base as a whole will mature in the sense that theyll understand more
  what is doable and what makes a great game.<br>
<br> 
  Until then, though, we have the responsibility to improve EQ while
  simultaneously keeping it true to what it is at its core. And well also keep
  the boards up and keep listening. But we WILL control the signal to noise ratio.
  If anything, well become more strict. Negative, pointless, flaming drives away
  players with constructive criticism (negative and positive) - of that I am
  certain. And yeah, it also makes the game and the games community look bad.<br>
<br>
  So, in closing, Id really recommend that those of you who are upset with
  aspects of the game and would like to see change to keep things constructive. If
  you dont, honestly, you become self-defeating, because were the board to
  degenerate into purely flames and insults wed shut it down, eliminating a
  fantastic avenue for you to affect the very change you want. Really, you risk
  losing your account AND losing these forums, and, knowing that youre all paying
  customers who care deeply about the game, I really dont think you want either.<br>

    seconds.]<br>
    </font><br>
    It will blink if it runs full course. However invisibility is designed to
    have a random duration, limited of course by a cap on the maximum. It is not
    supposed to be so reliable that you can avoid situations in which it wears

    It already works this way on a percentage basis. If you have 2000 mana, a
    100 mana spell is a much smaller percentage of your total mana.<br>
    <br>
    But to address the first posters question, the spell system is build upon
    spells taking mana. The exception to these are items with activatable
    effects, and the tradeoff in this case is a long casting time. Were we to
    implement things as you suggest, the casting time would have to be pretty
    long. Were left with the fact that you probably wouldnt have that spell

    I do however usually begin my day back on page 10 catching some of that was
    done in the off hours, however at around 11am, page 10 only goes back to
    about 6 or 7 am. Im working off of page 7 today, which is where I found this

    Thats an idea, of course Id rather try to encourage people to go elsewhere
    rather than frustrating them until they do :) Overall I agree with the
    intent of your suggestion if not its implementation exactly.<br>
    <br>
    A common suggestion here on the boards is, &quot;As more people enter a
    zone, more creatures shoudl spawn and more loot should be dropped&quot;.
    That suggestion is often labeled the &quot;cure for camping&quot;.
    Unfortunately, increasing the supply due to increasing demand only
    encourages more demand.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, if Oasis is crowded now with 80 people, imagine how crowded
    it would be if there was enough creatures to support however many people
    wanted to pile into the zone. As it is, we hope that someone walks into
    oasis, sees 80 people, says, &quot;man, this is crowded&quot;, and goes
    someplace else.<br>

    Were putting in an allowance for emails. @-codes should only expand when

    </font><br>
    Not plans to increase the skill, but possibly to increase its effectiveness
    at higher levels. Taunt purposely reduces in effectiveness on high level
    MOBs. At that time, all MOBs of that level were special encounters. Now that
    there is yard trash above 50th level, weve recognized the need to reevaluate
    this skill.</li>

    Away Mend from Monks&quot;</b></a><br>
    Youre asking for changes that would lead to there being no reason to play a
    warrior. Why would people want warriors if monks can tank just as well? They
    want monks because they do more damage than warriors even though they cannot
    fill the primary tank role very well.<br>
    <br>
    You also have Feign Death, which is an excellent escape ability, and also
    allows you to lower yourself on the creatures hatelist mid-combat. Warriors
    do not get anything special to help them escape.<br>

    Question</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: It also seems like I can
    summon a pet with the 39 level spell that can be weaker (hits for less
    damage) than the best pet I could summon at 34 was capable of.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    It is very possible that a pet summoned with a higher level spell can hit
    for less damage than a pet summoned with a lower level spell. Most often it
    would be the worst possible pet of the upper level spell compared to the
    best possible pet of the lower level spell.<br>
    <br>
    Remember that max damage is not the only attribute that the pet has. Pets
    have skills just like player characters. Higher level summons will have
    better skills than lower level ones, regardless of the max damage. As an
    example, the worst 39th level pet may hit for less than the best 34th level
    pet, however the 39th level summon will have better skills and do more
    damage on average.<br>
    <br>
    Theres also the matter of pet hitpoints, which is another factor in the
    strength of a pet.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014008.html"><b>Useful
    New Skill Idea</b></a><br>
    I dont think that the AC and stats for an NPC would be of much use to the
    player since they mean something very different. Overall I like the idea of
    the skill, maybe it would apply well to resistances. It would be nice to see
    where the &quot;weakness&quot; is in those resistances. Of course, if we
    were to do that, it would only be a little while before all of this was
    known with certainty and it didnt mean much.<br>
    <br>
    Hmmm, Im not sure that it would be something that would work well in EQ, but
    perhaps might be appropriate for a future product where we could design
    around it.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: May I suggest removing
    the friends lists cap of only 20. The reason is that most people including
    myself have more then 20 friends to add. Since the friends lists are saved
    locally to our computers I believe that cause a problem with Verants
    servers. Please consider this request and if possible post your thoughts.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Were still considering this. Well probably end up making the friends list
    differ on a per character/per server basis, however the 20 person limit is
    likely to remain. Lookups from the friends list are very processor and
    bandwidth intensive, leading to some non-negligible technical concerns.<br>

    </font><br>
    Theres currently over 1400 quests in game. Some are better than others, as
    things of this nature are always subjective based upon the opinions of those
    completing the quest. Some are simple, some are more difficult, some have a
    really high &quot;cool factor&quot; (Like the Lanseaux quests).<br>
    <br>
    Were always looking for ways to implement more cool quests in game and
    appreciate all of the suggestions that are made here on the boards.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014002.html"><b>Nerf
    Overused</b></a><br>
    When the term &quot;nerf&quot; was first coined, it was directed solely at
    making an existing item, skill, ability, or spell less useful in some
    fashion or another. Since then its morphed to mean &quot;anything that we
    dont like&quot;. I personally dont believe changing drops or moving things
    around constitutes a nerf, its just a normal part of the game.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/013993.html"><b>Spell

    drop-rates of level 55+ spells correct now? I ask this, because there seems
    to be a serious lack of them around.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    The Live team is going over the spell drops once again to be sure that they
    are all dropping at appropriate levels. One thing to remember is that not
    all spells drop randomly on creatures in all areas. Some spells only drop
    randomly in certain zones, while others only drop off of certain creatures.</li>
