    Most peoples idea of &quot;Proper Equipment&quot; is rare and hard to get

    </font><br>
    Theres nothing contradictory here. The twig issue has nothing to do with
    representation of popular opinion in regards to a class-complaint.
    Representation of popular opinion is a percentage-based argument, whereas representation
    of a number is a numeric argument.<br>

    I consider the *number* of people protesting the low-delay weapons change to
    be indicative of there being a *number* of them in game.<br>

    I consider the *number* of people protesting the current status of any class

    I do not consider the *percentage* of people protesting the current status
    of any class to be indicative of the *percentage* of people in game that

    health. In order to do this, considering the high resist rate and the early
    break problem, Bards had to devote ALL of their casting to doing this one
    thing and this one thing alone.<br>
    <br>
    We know that green MOBs that run run at 50% health, and that blue MOBs that
    run run at 25%. After the change, the song does not stop MOBs dead in their
    tracks until 20%. This means that, prior to the level 54 patch, Bards could
    stop ALL runners. Post the level 54 patch, Bards can stop NO runners. We
    CANT STOP TRAINS now. ]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    The change that was implemented about two months ago placed a cap on the
    maximum amount that a creature can be slowed prior to the addition of
    damage. At the time, the people making that change didnt think that it would
    affect any other spells or songs than the 54th level song. After it did, and
    due to the complaints here, we tested the song in depth, and determined that
    the way it was working before was far too powerful. The current
    functionality that you are describing is the correct functionality for the
    spell.</li>

<br>
Shortly after I got here everyone was screaming about how &quot;Brad plays a
Ranger&quot; and how they were the &quot;favored&quot; class.<br>
<br>
Im lucky if I can play my necro 4 hours in a week these days. Ive made 4 levels
in the past 9 months. Ill never see 60th level as Im not in it to level these
days. I have only one necro-specific item and it isnt even on that list
(Harvester). Ive refused to consult on most issues related to the necromancer in
house (except for nerfs, which Ive usually been the driving force behind). I
dont really plan to go after any of these items on the list, and I told the game
designer whos working on some really high end quests for all of the classes that
I wasnt interested in helping with the necromancer one.<br>
<br>
What could have been a good discussion fades into yet another thread about how
we must have some deviant plan to hurt your class or favor ours. We dont play
the game on &quot;god mode&quot;, create items out of thin air for our
characters, or run around trying to slip through enhancements for our classes.<br>

    </font>I assume you mean once per server rather than once per player. Thats
    probably not something that we would do. Wed rather that one-time quests be
    handled on a dynamic basis, with actors playing the NPCs present in most of

    Id say that very few patches do either, really. Perhaps if someone is dead

    challenge into the game.<br>

    Every day people post here on the board that the game is &quot;nothing but

    they choose to do while in game, when there is so much more there. These
    same people spend 12 hours per day in game doing what they come here and
    complain is boring. Were just trying to remove what is being cited as
    boring. Now obviously we cant please everyone in this process, for instance,
    those who wouldnt be happy unless there was absolutely no downtime of any
    kind, yet we have to try to address the issues that we can.<br>

    </font><br>
    The game should be fun. One of the ways that the game provides fun is to
    provide challenges for you to overcome. Challenges require risk to be
    meaningful. The risk in this case is the chance of failure. The penalty for
    that being death.<br>
    <br>
    If there was no death then there would be no risk which means that there
    would be no challenge and thus no fun. The FAQ explains this in more detail.<br>

    </font><br>
    A server really has to have a minimum number of people on it before it
    breaks even in terms of depreciation and operations. Certainly wed save some
    money from an operations standpoint by not having to provide GM support on a
    server of this nature, however it would have taken so long to populate the
    server that it would never have been profitable.<br>

    We might be able to get rid of more of your averagely anti-social people
    (KS, ninjalooting, etc.), however 75% of the GMs time these days is taken up
    investigating scams of one kind or another. Maybe if these slow down a
    bit...<br>
    <br>
    It might sound strange, but 90% of GM and Guide time is taken up by 10% of
    the playerbase. Its the same 10% daily. The real problem here is that when
    someone in the other 90% needs help, they are often in line behind several
    people of the 10%.<br>

    </font><br>
    That would be correct. The problem that you are mentioning has to do with
    the fact that NPCs are far more predictable than players, and data outside a
    radius around the player is based off of prediction. Data within the radius
    is updated more often, but that outside gets old.<br>

    That would dramatically increase the amount of bandwidth used. It wouldnt be

    No, as each account logging in would have to query all of the world servers.

    We do plan to implement some kind of server-specific polling mechanism,

    coin-only people might be in the majority there, there are enough people who
    want item loot across the servers that their wishes should be addressed as
    well. Item loot makes more sense on Rallos due to the reduced level-range
    for the purpose of PvP.<br>

    Im not sure how to respond to this. You shouldnt give your account info to
    other people. Yes, what someone did to you is wrong, and if we find them
    well surely take action, but it was perpetuated by you giving out your
    account info, which is &quot;expressly forbidden&quot; by the EQ EULA.<br>
    <br>
    If players reap consequences by engaging in activities that are forbidden by
    the EULA, they need to be held accountable for the consequences of those
    actions. Our GMs are too involved taking action in cases where issues are
    out of no fault of the player to compel them to &quot;hand out items&quot;

    information to anyone, and you wont have these problems.<br>

    From a database query.<br>
    <br>
    Why am I seeing so many posts along these lines? We do have ways of

    a matter of a couple on each server, we would have written them off as lucky
    and left them in game as is. But that isnt the case. There are quite a few
    of them on each server, though each poster here might only be aware of a
    few. There are roughly 8000 accounts playing on each server, half of which
    have characters capable of acquiring those items where they existed. No one
    person can say with certainty how many there are without direct access to
    our database.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006559.html"><b>Math
    and Logic</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: NO Abashi, its still
    only a 20% chance, since each spawn is independant of each other. ]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    You are indeed correct that each roll has absolutely nothing to do with the
    other. However, the percentages are based upon individual term binomial
    distribution probability. If you have a 20% chance of success (loot) per
    trial (kill), the chances of at least 1 success in 6 trials is just under
    74%. However six trials remains constant. If after the first trial you did
    not get a drop, your chances of getting one in the next 6 is still 74%. If
    after five more trials you still havent gotten one, your chance of getting
    one in the next 6 drops is still 74%.<br>
    <br>
    The probability is determined before the trails, and does not improve as the
    trials are completed (actually gets worse). For instance, lets say that we
    have the situation above. 20% of Frogs will drop the item. Lets say you
    decide that you are going to kill 6 frogs:<br>
    <br>
    Before you kill the first frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next 6 kills is: 73.79%<br>
    After you kill the first frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next 5 kills is: 67.23%<br>
    After you kill the second frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next 4 kills is: 59.04%<br>
    After you kill the third frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next 3 kills is: 48.80%<br>
    After you kill the fourth frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next 2 kills is: 36.00%<br>
    After you kill the fifth frog, your chances of getting at least one item in
    the next kill is: 20.00%<br>
    <br>
    Previous rolls are never taken into account, since they do not impact future
    results. However future results are impacted by the probability success
    versus the number of trials.<br>
    <br>
    You can set up a spreadsheet to calculate these probabilities using the
    BINOMDIST function in Excel.<br>
