    Post Locked</b></a><br>
    We have to shut down threads when they exceed 250 posts. 300 is really the
    key number but the chance of corruption of the boards goes up quite a bit
    after that. I didnt realize the thread had already doubled the usual size,
    so just caught it now.<br>
    <br>
    Theres a good chance that the thread will need to be deleted should it cause
    problems on the board. I hope not to do that, but just be aware.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065582.html"><b>A
    Radical Test</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Ok, I would like to
    propose a radical idea. Your dev team will probably hate me for suggesting
    this, but its one way to maybe get something done about all the problems
    facing players in EQ. I suggest that Abashi and some of the dev team take
    the top complaints people are having, wizards, monks, etc..., and give them
    exactly what they want.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Just to preface my answer, Im going to ask everyone to keep an open mind and
    not take offense at anything here. Most of us have played MMOGs for some
    time. Whether in the commercial setting, or in the form of MUDs, some of the
    issues we deal with are not due to any one particular person, but common
    problems that will be encountered any time someone tries to develop of a
    game of this nature.<br>
    <br>
    On to the subject at hand. This would be a radical idea. Lets assume for a
    moment that we can get those classes to agree on what they want and make the
    change. Should we decide to &quot;revert back&quot; later, how upset would
    people be then? Next, lets understand that some other classes would feel
    slighted by the changes made to these classes. Theyd then expect to get what
    they want. Then other classes that werent involved in the first two changes
    would figure that they also deserve what they want. Then wed be back to the
    first two classes that feel slighted as it is. This would continue until we
    put our foot down and said, &quot;No more&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    But we dont need to try that, because its already been done. Over the past 7
    months, tons of positive changes have been made to the classes, with very
    few negative ones. Any positive change made to one class satisfied them for
    the time until a few months down the road when all of the other changes were
    factored in. Several of the loudest complaints Im hearing now are coming
    from the same classes that had complaints that we fixed months ago. The
    feeling of, &quot;Its our turn now&quot;, keeps coming around again and
    again. Were now at the point to put our foot down as mentioned above.<br>
    <br>
    We cant afford to go making changes that we know will unbalance the game
    just for the purpose of reducing complaints, when the situation remains that
    there will always be issues that the players feel need to be addressed.
    There will always be some inequality felt by some classes, because weve
    designed the game not for equality but for balance.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065573.html"><b>Key
    Quest Broken?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why is it that the keys
    for Sebilis have both halfs of the key on 2 different mobs in the same zone
    that are always up and always drop each half, YET the keys for Charsis are
    on 2 different mobs, 2 different zones ( both green to the folks that would
    be going to charsis) and both mobs DO NOT always have the key componet ?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Concerning the critters being green, when designing dungeons, even new
    dungeons, we have to take into account the way that it fits within the
    entire game. Certainly there are a bunch of high level people who find those
    creatures green, but the person who is advancing through the game and
    encounters them while adventuring probably will get some experience off of
    them. Theyll then have these components once they reach level to enter that
    dungeon. Every time we put in something new, theres always a rush to get it.
    It takes a little while, but it balances out before long.<br>
    <br>
    Concerning the difficulty of getting the items, all I can say is that the
    quests are different. Ones easier, and the other is harder. Its based on
    whatever the quest designer had in mind at the time. I dont think that wed
    be interested in making one easier just because of the other.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065548.html"><b>Why
    dont SKs get Gate?</b></a><br>
    Gate is reserved for pure caster/priest classes. Consider &quot;Shadowstep&quot;
    as an extra ability that they garner from their parent class.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065563.html"><b>Insight</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Im just alittle curious
    when I look and see that clerics get equal AC to Paladins and ShadowKnights
    plus get complete heal on their Breastplate versus a 45 min, self only lvl
    24 necro spell, major sheilding and symbol of pinzan which requires a
    component. Im not complaining as I would surely love to have a cleric that
    can sit back and start casting CH when at half health over and over.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    In this case, the cleric item is giving them access to a spell that they
    normally have, that just costs them mana. The casting time on the item is
    sufficient to ensure that its not exactly a combat heal and doesnt replace
    the casted heal itself. Its also an extremely rare item off of a really
    tough creature. The breastplate itself doesnt really expand the definition
    of what a cleric is. They still remain a healer. I would admit that youd
    have a point had we put some type of damage spell on it.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: What is the reasoning
    behind having a set bonus applied to weapons. Should the bonus not be
    adjusted to the damage of the weapon?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    The damage bonus itself was originally put in without any regard to weapons,
    use, or damage. We later upped the per-swing damage bonus for 2H weapons.
    These weapons, the 3/10 and 4/11 and other really low delay weapons out
    there are basically broken. Were still fighting over whether or not to make
    a retroactive change to them.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065538.html"><b>Summoning
    More Pets</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why cant pet classes
    summon more than one pet at a time?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Client (polygons) and server load. A zone currently needs to support X
    people, Y pets, and Z NPCs. As long Y=X, and Z is constant, the numbers
    remain manageable under most circumstances. As soon as Y=2X or 3X, it
    quickly becomes difficult, and the server would have trouble keeping track
    of them all.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, as the number of things in the zone increases, the client then
    has to draw that many more polygons.<br>
    <br>
    Pet power was set based upon this one-pet limit. If we allowed multiple
    pets, their power would drop significantly.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065536.html"><b>Death
    Penalty</b></a><br>
    Everyone keeps quoting the worst case scenario in regards to the death
    penalty. You can reduce that substantially by getting a res. Yes, I
    understand that a res might not always be available, but assuming that you
    have friends, its probably available enough that you can mitigate the death
    penalty to a great extent. Death is supposed to be very inconveniencing and
    something that you dont want to encounter. It wouldnt be a risk if this
    werent the case.<br>
    <br>
    The experience system in game is considered frozen, meaning that no further
    changes will be made to how experience is earned, dealt out, or lost.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065512.html"><b>Runaway
    Pets</b></a><br>
    Runaway pets in dungeons (though preferrably not due to pathing problems) is
    one of the designed dangers of using pets. Owners need to be espicially
    careful that their pet doesnt run off, upset a few critters, and bring them
    back home to the group.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065524.html"><b>Please
    Define Companion (Shaman Pet Issue)</b></a><br>
    As I mentioned in the same message where I made the &quot;companion&quot;
    comment, the shamans pet is not core to the ability of the class. Basically,
    it is intentional that in the end, the SK ends up with the pet that they do,
    and shaman end up with the pet that they do.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065497.html"><b>&quot;HT,
    LoH, &amp; Posion but not Divine Aura/Barrier?&quot;</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Seems to me, if my god
    renders me invulnerable, I shouldnt be able to be stunned. I mean, I cant
    cast or attack, and no spell caster can cast on me. No mob can attack me
    either. Evac is real fun when you are invulnerable. Yet magically, my god
    doesnt have the power to keep me from being stunned. Hmmm....]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    From an in-character perspective, the idea is that just because your skin is
    impenetrable and your body is uncrushable, you can still be knocked over.
    From an out-of-character perspective, nothing is supposed to be 100%
    reliable in all cases.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065274.html"><b>Abashi
    Does Listen to Wizards</b></a><br>
    To the original poster, thanks for noticing. Its surprising how fast
    positive changes are forgotten after they are made.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065483.html"><b>Didnt
    Get Transfered...</b></a><br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064198.html"><b>Pet
    Comparison</b></a><br>
    The mage 50+ fire pet (Vocerate:Fire?) isnt a &quot;power&quot; pet, its a
    &quot;situational&quot; pet. Mages need to decide under what situations that
    pet is appropriate, much like many of your other pets. If you cannot see a
    situation in which that would be a good pet, its not mandatory that you use
    it. You have many other pets at your disposal.</li>
