<p><i>Hello everyone,</i></p>
<p><i>We are pleased to announce that tomorrow we will be implementing some major
changes here on the boards. While everyone will remain able to read all of the
forums, they will be restricted so that only active EverQuest account holders
will have the right to post. Its important that we mention that though we
respect the opinion of those who no longer play EverQuest, these forums are
provided as a service for active customers. The change will allow us to service
existing subscribers to a greater extent.</i>
<p><i>At the same time that these changes are made, we will begin strict moderation
of the boards. The flames and personal attacks that are now so common on these
boards will no longer be allowed to continue. As posters will have to log in
with their active EverQuest account info, we will have all the tools necessary
to track down and take action upon posters who choose to engage in some of the
less-than-courteous banter that takes place here. We will also be posting a FAQ
that not only explains the new rules that will be observed and enforced on the
boards, but also goes into verbose explanation of some of the issues that come
up here quite regularly (e.g. melee binding, experience requirements, etc.)</i>
<p><i>As a symbol of our renewed commitment to return the boards to a standard of
acceptability, we will be completely wiping the boards at the time of the
change.</i>
<p><i>Below is a subset of the FAQ that will be made available tomorrow regarding
the new rules on the board:</i>
<p><i>---snip---<br>
General Rules for EverQuest Forums</i>
<p><i>As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these
forums is bound by The Stations Terms of Service that can be found in their
entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a>.
In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that
apply to the EverQuest Forums.</i>
<p><i>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature
manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting.
This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers,
operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and
ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of
reading the forum.</i>
<p><i>You may not, however, post any material that:</i>
<p><i> Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but
do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster.<br>
 Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats. See above.<br>
 Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Though we do have a filter in
place to catch the unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a
license to abuse it.<br>
 Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation.<br>
 Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general
standards of decency in the United States.<br>
 Infringes on anyones privacy rights.</i>
<p><i>Furthermore, you may not:</i>
<p><i> Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting
attention paid to your issue.<br>
 Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to
another thread on a different subject.<br>
 Monopolize the front page of any forum by &quot;bumping&quot; threads of the
same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any
time that this occurs.<br>
 Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest
within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).<br>
 Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest
characters or items in exchange for real-world money.<br>
 Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest
EULA, or the Station Terms of Service.<br>
 Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other
Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products.</i>
<p><i>Actions Taken For Violation</i>
<p><i>Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on
the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It
could include any number of the following:</i>
<p><i> Editing of the post.<br>
 Deletion of the post/thread.<br>
 Closing of the thread.<br>
 Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration
of the suspension).<br>
 Banishment (results in the users station account being canceled. User will no
longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum).<br>
 Legal Action (i.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a
threat.)</i>
<p><i>People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning
before any action is taken. In the event that a warning is given, the warning
will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should
the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and
administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in
the Official EverQuest Forums.<br>
---snip---</i>
<p><i>As a note, we will begin strictly enforcing these rules as soon as the
changes are made. We would like to ask for everyones cooperation in following
and enforcing these rules at that time.</i>
<p><i>Thank you,</i>
<p><i>Gordon Wrinn<br>
</i>
</p>
He goes on with responses to several other posts:
<p><i>
Just a note on a couple of things (another repost):</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Starting tomorrow, all players must wear a yellow star on their
chest.</i>
<p><i>I wondered how long wed have to go before someone invoked Godwin.</i>
<p><i>Please do not compare something as trivial as rules here on the board to
something as substantial as the holocaust. You show disrespect to everyone who
ever new anyone who was affected by it by doing so. Things like this are a very
good example of what could cause action to be taken against accounts.</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;To facilitate hackers, your station name will now be given out
freely.</i>
<p><i>Station names will not be publicized. Though you will log in with your
station name, your chat handle will be displayed on posts that you make. There is
no security concern.</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Question, would posting further comments in debate or adding more
information to a previous post be in violation of this rule? (reading it I do not
think so, but want to make sure)</i>
<p><i>No, it applies more to people who start 20 or 30 threads on the same subject.
Basically intentional spammers.</i>
<p><i>Its important to mention that we have no problem with ideas or opinions being
posted on these boards, but do take issue with the presentation of those ideas
or opinions. If they cant be made without personally attacking someone, then
they should not be on this board. Attack the post, not the poster. For example,
&quot;This idea is moronic&quot; is not a personal attack, whereas &quot;You are
a moron&quot; is.</i>
<p><i>-Gordon<br>

Wew, good thing that fan sites like The Portal are out there so that we can here the real opinions of players.
