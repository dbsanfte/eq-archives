    1. shiverback ac? - prior to kunark, the AC on shiverback wasnt a problem,
    since once you could get it, you didnt need the AC from it. now, with the

    combat. so, more AC on shiverback, or a new planar++ armor set (like cobalt/Dw/etc..)
    would help.<br>
    2. vermiculated weight - might have been addressed, but why does a non plate
    wearing classs armor weigh more than other comparable (other planar sets,
    especially the warrior plate sets) armor sets?<br>
    3. is Verant gonna be at GenCon this year? and if so, what games are you
    guys gonna be showing? (please say sovereign).<br>
    4. novels/comics/cartoons? any word about officially sanctioned fiction
    about the world of norrath?<br>
    5. action figures? any word on what figures we should be looking for?<br>
    6. free food at VIs office? (i know bungies chicago office got free soda,
    and a free bagel day, and google.com gets catered lunches)<br>
    7. in game history? are we gonna see anymore references in game to
    norrathian history (like having quests use history books as components?)<br>
    8. out of game history/events? will we ever see GM event summaries on the

    up with the storyline?<br>

    We consistantly work to improve these issues, however the level to which

    zones. Well continue making changes until we come up with the best possible

    </font><br>
    We wouldnt implement a zone-wide chat channel that goes to more than one
    zone at a time due to both bandwidth and spam potential.<br>
    <br>
    A &quot;looking for group&quot; or other flag is a possibility. I just spoke
    to one of the programmers about it and it doesnt appear to have any
    technical concerns on first glance. Possible issues include /anon and /roleplay.
    Neither would show up on any filtered list, while an unfiltered list (/who
    all group) would probably return far more than 20 results. If you think that
    it would help people hook up more swiftly in game, we can see about putting
    it in. Of course it goes without saying that the flag would be turned off
    automatically once you join a group.<br>

    flash in the place of my now-cancelled wolf form for just a split second.<br>
    <br>
    When I scrolled up I noticed that the &quot;Your enveloping root spell has
    worn off&quot; was actually above the &quot;your feet have become
    entwined&quot; message, right after that message was &quot;the roots fall
    from your feet.&quot; This is the same symptom you said that indicated the
    damage was causing the root to break.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    I imagine that the messages just got a little mixed up due to the fact that
    you cast it upon yourself. Dynamics regarding the way spells work and wear
    off change a little when you are the target of your own spell versus someone
    elses.<br>
    <br>
    All of the &quot;root+damage&quot; spells work correctly. You might want to
    go in and check it out a bit more using NPCs as targets.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Why Do Paladins Get One
    Class Weapon In Kunark While Other Hybrids Get 9 for 50+]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    I think that you have some valid points, however the idea when Kunark items
    were being created, there was actually a shortage of weapons for the other
    two classes to my knowledge, and thats what was addressed. You do make a
    good point about the WAR/PAL 1H weapons being designed with dual wield in
    mind.<br>
    <br>
    That said, it is possible that things swung too far in the other direction.
    Ill bring the issue up with the designers.<br>
    <br>

    Weight?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Why does Vermiculated,
    the planar, chain based armor for druids (a class that CANNOT be large
    races, btw), weigh almost 10 stones MORE than every set of planar plate?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Ive spoken at length with the design team about some various item-issues
    that appear to be out of whack at first glance. The druid planar armor was
    among them. My understanding is that the weight is intentional in order to
    provide downsides for wearing the armor. Melee characters arent typically
    penalized for wearing armor as it is needed by them to perform their duties,
    whereas with casters, it is a luxury.<br>
    That luxury has some downsides in this case.<br>

    safe spot. AT the minium players should have 5 minutes to log out. 10 - 15
    being a more appropriate time]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    There is supposed to be at least a 5 minute warning in all cases of an
    intentional server downing. Of course, it is possible that some of the
    notifications are missed due to zoning or fighting. at the time that the
    warning messages are sent. Others might log in after a message and feel that
    they werent given a warning. I myself have sat on a server and watched
    warnings be issued every minute for 5 minutes, only to go into the
    chat-server and hear from people who didnt see the warning.<br>
    <br>
    That said, if its apparent that at least 5 minutes warning isnt given in the
    case of an outage, please let us know what server the problem occurred on so
    that we can take steps to ensure that proper warning is given in the future.<br>

    </font><br>
    Casting takes a certain amount of concentration, which is why casters get
    interrupted while being hit. Of course thats an RP reason. From a game
    design perspective, nothing hits while in a casting delay, not even NPCs.
    Though I like the idea, this is a core mechanic of EverQuest, and isnt
    really likely to change.<br>

    </font><br>
    Weve spoken about the mysticism before, and in regards to your argument, we
    actually publicize far more numbers in game than we originally would have
    liked. The fact that we did publicize those additional numbers doesnt
    necessarily mean that we should publicize the next thing that seems
    &quot;logical&quot; given that argument. At some point we either have to
    stop releasing more numbers, or just release them all. Though there are
    certainly people who would like to see numbers on everything, were of the
    mind that the game shouldnt be reduced to pure mathematics in the eyes of
    the players.<br>

    Gthen,<br>
    When GZ was designing the spell layouts, he made a list of all of the spells
    that he wanted to implement, and then set it up so that a certain number of
    spells were implemented in a given level. Though it may appear to make sense
    for a particular spell to be given a few levels earlier or later, it would
    upset the way that the spells are allocated.<br>
    <br>
    We actually made a mistake at one point, giving group resolution after group
    heroism. Im not sure how that happened, but rather than shift the spells
    back to where they should be, were actually going to replace one of the
    spells. Im mentioning this to illustrate how important it is that we provide
    spells at the level which they are provided.<br>

    We are giving that suggestion some serious consideration now. Though it is
    unlikely that we would completely remove the casting delay should we decide
    to do this, we would probably reduce it significantly.<br>

    constitues proof to the GM?</b></a><br>
    Most bugs that would result in a resurrection leave some sort of signature
    that would allow the GM or Guide to verify the incident and make the correct
    decision. For instance, falling for 10K damage leaves a line of text that
    can be /reported in order to provide &quot;proof&quot;.<br>
    The particular incident that you are mentioning however is not a bug.
    Centaurs by their nature are ornery critters, and have a very small percent
    chance of just going wild on someone. Of course this can be very
    inconvenient when there are other centaurs around, as their anger is
    contagious.<br>
    <br>
    I think that one of the reasons people think that this is a bug is that this
    NPC personality trait isnt widely used in game.<br>

    anyone noticed, but unlike the patch msg announced, people who are in /roleplay
    do NOT show up on /who GUILD all. I dont want to sound offensive, but maybe
    you guys should double or triple check patch content to make sure everything
    is there?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Yeah, you have a point I sincerely apologize for announcing a patch change
    that didnt take place. As it turns out, one file necessary for the /who all
    &quot;guild&quot; to work on /roleplayers wasnt included in the patch
    package. It will be in the next one.<br>
