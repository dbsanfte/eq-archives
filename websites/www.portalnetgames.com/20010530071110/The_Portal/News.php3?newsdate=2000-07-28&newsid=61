    Math</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Seriously though. Youre
    correct. In PnP games, hybrid math works something like 1 + 1 = 1.5, but
    here they seem to twist math in ways that physicists must dream about.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    PnP games however consist of a few friends sitting around a table, none of
    whom have to worry about getting left behind or chosen over another based
    upon the power of their class. To compare MMOGs directly to PnP games, it
    would be like 30 friends sitting in a room, all wanting to play, with only a
    few of the most powerful being allowed.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: How is it that you can
    combine a warrior who is great at taking damage and a druid who is good at
    dealing dmg and buffing and come out with a ranger. Every hybrid is the same
    way.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    If a ranger had all the skills and abilities of both warriors and druids,
    who would ever select a warrior or a druid for the group? The same situation
    would be present for the other hybrids. 1+1 cannot equal 2 in this case. The
    goal however is to make .25 + .75=1, and weve done a fairly good job of
    that.<br>
    <br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065626.html"><b>Beating
    the Game</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: See, there *is* a way to
    beat this game. Ita either to a)Reach level 60]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Considering that there were tons of people at 50th level when that was the
    cap, and the fact that they didnt quite once reaching 50th, thats pretty
    strong evidence that it doesnt constitue &quot;beating&quot; the game.
    Theres not that many level 60s yet, but even when there is I dont think that
    that will be a large quit-point either. People quit when they decide they
    are done with the game, regardless what level they happen to be at.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Believe it or not, we DO
    NOT LIKE PUTTING 1000 hrs into a character! ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Perhaps you may not enjoy it, but theres everything to suggest that a *lot*
    of people *do* enjoy long-term character development. The simplest evidence
    is the fact that many people do put thousands of hours into their
    characters. I know dozens of people with well over 100 days played. Theres
    even more, by several orders of magnitude, with over 50 days played. I have
    nearly 1000 hours of playtime on my character and have enjoyed them to a
    great extent.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: But with 14 classes I
    think you would get plenty, if not more replay value(subscription renewals
    in Verantese) and alot more satisfied customers if you cut down the exp
    requirements significantly. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    We dont expect people to be able to max out characters in all 14 classes.
    Thats the thing about massively multiplayer games - they have to have more
    content than anyone can ever expect to consume. If you reach a point in the
    game where people have consumed all of that content, then yes, theyve beaten
    the game.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065620.html"><b>Mesmerize
    Line for Clerics?</b></a><br>
    A mesmerize line wouldnt be appropriate for clerics. Clerics are already
    considered immensly useful to the group, and are likewise appropriatly
    balanced.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065514-2.html"><b>Cleric
    Suggestion Response</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: The problem at high
    levels (51+) is that we cant get groups if youre a hybrid or generalist or
    we have to wait for the cleric and enchanter to log on before we can do
    anything.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    People will and do make due with what they have in the absense of the
    &quot;perfect&quot; arrangement. Farming out existing class-specific skills
    to other classes thus reducing the use of the original classes is not really
    a viable solution. Players need to learn to adapt to the situation and
    overcome the obstacles with the resources at hand.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065533.html"><b>Future
    Events</b></a><br>
    Were actually going to have some new events that are going to start in the
    near future. Events will be held on each server to determine the best of a
    particular class, and all of the winners will be transferred to Test to
    compete there. It should be pretty interesting to see who the best players
    out there are :)<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href><b>Response to a Suggestion</b></a><br>
    Container code, particularly when dealing with nested containers, is very
    touchy business. Each additional level of nesting provides additional
    problems that need to be addressed. The way containers are handled now is
    part of the core foundation of EverQuest, so its highly unlikely that it
    will be expanded to allow nesting.<br>

    Meeting Aftermath</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:Abashi. I recon the

    just wasted our time getting this Weapons.]</i></font><br>

    We still havent decided completely whether a retroactive change is
    appropriate in this case. We have however decided that these items will no
    longer drop in their current form. More changes are not necessarily
    improbable. We do however try to avoid changing existing items whenever
    possible, so we need to put more serious thought into the issue.</li>
