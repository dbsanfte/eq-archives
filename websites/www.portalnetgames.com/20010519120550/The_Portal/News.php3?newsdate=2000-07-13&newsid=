    Experience Loss</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I believe this is a side
    effect of the Kunark patch that made it so people wouldnt immediately start
    at level 51 (they started like one pixel away from 51, a kill or two). As it
    is now, you get stopped w/ a pixel left (to &quot;61&quot;) and cannot gain
    anymore. This is especially harsh considering that a meager 5 deaths will
    set you back to level 59 (yes, 5 deaths will take away 5 bubbles of EXP). At
    level 50 w/ a full bar (minus a pixel) you could die about 10 times. It
    would be nice to continue to get buffer XP rather than being stopped. Any
    chance of this being changed?]</i></font>
    <p>No plans along these lines. We have to stop experience gain somewhere,
    and about 100 XP points below &quot;Maxlevel + 1&quot; is a good place to do
    it. Certainly you have less of a &quot;buffer&quot; per se, but 5 deaths
    seems pretty substantial. That said, are you sure its only 5 deaths? At 60th
    level, max experience loss on death has been capped for several levels.

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: now correct me if Im
    wrong, but wouldnt higher dmg output make it WORSE for us?]</i></font>
    <p>It depends on how we do it. In this case the plan is to enhance damage
    output from archery under certain conditions, giving rangers an incentive to
    back out of melee range for a few seconds.
    <p>If rangers can make a *big* hit from time to time at a greater delay
    rather than a *bunch* of smaller hits at a lesser delay, the desired affects
    might be obtainable.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061342.html"><b>Bugs</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: The specific instance
    may have been solved but you are wrong about them being fixed. Head out to
    Timirous Deep, and druid-style quad-kite the raptors. Within a few trials,
    when the raptors are low health (ie fleeing range) sometimes they stop, and
    then vanish. They dont vanish really so much as they teleport back to their
    spawn points and begin regaining health rapidly. (similar to when they are
    not engaged in combat, npc regen). This is the primary instance I can cite
    off hand that is easily reproduceable.]</i></font>
    <p>This might have to do with them entering the water, or getting close
    enough to it that they think theyve entered it. Pathing behaves differently
    there. Can anyone reproduce flee-warping away from water?
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Recently, due to
    abuse of mez lines and illusions, a change was made such that any time you
    cast an offensive spell in a city on a pvp server, your illusion drops(you
    _should_ know this). If you are a gnome enchanter, in oggok, and you try to
    cast mez, guess what? GANKAGE. So yes, you CAN cast mez, but in essence, you
    cant.]</i></font>
    <p>OHHHH... *thats* what you were talking about :-)
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Very simple. Equip
    your primary and off hands with stuff. Then equip something in range slot.
    Example: Bard wields 2 swords, then equips spectral bow into range slot, now
    he is holding a bow on the character model. (Granted, bow has been changed,
    but it is just an example, reproducable with any range weapon equipped.)]</i></font>
    <p>This is as intended. Its what makes the bow appear when its used. When
    you close to melee, your character doesnt actually melee with the bow like
    the message suggested. The bow should disappear and he should pull out his
    melee weapons.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Two things. On a
    philosophical note, A shark, on top of the mast of a boat, NOT a bug!?!?!?]</i></font>
    <p>A bug is something that doesnt work as designed, not something that
    doesnt work as expected, nor something that doesnt work in accordance with
    reality. With the way that pathing works, the possibility of a shark going
    for a ride on top of a boat does exist, and is not a bug. Its certainly not
    *desirable* given infinite processing power, bandwidth, and manpower, but in
    the absence of those, its acceptable.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: This is sort of a
    philosophical gripe. You are asking your players to begin the debugging
    process of your product. WE report the bugs, its YOUR job to fix them. ]</i></font>
    <p>Thanks for the note, however, bugs that we *can* reproduce will always
    have higher priority than bugs we cant. If you want to have your issue moved
    up the chain so to speak, let us know how to reproduce it. We dont assign
    people to relatively harmless (in the big picture) bugs and have them work
    full time on it until theyve found a way to reproduce it. Perhaps if we run
    out of reproducable ones we might do that.

    <p>Actually Id rather read posts from people who are courteous, regardless
    how many posts total they have. In any case, Im not sure if this particular
    board script supports &quot;stars&quot;, or whether our implementation of
    this board script would (since we dont use UBBs security).
    <p>It might be a neat thing to do. Perhaps we can look at it after we get

    Ester and Hobart have been confining their activities to the QA forum.
    Theres quite a bit of activity there which is taking most of their time.
    Please keep in mind that Ester and Hobart also have to document and in some
    cases fix the bugs that are presented there.
    <p>On one note, Id like to thank everyone whos been submitting things such
    as spelling and grammar errors in that forum. Weve another person here whos
    been working non-stop on them since the forum opened.

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/060798-2.html"><b>Magician
    Pets</b></a><br>
    That does sound like it might be a bit excessive to me. Having not played a
    magician into the &quot;research&quot; levels, I wasnt aware that this was a
    requirement. Of course, I do have to ask at this point, is a change in this
    area really *necessary* (again... *necessary*). Magicians have been
    succeeding since the game launched. To my knowledge, they can buy at least
    one pet every spell circle. Should there not be an additional and difficult
    requirement to get all 4 pets at every circle?
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/058690-2.html"><b>Shadow

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why do you think are so
    few people playing shadow knights? I am very interested in your theories.]</i></font>
    <p>Good question. I was quite surprised to only see one SK at the gathering.
    Weve several people playing them here and they are typically enjoyed by all.
    Id guess that its primarily the faction issue.
    <p>Id like to see a lot more people playing them. People frequently ask for
    a melee character that can solo, and the SK is certainly more capable of
    that than any of the others.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546-7.html"><b>Roleplaying</b></a><br>
    Though I do completely understand and appreciate the desire for roleplayers
    to be *exclusively* around other roleplayers, its not something that is
    really quantifiable. People already have a fair number of complaints about
    the judgements made by the GM/Guide staff. I can only imagine what level
    those complaints would reach if people started being thrown off of a server
    on the basis of &quot;not roleplaying&quot;. Id personally really like the
    idea of being in a roleplay-only environment, however even I am not
    comfortable with the thought of others judging whether or not I am
    roleplaying. The suggestions of removing /ooc and other zone-wide
    communicationd does not necessarily mean that a roleplaying environment will
    be further fostered, only that communications might be more difficult
    overall.
    <p>Im sorry guys, but an enforced &quot;roleplay only&quot;
    environment&quot; is not something that we can implement fairly.</p>

this afternoon:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061327.html"><b>Shaman
    &amp; Foraging</b></a><br>
    Sometimes we have to limit what races or classes can do for the purpose of
    creating interdependance. For instance, theres no *real world* reason why
    even a wizard shouldnt be able to pick up a sword and use it, yet we dont
    allow them to wield them in game.
    <p>There are many skills in game for which there is &quot;no reason&quot;
    why some other race or class cannot use them other than for gameplay
    reasons.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061315.html"><b>Mage
    Pet Gating</b></a><br>
    Its only one pet that gates, the mage 50+ fire pet which is actually a
    wizard. It probably shouldnt gate. Ive asked the programmer to take a look
    at this.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061257.html"><b>Quests</b></a><br>
    There are many different types of quests in game. I am sure that some, in
    the &quot;average players&quot; opinion require &quot;hours of
    camping&quot;, however others do not. One can choose whether or not they
    wish to take on those quests. Quests, like many other facets of the game,
    cannot be designed in a fashion such that every quests is suitable to every
    persons particular situation. Some will be completable by people with only a
    few hours at a time to invest, others will require more time.
    <p>Well continue putting quests of all types in regularly.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061105.html"><b>Aggro
    Range Higher While Sitting/Looting</b></a><br>
    Ive always felt that it was a nice touch. Creature &quot;x&quot; is too
    afraid of you to risk a conflict while you are alert, however decides that
    he might take a poke at you if you turn your back.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061104.html"><b>Sneak

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I dont think that this
    is fair. If you guys dont want rogues to be invisble to everything, atleast
    make it so we are able to tell what is really scowling.]</i></font>
    <p>Only creatures that have faction that determine what they will and will
    not attack give messages in /con indicating if they do or do not see you.
    Some things in the game will attack anyone, regardless of faction, and these
    things are always &quot;scowling&quot;. If you check hill giants while invis
    youll see the same issue. Its working as designed.

    again that I would like to see some high level quest armors for
    Iksar(warriors and shadow knight especially) put into EQ. It is called

    quest for, he cant wear Umbral, heck he cant even wear darkforge.]</i></font>
    <p>Weve spoken about this issue internally and agree that it is something
    that we need to work on in the near future. Ill be sure to let everyone know
    when we have some firm plans.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061052.html"><b>Meditation</b></a><br>
    Originally the idea was, from a roleplay perspective, that meditiation
    should take some concentration, which is why the spell book covered the
    screen to begin with. You werent even able to talk while medding in the
    beginning. Later, we decided to remove the requirement to look at the
    spellbook upon reaching level 35.
    <p>As it is now, the plans are for it to remain an advantage of reaching the
    higher levels.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059252.html"><b>GM
    &quot;Test of ____&quot; Events</b></a><br>
    The &quot;Tests&quot; are being revamped due to information garnered in the
    previous tests on various servers. Soon, there will be seperate
    &quot;Tests&quot; for each class. In addition, the entry fee will probably
    be lowered in most cases. Well release further information when we are able.

    <p>We disagree that there is any problem with the stregth of the pets. They
    are absolutely as strong as we want any pets to be.
    <p>As for DD spells, the magician class is appropriately balanced. Doing
    anything additional for the class would overpower them. Concerning summons,
    theres really nothing else that we could have summoned that wouldnt step on
    the toes of another class, thus reducing class interdependance.</p>

    Welcome to the Bug Board. Please let me introduce you to the procedures and
    rules we have here. This board is tightly moderated. This means that no
    ranting, foul language or personal attacks will be tolerated under any
    circumstances. The purpose for this board is for you to give us information
    about bugs in the game, and for us to give you feedback on those bugs.
    <p>I want to make this very clear in the beginning. Any posts that are
    inappropriate will be deleted. If you want to complain there are other
    forums to do so, this is not the place. We are only interested in bugs.
    <p>First let me define what a bug is. A bug is an error in the intended
    workings of the game. It is a quest not working, an NPC not spawning, it is
    a misspelling of something an NPC says, or some other mechanical feature
    such as an item being for a gnome monk.
    <p>Next, let’s define what is not a bug. Class balance is not a bug. A
    long spawn time is not a bug. A quest not giving adequate award is not a
    bug. These are issues that certainly should be addressed, just not on this
    board.
    <p>Hobart and I will be the ones who you will hear from most often, though
    occasionally other blue names will also post. If you do not hear from us for
    a few days, it is because we’re working on the game. Unlike Abashi,
    posting is not our primary job, so please be patient.
    <p>Our goal with this board is to provide communication back to the players
    about bugs and their current status. We welcome discussion of and questions
    about bugs as long as it is constructive. We also ask that before posting a
    bug, please read through the bugs already posted to limit duplicates as
    duplicates will be deleted. You are more than welcome to add input to an
    existing thread.
    <p>When posting, in the subject please give a brief summary of the bug to
    make it easier for us to review them. Also, please give as much detail as
    possible including your server name, the location (/loc) any npc’s
    involved and quest triggers. We will ask for more information if what you
    have provided is not enough.
    <p>Finally, if the issue that you are posting about contains information
    that would be considered a large spoiler, or have great exploit potential,
    please forward the complete description via email to eqtesting@verant.com.
    Feel free to post a more general, non-spoiler/exploit, version of the bug
    here should you require some general feedback on it’s progress.
    <p>We looking forward to working with you to identify these problems so we
    can make Norrath a more enjoyable place.

    EsterTheTester</b></a><br>
    Let me do a personal introduction. I was GM Camii of Povar and Innoruuk, and
    I now work in the Testing department at Verant. I do attend the Monday
    Meetings and I work closely with the EQLive team in identifying and
    communicating to them the bugs we have in the game. I also work with the
    Guide program with their bug reports.
    <p>I have a strange sence of humor, but I do take these bugs seriously. I
    also tend to not have the worlds greatest spelling skills, but I promise to
    proofread every post. =)
    <p>I look forward to posting and identifying bugs in Norrath through this
    board.

    <p>Youre not going to like this reply. Because of the way things work (and

    <p>Ok, I have a few suggestions. These are not guarenteed to fix the
    problem, but they seem to help. Try underclocking your viedo card. We find
    that the extra heat generated by the card working harder in Kunark is
    causing some systems to crash.If that doesnt work, tech support is your best
    bet, my experience at technical things is sorely limited.

    <p>There are two types of Legionnaire Shoulderpads. Unfortunately there is
    not space on the item to tell you which pad it is. One set comes from
    Crushbone, the other from around Freeport. The best way to ensure that you

    <p>Ok here is my favorite answer ... I have absolutely no idea if there are

    <p>Sound is a very high priority. One of our programmers spends most of his

  doubt the new island of Kunark, which features 20 some new zones for players
  of every level. Ranging from a deadly swamp to an abandoned Iksar city the new
  zones certainly do offer players a veritable feast of new activities. The
  Kunark zones also completely dwarf the old ones in size, offering a myriad of
  activities within each zone. Many zones feature several sub zones, such as
  caves that take you to small monster forts, small monster temples, one zone
  even features an entire city full of the dreaded frogloks.</font>
