<p>I thought Id bring a quick list of some things decided in todays tuning
meeting. There is not much information here besides what I will list, but please
feel free to comment:
<p>* Concerning Nagafen and Vox: We are looking into a way to keep Nagafen and
Vox as reasonable encounters for the high-30s-50s characters without having the
high 50s+ killing them constantly with little opposition.<br>
* We will be extending the &quot;Rez-for-XP&quot; window from 2 hours to 3 hours
in light of size and difficulty of some of the new zones.<br>
* VZ/TZ move: See other thread.<br>
* We are looking at a way to stop players from bypassing the need for a rogue by
using an NPC to open pickable doors. In other words, make friends with your
local rogue <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15"><br>
* Poison update is expected on Test next week.<br>
* &quot;Jolt&quot; will have its casting time lowered.<br>
* The Hole is expected to go live this week.

<p>Due to the results of the /movelog command executed by players on the PvP-Teams
servers the weekend before last, we are reconsidering our decision to do the
move. Out of nearly 1800 accounts across TZ and VZ that requested move, only 278
asked to be moved from TZ (Coin only) to VZ (Coin and Item loot), while 1513
requested a move in the other direction.
<p>The result of completing this move would most likely result in crowding on
the Tallon Zek server while leaving Vallon Zek nearly empty. While we have
considered allowing a smaller number of people to move from Vallon to Tallon,
we have concluded that that would most likely be more destructive to server morale
than our current plan.
<p>As of now, and for the reasons stated above, our plan is to change the Vallon
Zek server to Coin-only loot making it identical to Tallon Zek in that respect.
<p>We will wait a few days to view comments here prior to finalizing the decision.
Please followup here with your thoughts.
<p>-Gordon<br>

    not just the city where you started. You can rest there without being
    attacked, store food and supplies. Why not other games have it?]</i><br>
    <br>
    Though we considered the idea in EQ, we ended up waiving it in favor of
    spending more time on the adventure aspects of the game. Overall I think it
    was a good choice given our goals and timing constraints.<br>

    <i>[Quote from original post: I am kinda getting bored with my character. Is
    it against the rules to trade accounts with another player? Now before you
    say no as fast as you can, think about it. You are only trading an in game
    commodity for another in game commodity, that being characters. Almost like
    trading all of your gear for all of someone elses gear, and trading all of
    your class A exp for all of their class B exp.<br>
    <br>
    Yes, this is also against the rules. Though I appreciate your arguments,
    trading a sword for another sword in game (perfectly acceptable) is not the
    same as trading characters or accounts. Transfer of accounts has always been
    prohibited.<br>
    <br>
    Its not just the philosophical ideals concerning gameplay, but the amount of
    fraud that results in such transactions. Even with our policies as they are,
    completely forbidding character sales and account transfers, we still
    receive a number of emails daily citing fraud in relation to account
    transfers.]</i><br>

    Armor</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Id like to know why the cleric arms from the
    Ostiary in the library in Sebilis were nerfed, without any warning. These
    arms had the effect of Valor, which could be cast every 6 seconds. After the
    patch last week, they now take twice as long to cast, which in essence has
    rendered them useless, since Remedy and Superior Heal can be cast much
    faster with great hp return, even tho they cost mana and the arms do not.
    These were one of the nicest cleric pieces in the game, and like everything
    else that proves useful to a class, wound up getting nerfed and made useless
    without warning or explanation.]</i><br>
    <br>
    First, I apologize for the fact that this wasnt listed in the patch message.<br>
    <br>
    As for why they were changed, as you mentioned, use of the arms for the
    purpose of healing rather than for the &quot;buff&quot; that it gave was the
    primary motivation. The fact that that whole series increases current
    hitpoints in addition to max hitpoints was based on it being balanced by
    mana usage. Since the arms do not use mana, the casting-time becomes the
    entire cost. A cost of six seconds was too low for what it granted.<br>

    Weve had to back-burner (postpone indefinitely) any plans to due this due to
    some technical issues. If we take it up actively again in the future Ill be
    sure to let everyone know.<br>

    <i>[Quote from original post: I know this is cluching at straws, but any

    <br>
    Weve no plans at this time to develop or release additional platform ports
    of the EverQuest client.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Also, what system was EQ developed on? If you
    can reply to that one without revealing too much...]</i><br>
    <br>
    We use different tools for many different aspects of EQ. Outdoor geometry,
    indoor geometry, object building, character building, texture art, etc., all
    take place in different software packages. As for actual programming, its
    done primarily in a combination of C and C++.<br>
    <br>
    As for what particular hardware platform is used for each thing, it varies
    between WinTel stuff, various Unix platforms, and the like.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053625.html"><b>The
    Simple Truth</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: The more time spent regaining levels and
    leveling itself, the more months you spend on the game, and the more money
    Verant gets.]</i><br>
    <br>
    Actually we prefer to look at it from the standpoint that the longer we can
    keep you entertained, challenged, and intrigued, the longer youll play the
    game. We believe that things earned are cherished more than things given,
    which is why some work is necessary in order to advance.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Now for some, the fact that Verant MAKES you
    spend more months and months to &quot;win&quot;(achieving level 60) in this
    game and getting more money from its accounts may bother alot of people.]</i><br>
    <br>
    There is no way to &quot;win&quot; in EverQuest. Though some might hold
    &quot;level 60&quot; as the main goal they wish to reach, research shows
    that people dont &quot;reach 60 and quit&quot;, or previously, &quot;reach
    50 and quit&quot; like posts of this nature purport. We dont
    &quot;make&quot; you spend time to do anything. You choose a goal that you
    want to acheive and make the decision to do whatever is necessary to achieve
    it.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: The simple truth is, exp loss will not
    change...]</i><br>
    <br>
    Very true, but as mentioned above, its not some devious thing to
    &quot;make&quot; you play longer. Its a risk that is present in order to
    provide challenge, making it difficult to obtain goals, which a big part of
    the reason that people play the game.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053623.html"><b>Caster
    Loot</b></a><br>
    I guess that one of the situations is that things that are considered
    &quot;good&quot; caster loot arent very diverse. Int casters want int, and
    thats it. Wis casters want wis, and thats it. Now, since the int/wis
    softcaps werent changed in regards to Kunark, a lot of people are running
    around right up against 200 points. Theres only so much more that can be
    done with them.<br>
    <br>
    Melee characters on the other hand need weapons, AC, and every other stat
    they can get. As a caster, I really dont care about AC items that I can get,
    since if I get hit Im dead anyway.<br>
    <br>
    Basically, one of the cool things about being a melee class is that more
    options are open to you in regards to equipment. I think that casters will
    always be at a disadvantage in this area.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053584.html"><b>The
    Hole</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Has anyone taken a look at the items that will
    be coming from the hole to prevent more post-release item nerfs? You know
    what Im talking about. Robe of Living Fungus, Wind Saber, Rod of Mourning,
    Vambraces of Mourning, Manastone, Mistwalker, etc..]</i><br>
    <br>
    Sure, weve looked at the items, but as always I cannot guarantee that
    post-release adjustments wont be necessary. As always, 250k+ people can find
    more issues than any test team could. I certainly wish this wasnt the case,
    but the only way we could eliminate the need for any post-production changes
    with certainty would be to stop any post-production enhancements to the
    game. I doubt anyone would like that option either.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053549.html"><b>Unreliable
    Binds</b></a><br>
    Ive heard reports about this from time to time. To my knowledge, our testing
    team hasnt been able to find a reliable way to reproduce this. It would be
    nice to hear if anyone has a way to help us track this issue down.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053580.html"><b>Disappearing
    Boats</b></a><br>
    Were working on the problem with the disappearing boats. In the meantime,
    feel free to petition a GM should they appear inoperational. I do apologize
    for the delay in addressing this issue.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/053544.html"><b>Trolls
    and Centaurs</b></a><br>
    Centaurs are ornery and irrational creatures. It seems that they are prone
    to fits of rage for little to no reason, and have been known at times to
    attack nearly anyone. We think that it has something to do with tension in
    the area created by the number of people encroaching on their hunting
    grounds.<br>
    <br>
    As for your LD and where your corpse went, LDs will happen from time to time
    in internet based games for a number of reasons. As we dont have control
    over the majority of individual LDs, we dont do resurrections for most of
    them. Corpses have also been known to end up strange places when dying while
    LD. If it ends up someplace inaccessible (like on top of a mountain that a
    player cannot climb), the GMs will be happy to move it.<br>

    <br>
    Id really like to help solve the problem, however as we dont have a whole
    lot of people having crashing problems, it suggests a driver or
    hardware-specific issue. We are continuing to work on the sound-related
    issues, and will probably have a new patch up in that regard in the next
    couple of weeks.<br>

    <br>
    That said, just looking at some of the other things that have been released,
    it appears that there might be (stress *might*) some disparity between SK
    and Paly weapons in Kunark. Of course, that doesnt necessarily mean that
    there is a problem. If you recall, SKs were quite vocal about the lack of 1H
    weapons in game for them prior to Kunark.<br>
    <br>
    Ill mention this thread to the guys, but just to be clear, Im not promising
    anything, and usually wont give periodic updates on item-related issues.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044612-8.html"><b>Rain
    Spells</b></a><br>
    Ive read the original authors post, and from what I see its pretty accurate.
    Rain spells consider all targets in their field, whether or not those
    targets can actually be damaged. This is the way that the rain spells work.
    Now if this makes them completely &quot;useless&quot; in all cases, perhaps
    we need to look at them again, but at the moment they are working as
    designed.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052923.html"><b>Spellbook
    Follow-up</b></a><br>
    The spellbook obscuring the view is part of the &quot;penalty&quot; that
    lower-level casters pay in exchange for the power that they will receive
    later in life. From an RP perspective, the caster was so focused on
    meditating that they perceived little about what was happening in the world
    around them. Back in early beta we didnt even allow casters to speak while
    medding.<br>
