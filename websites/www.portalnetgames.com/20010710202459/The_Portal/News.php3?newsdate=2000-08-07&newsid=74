    </font><br>
    No, the spell hasnt changed. The spoiler sites that parse the spdat.eff just
    dont get the full picture from that file.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/001935.html"><b>Abashi
    - FD has changed on test</b></a><br>
    I havent seen a first-hand accounting of any change to feign death on test
    at this point. Every post has been from someone who knows someone on test
    who plays a monk, or by someone on test who knows someone who plays a monk.<br>
    <br>
    No intentional change has been made, and I havent see anything to indicate
    that any unintentional change was made. I took a look at it myself, and it
    appears that its operating the same as it has for months.<br>

    Cleric. When I was fighting DW Crocs they both would get hit for 40 points
    of damage. Why is that? If a Shadow Knight has higher ac then why does he
    take the same amout of damage? I have seen this with other classes as well.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Over time, youll find that the highly armored SK will take less damage per
    hit on average than your lightly armored mage.<br>

    Ok, so you got a bad roll on loot when killing one creature.

    maybe 25 30 names? Sound familar yeah its the way all /who all anyhting

    thats fine, but how can you say it cant be done? Thank you, Iuvian.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Indeed the GMs have the ability, it just cant be given to the public for
    technical reasons. Bandwidth is only a part of it, the other part being
    server load. There is a relatively small number of people who currently have
    the ability, its just not scalable to the potential of having 60K+ people at
    peak doing it.<br>

    To make stacks over 20 arrows you would use a special four slot quiver with
    a combine button that would take the 20 SAME TYPE arrows in each stack and
    combine them into a mega stack that would go in the ammo slot.<br>
    </font><font color="#072876"><br>
    The arrows would take on a quiver graphic and be placed in the ammo slot and
    have the larger number in the corner.<br>
    <br>
    Make this special quiver cost 10 times the normal quiver because it can
    reduce the number of slots needed to carry arrows.]</font></i><br>
    <br>
    Its a good idea, unfortunately, stacks cannot exceed 20 given game
    architecture, and containers cant be worn in the main inventory slots.<br>

    Because then people would &quot;pull the plug&quot; to avoid death.<br>

    </font><br>
    There isnt a way to determine the difference between someone &quot;pulling
    the plug&quot; and someone whos ISP has a problem. We cant even go off of
    high packet-loss, because its easy to simulate. What we can tell is if a
    problem is on our end, because its not just one person who goes LD, but
    thousands.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Ok I am not asking for
    any special Necromancer godlike powers, but if Necros are *masters* of the
    dead, disease, and poison, why is it that we do not get Cure poison? I mean
    we get Cure Disease, and Counteract Disease so why not Cure poison? Several
    of our spells are poisonous in nature meaning we have spent many hours
    dealing with the components. So WHY NOT CURE POISON?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Actually I believe that Shaman actually have better poison and disease-based
    spells. Anyway, necros get cure disease because rotting corpses and disease
    tend to go hand-in-hand. Their ability to cast poison-based spells doesnt
    mean that they should be able to cure them.<br>
    In any case, I do think that necromancers have more than enough abilities as
    it is, so it really wouldnt be prudent to expand them into this area.<br>

    </font><br>
    Its hard to say. Though we dont currently have a new server planned, its
    probably safe to say that the next server, should one be planned, will most
    likely be a split. It is however hard to tell what will happen past that
    point.</li>

    more than one at a time (magician summoned staffs come quickly to mind)]</i><br>

    a second copy of the dungeon for the next set of players.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    We actually want to encourage people to spread out in the world and
    experience new things. Spawing multiple copies of dungeons would work
    against this goal. Another issue would be that people might have a hard time
    getting into the same &quot;copy&quot; of the dungeon when they wanted to.
    Finally, we would lose control over the rate at which items enter the game.
    I can see a situation where large guilds would purposely create multiple
    copies for the purposes of camping the same thing in those multiple copies.<br>
    Its not a good solution for a MMOG.<br>

    Look! :) Mana Regen Again ....</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Ive noticed that it is
    taking FOREVER to med with my skill stuck at 255 (or 252?). We continue to
    get more mana intensive spells and more mana past the level 50 mark, but I
    am stuck with the same med capability I will have at level 60 that I had at
    level 50. So is there a fix proposed for this? How about an item that
    casts... or has the effect of clarity? If you can do the effect of SoW for J
    Boots.... why not clarity for another type of item? Seems only fair since
    the value of SoW is not near what clarity is anymore.]</i><br>
    <br>
    </font>The &quot;solution&quot; for what you are mentioning is grouping with
    classes that have the ability to increase your regen rate. Bards and
    enchanters can do this for you, and can certainly increase it at a rate
    beyond what it was at level 50.<br>
    <br>
    Putting in other ways to increase mana regeneration would unbalance the
    game. The methods available to increase the rate of regeneration do so to
    the greatest extent that weve designed for the game.<br>

    way to make respawn times faster on full servers?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Unfortunately, thats not the answer to overcrowding. Lack of things to kill
    in a particular area is one of the things that gets people to spread out to
    some of the other areas in the game. There is now more than enough land and
    things to kill in the game to support well over two thousand people, though
    as we mentioned before, were not raising the official peak-usage target.<br>
    <br>
    The other issue is that dungeons are laid out so that if they are
    &quot;done&quot; (rather than camped), several groups can move through them
    and get enough time to rest. Increasing spawn times, by even a minute,
    upsets that balance and actually promotes camping.<br>

    </font><br>
    Triple attack is basically just &quot;something neat&quot;. I dont
    understand why this is a frequent point with monks, as it really doesnt fire
    that often for warriors to really swing balance. If monks want it just
    because its a skill that they dont have, thats really not a compelling

    I thought we did some of that with the bundle/pack spells that we threw in.
    They are really there just for fun, as you suggest. If you can think of some
    other &quot;fun&quot; spells, we could throw those in as well<br>

    They were initially correct towards the end of the RoK beta, however at some
    point they got messed up. You are right that a few are out of order, for
    instance, with group heroism coming before group resolution.<br>
    <br>
    Rather than just put them in the right order, which would be considered as a
    nerf by some, were going to just change a spell or two to something more
    appropriate for the level. For instance, I believe that we are changing
    &quot;United Resolve&quot; to a &quot;group symbol&quot; spell that only
    uses one component.<br>

    As they are hand items, they cannot appear as a model held in the hand such
    as thulian claws.<br>

    slash ok? SK NEC WAR<br>
    <br>
    but Necros cant slash ( Ive had this thing in my bank for like ages and its
    no drop ( so should I keep it for some slashing fun one day when necros can
    slash? or just give it to my pet for a mean beat em up till I log? )]</i><br>

    The inclusions of necromancers on this item was most likely a mistake. That
    said, they look pretty cool when wielded by a caster. When the SolRo quests
    first came out, the first thing I did with my necro was to run out and get a
    Harvester<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: How do you know its 20
    hours a week? Please define the source of that datum.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Its actually over 20 hours per week, much closer to 23. The data is fairly
    easy to come by, as we can tell who is logged into the servers at any given
    time, and how long they are logged in.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: That 20 hour figure is
    fine if you reduce the weak to two days. I play about 20 hours a week
    myself, but thats based on the fact that I put in all 20 in one session, and
    then take a long break. Not everybody is as fortunate as me to have a nice
    schedule.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    I know what you are saying. Thats pretty typical of the average player. The
    average player typically plays a few hours each day with one long session
    once or twice a week.<br>

    petitions.</b></a><br>
    <i><font color="#FF0000">[Quote from original post: No doubt many people
    including myself have made petitions, only to be able to resolve the
    situation themselves or with help from other players moments later before a
    GM was able to reply.<br>
    Unfortunately once the problem has been solved, the petition is still
    waiting, and the sender has no way of removing the petition from the que, or
    informing the GM`s that they no longer need assistance, which no doubt is a
    waste of theyre time, and players who still need help are left waiting
    longer.<br>
    </font><font color="#072876"><br>
    Is there any chance that a means of deleting petitions sent would be added
    to the game?]</font></i><br>
    <br>
    Thats a good idea. Ill mention it to the team.<br>
    <br>
    Players can currently only file one petition per character. A &quot;delete
    petition&quot; command (e.g. /delpetition) would just inform the server that
    you are no longer in need of help allowing the server to expire the petition</li>
