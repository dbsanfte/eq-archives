    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Verant claimed quite
    loudly that Group Aggregate Damage would unbalance and ruin the game.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Ok. No one here ever said anything like that to my knowledge. It just
    couldnt be done at the time that it was suggested. It was later implemented
    because it was a good idea. There were absolutely no reservations about it
    here at the time that it was done.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: It was you personally
    who assured me on this board that group aggregate damage would be tested and
    removed because it was a bad idea. Go ahead Gordon. Refute that. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    And I never said anything like that either, considering that the Group
    Aggregate Damage change went in some time before I started working here.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065932.html"><b>Skeleton
    Naming Bug?</b></a><br>
    Its technically a bug. What it will take to fix it though is another issue.
    I dont believe that the issue has been *waived*, which still leaves it on
    our &quot;to be addressed&quot; list.<br>
    <br>
    With the number of outstanding bugs that have been fixed over the past few
    weeks, I wouldnt be surprised if you see this one addressed soon.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065948.html"><b>Sense
    the Dead Problems</b></a><br>
    Ill bring these issues up at our next tuning meeting. I know that we passed
    on the issue before, but Ill have another go at it :)<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065891.html"><b>Response
    to &quot;Solution to Class Envy&quot;</b></a><br>
    You seem to be advocating constant and persistant upgrades for each class as
    times goes on. What point do we stop? Never? At the same time do we
    constantly upgrade NPCs so that adventuring never becomes a joke? If so, is
    that a &quot;nerf&quot;?<br>
    <br>
    As much as Id like to be able to tell everyone that we will keep making
    every class more and more powerful, I cant do that. Sure, in the short term
    following each enhancement, people of that class would be happy, but then
    wed have to deal with things like, &quot;Their last enhancement was better
    than our enhancement&quot; and &quot;Their last enhancement now makes us
    useless&quot;. Sooner or later wed end up with a game that is pitifully easy
    and without challenge. Thats when wed end up with everyone quitting.<br>
    <br>
    Very soon, were going to have to start freezing various aspects of the game
    in order to allow our designers to concentrate further on content additions.
    This has already happened to some extent with the announcement of the
    experience systems and with issues such as melee binding. We cannot get into
    a situation where we are making enhancements to a class based upon a shift
    in relative power in regards to an enhancement to another class. We could
    make changes of this nature forever, or until the game was broken, and wed
    still have people who were upset about their classes.<br>
    <br>
    Id like to ask some very straight-forward questions:<br>
    <br>
    Do you think that there is any change or series of changes that we could
    make that would eliminate class-complaints from the board? Im not even
    talking about the odd complaint that comes up every once in a while that no
    one agrees with, just the ones that result in dozens of threads and hundreds
    of posts per day.<br>
    <br>
    Satisfying one group of people who are all of the same mind is easy.
    Satisfying 14 groups whos desires are often in direct conflict with that of
    another groups is impossible.<br>
    <br>
    Heres an example, I read a post today where one player said that Hybrids
    should all have all of the skills of the warrior, including hitpoints, and
    the strength of armor and weapons, in addition to the casting abilities that
    they already have. This is supposed to &quot;make up&quot; for the
    experinece penalty. Any warriors here agree with that?<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065921.html"><b>Math
    .25+.75=1 AND 1+ Exp Penalty=1, Explaination Please?</b></a><br>
    Additional or lesser experience requirements do not directly relate to
    class-balance.<br>
    <br>
    They are mere modifiers, of the same significance as things such as
    &quot;faction problems (or the lack thereof)&quot;, &quot;quest
    availability&quot;, &quot;item availability&quot;, and &quot;racial
    skills&quot;.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065664.html"><b>Class
    Inter-Dependancy</b></a><br>
    While I appreciate the paralells you are trying to form, let me point a few
    things out:<br>
    <br>
    [my quote]: If... I can get a bind by some method other than using another
    class.<br>
    <br>
    This is a factual statement that clearly defines a proposed change. Theres
    no subjectiveness to get into the of carrying the logic further. Theres no
    element of opinion or bias in the statement itself.<br>
    <br>
    [your quote]:If...This game ever becomes more fun and less frustrating and
    has less downtime. And the PVP problem is fixed. And classes are balanced.
    And people can bind anywhere with potions or NPCs. And anyone could heal
    using Bind Wounds skill to 100% health.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;more fun&quot; is subjective. People have differing ideas of
    &quot;fun&quot;. What one person finds fun, another person might find
    tedious. The game provides many different aspects, most of which should be
    found as &quot;fun&quot; by most peopel who continue playing beyond their
    free month.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;less frustrating&quot; is again subjective. What you find frustrating
    may be considered &quot;fun&quot; by another, and vice versa.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;less downtime&quot; is a matter of perception. If you view any time
    that you are not actively enaged in fighting creatures as
    &quot;downtime&quot; then there is probably too much of it for you. However
    others view what you refer to as &quot;downtime&quot; a chance to
    &quot;socialize&quot;, &quot;form relationships&quot;, &quot;reflect upon
    current events&quot;, &quot;roleplay&quot;, &quot;build character&quot;,
    &quot;craft items&quot;, &quot;get a snack&quot; and &quot;use the
    facilities&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, if pure, unadulterated action is your chief concern, you can get
    very close to that with certain group makeups as well.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065652.html"><b>More
    PvP Issues</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: First of all, the team
    servers are wrecked by the people that want it light races vs dark. Well, I
    dont like this, and in reality, these people are wrecking the team servers
    already. Light vs Dark is cross-teaming in the extreme]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    They might be &quot;wrecking&quot; your idea of the ideal situation, but if
    that is how the environment is operating on the team servers, it probably
    means that that is how the majority of players sees things there.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I dont really care if
    the majority want it light vs dark]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Everyone is certainly entitled to their own idea of what should be going on.
    Maybe you can gather the like-minded people and see if you can convince
    others to play the game in that fashion. I dont think that we, as the
    designers, will be able to force elves and halflings to go to war.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Stop it already with how
    RZers will wreck team servers...]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Well perhaps an influence of RZ players might actually help mold the server
    to your desire. They would be coming from a server where anyone can attack
    anyone, and would probably be more likely to attack someone outside of the
    &quot;Dark vs. Light&quot; situation.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065653.html"><b>Wurmslayer</b></a><br>
    The Wurmslayer is indeed being changed to a slashing weapon. The game
    designer who created the item mistakenly believed that Paladins could use
    piercing weapons. There are some other piercing weapons that have paladins
    included as a valid class. Paladins will either be removed from the list on
    those items, or the items will be changed to slashing.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065654.html"><b>Subscriber
    Numbers</b></a><br>
    Were still running over 70% retention after nearly 17 months of operation.
    Thats fairly substantial and unheard-of in the industry.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: It was in a recent
    interview with Brad, I think it was PC Gamer. He said something alone the
    lines of like 70% retention rate. He thought that was acceptable. I dont,
    when I worked customer service our goal was in the high 90s of retention and
    satisfaction. And it is possible, I worked at a few telecomunications
    companies that had a customer base of millions.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Average retention rates over time for subscription services vary by
    industry. Im sure that telecom and ISPs might enjoy higher average rates.
    MMOGs differ in this respect.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/065655.html"><b>More
    Variety</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Imagine a world where
    there are 30 different choices for race/class and more than 3 combinations
    are actually useful!]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    13 races and 14 classes gives us an incredible amount of variety. I can only
    imagine the difficulty that would come with trying to make 30 races and 30
    classes, each of which have to have their own &quot;place&quot; in the
    world. People already apply the famed &quot;Master of...&quot; title to each
    class. I would think that extending classes out to 30 would only make them
    more specifically qualified for certain situations and less qualified on the
    whole.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Finally, after we
    actually have a little variety, maybe people will stop whining &quot;its not
    fair, he is stronger, he has more, i want more, waaaaahh&quot; because
    different people will be fighting different things, so they will have
    nothing to really compare with.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I think that you underestimate the resolve of players to
    &quot;compare&quot;.</li>

    Math</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Seriously though. Youre
    correct. In PnP games, hybrid math works something like 1 + 1 = 1.5, but
    here they seem to twist math in ways that physicists must dream about.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    PnP games however consist of a few friends sitting around a table, none of
    whom have to worry about getting left behind or chosen over another based
    upon the power of their class. To compare MMOGs directly to PnP games, it
    would be like 30 friends sitting in a room, all wanting to play, with only a
    few of the most powerful being allowed.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: How is it that you can
    combine a warrior who is great at taking damage and a druid who is good at
    dealing dmg and buffing and come out with a ranger. Every hybrid is the same
    way.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    If a ranger had all the skills and abilities of both warriors and druids,
    who would ever select a warrior or a druid for the group? The same situation
    would be present for the other hybrids. 1+1 cannot equal 2 in this case. The
    goal however is to make .25 + .75=1, and weve done a fairly good job of
    that.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: See, there *is* a way to
    beat this game. Ita either to a)Reach level 60]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Considering that there were tons of people at 50th level when that was the
    cap, and the fact that they didnt quite once reaching 50th, thats pretty
    strong evidence that it doesnt constitue &quot;beating&quot; the game.
    Theres not that many level 60s yet, but even when there is I dont think that
    that will be a large quit-point either. People quit when they decide they
    are done with the game, regardless what level they happen to be at.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Believe it or not, we DO
    NOT LIKE PUTTING 1000 hrs into a character! ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Perhaps you may not enjoy it, but theres everything to suggest that a *lot*
    of people *do* enjoy long-term character development. The simplest evidence
    is the fact that many people do put thousands of hours into their
    characters. I know dozens of people with well over 100 days played. Theres
    even more, by several orders of magnitude, with over 50 days played. I have
    nearly 1000 hours of playtime on my character and have enjoyed them to a
    great extent.<br>

    <br>
    We dont expect people to be able to max out characters in all 14 classes.
    Thats the thing about massively multiplayer games - they have to have more
    content than anyone can ever expect to consume. If you reach a point in the
    game where people have consumed all of that content, then yes, theyve beaten

    People will and do make due with what they have in the absense of the
    &quot;perfect&quot; arrangement. Farming out existing class-specific skills
    to other classes thus reducing the use of the original classes is not really
    a viable solution. Players need to learn to adapt to the situation and
    overcome the obstacles with the resources at hand.<br>

    Container code, particularly when dealing with nested containers, is very
    touchy business. Each additional level of nesting provides additional
    problems that need to be addressed. The way containers are handled now is
    part of the core foundation of EverQuest, so its highly unlikely that it
    will be expanded to allow nesting.<br>

    We still havent decided completely whether a retroactive change is
    appropriate in this case. We have however decided that these items will no
    longer drop in their current form. More changes are not necessarily
    improbable. We do however try to avoid changing existing items whenever
    possible, so we need to put more serious thought into the issue.</li>

The bug was fixed, I called people into work, and I had the servers shut down for an emergency update.

This does not happen often, but when it does, we must act quickly.

If something similar were to happen again in the future I would bring them down again.

To those of you whose evenings were disrupted, I apologize. We will endeavor to minimize these occurances.

To the Verant employees who had to direct this operation and/or come into work, I am also sorry.

No one likes downtime, not us, not the players. 

That said, to the complainers and flamers in this thread: think for a moment, and think about the game as a whole. Some of you act like kids who are mad at their parents for not letting them play in the street. My god, do you think we bring down servers like this for giggles? 

To everyone else, again, sorry for the disruption.

-Brad
