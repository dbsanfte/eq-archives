                  As a young student, Balecross often longed for far off places and the sight of distant lands. Erudin<BR>
                  had been his home, and to his young mind his prison. Ships would doc at the Erudin port, and<BR>
                  from their passengers would come tales of Humans and Barbarians. Frightening adventures<BR>
                  would be spoken of at the local pubs, stories lush with strange creatures and stranger lands,<BR>

                  As time passed, Balecross learned the deep arts of magic, focusing his studies in the teachings<BR>
                  of the Gate Callers. As but a first year student, he helped to fight back the onslaught of barbarous<BR>
                  Kybolds - a primitive and vicious race of creatures that often plagued the dark recesses of the<BR>
                  Toxxulia forests of his homeland. He gained a great deal of experience during this time of strife,<BR>

                  Balecross soon attained his fifth level and stood amongst the ranks of junior mages. A well<BR>
                  respected student at the academy, his masters worried about his impulsive tendencies and rush<BR>
                  to leave his home land. To cool his adventurous spirit, his master Terran Halfmoon, challenged<BR>
                  Balecross with a quest. Terran said to Balecross, do you know of a beast across the great bridge<BR>
                  in the Toxxulia forest, a beast that calls for the death of all Erudite. Balecross knew of this<BR>
                  creature, he had always thought it a myth, a story to keep children in their beds at night. He said, I<BR>
                  have heard of the story, it is but a trite myth a bed time story for children. No said Terran, it is real.<BR>
                  It is a Troll, a cleric to the evil god Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear. Find it, and dispatch if from our<BR>
                  lands.<BR>

                  Balecross, sensing the risk and challenge of the quest, set off with high hopes of glory. He<BR>
                  traveled through the Toxxulia forest and to the bridge, looking for the evil troll. Upon the span he<BR>
                  waited, not truly sure that this troll was real, let alone would come to the bridge. Before long a deep<BR>
                  voice shouted out &#34;Beware all Erudites, for I will slay you all!&#34; At last, thought Balecross, not much<BR>
                  longer will this beast threaten our people.<BR>

                  Confidently, Balecross stroll across the bridge, towards the sound of the voice. Just as he crossed<BR>
                  the bridge, he saw a figure through the mist. It was heading towards him, slowing as if it had<BR>
                  nothing to fear. As the figure became visible, Balecross felt the hairs on his neck raise, and a<BR>
                  flicker of fear shoot through his body. This was a great beast, it must have been eight feet tall, and<BR>
                  huge. It was green with glowing eyes, almost purple in color. An incredibly ugly beast, Balecross<BR>
                  noticed its foul stench in the air. What have I done, thought Balecross. Can such a creature exist?<BR>
                  Garnering his courage, Balecross spoke in the strongest voice he could muster &#34;Stop! foul beast.<BR>
                  Dare you threaten the lands of the Erudite!&#34;<BR>

                  The beast paused for a moment, and then a crackling sound came from it. Thinking back on it,<BR>
                  Balecross now knew it was laughter. &#34;Weakling Erudite, is this the best your masters can send<BR>
                  against me.&#34; Balecross new that he would need all his power to slay this beast, and began to<BR>
                  recant a spell to call forth the magic of an Elemental to assist him. Before the words could form,<BR>
                  the world went dark. A screaming fear enveloped Balecross, a fear the likes of which he had never<BR>
                  known. Through the haze of pain and fear, Balecross heard the Troll utter strange words, Magic<BR>
                  words. How could such a beast know the ways of Magic, Balecross thought. Just then, a spike of<BR>
                  pain shot through his body and Balecross recognized his danger. This was no simple beast this<BR>
                  troll, this was a creature of evil magic.<BR>

                  Then, Balecross felt the fear lift, and the pain recede. He looked up in wonder, why am I not dead<BR>
                  he thought to himself. Looking across the bridge, Balecross saw his friend and rival Asheron, a<BR>
                  student of the Wizard arts, casting a spell of ice onto the beast. It reared up and screamed as the<BR>
                  ice shredded its green skin. More the pleasure the beast said, in a voice as cruel and cold as the<BR>
                  ice which cut into it. It began to recant magic words, praying to its evil god for power, and Asheron<BR>
                  was hit by a blast of divine power. The blast knocked him from his feet and across the bridge,<BR>
                  Balecross could see the pain streak across his friends face.<BR>

                  Pulling his wits together, he quickly finished his incantation and called forth an Elementalkin from<BR>
                  the Earth. The great magic creature grumbled to life, an incarnation of the Earth and Stone from<BR>
                  which it was created. Balecross sent the beast to attack the Troll. The Troll concentrating on<BR>
                  calling forth a blast to finish off Asheron, did not see the Elementalkin coming toward it. Just as<BR>
                  the troll started speaking the words to call forth his magic, the Elementalkin hit him with a crushing<BR>
                  blow to the head. The Troll was dazed, and lost its concentration. It stood up to attack its new<BR>
                  enemy, rage and pain screaming from his wild eyes. Shaking off the pain, Asheron called out for<BR>
                  the Magic, and the Troll once again reeled from a storm of cutting ice. Balecross, with his last bit<BR>
                  of magic strength, called forth fire, which engulf the troll, searing its skin and weakening it further.<BR>

                  At last the troll knew fear, and attempted to flee. A last volley of ice stuck the fleeing beast from<BR>
                  Asheron, just when the Elementalkin called forth the Earth magic to shutter the earth under the<BR>

                  call forth one last burst of flame, just enough to sear the last life from the lungs of the troll.<BR>

                  After returning, he went to see his Master Terran. Master said Balecross, I have failed. How can<BR>
                  that be said Terran, I see you have a bag - does it not contain the head of the foul troll. Balecross<BR>
                  said, yes master, but it was little more then luck that I survived. I would have died, but not for the<BR>
                  aid of a friend. An apprentice Wizard by the name of Asheron, risked his own life to save me. In<BR>
                  my pride and overconfidence, I thought to dispatch this create alone, and would have died for it.<BR>
                  Terran looked at Balecross with pride, you have learned a great lesson my apprentice, he said.<BR>
                  You have learned the value of companionship. In this world, you will need your friends and<BR>

                  As Balecross sat on the shores of the Lake of Ill Omen, he remembered well this first lesson. A<BR>
                  mage of the 30th level, now powerful in his art, he thought of that first quest and the mistake he<BR>
                  had made. I will need companions now he thought, for this is a strange land, and the dangers that<BR>
                  lay ahead will be far greater then those he had faced in the past. With that he stood up and<BR>
                  strolled over to join his group of adventures, ready to explore, learn and gain rich reward.<BR>
