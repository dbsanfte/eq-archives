  Gordon posts a lengthly commetary on PVP rules: 
  <p><i>Before I get into the subject of this post, let me define the rulesets
  in play on each of the PvP servers:<br>
  <br>
  Rallos: Complete PvP. Players can attack any other player within a 4 level
  limit. Looting is coin plus one item, providing that the item isnt bagged,
  NODROP, or carried in a melee slot. There are no faction penalties for
  engaging in PvP combat.<br>
  <br>
  Tallon/Vallon: PvP Teams. Players can attack any other player within an 8
  level limit, assuming that the target is on one of the 3 opposing teams.
  Looting is coin-only. There *are* faction penalties for engaging in PvP
  combat.<br>
  <br>
  As many here have noticed, there have been drives for each of the PvP servers,
  most recently Rallos, to get the server switched to coin-only loot. However,
  though the same drive once existed for Vallon, after the change was made,
  there was likewise a drive to switch it back to item-loot. This suggests that
  while there are people who enjoy coin-only loot, there are also people who
  enjoy item-loot. The difficulty that we are faced with is trying to make
  everyone happy. Simply implementing majority will on each server doesnt
  accomplish that objective, as it addresses the needs of the pro-coin crowd
  without taking care of the pro-loot crowd. As much as both groups come here
  insisting that &quot;everyone&quot; wants what they want, I dont think that
  anyone can truly deny that both groups exist.<br>
  <br>
  Right now, we have two servers where coin-loot is in operation, and one where
  item-loot is the rule. That layout is roughly equivalent to the percentages
  that enjoy coin-loot versus item loot. The third who enjoy item loot, though
  technically the minority, are still a significant portion of the gaming
  populace, and as such should have their concerns addressed as well. Rather
  than just changing Rallos to coin-loot, its been suggested that we allow
  people a one-time chance to move between the PvP servers. Though we are not
  yet prepared to commit to a plan of that nature, I do want to get everyones
  opinion as to whether or not they would find such a plan acceptable.<br>
  <br>
  If we were to allow moves, a two-step process would be used. First, Rallos
  people would be given the option to move to Vallon or Tallon (by choice), then
  Vallon and Tallon people would be given the opportunity to move to Rallos. If
  moved, players would suddenly find themselves in a new ruleset, subject to
  every facet of that ruleset.<br>
  <br>
  Former Rallos players would find themselves on teams, in an environment that
  discourages socialization outside of your team. They would suddenly be subject
  to attack in an 8 level limit, and would take race-based faction hits for any
  PvP kills made. Players with strange deity selections (e.g. Half elf
  worshipping Innoruuk) would suddenly find themselves homeless for all intents
  and purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Former team-server players moving to Rallos would have their ability to engage
  in combat restricted to a 4 level limit, and be subject to attack and able to
  attack anyone in that range. Any race-based faction penalties assigned while
  on the Team servers would follow to Rallos, and would not be reset.<br>
  <br>
  Players on all PvP servers would encounter an influx of characters of all
  levels, who wouldnt be completely familiar with any server-specific
  player-originated rules of etiquette that may be in place. It is possible that
  aspects once understood as a &quot;given&quot; within the server community
  might break down and be no more.<br>
  <br>
  It may sound like Im trying to discourage acquiescence to this change, however
  I just want to be sure that all aspects of the proposal are understood prior
  to anyone giving an opinion on the matter. If done, the change would likely be
  the biggest to be made to any server community in EverQuest, and we want to be
  sure that everyone is well-informed.<br>
  <br>
  Thoughts?<br>
