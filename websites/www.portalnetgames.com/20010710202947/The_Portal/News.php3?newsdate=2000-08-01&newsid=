  <br>
  **Patch Day**<br>
  <br>
  Greetings everyone!<br>
  <br>
  Todays patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:<br>
  <br>
  - Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs. In addition, the range for
  canned emotes has been increased.<br>
  - /who all &quot;guildname&quot; should now work for players who have /roleplay
  turned on.<br>
  - Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file. Those who
  turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once
  more.<br>
  - The &quot;Chat Filter&quot; tab in &quot;Options&quot; now has an option to
  filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br>
  <br>
  *Fast Drop*<br>
  <br>
  Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid
  accidentally dropping items on the ground. The new client allows players to
  set &quot;Item Dropping&quot; preferences on the &quot;General&quot; options
  tab. The three options that can be set are:<br>
  <br>
  - FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.<br>
  - CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an
  item.<br>
  - NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.<br>
  <br>
  Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command. The
  arguments are:<br>
  <br>
  - ON: Same as option &quot;Fast Drop&quot; on the General Tab.<br>
  - OFF: Same as option &quot;Confirm&quot; on the General Tab.<br>
  - NEVER: Same as above.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without
  confirmation. Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being
  dropped upon the ground. Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of
  your FastDrop setting.<br>
  <br>
  It is highly recommended that you use option &quot;CONFIRM&quot;, as GMs will
  not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.<br>
  <br>
  - The EverQuest Team<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  *EMERGENCY PATCH*<br>
  <br>
  Due to problems encountered in the most recent patch, you may temporarily see
  problems with spell icons displaying for certain stackable spells. We
  apologize for the inconvenience. This issue will be addressed in the next
  patch.<br>

    Policy Question Answered</b></a><br>
    This board is incredibly active, so I understand where you are coming from.
    The anti-bumping language in the rules of conduct is meant to apply more to
    the person who will go around to a dozen threads on the same subject and
    keep them bumped to the front constantly.<br>
    <br>
    The moderators will certainly give the benefit of the doubt to everyone here
    since the thread-index almost encourages it.<br>

    CAN post with an inactive account?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: I have access to a
    second account which for now I have let lapse. Payment ran out on it on July
    25 and it can still post. I was going to leave a message with it but that
    account was used by my nephew and his Chat name was too close to his user
    name... No use tempting anyone.... )]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Were checking into why this might be the case now. Its probably a problem
    with information synchronizing with the database on the message board.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for the info.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000137.html"><b>Acceptable
    Customer Service?</b></a><br>
    I certainly would have liked to see something a little more firm. I think
    that the GM that made the announcement had heard that they would be coming
    down soon, and wanted to give more than the standard 3-5 minutes notice if
    possible. It would be normal for the GM not to know exactly when the server
    would be down, though I think that they probably should have given a
    timeframe for what qualfied as &quot;shortly&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Concerning not being able to answer all the /tells, as much as wed like to,
    we just cant. Any broadcast, regardless of content, usually results in a
    /tell from about 10% of the people online at the time. Thats a sizeable
    number of /tells. The best they can do in this case is see if the same
    questions are being asked in a number of the /tells and try to follow up on
    the issue in a subsequent broadcast.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000161.html"><b>Patch
    Changes</b></a><br>
    Oops. Sorry, I knew I forgot to mention something. Indeed, ranged weapons
    will no longer use their full delay when you are not capable of using the
    weapon due to being too far to too close.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, we also stealth-fixed a problem with skill-caps on poison. They
    not correctly to up to where they should.<br>

    Board Clear-ups</b></a><br>
    Ive seen a few emails and received a few posts regarding threads showing up
    as read before youve read them. As the boards have been reorganized, I
    imagine that your browser thinks that the links have been accessed on the
    basis of them having the same name as something youve read previously.<br>
    <br>
    Clearing your history through your browser should fix this up.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: 1&gt; As long as you
    continue to speak to customers with the same tone you used when dealing with
    these examples, players are going to remember said examples. I’ve said
    this before, but here’s a slightly different angle: if I said some of the
    things said in that FAQ, in the tone they are said, I would have been fired
    – immediately &amp; without question – from any CS department I have
    ever worked for. And I have every reason to believe this would be true in
    the vastest majority of CS departments in this country. Need an example?
    Divine Intervention (final question under 4.1).]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    I understand what you are saying AuntieShaynta, but youll also notice that
    in cases where weve tried to be extremely delicate with issues, were usually
    jumped on for not giving a straight answer. Sometimes a straight answer
    requires that we be very blunt, and sometimes bluntness is taken with
    offense. In the particular case you quote, I was looking for a way to
    indicate that there will be no change, not &quot;no change&quot; in the
    &quot;lets discuss it for a long time and we might change it&quot; sense,
    but in the &quot;this will never ever change&quot; sense. Theres only so
    many ways to state an absolute negative.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: To again quote myself,
    if I were in Brad’s position no quest would go live until I personally
    tested it. ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    While I will not deny that there is much improvement to be had in our
    testing department, theres certainly too many quests for Brad to test them
    all personally. However you are correct that someone should.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Players are going to
    remember these examples as long as Verant in general and you in particular
    continue fertilizing their memories of these examples – by continuing the
    same behaviors.]</i><br>
    <br>
    </font>I understand that, but I would ask that the players also take note of
    progress that we make. We are all people, and people make mistakes. The
    point that we stop learning from our mistakes is the point that you should
    get worried.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Thank you for your
    time.]</i><br>
    </font><br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000096.html"><b>Cannibilize
    Fizzle Rate</b></a><br>
    Theres no spell-specific fizzle rate tied to that spell. Spells have an
    increased chance to fizzle during the level that you first become able to
    cast the spell. As you get at least a level higher, you should notice your
    ability to cast it improve greatly.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000115.html"><b>Changing
    Your Chat Handle on Official Boards</b></a><br>
    Ive noticed a number of questions here regarding changing your chat handle.
    You can change your chat handle by going into the EverQuest chat server, and
    typing:<br>
    <br>
    #rename OldName NewName<br>
    <br>
    The chat handles are currently copied over to the board database once per
    day, so it might take a little while for your change to be reflected in your
    posts. Were considering increasing the number of times per day that the
    database is copied, so the duration you will have to wait to see your new
    name reflected might decrease in the future.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000125.html"><b>Question
    About the Live Servers</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Im curious... has there
    ever been a change in the Test server that HASNT come to the Live Servers
    soon after?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Off the top of my head, I do recall a DOT change that was put on Test. The
    version that finally made the production servers was much different from the
    original version on test.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: Im getting the very
    creepy feeling that Verant just sticks things on Test for a couple days
    before putting it Live, without looking at the effects it has on Test, just
    to cover their bums.]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    Well, I certainly couldnt say that we havent made mistakes in the past. We
    do however continually try and improve our processes when we do make those
    mistakes.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000063.html"><b>Board
    Notice</b></a><br>
    We ran into a few problems getting the board reconfigured. We think that we
    have them all set now. If you notice any problems with the boards over the
    next day or two, please email me at <a href="mailto:gwrinn@verant.com">gwrinn@verant.com</a>.<br>
    <br>
    As a note, we now have a few people moderating the boards to remove posts in
    violation of the new rules of conduct. We appreciate everyones cooperation
    in keeping these boards free of the discourteous banter that was present
    before.<br>
    <br>

    Happened to XX-Board?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><i>[Quote from original post: I found the Newbie Board
    to be a great place to ask dumb questions. No one would flame and people in
    general were nice. It was a good forum to ask some basic advice and/or
    questions about the game that might not be found in an FAQ, but considered
    common knowledge by posters in the General Forum. Why was the decision made
    to delete this forum?]</i><br>
    </font><br>
    We wanted to limit the number of forums based upon what we could actively
    moderate. Given that flames wont be tolerated here any more, this might be a
    good place for the questions that you mention. However, if the Newbie Zone
    was really enjoyed that much, we could certainly think about bringing it
    back.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000056.html"><b>Official
    Welcome Message to New Boards</b></a><br>
    Welcome to the new EverQuest forums. As mentioned yesterday, posting to all
    forums, with exception to the “Customer Service / Technical Help” forum,
    is restricted to active EverQuest account holders. At this time, we are also
    implementing strict moderation on all EverQuest forums in accordance with
    the rules of conduct at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html.">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html.</a><br>
    <br>
    I’d like to begin by telling you about some new features of the boards. In
    the upper right-hand corner of the screen, under the “Post New Topic”
    button, you’ll find a link to the new EverQuest Forum FAQ. In addition to
    containing information regarding the new rules in place on the message
    boards, this FAQ also contains useful information on some subjects that tend
    to come up frequently on the boards. On the upper left-hand side of the
    screen, you’ll notice a link to “EQModerator”. This link will take you
    to a page that will allow you to email the moderators of the boards in order
    to report posts that violate the message board rules listed in the FAQ and
    the Rules of Conduct. The EQModerator email address is *only* to report
    violations of those rules and to request moderator support in a particular
    forum. At the top of each page you’ll note a line that reads “Posting to
    this forum is subject to the EverQuest Rules of Conduct”. We highly
    suggest that everyone read all of these documents prior to posting on the
    boards.<br>
    <br>
    We’ve taken great steps to ensure the security of Station information here
    on the boards. You’ll notice that when posting to the restricted boards,
    your Chat handle is displayed as the author of the post. You can change your
    chat handle once per week in the EverQuest Chat Server. Type #help for a
    list of commands available to you in the Chat server. Please note that
    posting in the “Customer Service / Technical Help” forum will display
    your Station Name rather than your Chat Handle, as the forum currently
    allows posts from the general public regardless of account status. In the
    near future, we will change that forum to use a chat handle if one exists.<br>
    <br>
    Please note that the new message board rules will be enforced immediately.
    There is to be no more name-calling, personal attacks, or rampant profanity
    on these boards. People who post in a prohibited manner will run the risk of
    losing access to their EverQuest accounts. We regret having to tie the two
    services together in this manner, however given the option of either doing
    this to allow the boards to serve their purpose, or shutting them down, we
    feel that this is a much better solution, as it allows us to serve our
    customers to the greatest extent possible.<br>
    <br>
    These boards exist as a resource for current EverQuest subscribers. I would
    like to thank everyone for helping ensure that they fulfill their purpose.
    We look forward to recommending these boards to our subscribers as a whole
    in the near future.<br>
