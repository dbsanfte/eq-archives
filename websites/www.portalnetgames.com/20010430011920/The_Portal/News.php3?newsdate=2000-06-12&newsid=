He addresses a lot of items a wide spectrum
of issues. 
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052131.html"><b>Music
    Problem</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: So, I am wondering why I cant get ANY music in
    Everquest at all. Now, recently, we were sent all those .Xmi files I had to
    sit through,]</i><br>
    <br>
    They were pretty small, it shouldnt have taken too long to download them.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: and then deleted anyways for fear of having
    the camping issues. Either way, I have yet to get music in the game.]</i><br>
    <br>
    Youll only get music if there is an XMI file for the zone that you are in.
    If youve deleted all of the XMI files I doubt youll get any music. Now if
    you didnt get any music even when you had XMI files, theres probably a
    problem with your sound card configuration.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052141.html"><b>Illusion/Faction
    Issue</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Why does faction(good and bad) transfer to
    my&quot;true self&quot;, when I have any Illusion on? Example: I use my DE
    illusion when I do the stein of moggok quest in Oggok. My true self is no
    longer KoS there now. I use my DE and Troll illusion in SK to kill treants.
    My &quot;true self&quot; is Kos to druids and all of Qeynos now. Is it a bug
    or are my illusions just kinda worthless now? I would really like to hear
    from you on this, Abashi, if at all possible. ]</i><br>
    <br>
    Its not a bug and its always worked this way. Deed-based faction (faction
    based on what you have done) is attached to the character, not the race that
    you happen to look like at the time. The only faction that illusions can
    affect is that of your race.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052143.html"><b>Item
    Specific Issues</b></a><br>
    Though I appreciate everyones concerns on some of the item-specific issues
    that have come up lately, some of this stuff is just the way it works.<br>
    <br>
    I would like to come up with a better way to say that, but sometimes thats
    the simplest explanation for issues such as this.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052145.html"><b>FA
    Quest Question</b></a><br>
    This is the first report Ive heard along these lines. The quest components
    are pretty rare drops.<br>
    <br>
    That said, I do believe that the quest was revamped less than 4 months ago,
    so your data might be a bit off.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052129.html"><b>Unblockable
    Spam</b></a><br>
    Ill talk to the guys about including that in the /ignore filter. In the mean
    time, please /report anyone being anti-social in that fashion and /petition
    to let the GMs know that you sent the report.<br>
    <br>
    Though we do like to retain our customers, wed be happy to do without those
    who purposely try to ruin the game for others.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052127.html"><b>Bug
    Report List</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: L56 Mage spell Muzzle of Mardu is bugged and
    cant be used by any race at all.]</i><br>
    <br>
    Not a bug. Give it to your pet.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Mage spell L56 Dyzils Deafening Decoy have a
    spell that was meant to be an AE tauntspell (atleast what I heard), it aint
    working, it cant taunt a mob of a L53 Airpet.]</i><br>
    <br>
    This should be pretty straight forward, Ill see if test can take a look.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Mages normal focus items dont work on Pets
    over L51, this is a huge bug or a secret nerf.]</i><br>
    <br>
    Neither. They just arent implemented at this time. Thats not to say that we
    will want to implement them though, as pets are about as powerful as we want
    them to be.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052100.html"><b>Suggestion
    for Vallon Zek</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: I was wondering if the CHEST piece could be
    made no drop on VALLON because its the most important piece for melee types
    and if some naked caster pkes it off ya when at 2 bubles of health the
    efficiency of that char goes down alot casters got nothing to lose when they
    die.]</i><br>
    <br>
    We really dont have any plans of making items NODROP to eliminate them as a
    loot possibility on the PvP servers that allow item loot.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052095.html"><b>Undead
    &amp; Nightvision</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, Why do undead not get Night vision? Is
    this a bug or a feature?]</i><br>
    <br>
    Like some other things on the board today, this is just how it is. When
    creating the illusions we decided what benefits an illusion would have.
    Night vision wasnt one of them.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052009.html"><b>Fun
    Ideas for High Keep Hold</b></a><br>
    Though in the original design, meta-games (games within games) were later
    scrapped in favor of working on other and more pressing issues. We do not
    have any immediate plans to revisit them at this time.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052067.html"><b>Complement</b></a><br>
    I think that theres more than a few out there like you, and I appreciate the
    fact that you posted here on the boards.<br>
    <br>
    Im glad you are enjoying the game.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052068.html"><b>Team
    Servers/Rallos Zek &amp; Faction</b></a><br>
    The teamservers have faction hits for PvP. Rallos Zek, on the other hand,
    does not have those faction hits. Thats just how the servers are set up.<br>
    <br>
    Plenty of people still engage in PvP combat despite these restrictions.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/052086.html"><b>New
    PvP Server?</b></a><br>
    We bring up new servers when the population on existing servers gets to the
    point that a new server is needed. All three of the PvP servers are
    currently underutilized, leaving no reason to bring up another at this time.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Plus im sure a huge majority of people would
    love to start fresh and not have 1000 people higher in level.]</i><br>
    <br>
    This happens after the server has been up a few days anyway. Unless you are
    the one whos highest in level, there will always be people higher than you.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051942.html"><b>Inspecting
    Players Suggestion</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Ive posted about this before, and Ive also
    suggested maybe making right-click player inspection re-mappable to a
    keyboard key, but maybe the simplest way to do this would be to just make
    player inspection during combat not possible. Accidentally right-clicking on
    other players, and seeing their stuff while Im getting wailed on is
    annoying. I cant be the only person who has this problem. Thanks.]</i><br>
    <br>
    Sounds simple enough. Ill ask the client programmer if he can take a look at
    it. No promises though.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/041075.html"><b>Falling
    off Boats</b></a><br>
    Thanks for the info. Until we can get it fixed, I suggest you jump over that
    area with the collision problem.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050423-2.html"><b>Server
    Issues</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: Case in point, after 5 days hunting in Hate
    during normal prime time hours, little was available to hunt as the non-peak
    crowd from over seas had largely cleared the zone during the &quot;day&quot;
    here (late aftrnoon here). This leaves many guilds in peak time at a loss
    for hunting for those items specific to these types of locations.]</i><br>
    <br>
    We cant start restricting use of a server during specific times of day on
    the basis that other people can play when you cant. It could very well be
    the other way around, with non-peak players citing how peak-players kill
    everything in these areas.<br>
    <br>
    The servers are up 24/7 excluding scheduled and emergency downtime. Nothing
    is on a perfect 24 hour or 12 hour spawntime, so sooner or later the
    critters in question will pop when virtually anyone is online.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051708.html"><b>Druid
    Quest Armor</b></a><br>
    <i>[Quote from original post: The last thread had a lot of good ideas and
    was completely ignored. Lets try again]</i><br>
    <br>
    This issue comes up about every two weeks as people who bring it up move on,
    and new people come here to the boards. I know that Ive addressed it
    probably a few dozen times in the past 6 months.<br>
    <br>
    That said, we are aware of the interest in a mid-level quest armor. We
    havent ruled out the possibility of putting some in in the future, but we
    dont have any specific plans to do so. We recieve hundreds of requests for
    items, quests, and content of various types daily. We have to decide what is
    *needed* versus what is *wanted*. Right now there is no pressing *need* for
    a mid-level druid quest armor based upon the fact that there are many other
    items in game that druids can wear, and that provide stats and bonuses in
    excess to what any class-specific armor would.<br>
    <br>
    Hopefully we will do it some day.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/051872.html"><b>Blood
    Ember Armor</b></a><br>
    The guys have looked the issue over. The blood ember armor weight is
    intentional. According to the Live guys, its due to the fact that the armor
    is easier to get than the other armor types in Kunark.<br>
