  <br>
  *The Fan Faire comes home!*<br>
  <br>
  The next EverQuest Fan Faire will be held April 6 - April 7, 2001 at the
  Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We expect this one to sell out quicker
  than Baltimore not only because the weather will be warmer, but also because
  its a safe bet to say youll get to meet even more Verant personalities since
  our offices are local. Dont delay with registration because you may get left
  out!<br>
  <br>
  The registration deadline is March 28th. Go to <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire">http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire</a>
  for details.<br>

  <br>
  ***Patch Day***<br>
  <br>
  *General Changes*<br>
  <br>
  -- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200.<br>
  -- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donals Breatplate on others once
  casted upon yourself.<br>
  -- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>
  -- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or
  alt+b.<br>
  -- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>
  -- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on
  Antonica and two others on Kunark. NPCs at these locations can fill you in on
  the details. Good hunting.<br>
  -- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the &quot;Celestial
  Healing&quot; effect has been increased to one minute. We understand that this
  severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing
  alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch. We did, however,
  need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the
  group tank. When weve decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those
  items retroactively.<br>
  -- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill
  values over 100. Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>
  -- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.
  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing
  /inspect.<br>
  -- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the
  chat window.<br>
  -- Fixed &quot;Breath of the Sea&quot;. It was mistakenly set to be
  unresistable.<br>
  -- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.
  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and
  clean up your pet.<br>
  -- &quot;Voice Graft&quot; will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of
  your pet.<br>
  -- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>
  -- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125. It was the intent
  for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll
  bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better. With the tracking
  improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>
  -- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<br>
  <br>
  *NPC AI Adjustments*<br>
  <br>
  -- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt
  creatures that are level 60 to 65. Previously, players could only taunt
  creatures below their level.<br>
  -- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount
  of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies. Prior to
  this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this. This is why NPCs
  would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>
  -- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much &quot;temporary
  hate&quot; when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>
  -- The maximum amount of &quot;hate&quot; that an NPC can add when witnessing
  a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>
  -- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number
  of hitpoints healed. Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of
  hate. Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<br>
  <br>
  *Velious Music*<br>
  <br>
  Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for
  some Velious Zones. Let us know what you think of the new compositions.<br>
  <br>
  *EQGems*<br>
  <br>
  A new &quot;mini-game&quot; has been added to the EverQuest client. EQGems is
  our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different
  activities while playing EverQuest. Based upon the success of EQGems, we may
  explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are
  multiplayer in and of themselves. Type /gems to play.<br>
