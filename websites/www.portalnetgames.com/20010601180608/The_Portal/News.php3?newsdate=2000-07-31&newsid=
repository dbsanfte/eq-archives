The event will begin at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and will run as long as there are people in attendance. Featured services will include a variety of tradespeople practicing fletching, blacksmithing, tailoring, and other skills as well as free starter weapons and provisions for newbies. Our casters will offer buffs to all, and there will even be music and fortune-telling. Some services may require a basic materials cost, but many will be free (donations will be cheerfully accepted in any case).

We are a roleplaying guild, and will be in character during the festival. Attendees are invited and strongly encouraged -- but not required -- to roleplay. We will provide safe escort from the Blackburrow entrance in Qeynos Hills and from the city gate in North Qeynos for those who require it. If you play (or are about to start playing) a new character, this event is an excellent place to get some help for little or no money. If you are not a newbie, there will still be much of interest, and we hope M-T players young and old will come and roleplay with us. 

Questions? E-mail Halwyn of Surefall at scholargipsy@hotmail.com or check out the Elves Website at www.geocities.com/loklorn to learn more about our guild.

<p><i>Hello everyone,</i></p>
<p><i>We are pleased to announce that tomorrow we will be implementing some major
changes here on the boards. While everyone will remain able to read all of the
forums, they will be restricted so that only active EverQuest account holders
will have the right to post. Its important that we mention that though we
respect the opinion of those who no longer play EverQuest, these forums are
provided as a service for active customers. The change will allow us to service
existing subscribers to a greater extent.</i>
<p><i>At the same time that these changes are made, we will begin strict moderation
of the boards. The flames and personal attacks that are now so common on these
boards will no longer be allowed to continue. As posters will have to log in
with their active EverQuest account info, we will have all the tools necessary
to track down and take action upon posters who choose to engage in some of the
less-than-courteous banter that takes place here. We will also be posting a FAQ
that not only explains the new rules that will be observed and enforced on the
boards, but also goes into verbose explanation of some of the issues that come
up here quite regularly (e.g. melee binding, experience requirements, etc.)</i>
<p><i>As a symbol of our renewed commitment to return the boards to a standard of
acceptability, we will be completely wiping the boards at the time of the
change.</i>
<p><i>Below is a subset of the FAQ that will be made available tomorrow regarding
the new rules on the board:</i>
<p><i>---snip---<br>
General Rules for EverQuest Forums</i>
<p><i>As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these
forums is bound by The Stations Terms of Service that can be found in their
entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a>.
In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that
apply to the EverQuest Forums.</i>
<p><i>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature
manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting.
This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers,
operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and
ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of
reading the forum.</i>
<p><i>You may not, however, post any material that:</i>
<p><i> Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but
do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster.<br>
 Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats. See above.<br>
 Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Though we do have a filter in
place to catch the unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a
license to abuse it.<br>
 Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation.<br>
 Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general
standards of decency in the United States.<br>
 Infringes on anyones privacy rights.</i>
<p><i>Furthermore, you may not:</i>
<p><i> Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting
attention paid to your issue.<br>
 Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to
another thread on a different subject.<br>
 Monopolize the front page of any forum by &quot;bumping&quot; threads of the
same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any
time that this occurs.<br>
 Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest
within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).<br>
 Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest
characters or items in exchange for real-world money.<br>
 Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest
EULA, or the Station Terms of Service.<br>
 Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other
Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products.</i>
<p><i>Actions Taken For Violation</i>
<p><i>Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on
the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It
could include any number of the following:</i>
<p><i> Editing of the post.<br>
 Deletion of the post/thread.<br>
 Closing of the thread.<br>
 Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration
of the suspension).<br>
 Banishment (results in the users station account being canceled. User will no
longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum).<br>
 Legal Action (i.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a
threat.)</i>
<p><i>People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning
before any action is taken. In the event that a warning is given, the warning
will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should
the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and
administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in
the Official EverQuest Forums.<br>
---snip---</i>
<p><i>As a note, we will begin strictly enforcing these rules as soon as the
changes are made. We would like to ask for everyones cooperation in following
and enforcing these rules at that time.</i>
<p><i>Thank you,</i>
<p><i>Gordon Wrinn<br>
</i>
</p>
He goes on with responses to several other posts:
<p><i>
Just a note on a couple of things (another repost):</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Starting tomorrow, all players must wear a yellow star on their
chest.</i>
<p><i>I wondered how long wed have to go before someone invoked Godwin.</i>
<p><i>Please do not compare something as trivial as rules here on the board to
something as substantial as the holocaust. You show disrespect to everyone who
ever new anyone who was affected by it by doing so. Things like this are a very
good example of what could cause action to be taken against accounts.</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;To facilitate hackers, your station name will now be given out
freely.</i>
<p><i>Station names will not be publicized. Though you will log in with your
station name, your chat handle will be displayed on posts that you make. There is
no security concern.</i>
<p><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Question, would posting further comments in debate or adding more
information to a previous post be in violation of this rule? (reading it I do not
think so, but want to make sure)</i>
<p><i>No, it applies more to people who start 20 or 30 threads on the same subject.
Basically intentional spammers.</i>
<p><i>Its important to mention that we have no problem with ideas or opinions being
posted on these boards, but do take issue with the presentation of those ideas
or opinions. If they cant be made without personally attacking someone, then
they should not be on this board. Attack the post, not the poster. For example,
&quot;This idea is moronic&quot; is not a personal attack, whereas &quot;You are
a moron&quot; is.</i>
<p><i>-Gordon<br>
</i>
</p>
Wew, good thing that fan sites like The Portal are out there so that we can here the real opinions of players.

    <br>
    Timnar,<br>
    <br>
    Im going to be very honest with you. Every post Ive read of yours has been
    extremely insulting. I really have no interest in walking into insulting
    threads, regardless of size, and address &quot;each and every issue
    contained&quot; therein. To be honest, I do keep track of people who tend to
    be interested in the betterment of the game above all else, and do tend to
    respond to their posts. By the same virtue, I keep track of those who are
    insulting as a rule, and tend not to respond to theirs even when the tone
    changes.<br>
    <br>
    That said, concerning the issues in that thread, theyve been addressed in
    the past in a multiple of threads. I posted a while back that were going to
    stay away from class-envy threads, which is what your post was.<br>
    <br>
    If youd like to keep posting the issues that you feel are important, that is
    your option. However I dont want to validate the &quot;insult them until
    they answer&quot; strategy, so I wont be responding. Im only responding to
    this one as a courtesy.<br>

    about how everyone should file their complaints to the FTC.gov online and
    found that, while making my reply, Verant had deleted the thread.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    The post was a nonsensical content-free post suggesting that people should
    go complain to every organization under the sun just for general purposes.
    Things of that nature are not to be arranged on our boards. Feel free to
    state your opinion, but if you want to suggest that people go complain to
    the government just for the sake of complaining, you can do that on someone
    elses boards.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: There is a problem with

    <br>
    Actually nothing of this nothing of this nature was said. The person asked
    if the &quot;game would ever become playable for the casual gamer&quot;, the
    response was &quot;it depends on what your definition of the casual gamer
    and playable is&quot;. Both are entirely subjective terms completely open to
    interpretation. If your idea of &quot;casual gamer&quot; is 5 minutes per
    day, and your idea of &quot;playable&quot; is maxing out your character in a
    week, then the game will not meet your expectations.<br>

    are Verant employees allowed to play?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Why are Verant employees
    even allowed to play?...]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Most people seem to think that we should play the game more, so this is a
    new one :) Seriously though, Verant employees need to play the game in order
    to keep in touch with how gameplay works and what is experienced by the
    players. Verant employees are not however, allowed to use their influence or
    any special abilities while &quot;playing&quot; the game.<br>

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/066416.html"><b>Quest
    Broken?</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Is this quest officially
    broken, or, was the decision to move Roror to AlizeTaeEw (Or VolEw,
    whichever one) the right decision?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Rorors change of faction was intentional. He used to be on the beta-neutral
    faction, a faction that no killable NPC is supposed to be on. Beta-neutral
    NPCs are to remain available to players regardless of race, class, deity, or
    action. Killing beta-neutral NPCs causes you to lose faction with NPCs such
    as the Priest of Discord.<br>
    <br>
    The quests with Roror are supposed to be completable still, though they may
    require that you work on your faction a bit before that becomes a
    possibility.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/066395.html"><b>Removing,
    Modifying Weapons Already Achieved</b></a><br>
    We really dislike the idea of removing or negatively modifying items in game
    once theyve been earned. This has as much been due to cusotmer expectations
    as it has been to our own philosophy.<br>
    <br>
    For each issue such as this that comes up, we need to decide whether a
    retroactive change is *needed*, not just whether wed like to do it overall.
    The issue with the Guise of the Deceiver is one of those times that we
    elected to leave the current item in game. The item itself didnt present
    much of a balance issue, and was just being used in a manner that was
    different from how we envisioned it. A retroactive change in this case wasnt
    *needed*.<br>
    <br>
    Manastones was more of a half-and-half issue. Though we elected to leave the
    existing ones in game as is, we also decided that they would become no more
    useful than they were at the given time. We disallowed their use in the
    Planes and all Kunark zones.<br>
    <br>
    Theres been other issues where weve elected to change the current item. We
    never tread this path lightly.<br>
    <br>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/066411.html"><b>CS
    Case</b></a><br>
    Ill have to support the GMs in this case, as they are not allowed to release
    information of this type. One of the facets of MMOGs is the ability to
    converse with other people who have been there before, rather than resorting
    to asking for &quot;hints&quot; from the customer-service staff.<br>
    <br>
    Try asking around a bit to see how things work. You might find that you are
    able to form some friendships with people who you wouldnt have met
    otherwise.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Will EQ every become
    playable for the &quot;Casual Player&quot;?]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I guess it depends on how you define &quot;playable&quot; and &quot;casual
    player&quot;. The average player of EQ currently plays just over 20 hours
    per week, and it is in that range that EQ is generally geared towards.<br>
    <br>
    Will a 2 hour per day player be able to acquire everything that a 4 hour per
    day player will in the same calander time? No, as the game is geared off of
    played-time versus calander time. Of course, theres also a bit better
    returns on time you can put in in one sitting, meaning that someone who
    plays 4 hours in one sitting will probably accomplish more than someone who
    plays 2 two-hour sittings.<br>
    <br>
    I think that it is a foregone conclusion that people who have more time to
    play will be able to do more in game.<br>

    Thats actually a pretty good advancement rate compared to what people are
    seeing in the 50+ range.<br>

    Playing a monk is probably not the best choice for a solo player,
    particularly due to the downtime involved without a support class. However
    Id consider the monk a very good class for a two-person group (with a healer
    of some sort, even a hybrid). You could probably quadruple the amount of
    time you can fight thus doubling your advancement rate just by adding one
    person to your group.<br>
    <br>
    As you certainly arent the only person in this situation, theres probably
    other people out there as well who are in your situation, you just need to
    find them. Try advertising for cleric, druids, shaman, or paladins for your
    group. I hear complaints from all of those classes that they cant find
    groups in your level-range.<br>

    Looting Corpse Nerf</b></a><br>
    About two weeks ago we put in some code to disallow the looting of others
    corpses. We made this change due to the multiple customer service issues
    that come up in regards to corpse looting, and the request from players to
    provide a method of consent that didnt allow looting.<br>
    <br>
    Providing seperate /consent commands for looting and dragging wasnt an
    option due to technical reasons. After viewing the new code in action for a
    while, weve had the opportunity to evaluate the whole issue and have decided
    that the looting of others corpses presents too many issues regarding
    customer service to reenable it.<br>
    <br>
    Given the massive reduction in fraud since the change went in, were pretty
    sure that the current logic provides the best possible environment for the
    players.<br>

    Collectively we know everything that there is to know about EQ. Of course,
    it would be folly to say that any one person person knows everything. Theres
    far too much to the game, and far too many people working on it to have
    every specific issue known off of the top of the heads of everyone on the
    game.<br>

    spinedoc, Id like to politely suggest that you check out the
    &quot;search&quot; function here on the boards if you are looking for my
    posts. Either that, or check out some of the major news sites such as
    EQVault, EverLore, or EQAnswers. Most of them offer continuing coverage
    throughout the day.<br>
