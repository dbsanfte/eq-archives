Solusek Ro:</i></font>
<blockquote>
  <font size=3>
  <p>It all started on a cold day when the lightning pierced a murky sky and the
  cold bitter winds blew through Norrath, a dark forbodeing of things to come.
  All seemed well when the army that had valiantly defended high keep had
  returned and sailed their crest upon a banner once more; the 1st Fist of Light
  returned. But then within the bowels of Neriak came a stir amongst the Teir
  Dal. They had not forgotten their past, nor their plans, and especially their
  defeat. There must be retribution! The Fist of Hate is born?</p>
  <p>With the appearance of that dark standard came Drayvar, whereabouts still
  unknown. Then appeared Mordeki, a ruthless shadow knight who carried orders
  supposedly from the hand of Lanys, daughter of Innoruuk. Mordeki poisoned a
  high priest in the process of collecting these orders only hand them to
  Drayvar personally. These orders commenced and officiated in the new Hate army
  that was to crusade through Norrath in a retributive strike to eliminate the
  light army.</p>
  <p>Then somewhere along the lines is believed Euthan (Banegrivms brother) and
  Martyr (who is now reportedly Euthans brother also) have also allied with the
  new hate army as well.</p>
  <p>Then a letter arrives from Qeynos written by Chesgard, a Knight of Thunder.
  A greta veil of shadow has begun to fall across the city of Qeynos. Crops
  wither, fish found floating dead at sea, the graves of the dead found torn
  open as a sore against the land, and strange sounds began to fill the hills at
  night accompanied by the baying of wolves beneath a witches moon. Rumors
  abound that the undying one had even returned to the disheveled ruins nearby.
  Chesgard worried for the life of his son, but was afraid to act for rumors and
  stories had been spread as old wives tales about their good commander Kane,
  speaking of witchery and demon worship.</p>
  <p>After counseling with the the High Priestess of Rodcet Nife, within the
  temple of life...she too concurred with the knight that a great evil was laying
  its grip fast about the city and if something was not done, then the end would
  come...and darkness would reign supreme over the vassal.</p>
  <p>Chesgard feared for the life of his son who patrolled the hills. He could
  not bare the thought of losing him. This in mind the knight set out upon the
  road and entered into the Rathe mountains. Here he entered a valley enshrouded
  by a thick heavy fog, wherein he found a small band of gypsies. He spoke to an
  old crone that saw in her visions the darkness which that knight spoke upon.</p>
  <p>She told him if he sought its source she needed to find the mariner who had
  traveled the world over. Only then would the source of the evil that plagued
  the good people of Qeynos be known. Her last words to Chesgard as he departed
  were the blood is on the walls. Later Chesgard discovers from a
  local youth about a captain whose ship is in dry doc at port and comes to
  believe this may in fact be the same mariner that the old crone
  spoke of.</p>
  <p>Chesgard then set quil to parchment and sent a page with the letter to the
  Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light. The page then was seen in the
  hallways leaving changing from the visage of a young lad, to that
  of a fair and beautiful high elf from whose lips could be heard, soon we
  will be together my love.</p>
  <p>In the letter Chesgard also had become suspicious as to the dark tidings,
  considering the re-emergence of the hate armies. The last time such evils were
  soon were none other then the war of hate, around the time of the battle of
  high keep. This was when the dead raised from their graves in the hills and
  Varsoons decayed plague was wrought across the lands.</p>
  <p>During this time Drayvar managed to temporarily ensnare the soul of Hothrog,
  with the aid of the witch Najena. Zyac later used his rites to unbind the soul
  of Hothrog from being bound in a Necromantic rite of passage. During this time
  a few confrontations occurred between Fist of Hate and 1st Fist of Light, this
  only being one of them...not even counting the endless taunting from the ranks
  of the Hate army.</p>
  <p>Having the letter a scouting party sets out to Qeynos. Its believed by
  Aikek and Linien that the mariner is none other then Captain
  Rohand form the Mermaids Lure at the docs. This same Captain also speaks of
  tales regarding the vampire Mayong Mistmoore not as a Teir Dal, but as a
  fallen high elf.</p>
  <p>The party which then consisted of Banegrivm, Linien, Genieve, Hothrog,
  Shaym, Mystican, Jarkari, and Raleldor Jax; a passing warrior who had heard
  the tales of Qeynoss strife and offered his sword in the cause. They maid
  their way the docs and found the Mermaids Lure and spoke with the captain. In
  the midst of their conversation with Captain Rohand, a gypsy spoke to
  Banegrivm and said only he who is of open faith may pass, what god do
  you follow?</p>
  <p>When Banegrivm answered the gypsy he was informed to hail mister
  bloodheart deep within the catacombs. Shaym new immediately considering
  her former past who exactly mister bloodheart was. He was none
  other then the Lord of the Bloodsabres themselves, vile champions of
  Bertoxxulous.</p>
  <p>The scout group made their way into the sewers. After much searching they
  discovered a secret door which led entry to the home of what was thought to be
  just a temple of Bertoxxulous. As they entered the ante-chamber a foul wind
  blew and what sounded like howling demons filled the air.</p>
  <p>As they entered in they saw twin shadow knights which guarded and entry.</p>
  <p>Raleldor was able to pass deeper within, being a warrior without liege to
  any faith. As he entered he saw not but a temple...but an entire citadel of
  deep dank evil. He made his way to Sragg Bloodheart and as he hailed him...a
  shrill vile sound pierced the air as a demons tendril like wisps took the life
  of Hothrog within an instant.</p>
  <p>Banegrivm gave the command for immediate retreat knowing there was know
  hope of a frontal assault. They reformed and pulled back with the knowledge
  that they had and an idea of the perils that lay ahead of them. But now new
  questions remain. What do the followers of Bertoxxulous have to do with those
  of Hate?</p>
  <p>Later that same fateful eve...Raleldor and Banegrivm discovered a paladin
  of Mithaniel Marr amidst the ranks of of the Qeynos guards. This struck odd
  considering as soon as he appeared he disappeared and then was found outside
  the Mermaids Lure. Even stranger is the fact that it had been thought all the
  guards true to the Qeynos seal were followers of Rodcet Nife. As the two spoke
  with Lieutenant Arathur, they were told by him to seek out Rolius
  in the Hall of Truth. When the two traveled there they were told by this
  knight to collect militia helms from the fallen corrupt city guardsmen.</p>
  <p>How odd a wayward knight of truth finds himself in Qeynos spreading the
  word of Marr. How odd yet again a paladin who follows Marr is fated to battle
  the arch enemy of the temple of life. But again...why? And how does all this
  relate to the the rising hate armies. What will happen next? Only time will
  tell...for assuredly war is coming...</p>
  <p>OOC - all of this is the background storyline that will be leading to mass
  guild conflict. Please contact <a href=mailto:banegrivm@aol.com>banegrivm@aol.com</a>
