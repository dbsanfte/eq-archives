concerning the clipping plane</a> issue. Heres the original post followed by
Brads response:
<ul>
  Ive been saying for MONTHS that the clipping plane slider bar is bugged. But
  Verant has yet to fix it. They say they have moved out the file header to max
  on the server, but since this is a client side bug, its still not fixed. I
  finnally got fed up at being believed by everyone BUT Verant, so I took the
  time to makes these pictures.<br>
  As you can see, as the rain subsites, it moves off, reveiling the real max
  clipping plane, but when the rain actually stops, the haze sets in, breaking
  the clipping planes max distance.<br>
  Abashi said that the clipping plane on each zone was set to max. Well if it
  was set to max, why is the rain able to go farther out then we are able to
  see?<br>
  I also made a comparison picture so you could see the difference.<br>
  ----------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  Here we have a normal day of EQ (typhoon)<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  ----------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  Here we have the rain moving off, and as you can see, it reveils a lot of open
  land. This wasnt even the farthest it goes, but its hard to take a pic at the
  right time when you only have 2 seconds.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  -----------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  Here is what we normally see. Lots of sky, not much land. The above might not
  look like a lot of extra land, but when you take the time to study it, you can
  see that it really can ammount to a LOT of extra distance.<br>

  <br>
  Here is a comparison of the 2 views. I didnt want to confuse anyone and have
  them say that &quot;They cant see the difference&quot;<br>

  <br>
  Any Questions?<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>First, thanks for the screenshots -- it helped us understand part of
  this issue.<br>
  Jeff Butler and I looked into this personally today and came to some
  conclusions.<br>
  <br>
  But first, some info into how clipping planes work.<br>
  <br>
  1. When an outdoor zone is exported from the tools we use to create it, the
  artist chooses a maximum clip plane. This setting affects how far out
  visibility is calculated, and can affect file size and frame rate.<br>
  <br>
  2. Most old world zones were exported with a much lower number than most
  Kunark zones.<br>
  <br>
  3. Each zone has a minimum and maximum clip plane number associated with it
  server side. These are the numbers you move between when you adjust the
  clipping plane slider in-game.<br>
  <br>
  4. The slider bar is supposed to work as a percentage. In other words, in one
  zone if the min is 1 and the max 1000, were the slider in the center, youd be
  at 500. But if the min was 1 and the max 100, say for another zone, youd be at
  50 with the slider in the middle.<br>
  <br>
  Ok, so, after looking into this and checking out the screenshots referred to
  in this thread we were able to determine the following:<br>
  <br>
  1. For some reason (well ask the programmer tomorrow), when rain stops, the
  clipping plane moves out beyond the max briefly and then settles back at the
  max. For example, I went to Overthere and verified what the screenshots
  showed: the Overtheres max clip is 1800 feet. It looked like the clip went to
  2000 or so briefly when the sky was still gray and then returned to 1800 when
  the sky was on again.<br>
  <br>
  2. Another bug (though not terribly consequential) is that depending on the
  max clip, the clip slider bar appears to do nothing the last 25% or so. I was
  in the Overthere using the clip slider and watching the clipping plane
  distance in feet (something that doesnt show on the normal client) and it got
  to the max, 1800, at around 75% of the slider bar.<br>
  <br>
  Ok, so what does this all mean? And could people see farther in the past?<br>
  <br>
  Possibly, yes -- weve changed the max clipping plane in zones several times.
  The fact that the slider bar appears to max out early, though, isnt stopping
  you from setting your clipping plane to the max setting server side. Neither
  is the rain.<br>
  <br>
  A good question, though, is if the Overthere displays out to 2000 briefly, why
  isnt the max clip for the Overthere 2000?<br>
  <br>
  I agree. What well do is go through the zones again and make sure the max
  server side is really the max the zone was exported at.<br>
  <br>
  Do keep this in mind, though: we cannot move the max clip beyond the clipping
  distance the zone was originally exported at -- the visibility data is just
  not there and youll see nothing beyond that hard limit. Unfortunately, the
  vast majority of the old world zones had max clips between 600 and 1500 feet.
  In other words, East Commons will never have a clip of 1800 or 2000 like the
  Overthere could.<br>
  <br>
  Ill also ask that the bug associated with the rain that has the cilp pull back
  past the max clip be fixed, although honestly, its not going to be a high
  priority bug in that it doesnt hurt gameplay.<br>
  <br>
  Anyway, I hope this clears things up. Ill watch this thread tonight to see if
  there are any additional questions.<br>

Heres the second volley of posts in this thread:
<ul>
  Brad I took a screenshot of each click of the clipping plane slider, from left
  to right, and took a snapshot of it (you can see its position)<br>
  I wanted to upload the images but seems @home wont let me upload at the
  momment... *sigh*<br>
  I also included a picture from the front of Felwithe that shows the entrace to
  the city, but the horizon is mostly sky, cause the clipping plane cant go far
  enough. Before the bug, I used to be able to see a good chunk of the town and
  NO blue sky at the horizon.<br>
  Since my server is down, would you like me to zip them up and email them to
  you?<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Darkmatter: The slider works fine up until that 75% or so point -- I was
  watching both the display that showed what the clipping distance is in feet as
  well as the view in the 3D window.<br>
  Am I positive that when it says 1800 feet Im really seeing 1800 feet? *shrug*
  As much as I can be -- the number is really just relative (virtual feet).<br>
  <br>
  Is it possible that when some weather/fog bugs were looked at that all zones
  clips were reduced a percentage, but I doubt it. I will ask the programmer to
  look at that again.<br>
  <br>
  I really think that having the live team go through and make sure the max_clip
  is set to as far as one can physically see in the zone (based on the exported
  zone maximum) is the best solution. Then, as long as you can move the slider
  to the right and eventually your clients clip is the same as the maximum clip
  for the zone, everything should be fine.<br>
  <br>
  -Brad</i></b>
</ul>
And heres the third and final volley of posts:
<ul>
  Oh while I was watching the rain for 30 minutes while I was making my first
  set of screenshots I had an idea.<br>
  Instead of having superlow visibility for all rain, why not have it random.<br>
  <br>
  Rainstorms arent always hurricanes.<br>
  <br>
  You could have it randomly pick how far the clipping plane is brought in, and
  how hazy it is, and if there was lightning, so you could reproduce a light
  shower.<br>
  You could also alter the ammount of light coming in, and the actual rain
  grafics so it could be raining more, or less. Maybe even at an angle to
  represent the wind blowing it. Rain should also be seen farther out in the
  distance, as it is now, the rain is almost totally 2D. (Actually I think it IS
  2D. :P)<br>
  <br>
  And, a cool thing, would be rarely, a really BAD storm where visibility was
  done to near 0, and rain came down hard, and light was really reduced. But
  this would have to be really rare or would kinda hamper the gameplay.<br>
  <br>
  Obviously not a high priority issue but I think it would add to the game.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Darkmatter:<br>
  When I move the slider bar (or hit the + key) it tells me something like:
  current clip: 500 max clip: 1800. Then, when I move it to about 75% it tells
  me current 1800 and max 1800 and then it stays at that from 75% to 100%.
  (which is obviously a bug -- the slider reads 75% but is really at 100%).<br>
  <br>
  When the max_clips are moved up on Test we will tell you. I will also ask the
  client programmer to let all players know current and max clip values (like
  our special client tells us now).<br>
  <br>
  Your rain ideas are great, and we could possibly randomize the fog distance
  when raining a little, but not much. The rain drops in EQ are actually
  polygonal particles, and if you could see very far while it rained your frame
  rate would approach zero because of all the particles that would be drawn :(<br>
