Assurance - Bugs/Testing</a> board:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum49/HTML/000002.html"><b>Welcome
    to the Bug Board</b></a><br>
    Welcome to the Bug Board. Please let me introduce you to the procedures and
    rules we have here. This board is tightly moderated. This means that no
    ranting, foul language or personal attacks will be tolerated under any
    circumstances. The purpose for this board is for you to give us information
    about bugs in the game, and for us to give you feedback on those bugs.
    <p>I want to make this very clear in the beginning. Any posts that are
    inappropriate will be deleted. If you want to complain there are other
    forums to do so, this is not the place. We are only interested in bugs.
    <p>First let me define what a bug is. A bug is an error in the intended
    workings of the game. It is a quest not working, an NPC not spawning, it is
    a misspelling of something an NPC says, or some other mechanical feature
    such as an item being for a gnome monk.
    <p>Next, let’s define what is not a bug. Class balance is not a bug. A
    long spawn time is not a bug. A quest not giving adequate award is not a
    bug. These are issues that certainly should be addressed, just not on this
    board.
    <p>Hobart and I will be the ones who you will hear from most often, though
    occasionally other blue names will also post. If you do not hear from us for
    a few days, it is because we’re working on the game. Unlike Abashi,
    posting is not our primary job, so please be patient.
    <p>Our goal with this board is to provide communication back to the players
    about bugs and their current status. We welcome discussion of and questions
    about bugs as long as it is constructive. We also ask that before posting a
    bug, please read through the bugs already posted to limit duplicates as
    duplicates will be deleted. You are more than welcome to add input to an
    existing thread.
    <p>When posting, in the subject please give a brief summary of the bug to
    make it easier for us to review them. Also, please give as much detail as
    possible including your server name, the location (/loc) any npc’s
    involved and quest triggers. We will ask for more information if what you
    have provided is not enough.
    <p>Finally, if the issue that you are posting about contains information
    that would be considered a large spoiler, or have great exploit potential,
    please forward the complete description via email to eqtesting@verant.com.
    Feel free to post a more general, non-spoiler/exploit, version of the bug
    here should you require some general feedback on it’s progress.
    <p>We looking forward to working with you to identify these problems so we
    can make Norrath a more enjoyable place.

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum49/HTML/000002.html"><b>About
    EsterTheTester</b></a><br>
    Let me do a personal introduction. I was GM Camii of Povar and Innoruuk, and
    I now work in the Testing department at Verant. I do attend the Monday
    Meetings and I work closely with the EQLive team in identifying and
    communicating to them the bugs we have in the game. I also work with the
    Guide program with their bug reports.
    <p>I have a strange sence of humor, but I do take these bugs seriously. I
    also tend to not have the worlds greatest spelling skills, but I promise to
    proofread every post. =)
    <p>I look forward to posting and identifying bugs in Norrath through this
    board.

    more Bunker Battle Blades to spare must be an indicator that the quest is
    currently not operational. After turning in the four pads, received generic

    <p>Ill have someone look at this quest, it may fall under the unfinished
    catagory, but if it is I will make sure it is noted as such.

    used an AoE spell, I could understand if the &quot;fallout&quot; hit
    something on the ground, but Ive seen it when the player is not even
    fighting when attacked.]</i></font>
    <p>Youre not going to like this reply. Because of the way things work (and
    please dont ask me specifics) that is one of those wonderful features. As a
    GM I would say that the Gods grant NPCs powers that the mere mortals do not
    possess.

    <p>Wow you guys read my mind. I tested that quest YESTERDAY and no they dont
    give you anything. It is officially not done but has been handed to the dev
    team to finish.

    <p>Well first off the slash for 32000 damage message was taken out, so it
    actually might be killing itself. The water may also have something to do
    with it. I will look into it (be prepared to hear that a lot) and see what
    we can come up with.

    <p>Ok, I have a few suggestions. These are not guarenteed to fix the
    problem, but they seem to help. Try underclocking your viedo card. We find
    that the extra heat generated by the card working harder in Kunark is
    causing some systems to crash.If that doesnt work, tech support is your best
    bet, my experience at technical things is sorely limited.

    &quot;Thanks&quot;, etc.]</i></font>
    <p>There are two types of Legionnaire Shoulderpads. Unfortunately there is
    not space on the item to tell you which pad it is. One set comes from
    Crushbone, the other from around Freeport. The best way to ensure that you
    are doing the correct one is to go and kill the mobs yourself.

    /locs are what we need with pathing problems. some of these can be fixed,
    some really cant. However with /locs I will forward them to our pathing

    to ask that, but I cant get a response with any combination of the above
    bracketed answer.]</i></font>
    <p>Ok this one personally bugs me. It is Known which means that we know it
    doesnt work, and we have sent it up to the dev team that it doesnt work.
    Also, that is exactly what we need to track these things down. We do know
    quite a few of the quests, but not all of them. Thanks!!!

    banker is a rogue and now i am kos with him due to to many quests for the
    lanze axe of the wolves]</i></font>
    <p>Ok here is my favorite answer ... I have absolutely no idea if there are
    any quests which raise that faction. What I can do is bring that up with the
    dev guys. No promises that such a quest would be easy, and for all I know
    one already exists, but I can look into it.

    a player is killed in PvP(Duel or in the Rallos Zek enviroment) then anyone
    can loot the corpse, not just the person or group who made the kill.]</i></font>
    <p>Nope, this one is not a bug. I brought it up with one of the programmers
    and it is a feature.
    <p>Sorry!!!

    smithing attempt supposed to eat the geozite tool upon failure? It returns
    PLANS if you fail, but the tool vanishes.]</i></font>
    <p>This one is not a bug, but may be a tuning issue. As things are set it is
    supposed to do this, should it do that? That is a dev question =)

    dead form was &quot;fixed&quot;.]</i></font>
    <p>Checked the Grimrot spawn today. It is difficult to get him to spawn but
    he DOES spawn. This one might require a trick though =)

  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum49/HTML/000004.html"><b>Clipping
    Plane Bug</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: The clipping plane bug.
    Theres a great thread on the gameplay board with info on this bug. ]</i></font>
    <p>Clipping plane is very low priority. It DOES work but not to its full
    potential. Here I get to give the dreaded its being looked at answer that
    everyone hates.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum49/HTML/000004.html"><b>Sound

    is distorted and the volumes are not correct. I myself have this problem and

    <p>Sound is a very high priority. One of our programmers spends most of his
    time working on fixing these issues. Unfortunately it is a lot more
    difficult than it sounds but know that it is actively being looked at and
    worked on.

    <p>Code has been done to fix this problem, or at least some instances of
    this problem. I am not sure which patch it will go in on (Abashi will let
    you guys know) but it should be soon(tm)
