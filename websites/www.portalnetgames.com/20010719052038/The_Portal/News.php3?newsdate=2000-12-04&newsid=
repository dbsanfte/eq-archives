<ul>
 <p><b>Sense and Disarm Traps<br>
 </b><br>
 In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps,<br>
 have gained the ability to sense them as well. Since we are aware that some<br>
 may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br>
 being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br>
 without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br>
 crossed a zone boundary.<br>
 <br>
 These skills now have use within Velious. There are traps, and they range<br>
 from annoying to deadly throughout Velious. They are invisible and can only<br>
 be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.<br>
 <br>
 Use “Sense Traps” to see if there are any traps in the vicinity. If so, you<br>
 can then use “Disarm traps” to try and disarm the trap. Once disarmed, the<br>
 trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br>
 your group passes through the area.<br>
 <br>
 If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br>
 directed towards the closest one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Corpse Dragging in Velious<br>
 </b><br>
 Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a<br>
 situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in<br>
 someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence<br>
 or risk. As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse<br>
 is considered “assisting the enemy” by the inhabitants of the area. They<br>
 will react accordingly.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Same Resolution Looting, Trading, Inspection, and Inventory (Velious Only)<br>
 </b><br>
 Previously, when looting, trading, or viewing inventory, the screen would<br>
 switch to a lower resolution mode (that small UI in the center if you are at<br>
 resolutions above 640x480). Now, if you are in resolutions above 640x480,<br>
 nearly all functions take place in the higher resolution mode. Functions<br>
 that currently do not take place in the higher resolution mode will do so in<br>
 the near future.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Experience Bar Enhancement<br>
 </b><br>
 Players will notice a blue line in their experience bar in addition to the<br>
 bars. The blue line is a “macroview” of each bubble of experience. The<br>
 blue line will fill the entire experience bar for each for each bubble of<br>
 experience earned.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Interface Enhancements</b><br>
 <br>
 The User Interface features new options and screens that allow players to<br>
 remain in the “Full Screen” video mode when playing the game, rather than<br>
 switching to the lower resolution “Overlay” mode. As a result, the<br>
 additional windows superimposed on the full screen UI are greater in number<br>
 and support additional options:<br>
 <br>
 <b>Positioning<br>
 </b><br>
 Windows can now be moved to a location of your preference by clicking on the<br>
 upper left-hand corner of each window, moving it to a location of your<br>
 preference, and clicking again to set it into place. This option is set on<br>
 a “per-resolution” basis, so you can have different window positions for<br>
 each resolution.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Scaling<br>
 </b><br>
 The Chat and Spell-effect windows can be scaled in size by clicking on the<br>
 lower right-hand corner, dragging to the desired size, then clicking again<br>
 to set the option. This option is set on a “per-resolution” basis, so you<br>
 can have different window scaling for each resolution.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Enabling / Disabling Windows<br>
 </b><br>
 Each window in full screen mode can be enabled or disabled for viewing by<br>
 engaging the customizable hot-key combination for that feature and window.<br>
 The defaults are:<br>
 <br>
 ALT – B: Buff/Spell Effects Window<br>
 ALT – P: Party (Group) Window<br>
 ALT – C: Chat Window<br>
 ALT – S: Spell Gem Window<br>
 ALT – H: Hotbox Window<br>
 ALT – T: Target Window<br>
 ALT – Y: Self-Status Window<br>
 ALT – M: Menu Window<br>
 <br>
 <b>LoadArmor17 through LoadArmor22 = TRUE or FALSE (Velious Only)<br>
 </b><br>
 Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with<br>
 Velious into your video card’s texture memory. Players with older video<br>
 cards may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you<br>
 experiencing slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in<br>
 areas with many textures.<br>
 <br>
 By default, these are all set to “FALSE”, as it is possible that those with<br>
 lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all of the new<br>
 armor files. At your option, you can switch all or part of them to “TRUE”<br>
 to see the new armor. If you have problems with framerate or disk swapping,<br>
 turn all or part of them back to “FALSE”.<br>
 <br>
 As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries<br>
 if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless<br>
 you are.<br>
 <br>
 <b>[WindowColors] (Velious Only)<br>
 </b><br>
 This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons<br>
 behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode. It can be set using the<br>
 /wincolor command in game.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Pauses in Social Batches<br>
 </b><br>
 You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause<br>
 takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of<br>
 tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br>
 <br>
 For example, a social consisting of:<br>
 <br>
 /sit off<br>
 /cast 1<br>
 /pause 100<br>
 /sit on<br>
 <br>
 ...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br>
 after you’ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br>
 <br>
 Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another<br>
 social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause<br>
 command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same<br>
 line.<br>
 <br>
 For example:<br>
 <br>
 /sit off<br>
 /pause 100,/cast 1<br>
 /sit on<br>
 <br>
 ...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note<br>
 that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another,<br>
 and MUST be specified first on the line.<br>
 <br>
