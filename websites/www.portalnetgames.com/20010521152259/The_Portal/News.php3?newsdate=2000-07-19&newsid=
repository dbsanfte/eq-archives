      <br>
      ***Patch Day***<br>
      <br>
      *Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*<br>
      <br>
      - The &quot;Safe Points&quot; have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of
      Ill Omen to someplace &quot;safer&quot;.<br>
      - You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.<br>
      - Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity
      filter.<br>
      - Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked
      doors.<br>
      - Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against
      non-moving, non-rooted targets. These restrictions allowed us to enhance
      archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>
      - Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was
      intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>
      - Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast &quot;Gate&quot;.<br>
      - A large rat says, &quot;Hit by non-melee for XXX damage&quot;, is
      history. The new message given probably isnt the source of never-ending
      humor that the old one was.<br>
      - Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>
      - Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.<br>
      - Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons. Take care to
      take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new
      gems/icons.<br>
      <br>
      *Poison*<br>
      <br>
      - Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>
      - Increased Rogue &quot;Make Poison&quot; skill cap.<br>
      - Substantially reduced chance to fail &quot;Apply Poison&quot;.<br>
      - Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>
      - Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br>
      <br>
      *General Crafts*<br>
      <br>
      - The Ants Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>
      - The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>
      - The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be
      crafted.<br>
      - The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>
      - Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>
      - The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>
      - The &quot;This item is trivial...&quot; message in craft skills has been
      replaced with &quot;You can no longer advance in skill from making this
      item&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      *Items*<br>
      <br>
      - The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>
      - The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the
      player.<br>
      - Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>
      - There was evidently more than one &quot;Fine Steel Dagger&quot; running
      around in the world. Some of them have been renamed &quot;Serpants
      Tooth&quot;.<br>
      - The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something
      a bit more useful.<br>
      - The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time. The function of
      its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a
      buff.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      */consent*<br>
      <br>
      Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to
      disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two
      seconds. Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report. Also,
      please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be
      two seconds before you can undo it.<br>
      <br>
      *Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*<br>
      <br>
      There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and
      Cazic-Thule. Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you
      alone. The significant upside to this change is that the &quot;Cazic
      Gate/Portal&quot; can be made much safer in nature for those who work on
      their faction.<br>
      <br>
      *Regen Effects*<br>
      <br>
      This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g.
      Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells. As a
      result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell
      while under the effect of a DOT. However, if the regen spell is already in
      place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell. This will
      allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using
      their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br>
      <br>
      *Keyed Dungeons*<br>
      <br>
      The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message
      from a couple of weeks ago. Furthermore, when your character dies, keys
      for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshans Peak, will no longer remain with your
      corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point. We
      made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of
      these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br>
      <br>
      *Barbed Scale Whip*<br>
      <br>
      In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to
      something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already
      in-game. It has been changed back to its original stats.<br>
      <br>
      *Hiding Corpses*<br>
      <br>
      A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client. This command
      (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC
      corpses on the screen. This can be very useful once youve entered a zone
      with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay. It will be
      particularly useful in the planes. The command supports the following
      arguments:<br>
      <br>
      - ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>
      - ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your
      group.<br>
      - NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br>
      <br>
      For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone,
      and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone. You can reset
      it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since
      you originally set it.<br>
      <br>
      *Resurrection*<br>
      <br>
      The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person
      casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. Furthermore,
      experience will not be &quot;removed&quot; from your corpse until you
      accept the resurrection by choosing YES. Previously, any resurrection
      spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br>
