  <b>*Emergency Patch*</b><br>
  <br>
  Due to the problems encountered in yesterdays patch, some additional data has
  been moved to the live servers today. As part of this patch, three new changes
  are included:<br>
  <br>
  - /Consent no longer gives other players permission to loot your corpse.
  Instead, it only gives them the ability to drag your corpse using the /corpse
  command. This change is due to player request stemming from number of customer
  service issues raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to
  steal the belongings of other players. The change will eliminate those
  concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>
  - Yesterdays patch changed the way spell-damage messages are reported to the
  caster. The new text was dark blue, making it hard to distinguish from the
  background when in HUD mode. The text color has been changed to
  &quot;yellow&quot; due to player request.<br>
  - Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless the winner of
  the duel is over 10th level. This should greatly reduce the number of duels
  with inappropriate names that have been occurring in the game.<br>
  <br>
  We would like to apologize to everyone for the problems stemming from
  yesterdays patch, and let you know that we have taken steps to greatly reduce
  the possibility that something of that nature could happen in the future.<br>
  <br>

    Im not sure what items your guild has, however, it was the end result of

    Most of the quests in the Plane of Sky have yet to be completed, so the

    afternoon rounds for posting on the boards and Ive seen no response to what

    <br>
    Namely, the bug with the loot tables and foraging last night. The worst
    thing to do is to leave us in the dark about this. It has been okay for us
    to debate it this morning while Im sure you had many other things going on

    What is Verants current stance on what happened? We know there was a loot
    bug, we know it has happened before, we have heard rumors of the scope of
    this problem (large and disturbing), and heard rumors that no corrective
    action is planned by Verant to restore the state of the game prior to the
    &quot;incident&quot;. Does/has Verant taken any action to correct this? What
    would really help is some solid facts, and those are only going to come from
    one person. You.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue.<br>
    <br>
    The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In
    addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available
    within the zone, not just random in nature. Its not like level 60 gear was
    showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone
    where the equipment was found normally.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback,
    the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss
    of experinece and play time, weve decided not to pursue it further.<br>
    <br>
    We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.<br>

    No, I stated that it wouldnt be in this patch, but the one after that, with

    But as long as this came up, I should probably clarify that it will be in
    the next client patch. Well probably be patching the servers again either
    today or tomorrow, but this stuff is part of the client.</li>

    the total of group damages (if you dont believe me i post you logs). ]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    Even if true, it only puts the class a few percentage points below an equal
    contrabution. Of course, equality in damage dealt isnt a goal when in a
    group. I doubt that a group would expect a bard, for instance, to even do
    that much damage. Overall it depends on the makeup of a group.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We dont have decent
    Kunark weapons.]</i></font><br>
    <br>
    I guess thats subjective. Theres definitely some good paladin weapons out
    there, and your skill with them is nearly equal to that of a warrior.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We take more xp than

    <br>
    Depends on what the other classes are. Also remember that race figures into
    the formula as well. Anyone who groups with an ogre or troll warrior
    shouldnt disparage, for instance, a human paladin.<br>

    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: We are not done for

    But you can certainly take damage, decrease the groups downtime, and perhaps
    you also have a good reputation and personality, which are the primary
    factors that determine who gets into a group.<br>

    Thanks for the note. This is the first post Ive seen where someone noticed
    that he resurrection problem had been fixed to the level that was suggested.
    Not only do we keep experience from being lost until you agree to the Res,
    but we also tell you whos casting it and what they are casting. Both of

    <br>
    Im not sure what you mean by &quot;say no now, say yes later&quot;, are you
    referring to the dragging, or where the resurrection issue wasnt considered
    a bug? Our &quot;Vision&quot; must be somewhat flexible due to constant
    changes and new content thats put into the game. Theres only a relatively
    small number of issues that we are absolutely firm on. The others take the
    form of there being &quot;no short term plan&quot; to implement a particular

    Theres no problem with the amount of damage being done by monks at this

    That would be cool, but we probably wouldnt attach a particle effect to a

    The classes in PvP werent setup so that theyd be equal. Perhaps you might
    not stand a chance in one-on-one combat in PvP (Im not an experienced

    <br>
    The way the illusion spells are currently set up doesnt rob you of the

    Cant really do that without affecting the PvE aspect of the game, so its not

    Since I notice that a number of threads are popping up on the subject, I
    thought Id address the issue here:<br>
    <br>
    The change really only affects those who were using the helm for healing. I
    think that its fairly obvious that the helm was intended as a buff, rather
    than a way to heal. Whens the last time you saw a cleric healing someone
    with Daring?<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, we considered replacing the spell effect with one that increased
    MaxHP but not current HP (thus removing the &quot;healing&quot; affect), but
    decided that increasing the casting time should address the main part of the
    problem. We will, however, leave this option open as a possibility.<br>

    <br>
    Actually our playerbase is up since it came out. Max users at peak dropped a
    little under 10 percent for the first few days than began rising again once
    people had checked out the game. Total number playing in any 24 hour period
    is up due to the number of new users from Europe.<br>
    <br>
    The changes that we have been making has been due to the fact that weve had
    the opportunity to step back and seriously analyse some of the things that
    were doing. We also had some personnel shifts that bolstered the EQ Live
    team.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, were improving things not because of influence from some
    external source, but rather because we just want our customers to be happy.<br>

    the Deal with Regen Effects?</b></a><br>
    Players were using the bug, where regen spells overwrote DOTs, as an
    entrypoint into another bug that allowed stacking of regen spells that
    shouldnt stack. The work-around is a little bit cumbersome due to
    limitations in the way spell-stacking works.</li>

  Gorden started a post responding to player requests. Here it is:
  <p><i>Hello all,<br>
  <br>
  Many people have suggested over the past few months that we should implement a
  version of the /consent command to give people the option to drag a corpse
  (via /corpse) rather than loot it, due to the amount of item theft that takes
  place. As you know, we previously ruled out such an option for various
  reasons, not the least of which were technical limitations.<br>
  <br>
  After considering issue for some time, and taking into account the
  customer-service issues created by those who loot corpses and steal items
  under the guise of /consent, weve decided that a change to its operation is
  warranted. In the next patch, /consent will be changed to give permission to
  drag the corpse only, not to loot it. Other people will not be able to loot
  your corpse.<br>
  <br>
  Though we realize that some will miss the ability to /consent in the previous
  fashion, the proliferation of NODROP items in game has made asking someone
  else to loot your corpse a very infrequent event. Given the ability to do one
  or the other, consent for loot, or consent for drag, we believe that most
  people would prefer the option to /consent for drag.<br>
  <br>
  We hope that this change will address everyones concerns by eliminating the
  amount of antisocial conduct that surrounds corpse looting.<br>
