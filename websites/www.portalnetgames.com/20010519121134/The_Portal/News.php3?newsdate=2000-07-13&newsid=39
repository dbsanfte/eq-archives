this afternoon:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061327.html"><b>Shaman
    &amp; Foraging</b></a><br>
    Sometimes we have to limit what races or classes can do for the purpose of
    creating interdependance. For instance, theres no *real world* reason why
    even a wizard shouldnt be able to pick up a sword and use it, yet we dont
    allow them to wield them in game.
    <p>There are many skills in game for which there is &quot;no reason&quot;
    why some other race or class cannot use them other than for gameplay
    reasons.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061315.html"><b>Mage
    Pet Gating</b></a><br>
    Its only one pet that gates, the mage 50+ fire pet which is actually a
    wizard. It probably shouldnt gate. Ive asked the programmer to take a look
    at this.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061257.html"><b>Quests</b></a><br>
    There are many different types of quests in game. I am sure that some, in
    the &quot;average players&quot; opinion require &quot;hours of
    camping&quot;, however others do not. One can choose whether or not they
    wish to take on those quests. Quests, like many other facets of the game,
    cannot be designed in a fashion such that every quests is suitable to every
    persons particular situation. Some will be completable by people with only a
    few hours at a time to invest, others will require more time.
    <p>Well continue putting quests of all types in regularly.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061105.html"><b>Aggro
    Range Higher While Sitting/Looting</b></a><br>
    Ive always felt that it was a nice touch. Creature &quot;x&quot; is too
    afraid of you to risk a conflict while you are alert, however decides that
    he might take a poke at you if you turn your back.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061104.html"><b>Sneak
    &amp; Hide Skills</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: I dont think that this
    is fair. If you guys dont want rogues to be invisble to everything, atleast
    make it so we are able to tell what is really scowling.]</i></font>
    <p>Only creatures that have faction that determine what they will and will
    not attack give messages in /con indicating if they do or do not see you.
    Some things in the game will attack anyone, regardless of faction, and these
    things are always &quot;scowling&quot;. If you check hill giants while invis
    youll see the same issue. Its working as designed.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061089.html"><b>Iksar
    High-level Armor</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post:Just wanted to state
    again that I would like to see some high level quest armors for
    Iksar(warriors and shadow knight especially) put into EQ. It is called
    Everquest after all, but what is a high level Iksar Shadow Knight going to
    quest for, he cant wear Umbral, heck he cant even wear darkforge.]</i></font>
    <p>Weve spoken about this issue internally and agree that it is something
    that we need to work on in the near future. Ill be sure to let everyone know
    when we have some firm plans.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061052.html"><b>Meditation</b></a><br>
    Originally the idea was, from a roleplay perspective, that meditiation
    should take some concentration, which is why the spell book covered the
    screen to begin with. You werent even able to talk while medding in the
    beginning. Later, we decided to remove the requirement to look at the
    spellbook upon reaching level 35.
    <p>As it is now, the plans are for it to remain an advantage of reaching the
    higher levels.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059252.html"><b>GM
    &quot;Test of ____&quot; Events</b></a><br>
    The &quot;Tests&quot; are being revamped due to information garnered in the
    previous tests on various servers. Soon, there will be seperate
    &quot;Tests&quot; for each class. In addition, the entry fee will probably
    be lowered in most cases. Well release further information when we are able.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><a href><b>Pet Problems</b></a><br>
    <font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Fire pet: pretty useless
    as it is casting aeria dds, dispells and gate.]</i></font>
    <p>It probably shouldnt be casting gate. Ill see if I can get that
    addressed.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: Earth pet: root was
    broken, but seems to be fixed already (correct me if Im wrong)]</i></font>
    <p>The fix for this should be live.
    <p><font color="#072876"><i>[Quote from original post: All pets: Not strong
    enough (I do not know if necro pets are better, some say yes, I hope someone
    tested it and can reply if thats true)]</i></font>
    <p>We disagree that there is any problem with the stregth of the pets. They
    are absolutely as strong as we want any pets to be.
    <p>As for DD spells, the magician class is appropriately balanced. Doing
    anything additional for the class would overpower them. Concerning summons,
    theres really nothing else that we could have summoned that wouldnt step on
    the toes of another class, thus reducing class interdependance.</p>
