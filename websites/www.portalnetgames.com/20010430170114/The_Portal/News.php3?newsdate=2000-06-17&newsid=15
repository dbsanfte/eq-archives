<p>The following is an excerpt from a post on the technical support board. It
draws attention to Verant customer service issues.</p>
<p>I found the attached email response from Verant to be pretty damned rude. After almost two months of frustration, I thought I was being diplomatic and polite with my inquiry to Verant. I find the attached Verant response to be highly
inflammatory.<br>
Basically the situation boils down to this:<br>
- Hundreds of us have been paying a monthly fee for a game which is currently unplayable due to no fault of our own.<br>
- Verant support is unreachable on the phone, and can offer no real support when they do answer.<br>
- Verant does not respond on their Tech Support message board.<br>
- I send a very polite and patient inquiry to their email account.<br>
- Their response is basically, &quot;heres how to cancel your account if youre not happy."<br>
<br>
I like the game. I dont want to cancel. Id just like some kind of remedy, or at least acknowledgement that there is a mystery problem that afflicts many of us that they have been unable to solve.<br>

You can cancel your subscription by going into the EverQuest game&nbsp;<br>
client<br>
and clicking "Account" and then "Cancel Account". All subscription<br>
cancellation requests become effective at the end of your current<br>
subscription cycle (i.e. at the end of your 3-Month subscription). You<br>
will still have access to EverQuest until your current subscription<br>
expires. Our policy is NOT to give refunds for subscriptions you have<br>
already purchased.<br>

Original message follows:<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
I understand that Sony/Verant is well aware of the<br>
crashing problem that has plagued many of us for the<br>
past 6 weeks or so. Personally, my severe crashing<br>
problems started with the April 21 patch. Since then<br>
I have been unable to stay online consistently for<br>
more than 10 minutes at a time before crashing to the<br>
desktop. (Quite often resulting in character death;<br>
either mine, my groupmates, or both.)<br>
<br>
I would like to continue to play EQ. I have not yet<br>
cancelled my account. I keep four active characters,<br>
three 25+ and one pegged at the end of 50th. I<br>
purchased Kunark the day it became available for<br>
online purchase. Someday I hope to actually explore<br>
it. I genuinely enjoy the game... when Im able to<br>
play.<br>
<br>
Since the crashing started on April 21 I have<br>
re-installed EQ several times, updated all my drivers,<br>
formatted my HD and installed everything from scratch,<br>
updated drivers again, replaced my soundcard, tried<br>
good a good old analog connection (instead of DSL),<br>
modified every BIOS option available, delete all the<br>
EQ *.rmi (or whatever) files, and just about<br>
everything else I or anyone else could think of. This<br>
is an EQ problem. Its not a problem with my system,<br>
although my configuration clearly has everything to do<br>
with it.<br>
<br>
I am losing hope that the EQ team will locate this bug<br>
anytime soon. I also believe that the few thousand or<br>
so of us having this problem are not a significant<br>
enough number to drive further attention. (Impossible<br>
to say how many of us there are, but surely less than<br>
5% of the active subscribers.)<br>
<br>
The only reasonable request I can think to make is<br>
that my account be credited for the time that the game<br>
has been unplayable to me. Right now that stands at<br>
6+ weeks. Im not asking for a cash refund, but a<br>
credit to use against next months charges or<br>
something. I recognize that Sony/Verant can not do<br>
this for everyone that calls with a problem, but this<br>
has been a known issue that has afflicted numerous<br>
people for a prolonged period.<br>
<br>
This by no means makes us (the afflicted) whole. Most<br>
importantly it doesnt remedy the fact that weve missed<br>
out on a dozen levels or so. It doesnt let me group<br>
with my friends who are now upper 30s while Im stuck<br>
at mid 20s. That cant be fixed, and we will all<br>
live with it. New friends will be met, and eventually<br>
we will catch up to our old ones. Provided we stay<br>
the course and wait for a fix. But in the absence of<br>
credit for multiple weeks of unplayable time, Im not<br>
sure how long were willing to wait. Personally, I<br>
know my time is drawing to an end. $9.89 a month<br>
isnt THAT much, but it adds up. To both you and to<br>
us.<br>
