Turns out
Verant is once again taking a heavy handed tactic to 3rd party add ons or enhancements
to the EverQuest game.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">PC Gamer, Vol. 7, No. 12, December 2000 brings
us another example of Verant and Sonys seeming inability to work with its base
of EverQuest fans. Most of us at The Portal have been in the gamming business
for many years. We have seen games that have become huge successes by adopting
and supporting player created Mods and enhancements (anybody heard of Quake or
Half-Life). By getting the player involved in a game, become an active part of
the gaming process and game can be expanded and improved in innumerable ways. Unfortunately,
not only does Verant not see it that way, there approach to gamer dedication is
to sick a lawyer on the fan.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">PC Gamer reports what happened to Ben Ziegler.
Ben is a rabid fan of EverQuest, like so many of us. Ben got to thinking, what
can I do to try to make EverQuets a better game. More to the point, Ben decided
to write a program that made many of the more mundane aspect of the game a bit
easier and generally improve the playability of EverQuest. By late March of this
year, he released a utility called EQ Macros.</font> <font size="3" color="#FFFF99">EQ
Macros is a batch of goodies that includes a slew of new features to make
EverQuest more enjoyable. It includes sought after features like an on screen
map, a compass, the ability to record macros and set waypoints.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">It turned out to be a pretty nifty package,
given that as many as 4000 people have downloaded it and as many as 900 have
registered the program. He recevied, PC Gamer reports, loads of e-mail from
other fans telling how they loved the utilities and it features.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">Well, it&nbsp;</font><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">
did not take Verant long to notice this nifty program and take a look at it. A
few hours after Gordon Wrinn, Verant Customer Service, had looked at it, Ben receives
a letter from John Smedley, Verants CEO, asking him to stop all work on EQ
Macros. PC Gamer reports the letter stated &quot;I have recently seen your EQ
Macro program and I am going to have to ask you to stop distributing it. It is a
direct violation of our terms of service and any person caught using it will be
banned.&quot; Ben Ziegler repled to the email proposing that they work together
to modify EQ Macros to make it acceptable to Verant. Smedley never responded,
instead Ziegler was slapped with a cease and desist order by Andy Zaffron, Vice
President and General Counsel for Sony Online Entertainment.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">Ziegler quickly defended himself, saying that
EQ Macros is not a malicious program. It does not let the player do anything
that a user cannot already do (it just makes it easier). Many fans of the
program have already flocked to his defense. PC Gamer reports that one user
wrote to Verant saying &quot;EQ Macros is really doing nothing a user cant do
for themselves. Online mapping - I can go to any website and print out a map;
updated location info - I can repeatedly hit the loc button. The list goes
on.&quot; For each feature in EQ Macros there is a corresponding way for a
player to do the same thing without it. Ziegler points out that when Sony first
looked at the program, they said that the use of macros was ok, as long as you
were physically in front of the computer to use it. PC Gamer reports he also
wants to make it clear that he is willing to tweak his program in any way that
Verant wants to, to keep it in use by EQ players. His offer of full cooperation
has only been met by one response: Cease and Desist.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">For now, EQ Macros is on hiatus. Ben has
retained a lawyer and is preparing to provide an official response to Verant
over the issue. Verant continues to remain firm on their no-nonsense policy
against EQ Macros.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">This is a sad blow for those of us that enjoy
gaming. EverQuest is a great game, one of the best currently of this new genre. Unfortunately
its owner, may very well kill their own success with this type of belligerent
attitude towards the same player base that makes the game a success. This
reminds me of a similar situation in the days of Ultima. In that instance,
Origin initially came down hard on a series of third party utility programs,
they generally labeled as &quot;cheat&quot; programs. Eventually, guidelines
were established and several utilities approved. We can only hope Verant will
understand that it is the customer paying the bill and take advantage of the
creativity and talent of EverQuest fans. If not, I suspect we will have many
options to choose from as more vendors jump into this new and rapidly developing
genre of computer gaming.</font></p>
