  EVERYTHING HERE IS SIMPLY MY IMPRESSION from what I<br>
  was told by Verant employees. I do not guarantee the<br>
  authenticity of either the information I received, nor<br>
  do I take responsibility for my own, potentially<br>
  erroneous interpretation of any aspect of Luclin that<br>
  they discussed with me. I was told that Luclin is<br>
  still very far from release and many details have not<br>
  been finalized. I would not be at all surprised if<br>
  many of the features/details I mention below change<br>
  before Luclin is released.<br>
  <br>
  Onto the info:<br>
  <br>
  * The Beastlord class will be heavily pet dependent and<br>
  will probably, at the highest levels, create a pet<br>
  that is at least 10 levels lower than your character.<br>
  On the other hand, the Beastlord will have a variety<br>
  of buffs that will work only on his own pet (though<br>
  he will have other buffs that can be used on other<br>
  characters/pets) which could effectively increase<br>
  the capability of the pet by a factor of 10 levels or<br>
  more.<br>
  <br>
  When I mentioned that this would cause problems with<br>
  aggro (i.e. low level pets causing everything green<br>
  to jump it) I was told that aggro is being redesigned<br>
  to take buffs and overall strengths of the pet into<br>
  consideration.<br>
  <br>
  * Beastlord pets quite possibly will not be able to<br>
  persist through zoning due to the unusually large<br>
  difficulty of getting npcs to zone.<br>
  <br>
  * Expect some aspects of Beastlords to be very similar<br>
  to existing hybrids, except with Shaman spells.<br>
  (At the same time I heard someone say that theyll<br>
  be totally different from hybrids with a lot of<br>
  unique spells, and more of a pet class, so Im not<br>
  sure theyre too solid on this.)<br>
  <br>
  * Beastlord pets will be unique and will not be the<br>
  same as Shaman pets, or any other pets currently<br>
  in the game. The pet selection will vary depending<br>
  on the race of the Beastlord.<br>
  <br>
  * The Bazaar zone will be in a central city located<br>
  on Luclin that is neutral to all races. The city<br>
  itself will be bordered by four different dungeons.<br>
  <br>
  The Bazaar will feature a variety of named and<br>
  differently colored tents to make it easy to tell<br>
  players where you will be meeting them, and will<br>
  feature a bank. Additionally, the city will be, or<br>
  be right next to, the primary entry point for<br>
  Luclin, to make getting there convenient.<br>
  <br>
  * Similar to Velious, there probably wont be any<br>
  factions that are correlated with factions in<br>
  the rest of Norrath, with the possible exception<br>
  of Kerran/Var Shir (since they are related.)<br>
  This is because Luclin has been cut off from<br>
  the rest of Norrath for quite some time.<br>
  <br>
  * You will be able to play from level 1 to level<br>
  60 without ever leaving Luclin.<br>
  <br>
  * It is quite probable that existing characters<br>
  will be given a one-time-only option to pick<br>
  a new face when Luclin is released.<br>
  <br>
  * On a somewhat related note, Var Shir (Kerran)<br>
  models will not only feature different faces,<br>
  but entirely different matching skin patterns. In<br>
  addition to the tiger Var Shir pictured in<br>
  the E3 screenshots, there may be black panther<br>
  Var Shir, lions, leopards, etc.<br>
  <br>
  * I asked about the alternative character<br>
  development and was told that there would be<br>
  new skills available for characters who are<br>
  level 60. To get and increase these skills,<br>
  you will need to spend experience you get<br>
  that is over the experience you needed for<br>
  level 60. (Currently any experience you get<br>
  over level 60 isnt really important, aside<br>
  from the death penalty.) You may also be<br>
  able to spend your post-60 experience on<br>
  perks like purchasing a title (&quot;Bob the<br>
  vindicator&quot;, etc.)<br>
  <br>
  * Armor now can have its own geometry. If<br>
  you take a look at the screenshots from E3,<br>
  youll notice that human armor plates go<br>
  beyond the shoulders of the player model.<br>
  Expect to see armors that significantly<br>
  alter the appearance of a character due<br>
  to the ability to create different shaped<br>
  armor.<br>
  <br>
  * The trees in Luclin very possibly will not be<br>
  animated, as people have pointed out from the<br>
  screenshot. An artist I spoke to said that this<br>
  is due to the mostly negative reaction to having<br>
  tree animations in the previous expansions.<br>
