Mother pleads for daughter's return<br>
The Crafton Hills College student was reported missing Sept. 15, two days after she was last seen.<br>
By ANDREA FEATHERS<br>
Staff Writer<br>
REDLANDS When 18-year-old Kelly Bullwinkle got home every night, she would turn off the porch light her mother had left on for her. Now, her mother says, the porch light will stay lit until Bullwinkle, who has been missing for almost two weeks, comes home.<br>
The petite Crafton Hills College freshman was last seen on the afternoon of Saturday, Sept. 13, while she was working at Baker's Burgers on East Redlands Boulevard. Her car was later found abandoned at Ontario Mills mall in Ontario, but Bullwinkle is still missing.<br>
<br>
Investigators are still not sure whether she left voluntarily or by force.<br>
<br>
A search party consisting of family, friends, and volunteers gathered this morning at 8 a.m. at a Denny's Restaurant in Victorville near Interstate 15.<br>
<br>
Since Kelly Bullwinkle is an avid equestrian, the trainer of her horse had vowed to bring the horse, named Banner, to help with the search. <br>
<br>
The family is also looking into the procedures for getting a reward from the Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation, an organization that provides rewards for missing persons.<br>
<br>
Bullwinkle's disappearance was first reported by her roommate Sept. 15, after she had been gone for 48 hours.<br>
<br>
Diana Bullwinkle, a chief petty officer in the Coast Guard, was out of the country on assignment when she learned her daughter was missing.<br>
<br>
On Sept. 18, there was a possible break in the case when a local person told investigators that he or she had overheard an individual claim responsibility for Kelly's disappearance. While investigators have contacted the person who allegedly claimed responsibility, they have not yet determined whether or not it was true, or if it has any relevance to the case.<br>
<br>
Since her car, a Mazda Protege, was found at Ontario Mills, police have considered various possibilities in the case, including that she disappeared from Redlands or that she drove to Ontario and went missing from there.<br>
<br>
There may also have been a party at the Bullwinkle house on the 900 block of La Feliz Drive on the evening of Sept. 12 or 13, which could be a factor in her disappearance. <br>
<br>
As far as what happened that day, Diana Bullwinkle isn't sure. What she does know is that &quot;it's not like her. She's a small-framed girl, trusting.&quot; In fact, she had encouraged her daughter to take self-defense classes. At the time of her disappearance, Kelly Bullwinkle was taking a course in weight training.<br>
<br>
Police detectives have worked 12-hour shifts looking for Bullwinkle since Sept. 18, Lt. Patrick Beaver said.<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't have a crime here,&quot; Beaver said. &quot;All we have is a missing person. So we don't have much.&quot;<br>
<br>
In addition to the effort Redlands officers and investigators have put into the case, detectives in Ontario are aiding the investigation and Kelly's family has also hired a private investigator.<br>
<br>
&quot;If there's anybody that knows anything,&quot; Bullwinkle said, &quot;no matter how small they think it is, it could be important for the case.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelly had graduated from Redlands East Valley High School in June. She wants to be a writer, Bullwinkle said, but also &quot;liked a little bit of everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're just praying for her to come home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Diana Bullwinkle won't be at the search. She's staying home by the phone in case her daughter calls.<br>
<br>
Anyone with information is asked to contact detective Chris Catren at the Redlands Police Department, (909) 798-7580.<br>

<br>
==============================================<br>
Hell of a note, to be serving your country and have this happen to your daughter.<br>
<br>
Dianna has served with my wife in the USCG in various duty stations since '93. We have watched Kelly grow up into the sweet person she is today.<br>
<br>

REDLANDS — Three weeks after an 18-year-old college student disappeared, police and coroner's deputies removed a body from a shallow grave in San Timoteo Canyon on Sunday.<br>
<br>
Though police could not say if the body was that of Kelly Laurel Bullwinkle, who has been missing since Sept. 13, coroner's officials said the body is that of a &quot;young female adult.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There has been no identification made,&quot; said Capt. Tom Fitzmaurice.<br>
<br>
A relative of Kelly Bullwinkle's said late Sunday afternoon that the family was told of the discovery, however family members didn't know much.<br>
<br>
The relative said family members were holding up as best they could.<br>
<br>
A request to speak to Diana Bullwinkle, Kelly's mother, wasn't granted. A person who answered the phone at Diana Bullwinkle's home said the woman would not be accepting phone calls. <br>
<br>
Fitzmaurice said &quot;human remains,&quot; were discovered about 4 p.m. Saturday by people playing paintball in the San Timoteo Canyon area, near Alessandro Road and the railroad tracks in Redlands.<br>
<br>
The body was removed about 3 p.m. Sunday from the shallow grave in a wooden area.<br>
<br>
Fitzmaurice said the area is often frequented by people who play paintball.<br>
<br>
Kelly Bullwinkle lived in the 900 block of La Feliz Drive on the south side of town. The petite Crafton Hills College freshman was last seen at the Baker's restaurant in downtown Redlands where she had worked that day.<br>
<br>
Diana Bullwinkle, a chief petty officer and health services technician in the Coast Guard, last heard from her daughter the morning of Sept. 12 in an e-mail, in which the young woman reported she was going to study for her psychology class.<br>
<br>
The following Monday, Diana Bullwinkle got an e-mail from her daughter's roommate that Kelly Bullwinkle hadn't been home for 48 hours.<br>
<br>
She rushed home from her assignment on a ship in Central America after learning her daughter was missing.<br>
<br>
Diana Bullwinkle said her daughter was conscious of her small frame and was afraid to wonder alone. The 5-foot-1, 98-pound woman was taking weight-training classes at the college in hopes of being better able to defend herself, Diana Bullwinkle said.<br>
<br>
Officials found her 1992 Mazda Protege at Ontario Mills on Sept. 14. Ontario police have reviewed security tapes made at the mall in an attempt to develop leads about Kelly Bullwinkle's whereabouts.<br>
<br>
Fitzmaurice wouldn't say much about the recovered body, other than it would be up to the coroner's office to make an identification.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the remains are related to one of our (missing person's) cases, then we'll take it from there,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now, this is in the hands of the coroner's office for identification.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Kelly Bullwinkle is asked to call Redlands police Detective Chris Catren at (909) 798-7580. <br>

<br>
Kelly Laurel Bullwinkle <br>
REDLANDS — During the past two weeks ABC7 Eyewitness News has done a number of stories on Kelly Bullwinkle hoping she would be found alive, but the San Bernardino coroner confirmed today that the remains of a young woman that was found in San Timoteo Canyon were indeed that of the 18-year-old Kelly Bullwinkle. <br>
Bullwinkle was a recent graduate of Redlands East Valley High School and was last seen leaving her work on Sept. 13, at Baker's Burgers in downtown Redlands. <br>
<br>
Her car was found near Ontario Mills Mall on Sept. 16. Her remains were discovered less than two miles from her Redlands home. <br>
<br>
Redlands Police Chief Jim Beermann vowed to find the killer. He said, &quot;To the person who murdered Kelly Bullwinkle, for that, understand the following - there is not anyplace you can go or hide from us - we will bring you to justice.&quot; <br>
<br>
At one point the Chief read a statement from Kelly's mother. <br>
<br>
It said, &quot;We would like to thank everyone for their prayers and warm condolences - we cannot begin to express the anguish and loss were are feeling - she was a wonderful daughter, granddaughter, niece and friend.&quot; <br>
<br>
There is a reward fund established for the information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer. <br>
<br>
A number of individuals from the community came forward offering to contribute funds towards a reward for information leading to the conviction of that person or those people involved in this crime. According to Redlands Mayor, that reward includes amounts committed by the Redlands City Council. The amount of the reward stands at $10,000. <br>
<br>
Authorities are asking for the public's help in finding the killer(s). They say she was killed shortly after she was last seen. <br>
=============================================<br>
I know Kelly is in a much better place now. I can't believe that someone could hurt such a sweet girl like Kelly.<br>
