See I found a book about a place called Angry land or Annoyed land, I’m not certain of how to translate it. Anyway, there was a picture that looked a lot like Frazz and the description said something about dressing in bright colors and being obsessed with pots of gold, they are supposed to be irritable (that should be obvious since they come from Angry land) and quite vicious when provoked.  The fact that he is a leprechaun is okay by me, although truthfully I was hoping he would admit to being a Viking instead of claiming to be an Enchanter. Sometime his blind acceptance of our cultures force feed roles and dogma bothers me, but I am sure sooner or later I will convince him of the truth. Hmmm I wonder how he will react when I tell him he is a leprechaun.  Humph, he’ll likely just claim I am dream like when he dreams about being Crathsor the Troll Warrior, yeah as if,  I mean hell he is shorter then me, troll warrior my eye.  Oh my I have been so excited about my discovery I have forgotten that some readers my not know who I am! Allow me to introduce myself.  <br>
<br>
I am Figin Newton (well I will, be once I convince the elders to allow me a last name) and I am the greatest Gnome Viking Poet ever. Well maybe Viking painter I’m not sure writing is my true calling. I know what you’re thinking, what the hell is a Viking, right? I’ll tell you what I know. I found a book in the library when I studying about summoning, (My dad made me go to magician school, but that is another story) so there I was and I found this book and the guy on the cover looked just like me! The more I read the more certain I became that I was indeed a Viking. They like to pillage and plunder and so do I.  They are fearless and used boats a lot, only a few things scare me and boats sound like fun but I have never seen one.  They have some neat sounding gods, not like the old boring ones mom is always yacking about. But the big kicker was that they had bloodlust just like me! A lot of the book was smudged and the librarian tried to convince me it had be misplaced and belong in the fiction section, but I know destiny when I see it, fate brought me this book, (and I did not steal it, the librarian just let me check it out permanently).  Man, it just occurred to me you may not know about bloodlust either! Hehehe, I remember when Frazz was explaining it to me, we meet in channeling 101 did you know that? No, of course you did not how could you? Sorry, I am supposed to be telling you a little story to explain Bloodlust.  One day Frazz and I where out pillaging and plundering the local fauna, and we ran in to a particularly strong Mino.  Me, Frazz and our pets where all pretty tired because we had just hacked up a bunch other victims.  Despite our efforts the pets went down, (by the way, my water pet, if you give him a Mino horn and a weapon looks like the very embodiment of Viking hood), I was out of mana so I sat down to think while Frazz slashed away at the beast.  I was deep in thought when I heard a grunt, and as I looked up I saw Frazz fall before the Mino! Well nobody does that to my friends (well the do but I try to make ‘em pay for it) so I leap up and unleash my Shock of Blades on that bastard and he promptly dies.  As I feel to my knees with a true Viking roar of anguish building inside me, up pops Frazz all excited because while he lay on the ground, for the 12th time in his life he felt the surge of power that can only be bloodlust and now he was certain that he was more powerful then ever.  And you know what? It was true once we got back to town he learned a couple of spells that had previously been stumping him.  <br>
<br>
I intend to try my hand a painting soon so keep your eyes out for more stuff under my Nom De Plume, Efmu. Did I tell you how I came up with that name? No? Well perhaps another time, it sounds like mom has dinner ready, see you around.<br>

I have a little scholar of the martial arts named Callio and a little treehugger named Nakele, and I am certain she'd love to play with a viking who has seen the inside of magician school.  Nakele is still rather unused to her spells and has little patience for this meditation thing, but perhaps if there were someone to tell her stories while she sat, it would be infinitely more pleasant.  What do you say?<br>
