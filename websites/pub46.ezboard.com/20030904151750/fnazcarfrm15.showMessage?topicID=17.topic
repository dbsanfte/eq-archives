<br>
The Shackles that Iksar Monks wear upon their wrists are a sign of their progression through their caste. They are the equivilent of the Freeport Sashes, and Qeynos Headbands. Although perhaps slightly more useful<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Shackle of Dust<br>
<br>
Give your newbie note to Grand Master Glox. He gives you this shackle. You may like to put it in the bank untill level 7, incase you die, and it decays on your corpse. <br>
Shackle of Clay<br>
<br>
The first quested shackle.<br>
Talk to Master Raska in the Court of Pain. He calls you a whiff, and upon asking him what a 'Whiff' is, you recieve the chance to prove that you are not so weak as he might think. Follow the prompts, and take the four slot bag he gives you. You need four items to fill this bag. We will go over each in detail.<br>
Goblin Scout Beads<br>
<br>
These drop from low level Goblin Scouts in Lake of Ill Omen. Take five minutes, head out here, and kill a Goblin scout (watch out for higher level goblins), they should only be around level 4. <br>
Sabertooth Cub Canine<br>
<br>
These drop off Sabertooth CUBS. They are usually around level 5. Also in Lake of Ill Omen, so get this and the Scout beads at the same time. <br>
Froglok Skipper Stone<br>
<br>
This tiny range weapon drops off Froglok Skippers, a fairly common spawn around the Swamp of No Hope newbie zone. Approx. level 5 again. <br>
Large Scorpian Pincer<br>
<br>
These drop off Large Scorpians, which are level 6ish. Look for them around the Field of Bone newbie area, and the edges of the Pit.<br>
<br>
Stick these items in the bag, combine them, and return to Master Raska for your Shackle of Clay. <br>
Shackle of Stone<br>
<br>
To prove that you are true to the cause of the Swifttail, you must perform the task of cleansing. Ask Master Raska about the Shackle of Stone, and recieve your mission to hunt the Iksar Bandits, and return their masks. <br>
Iksar Bandits<br>
<br>
around level 9 in the Field of Bone pit. Get the two masks, and if possible, a third to wear if you aren't twinked. <br>
<br>
Iksar Bandits also drop torn notes on occasion. Get the two halves and hand them to the Grand Master to get a flute, whos use is yet to be figured out. Read the notes for a good story.<br>
<br>
Return the Masks and your two previous Shackles, to recieve the glorious Shackle of Stone! <br>
Shackle of Rock<br>
<br>
Note : You can start this quest whenever you like, but I found Feign Death was nessacary before I could finish it.<br>
<br>
Talk to Master Niska in the Court of Pain about the Shackle of Rock, and she tells you that she will give you the shackle if you bring her back the fists of Talon Southpaw, one of the greatest, fastest, strongest, Iksar Monks who ever lived. You may want to buy the book about Tallon from the Court Chronicler if you have not already, and go ask the Bar keep in the Tink and Babble about him. Seems he was almost impossibly-fast with that left hand. Here's the catch ; he had two left hands, explaining his lightning speed. Time to get those fists. <br>
Fist One<br>
<br>
Dropped off a Sarnark Courier in the Lake of Ill Omen <br>
Fist Two<br>
<br>
You are not the first Monk to look for Talon's fists. Another one, a greater Master, has ended up in the Timorous Deep, after searching many years for the fist. The Iksar Master has the 2nd fist. <br>
Fist Three<br>
<br>
This is held by the Dancing Skeleton that an Ogre in Timorous Deep can summon for 5gold. <br>
How to get them<br>
<br>
I suggest you try and get the Sarnar Courier's fist first. If possible, get a ranger, or higher level Druid or Bard, to try and track him for you. He is around level 12 - 15, easy to kill, and spawns around the ruins near the Firiona Vie river in the Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
In Timorous Deep, there is a rogue Iksar Monk, named An Iksar Master. He has the second fist, but before he will hand it to you, you must bring four items back to him, placed and combined in a bag he gives you. Don't worry about getting the bag yet, we'll do that later.<br>
<br>
The four items are: <br>
Excavtors Claw.<br>
<br>
This drops off Burynai Excavators in Kurn's Tower, and in the Pit. Excavators are fairly easy for their level. Around 16ish. <br>
Intact Mandible.<br>
<br>
This drops of Skulking Brutling, in Warsilks Woods. Around level 12, easy kill. Drop is semi-rare though, it may take awhile. <br>
Sparring Gloves of a Goblin Pit Fighter.<br>
<br>
These drop off Goblin Pit Fighters, a semi- rare spawn in Warsilks Woods. Get this after the Mandible. Head to any set of Goblin ruins and kill everything that spawns (you may need some help for this) untill you get the Pit fighter. <br>
Torn Sash from a Young Ronin.<br>
<br>
Ug. Worst part of the quest. You need to head to South Ro, and kill a Young Ronin. Back to this part later.<br>
<br>
The third fist is held by the Skeleton that the Great Oowomp will summon if you give him five gold. The Great Oowomp is on the Ogre Island, where the boats stop in Timorous. Here is the catch though, the hand is only the thumb. The thumb is a container, in which you must place and combine, his fingers. His fingers, named 'A Withered Finger X', where X is a length, drop off the Fingered Skeleton in Kurns. I hope you hunted here and managed to pick some up. Camp the Fingered Skeleton untill you have all four fingers.<br>
<br>
Now to head out to Timorous. Get a map of Warsilks Woods, if you don't already know, and head to The Overthere (safest way is to follow the beach, and then turn inland at the far end of the zone). In the Overthere, head towards the evil Outpost, and swim out to the boat when it arrives, making sure to avoid any guards, as they will kill you. This boat will take you to Timorous. After you zone in, stay on the boat untill it arrives at the Ogre Island. Jump into the water, and swim around to where the Barge headed for Oasis docks. (Have a look at this map I'll refer to it from now on). Take the barge to Oasis.<br>
<br>
After you reach Oasis Dock, head left, facing into the beach, down the shore, and then when you hit the rock wall, follow it until you zone into South Ro. Here, find (you may need track again) a Young Ronin and kill them. They are slightly more powerful than a Derv, and you may need help. They are a semi-rare spawn, and wander around the desert part of the zone. Kill them and take their torn sash. Head back to Oasis, and get the boat to Timorous.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the Ogre Island, don't get back on the boat straight away. Head towards the Great Oowomp, using sneak and trying to avoid other Ogres. I did this at level 19, and everything except the Oowomp conned blue. Get as close as possible to the Oowomp, and then Feign Death. Then, get five gold ready, un-feign and quickly give it to the Oowomp. If you un-feign with sneak on, you will have a few seconds before he and the other ogre near by agro. Give him the cash, and re-feign. He summons a skeleton. After the skeleton as popped up, un-feign again, with sneak on, and ask him who Talon Southpaw was. Follow the cues and get your fist. Feign again. These guys are weak, and if you are fast, shouldn't lose much health. Get up, run to the docks, FD to get them off you, and rise and repeat untill you are on the boat back to The Overthere. Whilst here, stick the four fingers into the container you just got from the Skeleton and combine them. Ta da, the second fist.<br>
<br>
On the way back to Overthere, keep your eyes open for the Bandit shipwreck (see the map), when you see it, jump off the boat, and then head for approx -5000, 3000, and the Iksar Master (see the map). Find him, ask him what are the Fists of Talon Southpaw, and then offer to return it. Take the bag, put the gloves, claw, mandible, and sash in it, combine them, and give him the bag back. Ta da! Third fist.<br>
<br>
Now you have some choices. Take the boat back to Overthere, or, if you have balls, swim to the Firepo(r)t room, and take the Cabilis teleport home, to give in the fists and get your Shackle of Rock!<br>
<br>
Note : If you have a high level enchanter friend, you can just get him to charm the Ogre and the skeleton. That makes it about 1000x times easier to do the quest, but not all of us have a high level enchanter friend, eh?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Guide to the Shackle Of Rock Quest - By Siupunyau<br>
<br>
Master Niska (East Cabilis) : he need &quot;Head of Kwinn outlander:<br>
<br>
Kwinn The Outlander - At Fironia Vie (FV)<br>
Rare Spawn and will killed by Frogloks.<br>
<br>
Give Head of Outlander, Shackles of Rock and Shackles of Stone to Master Niska , he will return you Shackles of Copper.<br>
<br>
Guide to the Shackle of Bronze Quest - By Jinsoku<br>
<br>
This quest originates in Cabilis, but has more involvement with &quot;an iksar master&quot; in the Timorous Deep.<br>
<br>
In order to initiate the quest, go to Master Niska (in Cabilis, located near Master Glox) and state that &quot;I will be your personal courier.&quot; She will hand you a Tin Box which weighs 8 pounds, and request that you take it to Master Rinmark, who in fact identifies as &quot;an iksar master.&quot; Master Rinmark is located on the chess-board island in the Timorous Deep. He stands meditating atop a mountain peak on the island (you should have no problem finding him as the island is quite small).<br>
<br>
Once the Tin Box is handed in to &quot;an iksar master&quot; (Master Rinmark) the following reaction will be triggered:<br>
<br>
&quot;An Iksar master opens the box to reveal a variety of pebbles. How grand!! My pebbles!! Now I can continue with my rock garden!! Would you please [assist old Rinmark in completing this rock garden]?&quot;<br>
<br>
You say : &quot;I will assist old Rinmark in completing his rock garden&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An iksar master pours the pebbles from the box into his pocket and hands it to you. Take my box, Fill and combine within my box the following: a Radiant Medeorite, Frontier Fools Gold, Petrified Redwood, Rile's Sand Coin, Sulfur Stone, Fragment of Tektite, Plains Pebble, Jade Magma, Heart of Ice and an Unholy Coldstone. Return the Full Tin Box to me and I shall reward you with a Shackle of Bronze.&quot;<br>
<br>
The components are easy. This will probably be one of the most tedious and boring quests you will ever do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Radiant Meteorite - Foraged in the Burning Woods. Took me about 2 hours.<br>
Frontier Fools Gold - There are indeed 2 different forageable gold nuggets. Our desired nugget is will identify as Frontier Fools Gold. The one we DON'T want and WILL NOT combine in the box is Genuine Gold Nugget.<br>
Petrified Redwood - grr, more foraging... took me a short 10 minutes though. head to Warsliks Woods for this.<br>
Rile's Sand Coin - Some more foraging, stay in Timorous Deep and kill raptors or something, this one took me a long time.<br>
Sulfur Stone - These drop from Drolvarg Scavengers. Scavengers can be found roaming the middle of the zone. Walk straight outwards once you zone in from Lake of Ill Omen. They're really known as &quot;Scarlet Stones,&quot; but with the identify spell these are indeed Sulfur Stones.<br>
Fragment of Tektite - Pick up 2 carnelian gems. Grab a friend to cast the invisibility spell on you. At the entrance to the evil outpost (coming in from overthere) you will see two gargoyles. Run into the tunnel with invisibility and at the other end of the tunnel will appear two more gargoyles, with one of having the name &quot;Tektite.&quot; He wants a replacement for his eyes, and seeks two Carnelian gems. Run up behind him, feign, and hit sneak until it works. Get back up (DO NOT HAIL HIM) and hand him the two gems in seperate slots. You will receive a piece of &quot;Tektite.&quot;<br>
Plains Pebble - Again, more foraging. head to the karanas for this. I got mine in south karana. practiced safe fall and bandaging using krak windchaser, and the aviak tower. Good deal I guess.<br>
Jade Magma - Kill burynai miners in Frontier Mountains. My first kill yielded a Jade Magma.<br>
Heart of Ice - In Lake of Ill Omen, these drop from the undead &quot;Ice bone skeletons&quot; near the lake shore.<br>
Unholy Coldstone - In permafrost caverns, a goblin priest will drop them. Priests are random common spawns deeper inside permafrost. I got mine in the Preacher room.<br>
<br>
This quest is long, tedious, but well worth the reward, a Shackle of Bronze. AC and magic resistance in one bracer. Humans might wonder as to why we go through so much trouble. Well to keep it short you have to be an Iksar to know what its like not being able to wear any sort of plate-mail armor<br>
<br>
Psilon Dvega's Guide to the Shackle of Steel <br>
<br>
<br>
This is the last Shackle Quest for us Iksar monks, and well worth the effort too. I was at level 51 when I completed the quest solo. Due to the last part of the quest, I'd suggest you be 50+ to do this quest by yourself or 45+ to do it with a group. I'm sure it can be done at lower levels, but it might be more trouble than it's worth at the moment. <br>
<br>
Anyway, onto the quest. This one starts in Timorous Deep with Master Rinmark (the &quot;iksar master&quot; on chessboard island). If you finish his rock collection (for the previous Shackle), he will automatically begin the quest. This brings me to the prerequisites for the quest. You will need BOTH your Shackle of Copper and your Shackle of Bronze for this quest. If you don't have them, get them. Then approach Master RInmark and ask him &quot;who student&quot; or &quot;where is the student&quot;... one of those will give you a response and a &quot;part of a large key.&quot; It is a two slot container <br>
<br>
Ultimately, this container will need to be filled with &quot;a copper key&quot; and &quot;a nickel key.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Nickle Key <br>
<br>
The Nickel Key is easy to get, it just takes time. If you mull around the third floor of Dalnir for a while, you'll come across &quot;a goblin penkeeper&quot; Swat 'im! He'll drop the key you need. I've seen him in two places on the third floor. If you take the southern branch of the four way hall after you drop into the third floor, you will hit a room with three pillars. This is where I killed him. Another place he's spawned is in the &quot;crusader room&quot; (see EQ Atlas for details). After getting your Nickel Key, toss it into your &quot;part of a large key&quot; and head to Droga.. /em shiver. <br>
<br>
The Copper Key <br>
<br>
Droga is not a fun place for ANYONE. I'd suggest you head down there with a few items first. Potions are the key to this portion of the quest. Before you step foot in Droga, be smart and equip yourself with two or three Invis potions (13pp give or take at the potion vendor in Cabilis) and a shrink potion (20pp give or take from your favorite Shammy). If you don't get these potions, you will probably die in Droga and you will probably have on heck of a CR ahead of yourself. There is one more element to this trip that is recommended. A porter.. druid or wizzy, it doesn't matter. It is highly preferable to be able to get out with a click of a button instead of running around aimlessly thru the halls with Ht'ing mosstroopers and backstabbing slinkers on your tail. The porter is optional, but after doing this all solo, I'd give my arm for one. <br>
<br>
You will need a map too... head to the jail area of Droga. In the Inner Sanctum (as described by EQ Atlas), there are two ways into the jail. One is by keys and the other is by a pit. For this run, I'd suggest you fall down into the pit. MAKE SURE YOU ARE INVISSED BEFORE YOU FALL DOWN THE PIT. <br>
<br>
Once you fall, you'll find yourself in a jail cell. If you face the door of the cell, to your right will be a secret passage (it looks like a wall, just walk through it) and on the other side, you will be in another cell with a busted down door. Also in this cell is the &quot;goblin interrogator.&quot; He is your target. Look out for adds as you engage him... pin him to the wall and try not to let him run. There are goblins all over the place! Green to me at 51, he is a very nasty Necro-type who loves to slap DoTs and Nukes onto you. Word of warning. He has a damage shield!!! So be careful how you take him down, because his DS alone will bring you down a few bubbles if you use low delay weapons. I'd suggest you bring along your favorite 2hb and whack at him with that. You may have to FD and try him a few times before you can catch him without his DS up. Patience, Grasshopper... <br>
<br>
Once you have him waxed, loot the &quot;Copper Key&quot; off of him and put it in the key container. Hit the &quot;combine&quot; button and viola. You have the key to unlock the shackles of the Iksar slave. <br>
<br>
I saved the Droga part for last because now the rest of this quest is a cakewalk. It just so happens that the &quot;student&quot; that Rinmark was mumbling about is in a cell right here in Droga! Suck down a shrink potion now while you're at a safe spot and drink another invis potion. If you head out of the cell with the broken down door and turn left, you will see a cell across the jail from you. Duck and move in between the bars of that cell. In this cell, you should see some sort of Iksar. If you see &quot;a crazed Iksar,&quot; just FD and wait for him to poof. If you see any other sort of Iksar, drop your invis, hail him, and ask him &quot;Are you Veltar?&quot; <br>
<br>
If he doesn't respond with &quot;An iksar slave's soiled face shines with a glint of hope. 'You know my name? Who has [sent] you to find me?'&quot;, do NOT hand him the key you have just combined. He isn't Veltar, and he will take your key and you will have to do it over again! If he responds as stated, then I'd suggest you finish the conversation with &quot;Master Rinmark sent me.&quot; Let him talk some more and ask &quot;Where is the coppernickel key?&quot; He'll rant some more, but you're a step ahead of him. You have the coppernickel key in your hands. Now you can hand him the COMBINED key (make sure it's combined), the Shackle of Copper, and the Shackle of Bronze. He will then give you his Shackle of Steel and all you have to worry about is leaving. <br>
<br>
From this point, if you have a porter, just evac out. If not, you can re-invis, duck in between the cell bars and leave Droga normally. That part is up to you... at least you'll have your Shackle of Steel on your corpse if the goblins get you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
