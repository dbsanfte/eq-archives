The system has been patterned closely after Afterlife's system. In order to maintain fairness across the varying levels of player's raid time, DKPs or Dragon Kill Points are awarded to players when they participate in killing raid level mobs. These points are then used to weight the randoming between players when loot drops. When loot is won, the DKP value associated with that item is subtracted from the winning player's DKP bank. Through this method, even though a player may be killing a raid level mob that does not drop an item that character would use, the player still benefits as he or she receives some predetermined DKP amount. This DKP can be used in the future to more or less purchase an item the character desires.<br><br>In order to mitigate the &quot;bad random&quot; scenario, a scenario where a person that has been raiding for a long time loses a random to a person who's brand new, there are DKP tiers. Tiers have been developed to enable players with similar amounts of time invested (similar DKP levels) to random for loot while those with significantly less time invested (lower DKP levels) are excluded. The DKP tier that an item will be randomed in will be defined as the highest interested player's DKP level minus 10% of his DKPs or the highest interested players DKP value rounded up to the nearest 5 minus 4, whichever is larger. In cases where this number is the same, the latter of these is used (round up to nearest 5 minus 4.) <br><br>For those that would rather not do the math, this is summed up as: if the highest interested player's DKP level is 50 or less the tier level is 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 etc. wherever the highest players DKP level falls. If the highest interested player's DKP level is 51+, then the highest interested player's DKP level minus 10% is the defined tier range. As this can be confusing, here are several examples to help you better understand:<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>An item drops and Player A desires to have the it and has the most DKPs of all interested at 23 DKPs. As this is less than 50 the tier would be 21 to 25. Thus, all players with 21-25 DKPs who wanted the item could random against each other for it. If there were no other interested players in this tier, Player A would get the item and the DKP cost of the item would be subtracted from his DKP bank.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>An item drops and Player B desires to have the it and has the most DKPs of all interested at 43 DKPs. As this is less than 50, the tier would be 41 to 45. Thus, all players with 41-45 DKPs who wanted the item could random against each other for it.<br><br>Example 3:<br><br>An item drops and Player C desires to have the it and has the most DKPs of all interested at 86 DKPs. As this DKP amount is 50+, the tier range will be 86-8.6=77.4 -- 77.4 to 86. Thus, all players with 77.4-86 DKPs who wanted the item could random against each other for it.<br><br>Example 4:<br><br>An item drops and Player D desires to have the it and has the most DKPs of all interested at 256 DKPs. As this DKP amount is 50+, the tier range would be 256-25.6=230.4 -- 230.4 to 256. Thus, all players with 230.4-256 DKPs who wanted the item could random against each other for it.<br><br>As you can see, the larger the DKP level for those interested, the larger the range. This is intended as players whose DKP values are within 10% of each other have invested similar amounts of raiding time.<br><br>Players can only random for items that their character would use. These items cannot be used by their twinks or transferred to any other player except through the proper process. If nobody present wants an item that drops, it is added to the guild bank and offered again at the next guild raid.<br><br>A player must have enough DKPs to purchase an item in order to be eligable for the random, that is, s/he cannot go negative. If nobody has enough DKPs to purchase an item, the item is banked and re-offered at the next raid. If the item is NO DROP, however, the item is offered at tier zero and all players with positive DKP values who need may random for it. The winning player will then go negative to purchase the item. If the item is NO DROP and no players interested have positive DKP values, the item is offered at tier sub zero and all players in need are allowed to random regardless of how negative they are. Items that have been in the guild bank for one week or more have their class restrictions removed and they can be purchased with DKPs for player's alternate characters. Items that have continued lack of interest can be liquidated at market value to players outside the guild for raid money or sold to members of the guild for 66% of market value.<br><br>Qualifying items (raid level items) that are upgraded at a raid can be offered to those present using the same process as if the item dropped at that raid. In this situation the winning player transfers the DKP value for that item to the previous owner. If no players desire the raid level item that was upgraded, the player may sell it to the bank for one-half it's DKP value or keep it and offer it again at the next guild raid. Non-raid level items acquired by the guild which are upgraded will be returned to the guild bank to be given to a member in need or liquidated for raiding funds.<br><br>Keys quest components (trak teeth etc.) are not considered loot and will be awarded to players based on total DKPs earned, level, class* and percentage complete. Once an item like this is awarded, the player must make completing the key quest a high priority as the commitment being given to that person by the guild is large. *The keys will be awarded in an order to ensure balanced groups.<br><br>DKPs will be awarded at the end of each day's raiding and be available to purchase items for the next day's raiding. The difference between this and actual real time awarding of DKPs in minimal compared to the resources and time needed to track and maintain a real time updating program. Each player will know exactly where he or she is at for DKPs when the raiding begins and these are the numbers that will be used that day.<br><br>A list of items and their associated DKP values as well as the DKP values for various raid level encounters will be published and maintained for the guild's reference.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub46.ezboard.com/uslaas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slaas</A> at: 8/24/01 12:38:23 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.sacrosanctguild.com/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub46.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="divinity14264frm5">General<option value="divinity14264frm7">Recruitment<option value="divinity14264frm4">Guild Policies<option value="divinity14264frm6">For Sale<option value="divinity14264frm22">Need Access<option value="divinity14264frm3">General - Members Only<option value="divinity14264frm23">Guild Events<option value="divinity14264frm24">Tactics and Strategy<option value="divinity14264frm25">Applicant Review<option value="divinity14264frm27">Voting<option value="divinity14264frm28">DKP Updates<option value="divinity14264frm29">DKP Auction House<option value="divinity14264frm26">Bank<option value="divinity14264frm1">Council Forum<option value="divinity14264frm8">Bards<option value="divinity14264frm9">Clerics<option value="divinity14264frm10">Druids<option value="divinity14264frm11">Enchanters<option value="divinity14264frm12">Magicians<option value="divinity14264frm13">Monks<option value="divinity14264frm14">Necromancers<option value="divinity14264frm15">Paladins<option value="divinity14264frm16">Rangers<option value="divinity14264frm17">Rogues<option value="divinity14264frm18">Shadow Knights<option value="divinity14264frm19">Shamans<option value="divinity14264frm20">Warriors<option value="divinity14264frm21">Wizards<option value="divinity14264frm30">Admin Archives<option value="divinity14264frm31">Admin Archives II</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/bdivinity14264>Sacrosanct</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub46.ezboard.com/fdivinity14264frm4>Guild Policies</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
