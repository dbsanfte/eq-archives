<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> What once was a gathering place for fishermen
of all types, is now a place to get your hair set and get your nails manicured.
People of all ages came to the store to talk fishing, forget there troubles,
and buy bait and tackle. Now we are forced to buy through catalogs or big
chain stores, where you'll never get any information on current fishing
conditions.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I would rather stop in a local bait
shop to buy my gear, and bait. Even if it costs a little more, the information
you'll get on local fishing hot spot is priceless. Most of my knowledge
and skills came from talking to the owners and customers that frequent
these shops. Most people think that buying bulk is better, saving a penny
is more practical, or buy through the mail is convenient. This is true
in a lot of cases, like buying produce for canning, or stocking up on necessities,
but for fishing equipment, buying it from a big chain store or catalog
will limit the personal information you'll get on where and how to use
the lure or product you just purchased.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; For those guys who order through a catalog because
its cheaper, what will you do when you need live bait or a lure and there
is no place to get it. Remember the mall opens at 10:00am, and mail order
can take weeks to get, but your local bait shop is usually open at 6:00am
and has what you need when you need it, like the glow spoon you lost the
night before to a 25lb salmon.</b>
<br><b>I personally, have called bait shops and asked if they would stay
open late, so I could come in for bait and tackle for the next day. I couldn't
get out of work early enough, but they waited for me after closing time,
try getting that service from a chain store.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had some of the best fishing of my life
because the shop owners unselfishly told me some of they’re favorite spots,
and it didn't cost me a dollar to call a hot spot hotline. The owner of
my local bait shop, which is now a salon, opened his store because he loves
fishing and wanted to help people enjoy this great sport. The shop would
still be open today, but lost business to catalogs and chain stores, forced
they’re doors to close. My friends and I really miss this small bait shop.
I feel obligated to help other small bait shops by purchasing equipment
and bait, because this particular shop gave us so many good times and memories
catching fish. One memory stands out clear, we walked into the shop to
talk fishing and buy a few lures, and Keith (the owner) told us to grab
the local fishing news paper that was available at his shop, and turn to
page 6. Much to our surprise a picture of Jeff (@angler-info) and I holding
4 steelhead trout was on that page. He submitted our picture to the publication,
not telling us, to surprise us because he knew it would make the paper
and make us happy at the same time. We thanked him, and he just said "heck
man, you guys did all the work".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point I’m trying to make is that no amount
of money can replace the personal service you'll get from a small bait
shop. They can show you the new high tech gear, teach a beginner how to
string a reel and tie a knot, or explain certain techniques to help you
boat more fish. In closing, if you want to keep the sport of fishing fun
(fun = catching fish), please help support your local bait shops, just
remember we're all in the same boat.</b>
<p><b>till next time...&nbsp; Good Fishing.</b>
