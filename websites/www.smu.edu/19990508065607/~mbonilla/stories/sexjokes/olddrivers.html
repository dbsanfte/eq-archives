Ethel is a bit of a demon in her wheelchair and loves to charge  around the nursing home, taking corners on one wheel and getting up to maximum speed on the long corridors.  Because the poor woman is a sandwich short of a picnic, the other residents tolerate her, and some actually join in.<BR>
<BR>
One day, Ethel was speeding up one corridor  when a door opened and a man stepped out with his arm out stretched. "STOP!" he said in a firm voice. "Have you got a license for that thing?" Ethel fished around in her handbag on her lap and pulled out a Kit-Kat wrapper which she held up to him. "Ok" he said and she went on her way.<BR>
<BR>
Taking the corner near the TV lounge on one wheel, another man stepped out in front of her and shouted "Stop! Have you got a valid tax disc from your vehicle madam?"  Ethel dug into her handbag again and pulled out a beer-mat which she held up to him and he allowed her to carry on.<BR>
<BR>
Going down the final corridor before the front door, a third man stepped out in front of her.  This one was stark naked and was holding a sizeable erection in his hand......<BR>
<BR>
Oh no", said Ethel,...............<BR>
<BR>
"Not the breathalyzer again!"<BR>
