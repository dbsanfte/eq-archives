Three couples, an elderly couple, a middle aged couple and a young newlywed couple wanted to join a church.
 <P>
The pastor says, "We have special requirements for new parishioners. You must abstain from having sex for two weeks."
 <P>
The couples agreed and came back at the end of two weeks. The pastor goes to the elderly couple and asks, "Were you able to abstain from sex for the two weeks?"
<P>
The old man replies, "No problem at all, Pastor."
<P>
"Congratulations! Welcome to the church." said the pastor.
<P>
The pastor goes to the middle aged couple and asks, "Well, were you able to abstain from sex for the two week?"
<P>
The man replied, "The first week was not too bad. The second week I had to sleep on the couch for a couple of nights but, yes we made it."
<P>
"Congratulations! Welcome to the church." said the pastor.
<P>
The pastor then goes to the newlywed couple and asks, 'Well, were you able to abstain from sex for two weeks?"
<P>
"Well Pastor, we were not able to go without sex for the two weeks." the young man replied.
<P>
"What Happened?" inquired the pastor.
<P>
"My wife was reaching for a can of corn on the top shelf and dropped it. When she bent over to pick it up, I was over come with lust and took advantage of her right there."
<P>
"You understand of course, this means you will not be welcome in our church." Stated the pastor.
<P>
"That's OK." Said the young man, "We're not welcome at Safeway anymore either.
<P>
