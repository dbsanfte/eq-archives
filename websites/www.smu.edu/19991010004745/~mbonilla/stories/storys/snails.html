Ted woke up one morning, and made his way to the front porch to get the newspaper.  
After shuffling down the hallway and opening the front door, he reached down for the paper and saw a snail lying on the porch.  Ted picked up the snail and threw it across the street. Two years later,  on a Sunday morning,  Ted was going through his same routine.  Wake up, put on slippers and a robe,  and make his way to the front door to retrieve the paper. When he opened the door,  there sat the snail.  The snail looked up at Ted and said "Now what in the FUCK was THAT all about?!!!"
