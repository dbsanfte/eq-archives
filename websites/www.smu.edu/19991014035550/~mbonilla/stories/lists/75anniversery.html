As they cut the cake for their 75th anniversary, the old man nuzzled the old lady's ear and whispered:<BR>
<BR>
"Darling, there's something I've wanted to ask you all these years. Our eleventh child never did look like his brothers and sisters. Did he have a different father?"<BR>
<BR>
The old lady lowered her eyes and murmured,<BR>
<BR>
"Yes dear, he did."<BR>
<BR>
The old man just stood there for a while without saying a word. Finally, he asked,<BR>
<BR>
"Who was it?"<BR>
<BR>
The old lady said softly, "You, dear."<BR>
