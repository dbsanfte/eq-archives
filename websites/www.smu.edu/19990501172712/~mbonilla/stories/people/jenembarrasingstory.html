<P>
Normally when I hear embarrassing stories about my friends I sort of
chuckle a little and let it pass, however when my friend at CU boulder
wrote me this letter telling me about her embarrassing experience, as sick
as it was I could not help but become hysterical and I know with the
sick sense of humor my friends have, that ya'll would appreciate this as
well.  I asked my friend if I could write it up. She didn't mind as long
as I didn't use her name, so here it is...this one's for you Wood.

   An anonymous girl lets call her jen, is a junior in college attending
school in Colorado.  Like all college students, she is wrapped up in the
partying and the wildness college life has to offer.  Jen being the
computer science major that she is does, however, have a lot of work to
do on her computer so when she's not out having a good time, she's
working her butt off designing computer programs and installing
software.
<P>
   One day, soon after she had broken up with her boyfriend, she was
home alone on a Friday night for the first time in the three years they
had been dating. she was sad, alone, and depressed, so she decided to
make a new homepage.  She was playing on the net when she decided to get
onto a chat line.  Being the wild psycho she is she decided to get onto
a sex line.  So jen got onto a sex chat line and started playing around
on it.  Over the line she met a guy who identified himself as jeremy. 
She started playing with him. She gave a false name, saying her name was
"katie" and started getting into detail about what she would like to do
to him with her tongue.  He responded by telling her to picture being
naked while his hands ran over every square inch of her body.  Soon they
were having cybersex.  This went on for awhile, and then she got off the
line agreeing to meet him back on the line the following night.
<P>
        Saturday night rolls around, and Jen is on the line with jeremy
again.  They become even closer this night, so they continue like this
for a week. At the end of the week, they started talking about other
things, and got into very intimate issues and feelings.  They became
close, exchanging their lives. Jen didn't' tell jeremy she was in
college, because she was afraid of sounding like an immature college
girl.  She felt guilty, but after a few weeks, she really liked this
guy.  This went on between the two of them like this for months, and
months turned into a year.  By the end of the year they had exchanged
the most intimate thoughts, and yet had never even spoken on the phone. 
They were afraid of ruining the mystery.  They had done everything
sexually possible over the net, and were affectionate as well, waiting
for the day that they could some day be together.  They finally decided
they had had enough.  They wanted to meet each other, they were in love
and they had to meet.  They didn't care about age or looks or anything
but each other.  Jeremy told jen he thought she could be his next
wife.  Jen was wary at first but decided she didn't care how old he was
or how ugly, she loved him.  He was the only one she could feel
comfortable with. 
<P>
	so...they planned a trip to meet in Vale, Colorado.  They were going to
spend the weekend together and finally meet.  Jen didn't want the hassle
of having to find him, so she said, "Why don't you just get the room and
we'll meet in the room?  That way there will be no mistake."  Jeremy
agreed.
<P>
        Jen showed up at the resort first, and checked into the room,
telling the desk lady to hold the key for the next party, so she went
into the room.  She wanted things to be special so she lit some candles,
put on some music, and stripped naked and climbed into the bed under the
covers, deciding to surprise Jeremy when he got there.  The time soon
came; the lights were out, the mood was right, and she heard a key in
the door.  She heard someone walk in and around the corner, and she
whispered, "Jeremy", jeremy said, "Katie?" (this was the false name she
had given him.)  Yes, she said, so he fumbled for the light, and turned
it on to see Jen on the bed naked before him.  The next thing heard
around the world were two blood-curling screams.  Jen covered herself
up, and with her most humiliating voice said, "Dad?" and Jeremy said,
"JEN!!!"
