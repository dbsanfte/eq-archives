A fellow picked up a girl in a bar and took her home with him. After
some preliminary drinks and talk, they got undressed, climbed into bed
and generally got organized for a leg over.  After a few minutes, the
girl started laughing. The fellow asked her what she found so amusing.<BR>
"Your organ," she replied. "It's a bit on the small side."<P>
Hurt, he replied: "It's not used to playing in cathedrals."<P>
