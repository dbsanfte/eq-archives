<H2><CENTER>I'm Glad I'm A Man</CENTER></H2>
I'm glad I'm a man, you better believe.<BR>
I don't live off of yogurt, diet coke, or cottage cheese<BR>
I don't bitch to my girlfriends about the size of my breasts<BR>
I can get where I want to - north, south, east or west<BR>
I don't get wasted after only 2 beers<BR>
and when I do drink I don't end up in tears.<BR>
<BR>
I won't spend hours deciding what to wear,<BR>
I spend 5 minutes max fixing my hair<BR>
and I don't go around checking my reflection in everything shiny from every direction.<BR>
I don't whine in public and make us leave early<BR>
and when you ask why get all bitter and surly.<BR>
<BR>
I'm glad I'm a man, I'm so glad I could sing<BR>
I don't have to sit around waiting for that ring.<BR>
I don't gossip about friends or stab them in the back<BR>
I don't carry our differences into the sack.<BR>
I'll never go psycho and threaten to kill you<BR>
or think every guy out there's trying to steal you.<BR>
I'm rational, reasonable, and logical too<BR>
I know what the time is and I know what to do.<BR>
<BR>
And I honestly think its a privilege for me<BR>
to have these two balls and stand when I pee<BR>
I live to watch sports and play all sorts of ball<BR>
It's more fun than dealing with women after all<BR>
I won't cry if you figure out it's not going to work<BR>
I won't remain bitter and call you a jerk.<BR>
Feel free to use me for immediate pleasure<BR>
I won't assume it's permanent by any measure.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I'm glad I'm a man, a man you see<BR>
I'm glad I'm not capable of child delivery<BR>
I don't get all bitchy every 28 days<BR>
I'm glad that my gender gets me a much bigger raise<BR>
I'm a man by chance and I'm thankful it's true<BR>
I'm so glad I'm a man and not a woman like you!<BR>
<P>
