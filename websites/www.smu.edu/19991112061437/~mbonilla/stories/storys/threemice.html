Three mice are sitting in a bar talking about how tough they are. The first
mouse slams down a shot and says, "I play with mouse traps for fun.  I'll
run into one on purpose and as it's closing on me, I grab the bar and bench
press it twenty or thirty times."  And with that he slams another shot.
<P>
The second mouse slams down a shot and says, "That's nothing.  I take those
De-Con tablets, cut 'em up, and snort 'em just for the fun of it."  And
with that he slams another shot.
<P>
The third mouse slams down a shot, gets up and walks away.  The first two
mice look at each other, and then turn to the third mouse and ask, "Where
the hell are you going?"
<P>
The third mouse stops and replies, "I'm going home to fuck the cat."
