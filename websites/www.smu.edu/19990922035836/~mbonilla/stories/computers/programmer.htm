A Programmer and an Engineer were sitting next to each other on an
airplane.  The Programmer leans over to the Engineer and asks if he
wants to play a fun game.  The Engineer just wants to sleep so he
politely declines, turns away and tries to sleep.  The Programmer
persists and explains that it's a real easy game.  He explains,"I ask a
question and if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.  Then you ask
a question and if I don't know the answer I'll pay you $5." Again the
Engineer politely declines and tries to sleep.
<P>
The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, "O.K., if you don't know
the answer you pay me $5 and if I don't know the answer I pay you $50"
Now, that got the Engineer's attention, so he agrees to the game. The
Programmer asks the first question, "What's the distance from the earth
to the moon?" The Engineer doesn't say a word and just hands the
Programmer $5.
<P>
Now, its the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer,"What goes up a
hill with three legs and comes down on four?" The Programmer looks at
him with a puzzled look, takes out his laptop computer, looks through
all his references and after about an hour wakes the Engineer and hands
the Engineer $50. The Engineer politely takes the $50 turns away and
tries to return to sleep.
<P>
The Programmer, a little miffed, asks, "Well what's the answer to the
question?" Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands
$5 to the Programmer, turns away and returns to sleep.
<P>
