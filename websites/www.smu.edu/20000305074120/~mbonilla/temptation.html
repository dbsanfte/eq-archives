A heaven I'd get with a hope<BR>
Just like the feeling inside, it's no joke<BR>
And though it hurts me to treat you this way<BR>
Betrayed my words, I'd never heard, too hard to say<BR>
Up, down, turn around<BR>
Please don't let me hit the ground<BR>
Tonight I think I'll walk alone<BR>
I'll find my soul as I go home<BR>
<BR>
Each way I turn, I know I'll always try<BR>
To break this circle that's been placed around me<BR>
From time to time, I find I've lost some need<BR>
That was urgent to myself, I do believe<BR>
Up, down, turn around<BR>
Please don't let me hit the ground<BR>
Tonight I think I'll walk alone<BR>
I'll find my soul as I go home<BR>
<BR>
Oh, you've got green eyes<BR>
Oh, you've got blue eyes<BR>
Oh, you've got grey eyes<BR>
And I've never seen anyone quite like you before<BR>
No, I've never met anyone quite like you before<BR>
Thoughts from above hit the people down below<BR>
People in this world, we have no place to go<BR>
Oh, it's the last time<BR>
Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before<BR>
Oh no, I've never met anyone quite like you before<BR>
