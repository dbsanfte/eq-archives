Hi Everyone!  Well, this is where you usually would find an incredible amusing story about Barbie.  But it seems the man has come down on me. : (  See SMU got a nasty letter from Mattel (from here on out known as the MAN).  The MAN said that the amusing Barbie stories were infringing on their trademark.  So they sent some tough guys out to rough up the SMU guys, and well the SMU guys then sent out their henchman to let me known that I would have to remove the offending pages.  BUT! *grin* if you do want to see the incredibly funny and oh so entertaining, Barbie of the 90's, A Letter from Barbie, and Politically Correct Barbie, send me an email here

<P>
saying I Want Barbie (and please put your email address in the message)
<P>
and i'll send it back to you in a jiffy (well not always a jiffy, but eventually :)
<P>
Oh, and one more thing.  Please don't send me requests for Barbie pictures or anything like that, I don't have any.  I'm not a peddler of Barbie picture, just amusing, funny, entertaining stories that I get in email every day. : )  And also, I didn't write any of the stuff that's in the funny stories, I just get it in mail and then slap it back on the web for the world to enjoy. So Please visit the rest of the my home page (<A HREF="../../index.htm">The Little Island</A>) and have fun looking around! : )
<P>
Mario.
