Three bulls heard via the grapevine that the rancher was going to bring yet another bull onto the ranch, and the prospect raised a discussion among them.<BR>
<BR>
First Bull:  "Boys, we all know I've been here 5 years.  Once we settled our differences, we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine.Now, I don't know where this newcomer is going to get HIS cows, but I aint'<BR>
givin' him any of mine."<BR>
<BR>
Second Bull:  "That pretty much says it for me, too.  I've been here 3 years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we've agreed are mine. I'll fight 'im till I run him off or kill 'im, but I'M KEEPIN' ALL MY<BR>
COWS."<BR>
<BR>
Third Bull:  "I've only been here a year, and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to "take care of."  I may not be as big as you fellows (yet) but I am young and virile, so I simply MUST keep all MY cows."<BR>
<BR>
They had just finished their big talk when an eighteen-wheeler pulls up in the middle of the pasture with only ONE ANIMAL IN IT:  the biggest Son-of-Another-Bull these guys had ever seen!  At 4700 pounds, each step he took toward the ground strained the steel ramp to the breaking point.<BR>
<BR>
First Bull:  "Ahem... You know, it's actually been some time since I really felt I was doing all my cows justice, anyway.  I think I can spare a few for our new friend."<BR>
<BR>
Second Bull:  "I'll have plenty of cows to take care of if I just stay on the opposite end of the pasture from HIM.  I'm certainly not looking for an argument."<BR>
<BR>
They look over at their young friend, the 3rd bull, and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns, and snorting.<BR>
<BR>
First Bull:  "Son, let me give you some advice real quick.  Let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it."<BR>
<BR>
Third Bull:  "Shit, he can have ALL my cows.  I'm just making sure he knows I'M a bull!"<BR>
