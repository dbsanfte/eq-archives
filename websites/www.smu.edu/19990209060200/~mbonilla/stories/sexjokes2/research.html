<BR>
In 1993, the American Government funded a study to see why the head of a man's penis was larger than the shaft.  After one year and $180,000.00, they concluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex.<BR>
<BR>
After the US published the study, Germany decided to do their own study.<BR>
<BR>
After $250,000.00, and 3 years of research, they concluded that the reason was to give the woman more pleasure during sex.<BR>
<BR>
Poland, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted their own study. After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, they concluded that it was to keep a man's hand from flying off and hitting him in the forehead.<BR>
