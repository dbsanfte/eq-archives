<EM>I went to the door today and the postman delivered a 
partridge in a pear tree.  What a thoroughly delightful gift. 
I couldn't have been more surprised. </EM>

<EM>Oh!  Aren't you the extravagant one.  Now I really must 
protest.  I don't deserve such generosity, three French hens. 
They are just darling but I must insist, you've been too 
kind. </EM>

Dear John,<BR>

they are beautiful but don't you think enough is enough. 
You're being too romantic. </EM>

<EM>What a surprise.  Today the postman delivered 5 golden rings; 
one for every finger.  You're just impossible, but I love it. 
Frankly, all those birds squawking were beginning to get on 
my nerves. </EM>

Dear John:<BR>
<P>
<EM>When I opened the door there were actually 6 geese a-laying 
on my front steps.  So, you're back to the birds again, huh? 
Those geese are huge.  Where will I ever keep them?  The 
neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through the 
racket. </EM>
<P>
Please stop.<BR>

<P>
<EM>What's with you and those fucking birds?  7 swans a-swimming. 
What kind of God damned joke is this?  There's bird shit all 
over the house, and they never stop with the racket.  I can't 
sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck.  It's not funny.  So 
stop with those fucking birds. </EM>

O.K. Buster:<BR>
<P>
<EM>I think I prefer the birds.  What the hell am I going to do 
with 8 maids a-milking?  It's not enough with all those birds 
and 8 maids a-milking, but they had to bring their God damned 
cows.  There is shit all over the lawn and I can't move in my 
own house.  Just lay off me, smart ass. </EM>

Hey!  Shithead,<BR>
<P>
<EM>What are you?  Some kind of sadist?  Now there's 9 pipers 
playing.  And Christ do they play.  They've never stopped 
chasing those maids since they got here yesterday morning. 
They cows are getting upset, and they're stepping all over 
those screeching birds.  What am I going to do?  The 
neighbors have started a petition to evict me. </EM>

You'll get yours,<BR>

You Rotten Prick,<BR>
<P>
<EM>Now there's 10 ladies dancing.  I don't know why I call those 
sluts ladies.  They've been balling those pipers all night 
long.  Now the cows can't sleep and they've got the diarrhea. 
My living room is a river of shit.  The Commissioner of 
Buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why this building 
shouldn't be condemned. </EM>
<P>
I'm sicking the police on you.<BR>

Listen!  Fuckhead,<BR>
<P>
<EM>What's with the 11 lords a-leaping on those maids and ladies. 
Some of those broads will never walk again.  Those pipers ran 
through the maids and have been committing sodomy with the 
cows.  All 23 of the birds are dead.  They've been trampled 
to death in the orgy.  I hope you're satisfied, you rotten, 
vicious swine.</EM>
