Two prostitutes were riding around town with a sign on top of their car which said: "TWO PROSTITUTES -- $50.00."<BR>
<BR>
A policeman, seeing the sign, stopped them and told them they'd either have to remove the sign or go to jail.<BR>
<BR>
Just at that time, another car passed with a sign saying: "JESUS SAVES."<BR>
<BR>
One of the girls asked the cop: "How come you don't stop them?!"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, that's a little different," the cop smiled. "Their sign pertains to religion."<BR>
<BR>
So the two ladies of the night frowned as they took their sign down and drove off.<BR>
<BR>
The following day found the same cop in the area when he noticed the two ladies driving around with a large sign on their car again.  Figuring he had an easy bust, he began to catch up with them when he noticed the new sign which read:<BR>
<BR>
"TWO ANGELS SEEKING PETER -- $50.00."<BR>
