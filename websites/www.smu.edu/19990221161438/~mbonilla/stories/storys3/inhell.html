Three guys found themselves in Hell: Smitty, Mark, and Brian. A little confused at their present situation, they were startled to see a door in the wall (which they hadn't noticed before) open, and behind the door was perhaps the Ugliest woman they had ever seen. She was 3'4", dirty, and you could smell her even over the Brimstone.<BR>
<BR>
The voice of the Devil was heard, "Smitty, you have sinned!!! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!" And Smitty was whisked through the door by a group of lesser demons to his doom.<BR>
<BR>
This understandably shook up the other two, and so they both jumped when a second door opened, and lo! an even more disgusting example of womanhood gone wrong. She was over 7', covered in thick black hair, and flies circled her.<BR>
<BR>
The Voice of the Devil was heard, "Mark, you have sinned!!! You are condemned to spend the rest of eternity in bed with this woman!!!" And Mark, like Smitty, was whisked off.<BR>
<BR>
Brian, now alone, felt understandably anxious, and feared the worst when the third door opened. And as the door inched open, he strained to see the figure of... Cindy Crawford!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Delighted, Brian jumped up, taking in the sight of this beautiful woman, barely dressed in a shiny metallic NASA-space-age material bikini. Then he heard the voice of the Devil say :<BR>
<BR>
"Cindy, you have sinned ........"<BR>
