Let's face it: English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant or ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.
<P>
English muffins were not invented in England or french fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies, while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.
<P>
We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square, and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. 
<P>
And why is it that writers write, but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce, and hammers don't ham? 
<P>
If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So, one moose, 2 meese? One index, two indices? Is cheese the plural of choose?
<P>
If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?
<P>
In what language do people recite at a play, and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways? 
<P>
How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites? How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as h*ll another?
<P>
When a house burns up, it burns down. You fill in a form by filling it out and an alarm clock goes off by going on.
<P>
When the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible. And why, when I wind up my watch, I start it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it?
<P>
Now I know why I flunked my English. It's not my fault -- the silly language doesn't quite know whether it's coming or going.
<P>
