One day a little boy asked his mother how old she is and she told him that little boys didn't ask ladies how old they were.  Some time later the little boy asked his mother how much she weighed and she told him that little boys didn't ask ladies how much they weighed. The little boy then asked his mother why she and his daddy had gotten a divorce.  The Mother told him that little boys didn't ask ladies personnel questions like  that. Later that day the little boy was playing with a friend and told the friend that his mother wouldn't tell him how old she was or how much she weighed or anything.  His friend told him that all he had to do was look on his mother's driver's licence and he could find out any thing he wanted to know.  So the little boy went home and looked on his mother's driver's licence and then went and told his mother he knew how old she was and told her she was 30 years old.  Then he told her that he knew how much she weighed and told her she weighed 125 pounds. Then he told her he knew why she had gotten a divorce and told her it was because she had gotten an F in sex.
