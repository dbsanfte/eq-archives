One day an Englishman, a Scotsman, and an Irishman walked into a pub together. 
They each proceeded to buy a pint of Guinness.  Just as they where about to
enjoy their creamy beverage three flys landed in each of their pints, and were
stuck in the thick head.
<P>
The Englishman pushed his beer from him in disgust.
<P>
The Scotsman scooped at his beer until he washed the fly out and then continued
drinking.
<P>
The Irishman carefully picked the fly out of his drink, then held it out over
the beer and started yelling "SPIT IT OUT YOU BASTARD! SPIT IT OUT!!!!"
<P>
