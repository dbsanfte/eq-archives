There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her business so she did a lot of flying.  But flying made her nervous so she always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.<BR>
<BR>
One time she was sitting next to a man.  When he saw her pull out her Bible he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After awhile he turned to her and asked "You don't really believe all that stuff in there do you?"<BR>
<BR>
The lady replied "Of course I do it is the Bible."<BR>
<BR>
He said "Well what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?<BR>
<BR>
She replied "Oh, Jonah.  Yes I believe that, it is in the Bible.<BR>
<BR>
He asked "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the whale?"<BR>
<BR>
The lady said "Well I don't really know I guess when I get to heaven I will ask him."<BR>
<BR>
"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.<BR>
<BR>
"Then you can ask him."  replied the lady.<BR>
