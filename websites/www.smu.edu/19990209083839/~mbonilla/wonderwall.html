today is gonna be the day<BR>
that they're gonna throw it back to you<BR>
by now you should have somehow<BR>
realised what you gotta do<BR>
i don't believe that anybody<BR>
feels the way i do about you now<BR>
<BR>
backbeat the word is on the street<BR>
that the fire in your heart is out<BR>
i'm sure you've heard it all before<BR>
but you never really had a doubt<BR>
i don't believe that anybody<BR>
feels the way i do about you now<BR>
<BR>
and all the roads we have to walk are winding<BR>
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding<BR>
there are many things that i would like to say to you<BR>
but i don't know how<BR>
<BR>
because maybe<BR>
you're gonna be the one that saves me<BR>
and after all<BR>
you're my wonderwall<BR>
