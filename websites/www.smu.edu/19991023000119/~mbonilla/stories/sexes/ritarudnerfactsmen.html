4. Men are very confident people.My husband is so confident that when he watches sports on television, he thinks that if he concentrates he can help his team.If the team is in trouble, he coaches the players from our living room, and if they're really in trouble, I have to get off the phone in case they call him.<BR>

12. Men have higher body temperatures than women. If your heating goes out in winter, I recommend sleeping next to a man. Men are like portable heaters that snore.<BR>
<BR>
13. Women take clothing much more seriously than men.I've never seen a man walk into a party and say "Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed; get me out of here. There's another man wearing a black tuxedo."<BR>
<BR>
14. Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage. They've experienced pain and bought jewelry.<BR>
<BR>
15. If a man prepares dinner for you and the salad contains three or more types of lettuce, he is serious.<BR>
<BR>
16. If you're dating a man who you think might be "Mr. Right," if he a) got older, b) got a new job, or c) visited a psychiatrist, you are in for a nasty surprise.The cocoon-to-butterfly theory only works on cocoons and butterflies.<BR>

<BR>
24. Getting rid of a man without hurting his masculinity is a problem. "Get out" and "I never want to see you again" might sound like a challenge. If you want to get rid of a man, I suggest saying, "I love you... I want to marry you...I want to have your children." Sometimes they leave skid marks.<BR>
<BR>
25. Men are self-confident because they grow up identifying with super-heroes. Women have bad self-images because they grow up identifying with Barbie.<BR>
