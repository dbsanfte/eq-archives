The reason why our bras don't always match our underwear is because WE actually change our underwear.<BR>
<BR>
The next time you and your buddies joke about armed women in combat, take a poll to see which of you successfully aim at the toilet rim.<BR>
<BR>
If we're watching football with you--it's not bonding--it's the butts.<BR>
<BR>
If the truth hurts, ask us those ego-sensitive questions on your payday.<BR>
<BR>
Whenever possible, please try to say whatever you have to say after the movie.<BR>
<BR>
Don't fret if you find out that the milkman delivers more than once a day.<BR>
<BR>
Please don't drive when you're not driving.<BR>
<BR>
Lay off the beans several hours before bedtime.<BR>
<BR>
Our bedtime headaches are inversely proportional to the number of baths you take.  *teehee*  (^_^)<BR>
<BR>
If you were really looking for an honest answer, you wouldn't ask in bed.<BR>
<BR>
The next time you joke about female drivers, research the number of accidents caused by rubber-necking mini-skirts.<BR>
<BR>
If only women gossip, how do you and your friends keep track of "who's easy"?<BR>
<BR>
Stop telling us most male strippers are gay: we don't care.<BR>
<BR>
When you're not around, I belch loudly, too.<BR>
<BR>
Start parting and combing your hair to one side early in life--you'll never see the 'island' coming.<BR>
<BR>
Have a strong need for male bonding? Visit your proctologist.<BR>
<BR>
Your contributions to your child should go above and beyond that y chromosome you unselfishly sacrificed.<BR>
<BR>
Eye contact is best established above our shoulder-level.<BR>
<BR>
Your balding is a good thing--it subsidizes our hair care expenses.<BR>
