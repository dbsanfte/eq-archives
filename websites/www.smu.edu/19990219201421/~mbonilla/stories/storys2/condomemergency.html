President Boris Yeltsin called Clinton with an emergency:<BR>
<BR>
"Our largest condom factory has exploded!" the Russian President cried.<BR>
"My people's favorite form of birth control! This is a true disaster!"<BR>
<BR>
"Boris, the American people would be happy to do anything within their power to help you," replied the President.<BR>
<BR>
"I do need your help," said Yeltsin. "Could you possibly send 1,000,000 condoms ASAP to tide us over?"<BR>
<BR>
"Why certainly!  I'll get right on it!" said Clinton.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, and one more small favor, please?" said Yeltsin.<BR>
<BR>
"Yes?"<BR>
<BR>
"Could the condoms be red in color and at least 10" long and 4" in diameter?" said Yeltsin.<BR>
<BR>
"No problem," replied the President and, with that, Clinton hung up and called the President of Trojan.  "I need a favor, you've got to make 1,000,000 condoms right away and send them to Russia."<BR>
<BR>
"Consider it done," said the President of Trojan.<BR>
<BR>
"Great! Now listen, they have to be red in color, 10" long and 4" wide."<BR>
<BR>
"Easily done. Anything else?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yeah," said the President, "print 'MADE IN AMERICA, SIZE MEDIUM' on each one."<BR>
