A baby was born that was so advanced that he could talk.  He looked around the delivery room and saw the doctor.<BR>
<BR>
"Are you my doctor?" he asked.<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, I am."<BR>
<BR>
The baby said "Thank you for taking such good care of me during birth."<BR>
<BR>
He looked at his mother and asked, "Are you my mother?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, I am," she said.<BR>
<BR>
"Thank you for taking such good care of me before I was born" he said. <BR>
<BR>
He then looked at his father and asked "Are you my father?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, I am," his father answered.<BR>
<BR>
The baby motioned him close, then poked him on the forehead with his index finger 5 times, saying "I want you to know that THAT HURTS!"<BR>
