Billy Joe and Mary Sue, newly joined in holy matrimony, are spending their wedding night at the Motel 6 Honeymoon Suite in Parthenon, Arkansas. They've abstained from the dirty deed until this very night.<BR>
<BR>
Just as Billy Joe is about to make love to his new wife for the first time, she stops him. "Wait, Billy Joe. I just thought you should know... this ain't just our first time... this here is my first time ever. I'm a virgin. I been savin' myself just for you."<BR>
<BR>
"Whut you say, Mary Sue?"<BR>
<BR>
"I said, I'm a virgin. One hunnert percent cherry. Just for you on our weddin' night."<BR>
<BR>
"Yore a VIRGIN??"<BR>
<BR>
"That's right. Please be gentle."<BR>
<BR>
"Gentle? Gentle my ass. I'm outta here!"<BR>
<BR>
With that, Billy Joe pulls up his pants, hard-on and all, and leaves his virgin bride lying alone and naked. He slams the door, jumps in his pickup, and drives back home across the tracks.<BR>
<BR>
"Paw! Paw! Wake up! Yore not gonna believe this!"<BR>
<BR>
"Huh? Billy Joe, whut the hell you doin' here? It's 3am on yore weddin' night! Why the hell ain't you and that purty new wife of yours in a haystack somewhere f*ckin' like rabbits?"<BR>
<BR>
"Paw, I wuz all set to do just that, when Mary Sue up and tells me that she's a virgin!"<BR>
<BR>
"A VIRGIN?"<BR>
<BR>
"That's right, Paw. One hunnert percent cherry. As soon as she told me, I got the hell outta there as fast as I could!"<BR>
<BR>
"Well, son, lemme tell you, you did the right thing... Cuz if she ain't good enough fer her own fam'ly, she certainly ain't good enough for ours!"<BR>
