This guy goes to a bar that's on the tenth floor of a hotel.  He sits down 
and has a couple of drinks, then stands up, announces loudly that he has 
had enough, and goes over and jumps out the window.  Now, there are two men who are sitting at a window table, and having that natural human curiosity 
about the grotesque, watch as this man plummets to certain death.  However,
just as he  is about to hit the ground, he rights himself, pulls his feet 
underneath himself, and lands gracefully.  He then turns and comes back 
into the building. Naturally, the two men are amazed.  The guy comes back into 
the bar, orders a few drinks, then repeats the process.  The two men at the
window seat are astounded!  When the guy returns and repeats the procedure 
AGAIN, the two  men stop him before he jumps and ask him how on earth he 
does that.  He replies "It's simple, really.  There's an air vent down by 
the ground, and if you catch the updraft, you can right yourself and land 
on the ground with no problems."  Then he proceeded to jump out the window 
again.  Well, these two men decided that they just HAD to try this, so they  jumped out the window, and SPLAT!  -- made a mess hitting all over the ground. 
Meanwhile, the first guy has made it back up to the bar.  When he sits down
to order his drinks, the bartender says "Superman, you can be a real 
asshole when you're drunk!"
