  Originally from the San Jose Mercury news, "News of the Weird". 
<P>
(a) Portsmouth, R.I.  Police charged Gregory Rosa, 25, with 
    a string of vending machine robberies in January when 
    he (1) fled from police inexplicably when they spotted 
    him loitering around a vending machine and (2) later 
    tried to post his $400 bail in coins. 
<P>
(b) Karen Lee Joachimmi, 20, was arrested in Lake City, 
    Florida for robbery of a Howard Johnson's motel.  She 
    was armed with only an electric chain saw, which was 
    not plugged in. 
<P>
(c) The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked 
    into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 7:50am, 
    flashed a gun and demanded cash.  The clerk turned him 
    down because he said he couldn't open the cash register 
    without a food order.  When the man ordered onion rings, 
    the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast.  The 
    man, frustrated, walked away. 
<P>
And it gets better:<BR>
<P>
(d) David Posman, 33, was arrested recently in Providence, 
    R.I, after allegedly knocking out an armored car driver 
    and stealing the closest four bags of money.  It turned 
    out they contained A800 in PENNIES, weighed 30 pounds 
    each, and slowed him to a stagger during his getaway so 
    that police officers easily jumped him from behind. 
<P>
(e) The Belgium news agency Belga reported in November that 
    a man suspected of robbing a jewelry store in Liege said 
    he couldn't have done it *because he was busy breaking 
    into a school at the same time.*  Police then arrested 
    him for breaking into the school. 
<P>
(f) Drug-possession defendant Christopher so-and-so, on trial 
    in March in Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched 
    without a warrant.  The prosecutor said the officer didn't 
    need a warrant because a "bulge" in Christopher's jacket 
    could have been a gun.  Nonsense, said Christopher, who 
    happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court. 
    He handed it over so the judge could see it.  The 
    judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and 
    laughed so hard he required a five-minute recess to compose 
    himself. 
<P>
(g) Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz gave himself 
    five-inch-long welts in March when he tried to iron his 
    polo shirt while wearing it.  "I've ironed that way five 
    or six times," he said, "and never had it happen." 
<P>
(h) Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently 
    after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy 
    pickup with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was 
    a perfect fit).  However, when electricity heated the 
    bullet, it went off and shot him in the knee.
