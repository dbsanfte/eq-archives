Two whales, a male and female, are swimming off the coast of Japan when 
the male whale looks up and sees the whaling ship that killed his father 
five years ago.  Excited at the opportunity to avenge his father's 
death, the male whale says to the female "Let's go underneath the ship 
and blow air through our blow holes.  That ought to knock their boat 
over, and make them think twice about killing innocent whales."  The 
female whale agrees, and the plan works perfectly.
<P>
Once the whaling ship has completely sunk, the male whale notices that 
most of the sailors are making their way back to the shore by either 
swimming or in lifeboats.  Not willing to let them get away so easily, 
the male whale yells "They're going to shore - Let's go gobble them up!" 
Just then, the female whale becomes less cooperative: "HEY!", she says, 
"I agreed to the blow job, but there is NO WAY I'm swallowing seamen!
