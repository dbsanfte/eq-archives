There'll be times<BR>
When my crimes<BR>
Will seem almost unforgivable<BR>
I give in to sin<BR>
Because you have to make this life liveable<BR>
But when you think I've had enough<BR>
From your sea of love<BR>
I'll take more than another riverfull<BR>
And I'll make it all worthwhile<BR>
I'll make your heart smile<BR>
<BR>
Strangelove<BR>
Strange highs and strange lows<BR>
Strangelove<BR>
That's how my love goes<BR>
Strangelove<BR>
Will you give it to me<BR>
Will you take the pain<BR>
I will give to you<BR>
Again and again<BR>
And will you return it<BR>
<BR>
There'll be days<BR>
When I'll stray<BR>
I may appear to be <BR>
Constantly out of reach<BR>
I give in to sin <BR>
Because I like to practise what I preach<BR>
I'm not trying to say<BR>
I'll have it all my way<BR>
I'm always willing to learn<BR>
When you've got something to teach<BR>
And I'll make it all worthwhile<BR>
I'll make your heart smile<BR>
<BR>
Pain will you return it<BR>
I'll say it again -- pain<BR>
Pain will you return it <BR>
I won't say it again<BR>
<BR>
I give in<BR>
Again and again<BR>
I give in<BR>
Will you give it to me<BR>
I give in<BR>
I'll say it again <BR>
I give in<BR>
<BR>
I give in<BR>
Again and again<BR>
I give in <BR>
That's how my love goes<BR>
I give in<BR>
I'll say it again <BR>
I give in<BR>

<P>
