An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front porch, reflecting
on her long life, when--all of a sudden--a fairy godmother appears in front of
her and informs her that she will be granted three wishes.
<P>
"Well, now," says the old lady, "I guess I would like to be really rich."
<P>
*** POOF ***
<P>
Her rocking chair turns to solid gold.
<P>
"And, gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful princess."
<P>
*** POOF ***
<P>
She turns into a beautiful young woman.  "Your third wish?" asked the fairy godmother.  Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front of them.
<P>
"Ooh--can you change him into a handsome prince?" she asks.
<BR>
*** POOF ***
<P>
There before her stands a young man more handsome than anyone could   
possibly imagine.
<P>
She stares at him, smitten.  With a smile that makes her knees weak, he   
saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:
<P>
"Bet you're sorry you had me neutered."
<P>
