A woman was trying to board a bus, but her skirt was too
tight and she couldn't step up.  She reached behind her
and lowered the zipper a bit and tried again.
<P>
The Skirt was still too tight.  She reached
behind her and lowered the zipper some more.
<P>
She still couldn't get on the bus and lowered the
zipper a third time. All of the sudden, she felt two hands
on her butt, which proceeded to push her up onto the bus.
<P>
She spun around, with anger in her eyes and said very
indignantly, "Sir, I do not know you well enough for
you to behave in such a manner!!"
<P>
The man smiled coyly and said, "Lady, I don't know you
well enough for you to unzip my fly three times either!"
<P>
