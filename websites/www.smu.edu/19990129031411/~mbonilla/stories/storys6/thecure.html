A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office.<BR>
<BR>
After his checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone.<BR>
<BR>
He said, "Your husband is suffering from a very severe disease, combined with horrible stress. If you don't do the following, your husband will surely die."<BR>
<BR>
"Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast.  Be pleasant, and make sure he is in a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal.<BR>
<BR>
For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with chores, as he probably had a hard day.<BR>
<BR>
Don't discuss your problems with him, it will only make his stress worse. And most importantly. make love with your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim." If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely.<BR>
<BR>
On the way home, the husband asked his wife. "What did the doctor say?"<BR>
<BR>
"You're going to die," she replied.<BR>
