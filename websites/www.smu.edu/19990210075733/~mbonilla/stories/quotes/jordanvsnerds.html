In answer to the eternal question "Is it better to be a jock or a nerd?"<BR>
I submit the following:<BR>
    <BR>
Michael Jordan will make over $300,000 a game: $10,000 a minute, assuming he averages about 30 minutes per game.<BR>
    <BR>
Assuming $40 million in endorsements next year, he'll be making $178,100 a day (working or not)!<BR>
    <BR>
Assuming he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head.<BR>
    <BR>
If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there.<BR>
    <BR>
If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it.<BR>
    <BR>
He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage (after the wage hike)<BR>
    <BR>
He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends.<BR>
    <BR>
If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours.<BR>
    <BR>
If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second.<BR>
    <BR>
He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be 'reimbursed' $33,390 for that round.<BR>
    <BR>
Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into his tax deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 for such accounts at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st, 1997.<BR>
    <BR>
If you were given a tenth of a penny for every dollar he made, you'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year.<BR>
    <BR>
He'll make about $19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics.<BR>
    <BR>
He'll make about $15,600 while the Boston Marathon is being run.<BR>
    <BR>
While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600.<BR>
    <BR>
Next year, he'll make more than twice as much as all of our past presidents for all of their terms combined.<BR>
    <BR>
    <BR>
Amazing isn't it?  BUT:<BR>
    <BR>
JORDAN WILL HAVE TO SAVE 100% OF HIS INCOME FOR 270 YEARS TO HAVE A NET WORTH EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF BILL GATES.<BR>
    <BR>
    <BR>
NERDS RULE!  NERDS RULE!  NERDS RULE!<BR>
