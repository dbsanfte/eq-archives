A phone company rep called yesterday to convince me that I need a CALLER IDENTIFICATION box. We talked for 20 minutes - I, about how the world needs less technology, and she, about how the box is like a peephole in your front door and about the virtues of knowing that you missed a call from your mother.<BR>
<BR>
In my opinion, the existence of this box is creepy, and has created two problems for me personally.<BR>
#1. If you dial a wrong number and get somebody with caller ID, that cretin will call you back just to see who you are and to ask why you called. I've had this conversation with a subscriber:<BR>
My phone rings.<BR>
Me: Hello?<BR>
Subscriber: (pause) Yeah, who is this?<BR>
Me: What?<BR>
Subscriber: Who IS this? You called me.<BR>
Me: Actually, I think YOU called ME. I'm pretty sure my phone just rang and I answered it. So YOU called ME. Who is this?<BR>
Subscriber: This is Dale. You called me before, earlier today.<BR>
Me: I don't think I called you, Dale.<BR>
Subscriber: Yeah you did, your number is on the box.<BR>
Me: Oh, Ok. I get it. Dale, I dialed your number by accident. I don't know you, but I'm a friend of Chip's. Is he there?<BR>
Subscriber: Who?<BR>
Me: Your roommate, Chip.<BR>
Subscriber: I don't have no roommate.<BR>
Me: Say goodbye, Dale. You don't know me. I dialed your number by accident.<BR>
<BR>
Problem #2: spy anxiety: you don't know if THEY know.<BR>
<BR>
There is a new, uninvited element in communication protocol. Should you call back someone who didn't leave a message? I say no. Do you wonder if someone has the box as you are about to hang up on their answering machine? Do you feel like a stalker if they know you called and hung up?<BR>
<BR>
Now that the box exists, you have to explain to your friends why you called six times in an hour and never left a message on the answering machine.<BR>
<BR>
I tried to explain this problem to the phone woman, who couldn't understand why I don't have the courtesy to leave a message when I call somebody. "If I left a message, they would have no use for the box, would they?" I offered, and "seems like the box is to find out what jerks didn't have the courtesy to leave a message. Your box is making a jerk out of me, and I don't want to know what jerk  friends of mine are calling and not leaving messages."<BR>
<BR>
I rambled on about how conveneince and efficiency and technology and television are creating isolation and removing the human touch, blah, blah, blah, and when was the last time you got a hand-written letter from a friend, and I bet those high school kids who are blowing away their classmates with automatic weapons had caller ID and got pissed off at prank phone callers. By the end of the conversation the salesperson promised me a hand-written letter about the virtues of the box. I spoke with her supervisor who promised to include some tourist information on Orlando (where they were calling from what sounded like a crowded bar - 60 people in a room, she admitted with apology, un-separated at tables, yacking in headsets and staring blankly at 59 other yackers.),if that's what I really wanted.<BR>
<BR>
I asked what would have happened if I hadn't answered the phone for this call - "Would you have left a message on my answering machine?"<BR>
<BR>
She said, "no, we don't have callback capability."<BR>
<BR>
"What would my caller ID box be reading right now," I asked.<BR>
<BR>
"OUT OF AREA," she said.<BR>
<BR>
"Sounds useful. I'll sign up when I get your letter."<BR>
