A guy on a cruise gets shipwrecked on a desert island . He finds
himself alone with Cindy Crawford.  Stretching his
powers of persuasion to the limit, he suggests that even though
he's a pretty average-looking guy, they're both in for a long
period of sexual frustration before they get rescued, so they
might as well decide to begin a physical relationship
immediately.  Cindy thinks this over and, much to
the guy's surprise, accepts.
<P>
For the first week, it's the best sex they've ever had [well,
OK, more like the best sex HE's ever had].
<P>
During the second week, it's still pretty good, but the guy
begins to feel like something is missing.
<P>
By the end of the third week, the guy is having a hard time
getting motivated.
<P>
So one day he calls Cindy over to him and suggests that she try
his shirt on.  She is puzzled, but complies.  He regards her for
a moment and shakes his head; not good enough.
<P>
He then has her put his pants on.  Looks her over.  Nope, not
quite.
<P>
Then he gives her his shoes and hat, and she puts them on.
Almost, he thinks.
<P>
Finally he suggests that she start acting like a guy.  Cindy
doesn't understand this at all.  Just pretend you're a guy for
15 minutes, he says.
<P>
Cindy does her best to act like a guy.  Evidently it's good
enough.  The guy steps up to her, throws an arm around her in a
fraternal sort of way, and says, "Man!  You are not gonna
BELIEVE who I've been sleeping with for the past three weeks!"
<P>
