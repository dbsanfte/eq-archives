A beautiful woman went to a gynecologist.  The doctor took one look at this woman and all his professionalism went out the window. He immediately told her to undress.  After she had disrobed, the doctor began to stroke her thigh.  Doing so, he asked her, "Do you know what I'm doing?"<BR>
"Yes," she replied, "you're checking for any abrasions or dermatological abnormalities."<BR>
"That is right," said the doctor. He then began to fondle her breasts.  "Do you know what I'm doing now?" he asked.  <BR>
"Yes," the woman said, "you're checking for any lumps or breast cancer."  <BR>
"Correct," replied the shady doctor. Finally, he mounted his patient and started having sexual intercourse with her.  He asked,  "Do you know what I'm doing now?" <BR>
"Yes," she said.  "You're getting herpes, which is why I came here in the first place."<BR>
