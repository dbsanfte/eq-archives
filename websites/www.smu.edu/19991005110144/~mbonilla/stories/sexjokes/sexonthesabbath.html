A man wonders if having sex on the Sabbath is a sin because he is not sure if sex is work or play. So he goes to a priest and asks for his opinion on this question.<BR>
<BR>
After consulting the Bible, the priest says, " My son, after an exhaustive search, I am positive that sex is work and is therefore not permitted on Sundays."<BR>
<BR>
The man thinks: " What does a priest know about sex?" So he goes to a minister, who after all is a married man and experienced in this matter. <BR>
<BR>
He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and therefore not for the Sabbath!<BR>
<BR>
Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out the ultimate authority: a man of thousands of years tradition and knowledge. In other words, he goes to a rabbi. The Rabbi ponders the question, then states, " My son, sex is definitely play."<BR>
<BR>
The man replies, "Rabbi, how can you be so sure when so many others tell me sex is work?"<BR>
<BR>
The Rabbi softly speaks, "If sex were work, my wife would have the maid do it."<BR>
