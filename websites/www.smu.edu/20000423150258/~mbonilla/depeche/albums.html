<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/speakandspell.html">Speak and Spell</A></FONT> ~~  Their first album, it's a good record, although the early stuff isn't really my favorite (before Black Celebration/Some Great Reward)  This album has the classic Just Can't Get Enough.  Also this is the only record in which Vince Clark(now of Erasure) made while he was in Depeche Mode.  
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/abrokenframe.html">A Broken Frame</A></FONT> ~~ I think this is their worst record.  It has a few good songs (See You) on it, but for the most part, this is my least favorite album.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<a href="pictures/constructiontimeagain.html">Construction Time Again</A>
</FONT> ~~ This is a good record, It has some great tracks on it like People are People and Everything Counts (which, btw, is wonderful live.  imagine 20,000 people singing &quot;The grabbing hands, grab all they can, everything counts in large amounts&quot;)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/peoplearepeople.html">People are People</a></FONT> ~~ This album was released for US audiences that didn't all ready know about Depeche Mode.  The album has songs from the older records but overall it's a good record.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/somegreatreward.html">Some Great Reward</a></FONT> ~~ This record has some wonderful songs on it.  Somebody, Master and Servant, Blasphemous Rumours, and also People are People is on this record.  
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/catchingupwithmainframe.html">Catching Up With Depeche Mode </a></FONT>~~ This is the singles collection from 1980 - 1984.  A great album to pick up if you want to get the best songs from dM but don't want to buy all the records.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/blackcelebration.html">Black Celebration</a></FONT> ~~  This album is wonderful.  It has so many great songs, I always love sitting back and listening to this album.  It has the songs Stripped, A Question of Time, A Question of Lust, Black Celebration, But Not Tonight, and on and on.  Many people find this album to be dM's best.  This comes as a very close second to Music for the Masses as my favorite.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/musicforthemasses.html">Music for the Masses</a></FONT> ~~ This is my favorite dM record.  It seems this record always finds its way into my cd player.  Never Let Me Down Again is one of my favorite all time songs.  And I couldn't forget to mention Behing the Wheel or Strangelove.  This album is defintely one of their most danceable, I think this is one reason why I enjoy this record so much.  Listen to this record to hear some of the best work ever done by dM.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">101</FONT> ~~ The live album from Music for the Masses.  This record was recorded live in front of 65,000 people at the Rose Bowl.  If you want to get a feel for how Depeche Mode is live, take 101 for a listen.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/violator.html">Violator</a></FONT> ~~ Another great record.  It has the songs Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence (Another one of my all time favorites), and also World In My Eyes.  This record is great.  Even the B-sides to the singles were wonderful.  Happiest girl and Sea of Sin from the World in My Eyes single could have easily been good enought to be put on the album.  
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/songsoffaithanddevotion.html">Songs of Faith and Devotion</a></FONT> ~~ This record is dark and moody. dM used a lot more guitar on this record than ever before.  You can hear this in the rock inspired I Feel You.  But you can also hear it on other tracks like Walking in my shoes, and also In Your Room.  Still, I still like this record alot. (what can I say, I like them all alot, it's dM! : )
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/songsoffaithlive.html">Songs of Faith and Devotion Live</a></FONT> ~~ The live versions of the album.  I Feel You sounds incredible live.  It's one of the best songs I've ever seen performed live.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="pictures/ultra.html">Ultra</a></FONT> ~~ The newest record.  I have to say that I really like this record.  It has a nice slow pace.   Although I wish they had added some more danceable tracks, I still really like this album a lot. Its more of a follow up to Violator than to Songs of Faith and Devtion.  I'll let you know what I think after I've listened to it a few hundred more times. : )
