A rabbi, a medicine man, and a catholic priest are sitting on a boat, fishing. The medicine man's line gets caught on a rock, so he gets out of the boat, walks out onto the water, unhooks it and gets back into the boat.  
<P>
A little later, the rabbi's line gets caught on the same rock.  He gets out of the boat, walks out onto the water and unhooks the line.  After even longer, the priest's line gets caught on the very same rock.  The priest gets out of the boat, starts walking on the water, then falls in.
<P>
The rabbi looks at the medicine man and says, "think we should tell him where the rocks are?"
