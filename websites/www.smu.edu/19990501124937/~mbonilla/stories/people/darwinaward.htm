You may recall last year's Darwin Award winner: The man who found out
moments before making a 300 MPH dent in an Arizona cliff that the JATO(jet
assist take off) unit he'd strapped to his car could not be turned off
once it was turned on.
<P>
Darwin awards are (by definition) granted posthumously. This citation
is bestowed upon (the remains of) that individual, who through single-minded
self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove undesirable elements from the
human gene pool.

[Unknown, 25 March]<BR>
A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own flatulance. There was no mark on his body, but an autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods.  It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing from the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. had he been outside, or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal. But the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. He was a &quot;big man with a huge capacity for creating (this deadly gas).&quot; Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized.

[AP, Cairo Egypt, 31 Aug 1995]<BR>
Six people drowned trying to rescue a chicken that had fallen into a well in southern Egypt. An 18 year old farmer was the first to descend into the 60 foot well. He drowned, apparently after an undercurrent in the water pulled him down, police said. His sister and two brothers, none of whom could swim well, went in one by one to help him, but also drowned. Two elderly farmers then came to help, but they were apparently pulled down by the same undercurrent. The bodies of the six were later pulled out of a well in the village of Nazlat Imara, 240 miles south of Cairo. The chicken was also pulled out. It survived.

Here are some more examples of the intelligence challenged

[Times of London]<BR>
A thief who sneaked into a hospital was scarred for life when he tried to get a suntan. After evading security staff at Odstock Hospital in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and helping himself to doctors' paging devices, the thief spotted a vertical sunbed. He walked into the unit and removed his clothing for a 45 minute tan. However, the high-voltage UV machine at the hospital, which is renowned for its treatment of burn victims, has a maximum dosage of 10 seconds. After lying on the bed for almost 300 times the recommended maximum time, the man was covered in blisters. Hours later, when the pain of the burns became unbearable, he went to Southampton General Hospital, 20 miles away, in Hampshire. Staff became suspicious because he was wearing a doctor's coat. After tending his wounds, they called the police. Southampton police said: &quot;This man broke into Odstock and decided he fancied a quick suntan. Doctors say he is going to be scarred for life.

In case you've forgotten about the 1995 awardees, some of them are listed below.:
<P>
James Burns, 34, of Alamo, Mich., was killed in March as he was trying to repair what police describe as a &quot;farm-type truck.&quot; Burns got a friend to drive the truck on a highway while Burns hung underneath so that he could ascertain the source of a troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and the other man found Burns &quot;wrapped in the drive shaft.&quot;
<P>
Same thing here in MI. Seems some poor fella thought it would be a good idea to &quot;remove&quot; a downed power line from his car. Newspaper reports state that it took a FULL MINUTE of neighbors whacking away at him with a 2x4 to free their freshly fried former friend from the fatal flashing.
<P>
[Bowling Green, Ohio]<BR>

<P>
David Posman, 33, was arrested recently in Providence, R.I, after allegedly knocking out an armored car driver and stealing the closest four bags of money.

<P>
The Belgium news agency Belga reported in November that a man suspected of robbing a jewelry store in Liege said he couldn't have done it *because he was busy breaking into a school at the same time.*  Police then arrested him for breaking into the school. 
<P>
Drug-possession defendant Christopher so-and-so, on trial in March in Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant.  The prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in Christopher's jacket could have been a gun.  Nonsense, said Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court. He handed it over so the judge could see it.  The judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and laughed so hard he required a five-minute recess to compose himself. 
<P>
Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz gave himself five-inch-long welts in March when he tried to iron his polo shirt while wearing it.  "I've ironed that way five or six times," he said, "and never had it happen." 
<P>
Dave so-and-so of Anniston, Alabama, was injured recently after he attempted to replace a tubelike fuse in his Chevy pickup with a 22-caliber rifle bullet (used because it was a perfect fit).  However, when electricity heated the bullet, it went off and shot him in the knee.
