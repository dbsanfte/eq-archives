1. Learn to work the toilet seat. If you've managed to lift it up, gravity is on your side when it comes to putting it back down.<BR>
<BR>
2. Sometimes, we are not thinking about having sex.<BR>
<BR>
3. "I ate it, didn't I?" is not considered praise.<BR>
<BR>
4. Your responsibility for raising children does NOT end at conception.<BR>
<BR>
5. Get rid of your comb-over. It's not different -- it's just as ridiculous as every other comb over. You're losing your hair -- face it.<BR>
<BR>
6. An order of takeout ribs and a Chris Farley movie is not everybody's idea of a good time.<BR>
<BR>
7. "Yeah yeah, you look fine" is not a compliment.<BR>
<BR>
8. Yes, I DO tell my best friend everything.<BR>
<BR>
9. You have enough ballcaps.<BR>
<BR>
10. You have too many t-shirts.<BR>
<BR>
11. You're too old to wear a goatee.<BR>
<BR>
12. Every actor we find attractive is not gay. You can stop using this one -- we've all heard it.<BR>
<BR>
13. A hug is not always a prelude to sex.<BR>
<BR>
14. When we ask "are you listening," we already know you're not.<BR>
<BR>
15. Your best friend is an idiot.<BR>
<BR>
16. Nothing says "I love you" like offering to go to the grocery store.<BR>
<BR>
17. If you can rebuild the carburetor on a '66 Mustang, working the washing machine should be a snap.<BR>
<BR>
18. Yes and no are sometimes acceptable answers -- grunts and blank stares are not.<BR>
<BR>
19. A sore back that prevents you from doing household chores for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
20. Underwear is like a car. After five years, it needs to be replaced with a newer model.<BR>
<BR>
21. A romantic weekend getaway does not involve baiting a hook.<BR>
<BR>
22. Slapping us on the butt and saying "how bout getting me a cold one" is not foreplay.<BR>
<BR>
23. The missionary position is best left to missionaries.<BR>
<BR>
24. Rolling over and mumbling "I've got to get some sleep" does not produce an afterglow.<BR>
<BR>
25. If it was really good for me...you wouldn't have to ask.<BR>
