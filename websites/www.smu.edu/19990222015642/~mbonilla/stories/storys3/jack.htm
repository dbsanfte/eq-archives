<P>
Many people are at a loss for a response when someone<BR>
says:  "You don't know Jack Schitt."  Now you can handle this<BR>
situation with aplomb!<BR>
<BR>
Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt and Oh Schitt.<BR>
Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married Oh Schitt,<BR>
the owner of Kneedeep Schitt Inn.  In turn, Jack Schitt<BR>
married Noe Schitt and the deeply religious couple produced<BR>
six children.<BR>
<BR>
Holy Schitt, their first, unfortunately passed on shortly<BR>
after childbirth.  Next came twin sons, Deep Schitt and<BR>
Dip Schitt; two daughters, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt;<BR>
and another son, Bull Schitt.  Against his parents' objections,<BR>
Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout.<BR>
Dip Schitt married Lotta Schitt and they produced a Mongoloid<BR>
son, Chicken Schitt.  Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were<BR>
inseparable throughout their childhood, and married the Happens<BR>
brothers in a joyous dual ceremony.  The Schitt-Happens children<BR>
<BR>
Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world.<BR>
He recently returned to the family farm with his new bride,<BR>
Pisa Schitt, on his arm.  The young couple is awaiting the<BR>
imminent arrival of Baby Schitt.<BR>
<BR>
Now when someone tells you that you don't know Jack Schitt,<BR>
you can gently correct them.<BR>
