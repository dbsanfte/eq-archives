Remember that summer you spent with your parents in Hawaii and how mad you were that they made you go?  And how you were hopelessly bored until you saw the most gorgeous man you'd ever encountered strolling down the beach looking at you, skillfully removing your skimpy bikini with his piercing eyes?  And how you spent the last month imagining him taking you in every possible way, masturbating feverishly day and night, wishing he would reappear, but he never did because you were 15 and he would have gone to jail?  That was me, and you just turned 18.<BR>
