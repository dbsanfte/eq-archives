A Frenchman and an Italian were seated next to an American on an overseas flight. After a few cocktails, the men began discussing their home lives.<BR>
<BR>
"Last night I made love to my wife four times," the Frenchman bragged, "and this morning she made me delicious crepes and she told me how much she adored me."<BR>
<BR>
"Ah, last night I made love to my wife six times," the Italian responded, "and this morning she made me a wonderful omelet and told me she could never love another man."<BR>
<BR>
When the American remained silent, the Frenchman smugly asked, "And how many times did you make love to your wife last night?"<BR>
<BR>
"Once," he replied.<BR>
<BR>
"Only once?" the Italian arrogantly snorted. "And what did she say to you this morning?"<BR>
<BR>
"Don't stop."<BR>
