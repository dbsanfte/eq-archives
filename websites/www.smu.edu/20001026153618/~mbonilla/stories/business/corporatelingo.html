Here's a little clarification of typical corporate lingo.<BR>

<BR>

COMPETITIVE SALARY:<BR>

We remain competitive by paying less than our competitors.<BR>

<BR>

JOIN OUR FAST-PACED COMPANY:<BR>

We have no time to train you and you'll have to introduce yourself to your co-workers.<BR>

<BR>

SEEKING ENTHUSIASTIC, FUN, HARD WORKING, PEOPLE:<BR>

...who still live with their parents and won't mind our internship-level salaries.<BR>

<BR>

CASUAL WORK ATMOSPHERE:<BR>

We don't pay enough to expect that you'll dress up; well, a couple of the real daring guys wear ear rings.<BR>

<BR>

JOIN OUR DYNAMIC TEAM:<BR>

We all listen to nutty motivational tapes.<BR>

<BR>

MUST BE DEADLINE ORIENTED:<BR>

You'll be six months behind schedule on your first day.<BR>

<BR>

SOME OVERTIME REQUIRED:<BR>

Some time each night and some time each weekend.<BR>

<BR>

DUTIES WILL VARY:<BR>

Anyone in the office can boss you around.<BR>

<BR>

MUST HAVE AN EYE FOR DETAIL:<BR>

We have no quality control.<BR>

<BR>

COLLEGE DEGREE PREFERRED:<BR>

Unless you wasted those four years studying something useless like philosophy or English.<BR>

<BR>

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE:<BR>

We've filled the job; our call for resumes is just a legal formality.<BR>

<BR>

SEEKING CANDIDATES WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE:<BR>

You'll need it to replace three people who just left.<BR>

<BR>

PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS A MUST:<BR>

You're walking into a company in perpetual chaos.<BR>

<BR>

REQUIRES TEAM LEADERSHIP SKILLS:<BR>

You'll have the responsibilities of a manager, without the pay or respect.<BR>

<BR>

GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS:<BR>

Management communicates, you listen, figure out what they want, and then do it.<BR>
