<BR>
There is a bear on the bank of the lake, and he is saying "If that fly would drop six inches, the fish would jump out to get it and I could grab the fish!!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a hunter in the forrest, taking aim at the bear. He says "If that fly would drop six inches, then the fish would jump out and the bear would reach for the fish and come into the clear, then I could shot it!!!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a mouse, hidden behind the hunter. He is looking at the hunter's cheese sandwich. He say's "If that fly would drop six inches, the fish would go for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, the  hunter would put down his cheese sandwich and go to shoot the bear and  I could grab the cheese sandwich!!!!"<BR>
