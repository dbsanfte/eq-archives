A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to
the stand in a trial--a grandmotherly, elderly woman.  He
approached her and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"
<P>
She responded, "Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I've
known you since you were a young boy.  And frankly, you've
been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your
wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their
backs. You think you're a rising big shot when you haven't the
brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a
two-bit paper pusher.  Yes, I know you."
<P>
The lawyer was stunned.  Not knowing what else to do he
pointed across the room and asked,  "Mrs. Williams, do you
know the defense attorney?"
<P>
She again replied, "Why, yes I do.  I've known Mr. Bradley since
he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents.
And he, too, has been a real disappointment to me.  He's lazy,
bigoted, he has a drinking problem.  The man can't build a
normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of
the shoddiest in the entire state.  Yes, I know him."
<P>
At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and
called both counselors to the bench.  In a very quiet voice, he
said with menace, "If either of you asks her if she knows me,
you'll be in jail for contempt within 5 minutes!"
<P>
