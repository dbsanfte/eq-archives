Hello fellow web surfer.  You've reached my personal page.  Here's where you get to learn all about me.
<p>
Alright, I'm a 24 year old Latin male, and I attending <FONT COLOR="#1a0158"><a href="http://www.smu.edu/" TARGET="_top">Southern Methodist University</a></FONT>.  Right now I'm getting a second degree in computer science (Jan 98, I'll be done in May 99!).  I all ready have one in biology.  I just have a strong desire to collect degrees. hehe
<p>
Now back to the task at hand.  I'm from Denison, Texas, which is near the Texas-Oklahoma border.  Now Denison isn't very big, and it isn't much fun, but at least we have lots of movie theaters, a mall, and most modern conveniences. Anyways, Denison is cool just to go back and hang out in, but I prefer to stay here in Dallas, where at least there is always something to do.  You can always find some bar or club to go out to.  Now the only problem with Dallas is that if your under 21 or ID impaired, you really don't have all that many choices to go to.  And the few choices that you do have aren't really that good.
<p>
Let's see, what else is there.  Oh yeah! I've got one older sister who the coolest sister anyone on the planet could hope for.  She works for GTE directories.  I've got a younger <A HREF="http://www.smu.edu/~fbonilla/">brother</A> who's also going to SMU.  He's definitely a cool brother.  I think that its kind of unusual to have a brother and sister who get along so well with each other.  Usually there's always some kind of dislike between siblings, but my family just happens to be different.
<P>
My mom and dad are the best parents that anyone could ask for. Always there and always understanding, they're the biggest reason that I am who I am. My parents are from El Salvador. They came here to Texas where my dad now works as a doctor in Denison. 
<P>

I can't foget to mention my girlfriend! (she kill me if i didn't. (hehehe) Trisha (here is a <A HREF="pictures/meandmario.jpg">pic</A> of us,  she's such a cutie isn't she?) is really wonderful and sweet.&nbsp; Its been great going out with her these last few months.&nbsp; Here's her <A href="http://www.geocities.com/Southbeach/Lounge/7555/">page</A> if you want to visit her. :)
<P> -->  
Ok so I can't forget about my friends.  My first group is the one where It's my sister, Lise, Kristina, Susan, and James.  These are the ones I hang out with on the weekends at the Dubliner.  Big fun there everyone! Check it out sometime if you can. : )
<P>
Joe's the maniac computer science engineer and was my roommate for three years. He does way too much work for his own good, but Joe's a cool guy, and he's also a Latin brother, seeing as he's Cuban and all.  Then there's Michelle A.  She's a cutie and a big sweetheart.  Only problem though is she's in Kansas City, so she's not really good to go out with, but she's always great to talk with. : )   And also there's Amy.  She's a super sweetheart too.  but damn, she's in Pennsylvania.  This is no good also! hehe
<P>
There's also Sarah and Orlando.  They had to put up with me during the Monopoly drama (and i put up with them : )   But they're lots of fun and it was really cool corrupting Sarah this semester. *grin*  Yep, me and Orlando turned our geeky, square friend into a stumble down, slurred speech drinking buddy!! woohoo!!!!!  (it's not really that bad, but i do have to mess a little with Sarah because its just so fun. : )
<P>
And one last thing! I just have to say hello to all my fun online friends. : )  You guys are always tons of fun to chat it up with and just be silly with!

<CENTER><H3>Curly Hair</H3></CENTER>
I also have the curliest hair on the planet.  Not good for styling, but it's great to amuse women with at the bars.  <BR><CENTER>--example--</CENTER><br>
Oh! what great curly hair.  Can I play with it?<BR>
Oh yeah, go right ahead.  She proceeds to play with my curls, stretching them so far out of place that afterwards I look like Kramer on a really bad hair day, effectively ruining my chances of getting anywhere with any girl for the rest of the night. :)
