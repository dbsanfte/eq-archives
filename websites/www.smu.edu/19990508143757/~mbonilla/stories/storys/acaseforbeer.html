A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when
the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that
are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,
because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving
by the regular culling of the weakest members.
<P>
In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the
slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off
brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells
first.
<P>
In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain
cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.
<P>
