A married woman is having an affair.  Whenever her lover comes over, she puts her nine year old son in the closet.  One day the woman hears a car in the driveway and puts her lover in the closet, as well.<BR>
       <BR>
Inside the closet, the little boy says, "It sure is dark in here, isn't it?<BR>
       <BR>
"Yes it is," the man replies.<BR>
       <BR>
"You wanna buy a baseball?" the little boy asks.<BR>
       <BR>
"No thanks," the man replies.<BR>
       <BR>
"I think you do want to buy a baseball," the little boy says firmly.<BR>
       <BR>
The man considers the position he is in for a moment.  "Uh, I see.  You're right, I do want to buy the ball.  How much?"<BR>
       <BR>
Twenty-five dollars," the little extortionist replies.<BR>
       <BR>
"TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?!" the man repeats incredulously, but then  shakes his head and complies to protect his hidden position.<BR>
       <BR>
The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again when she hears a car in the driveway and, again, places him in the closet with her little boy.<BR>
       <BR>
"It sure is dark in here, isn't it?" the boy starts off.<BR>
       <BR>
"Yes it is," replies the man.<BR>
       <BR>
"Wanna buy a baseball glove?" the little boy asks.<BR>
       <BR>
"OK.  How much this time?" the hiding lover responds.<BR>
       <BR>
"Fifty dollars," the boy replies and the transaction is completed.<BR>
       <BR>
The next weekend, the little boy's father says, "Hey, son.  Go get your ball and glove and we'll play some catch."<BR>
       <BR>
"I can't.  I sold them," replies the little boy.<BR>
       <BR>
"What did you get for them?" asks the father, expecting to hear about lizards and candy and preparing a lecture about how valuable the baseball and glove were.<BR>
       <BR>
"Seventy-five dollars," the little boy says.<BR>
       <BR>
"SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?! That's thievery! I'm taking you to the church right now. You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness!"  The father hauls the child away.<BR>
       <BR>
At the church, the little boy goes into the confessional, draws the curtain, sits down, and says "It sure is dark in here, isn't it?"<BR>
       <BR>
"Don't you start that shit again," says the priest.<BR>
