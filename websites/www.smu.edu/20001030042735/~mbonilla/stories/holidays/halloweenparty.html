<CENTER><H3>Halloween Party</H3></CENTER>

A couple was invited to a swanky masked Halloween party.  She got a terrible
headache and told her husband to go to the party alone.  He, being a devoted
husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin
and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not
going.  So he took his costume and away he went.
<P>
The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it
was still early, she decided to go to the party.  In as much as her husband did
not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching
her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him.
<P>
She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance
floor, dancing with every nice chick he could and copping a little feel here
and a little kiss there.  His wife went up to him and being a rather seductive
babe  herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new
stuff that had just arrived.
<P>
She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband.
Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off
they went to one of the cars and had a little bang.  Just before unmasking at
midnight, she slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into
bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.
<P>
She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he
had.  He said, "Oh, the same old thing.  You know I never have a good time when
you're not there."  Then she asked, "Did you dance much?"
He replied, "I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance.   When I got there,
I met Pete, Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played
poker all evening.  But I'll tell you...the guy I loaned my costume to sure had
a real good time!"
<P>
