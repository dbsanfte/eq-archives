"In retrospect, I admit it was unwise to try to gain access to my
house via the catflap," Gunter Burpus admitted to reporters in Bremen,
Germany.
<P>
"I suppose that the reason they're called cat flaps, rather than human
flaps, is because they're too small for people, and perhaps... I
should have realized that."
<P>
Burpus (41), a gardener from Breman, was relating how he had become
trapped in his own front door for two days, after losing his house keys.
<P>
"I got my head and shoulders through the flap but became trapped fast
around the waist.  At first, it all seemed rather amusing, I sang
songs and told myself jokes.  But then I wanted to go to the
lavatory.
<P>
"I began shouting for help, but my head was in the hallway, so my
screams were muffled.  After a few hours, a group of students
approached me but, instead of helping, they removed my trousers and
pants, painted my buttocks bright blue, and stuck a daffodil between
my cheeks. Then they placed a sign next to me which said 'Germany
resurgent, an essay in street art. Please give generously'.....and
left me there.
<P>
"People were passing by and, when I asked for help, they just said:
'Very good! Very clever!'  and threw coins into my trousers.
<P>
No one tried to free me. In fact, I only got free after two days
because a dog started licking my private parts and an old woman
complained to the police. The rescue services came and cut me out, but
the police arrested me as soon as I was free.  Luckily, they've now
dropped the charges, and I collected over DM3,000 ($2,000) in my
underpants, so the time wasn't entirely wasted."
