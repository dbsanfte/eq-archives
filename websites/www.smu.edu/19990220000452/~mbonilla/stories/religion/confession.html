In a small cathedral a janitor was cleaning the pews between services when he was approached by the priest.<BR>
<BR>
The priest asked the  janitor, "Could you go into the confessional and listen to confessions for me?  I really have to go to the bathroom and the Widow McGee is coming.  She tends to go on but never really does anything worthy of serious repentance, so when she's done just give her 10 hail Mary's and I'll be right back."<BR>
<BR>
Being the helpful sort, the janitor agreed.  Just as expected the Widow McGee came into the booth and started her confession.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh Father, I fear I have done the unforgivable.  I have given into carnal thoughts and have had oral sex."<BR>
<BR>
Stunned, the janitor had no idea how to handle this situation.  Surely 10 hail Mary's would not do.  So, in a moment of desperation the janitor peered his head out of the confessional and asked an alter boy, "Son, what does the priest give for oral sex?"<BR>
<BR>
In reply the alter boy said, "Two Snickers and a Coke."
