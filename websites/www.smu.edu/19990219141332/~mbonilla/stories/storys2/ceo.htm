A CEO (and member of Forbes 400!) throwing a party takes his executives on a tour of his opulent mansion. In the back of the property, the CEO has the largest swimming pool any of them has ever seen. The huge pool, however, is filled with hungry alligators. The CEO says to his executives "I think an executive should be measured by courage. Courage is what made me CEO. So this is my challenge to each of you: if anyone  has enough courage to dive into the pool, swim through those alligators, and make it to the other side, I
will give that person anything they desire. My job, my money, my house, anything!"
<P>
Everyone laughs at the outrageous offer and proceeds to follow the  CEO on the tour of the estate. Suddenly, they hear a loud splash.  Everyone turns around and sees the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) in the pool, swimming for his life. He dodges the alligators left and right and makes it to the edge of the pool with seconds to spare. He pulls
himself out just as a huge alligator snaps at his shoes. The flabbergasted CEO approaches the CFO and says, "You are amazing. I've never seen anything like it in my life. You are brave beyond measure and anything I own is yours. Tell me what I can do for you."
<P>
The CFO, panting for breath, looks up and says, "You can tell me who the hell pushed me in the pool!!"
