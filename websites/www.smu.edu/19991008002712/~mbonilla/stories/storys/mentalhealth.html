Thank you for calling the mental health hotline.  
<P>
If you're obsessive/compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.  
<P>
If you're co-dependent, ask someone to press 2 for you.  
<P>
If you're a multiple personality, press 3 4 5 and 6.  
<P>
If you're paranoid and delusional, we already know what you want and who you are.  Just stay on the line while we trace your call. 
<P>
If you're schizophrenic, please hold, and a little voice will tell what to press.  
<P>
If you're depressed, it probably doesn't matter what you press, it won't do you any good anyway.
<P>
