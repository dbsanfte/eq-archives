There were these two nude statues in a park, male and female, who always stared at each other. One day, a wizard came up to them and said, "this is your 200th anniversary so I am going to give you just 30 minutes of 
humanity so spend it well." The wizard waved his wand and the two statues went behind one 
of the big trees and the wizard heard giggles laughs and saw a little hanky 
panky but nothing much. After fifteen minutes they came out exhausted and the wizard 
asked why don't they do it again so as not to waste their 15 minutes. The male 
statue said to the female statue "Ok, but this time you hold the pigeon and I crap 
on it."
