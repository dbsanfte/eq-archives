One of the most atmospheric, moodiest, darkest games ever created.  This is one of the few games where your on the edge of your seat afraid of what's going to happen next.  Fear that as soon as you press that button, some of the nastiest monsters ever created are going to come after you.

This is a super cool strategy game.  You build up a civilization, grown your military power and then go and conquer the other guy. : )  The single player campaigns are fun, but the real action is in the multiplayer mode.  It's incredibly fun playing against other people. : )  Check it out.
