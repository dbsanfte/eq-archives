"In retrospect, I admit it was unwise to try to gain access to my house via the catflap," Gunter Burpus admitted to reporters in Bremen, Germany.
<P>
"I suppose that the reason they're called cat flaps, rather than human flaps, is because they're too small for people, and perhaps... I should have realized that."
<P>
Burpus (41), a gardener from Breman, was relating how he had become trapped in his own front door for two days, after losing his house keys.
<P>
"I got my head and shoulders through the flap but became trapped fast around the waist.  At first, it all seemed rather amusing, I sang songs and told myself jokes.  But then I wanted to go to the lavatory.
<P>
"I began shouting for help, but my head was in the hallway, so my screams were muffled.  After a few hours, a group of students approached me but, instead of helping, they removed my trousers and pants, painted my buttocks bright blue, and stuck a daffodil between my cheeks. Then they placed a sign next to me which said 'Germany resurgent, an essay in street art. Please give generously'.....and left me there.
<P>
"People were passing by and, when I asked for help, they just said: 'Very good! Very clever!'  and threw coins into my trousers.
<P>
No one tried to free me. In fact, I only got free after two days because a dog started licking my private parts and an old woman complained to the police. The rescue services came and cut me out, but the police arrested me as soon as I was free.  Luckily, they've now dropped the charges, and I collected over DM3,000 ($2,000) in my underpants, so the time wasn't entirely wasted."
