Little Johnny is passing his parents' bedroom in the middle of the night, in search of a glass of water. Hearing a lot of moaning and thumping, he peeks in and catches his folks in The Act. Before dad can even react, Little Johnny exclaims "Oh, boy! Horsie ride! Daddy, can I ride on your back?" Daddy, relieved that Johnny's not asking more uncomfortable questions, and seeing the opportunity not to break his stride, agrees. Johnny hops on and daddy starts going to town. Pretty soon mommy starts moaning and gasping. Johnny cries out "Hang on tight, Daddy! This is the part where me and the milkman usually get bucked off!"<BR>
<BR>

Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed to go to the bathroom. He yelled out, "Miss Jones, I need to take a piss!!" The teacher replied, "Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in this situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please use the word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to go." Little Johnny thinks for a bit, then says, "You're an eight, but if you had bigger tits, you'd be a ten!!!" <BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>******************************************</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
One day, during a lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show of hands for who could use the word "beautiful" in the same sentence twice. First, she called on little Suzie, who responded with, "My father bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it."<BR>
<BR>
"Very good, Suzie," replied the teacher.<BR>
<BR>
She then called on little Michael.<BR>
<BR>
"My mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully," he said.<BR>
<BR>
"Excellent, Michael!"<BR>
<BR>
Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.<BR>
<BR>
"Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was pregnant, and he said, 'Beautiful, fucking beautiful!'"<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>******************************************</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
A few months after his parents were divorced, little Johnny passed by his mom's bedroom and saw her rubbing her body and moaning, "I need a man, I need a man!" <BR>
<BR>
Over the next couple of months, he saw her doing this several times. One day, he came home from school and heard her moaning. When he peeked into her bedroom, he saw a man on top of her. Little Johnny ran into his room,  took off his clothes, threw himself on his bed, started stroking himself, and moaning, "Ohh, I need a bike! I need a bike!"<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the  following Monday.<BR>
<BR>
On the first Friday, the teacher asks, "How many grains of sand are in the beach?"<BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, no one could answer. The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, "How many stars are in the sky?" and again no one could answer. <BR>
<BR>
Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a 3 day weekend.<BR>
<BR>
So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping-pong balls and paints them black. The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day just when the teacher says, "Here's this week's question," Johnny empties the bag to the floor sending the ping-pong balls rolling to the front of the room.<BR>
<BR>
Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the <BR>
entire class starts laughing. <BR>
<BR>
The teacher says, " Okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?"<BR>
<BR>
Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, "Bill Cosby, see ya on Tuesday!"<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Little Johnny, on a day when he was being particularly reckless, was playing in the backyard one morning. Soon, some honeybees started swirling around, annoying little Johnny. He began stomping on them in his temper. His father caught him trampling the honeybees, and after a brief moment of thought said,  "That's it! No honey for you for one month!"<BR>
<BR>
Later that afternoon, Johnny pondered upon some butterflies, and soon started catching them and crushing them under his feet. His father again caught him, and after a brief moment of thought, said, "No butter for you for one month!" <BR>
<BR>
Early that evening, Johnny's mother was cooking dinner, and got jumpy  when cockroaches started scurrying around the kitchen floor. She began stomping on them one by one until all the cockroaches were dead.  Johnny's mother looked up to find Johnny and his father standing there watching her. To which Johnny said, "Are you going to tell her, daddy, or do you want me to?"<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
A teacher cautiously approaches the subject of sex education with her fourth grade class because she realizes Little Johnny's propensity for sexual innuendo. But Johnny remains attentive throughout the entire lecture. Finally, towards the end of the lesson, the teacher asks for examples of sex education from the class.<BR>
<BR>
One little boy raises his hand, "I saw a bird in her nest with some eggs."<BR>
<BR>
"Very good, William," cooed the teacher.<BR>
<BR>
"My mommy had a baby," said little Esther.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, that's nice," replied the teacher.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, little Johnny raises his hand. With much fear and trepidation, the teacher calls on him. <BR>
<BR>
"I was watchin' TV yesterday, and I saw the Lone Ranger. He was surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of Indians. And they all attacked at one time. And he killed every one of them with his two guns."<BR>
<BR>
The teacher was relieved but puzzled, "And what does that have to do with sex education, Johnny?" <BR>
<BR>
"It'll teach those Indians not to fuck with the Lone Ranger."<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>******************************************</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Little Johnny took his new chemistry set down to the basement where he stayed all afternoon mixing various liquids together. Eventually, his dad went down and found him surrounded by test tubes, pounding something into the  wall.<BR>
<BR>
"Why are you hammering a nail into the wall?" asked the dad.<BR>
<BR>
"It's not a nail," said Johnny. "It's a worm! I tried to bring this worm back to life with my special chemical mixture, but my formula made the worm hard as a rock." <BR>
<BR>
Johnny showed his dad the liquid mix that he had soaked the worm in, and his dad said, "I'll tell you what. You give me the test tube  with your special  chemical mixture in it and I'll buy you a Toyota."<BR>
<BR>
So little Johnny handed the test tube over. The next day, when Johnny got home from school, he saw a brand  new Mercedes-Benz parked in the driveway. He then asked his dad about the car.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh," said the father, "your Toyota is in the garage. The Mercedes is from your mother."<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Little Johnny came home from school one day and said to his father, "Dad, what can you tell me about politics? I have to learn about it for school tomorrow."<BR>
<BR>
The father thought some and said, "Okay, son, the best way I can describe politics is to use an analogy. Let's say that I'm capitalism because I'm the breadwinner. Your mother will be government because she controls everything, our maid will be the working class because she works forus, you will be  the  people because you answer to us, and your baby brother will be the future. Does that help any?" <BR>
<BR>
Little Johnny said, "Well, Dad, I don't know, but I'll think about what  you said." Later that night, after everyone had gone to bed, Johnny was woken up by his brother's crying. Upon further investigation, he found a dirty diaper.<BR>
<BR>
So, he went down the hall to his parent's bedroom and found his father's side of the bed empty and his mother wouldn't wake up. Then he saw a light on in the guest room down the hall, and when he reached the door, he saw  through the crack that his father was in bed with the maid. Because he couldn't do anything else, he turned and went back to bed.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning, he said to his father at the breakfast table, "Dad, I think I understand politics much better now." <BR>
<BR>
"Excellent, my boy," he answered, "What have you learned?"<BR>
<BR>
Little Johnny thought for a minute and said, "I learned that capitalism is screwing the working class, government is sound asleep ignoring the people, and the future's full of shit."<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
A Sunday School teacher of pre-schoolers was concerned that his students might be a little confused about Jesus Christ because of the Christmas season emphasis on His birth. He wanted to make sure they understood that the birth of Jesus occurred a long time ago, that He grew up, etc.<BR>
<BR>
So he asked his class, "Where is Jesus today?"<BR>
<BR>
Steven raised his hand and said, "He's in heaven."<BR>
<BR>
Mary was called on and answered, "He's in my heart."<BR>
<BR>
Little Johnny, waving his hand furiously, blurted out, "I know! I know! He's in our bathroom!!!" <BR>
<BR>
The whole class got very quiet, looked at the teacher, and waited for a response. The teacher was completely at a loss for a few very long seconds. He finally gathered his wits and asked Little Johnny how he knew this. And Little Johnny said, "Well...every morning, my father gets up, bangs on the bathroom door, and yells 'Jesus Christ, are you still in there?'<BR>
