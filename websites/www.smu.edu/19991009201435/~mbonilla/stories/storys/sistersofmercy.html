A man is driving down a deserted stretch of highway, when he notices a sign 
out of the corner of his eye.  It reads SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF 
PROSTITUTION - 10 MILES.  He thinks it was just a figment of his imagination 
and drives on without a second thought.  Soon, he sees another sign which 
says SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 5 MILES and  realizes that 
these signs are for real. When he drives past a third sign saying SISTERS OF 
MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION NEXT RIGHT, his curiosity gets the best of him 
and he pulls into the drive.
<P>
On the far side of the parking lot is a somber stone building with a 
small sign next to the door reading SISTERS OF MERCY.  He climbs the steps 
and rings the bell.  The door is answered by a nun in a long
black habit who asks, "What may we do for you, my son?"
He answers, "I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested 
in possibly doing business." "Very well, my son.  Please follow me". 
<P>
He is led through many winding passages and is soon quite disoriented. The 
nun stops at a closed door, and tells the man, "Please knock on this door". 
He does as he is told and this door is answered by another nun in a long 
habit and holding a tin cup.  This nun instructs, "Please place $50 in the 
cup, then go through the large wooden door at the end of this hallway."  He 
gets $50 out of his wallet and places it in the second nun's cup.  He trots 
eagerly down the hall and slips through the door, pulling it shut behind 
him.  As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the parking 
lot, facing another small sign:
<P>
GO IN PEACE, YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SCREWED BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY.
