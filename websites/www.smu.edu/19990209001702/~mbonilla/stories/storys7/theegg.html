<center><h3>The Egg</h3></center>

So you think your life is bad..... <BR>
<BR>
Just think how bad the life of the egg is... <BR>
<BR>
You only get laid once! <BR>
<BR>
You only get eaten once! <BR>
<BR>
It takes 4 minutes to get hard <BR>
<BR>
2 minutes to get soft <BR>
<BR>
You have to share a box with 11 other guys <BR>
<BR>
And the only chick who ever sat on your face was your mother.<BR>
