<UL>
	<LI>There is no such thing as child-proofing your house.
	<LI>If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades they can ignite.
	<LI>A 4-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.
	<LI>If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing puppy underwear and a superman cape.
	<LI>It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a 20-by-20-foot room.
	<LI>Baseballs make marks on ceilings.
	<LI>You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.
	<LI>When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit.
	<LI>A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.
	<LI>The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan.
	<LI>When you hear the toilet flush and the words "uh-oh," it's already too late.
	<LI>Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.
	<LI>A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a 36-year-old man says they can only do that in the movies.
	<LI>A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.
	<LI>If you use a waterbed as home plate while wearing baseball shoes, it does not leak - it explodes.
	<LI>A king-size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000-square-foot house 4 inches deep.
	<LI>Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a four-year-old.
	<LI>Duplos will not.
	<LI>"Play-Dough" and "microwave" should never be used in the same sentence.
	<LI>Super Glue is forever.
	<LI>McGyver can teach us many things we don't want to know.
	<LI>Ditto Tarzan.
	<LI>No matter how much Jello you put in a swimming pool, you still can't walk on water.
	<LI>Pool filters do not like Jello.
	<LI>VCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show them doing so.
	<LI>Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.
	<LI>Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.
	<LI>You probably do not want to know what that odor is.
	<LI>Always look in the oven before you turn it on.
	<LI>Plastic toys do not like ovens.
	<LI>The fire department in San Diego has at least a 5-minute response time.
	<LI>The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy.
	<LI>It will, however, make cats dizzy.
	<LI>Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.
	<LI>Quiet does not necessarily mean don't worry.
	<LI>A good sense of humor will get you through most problems in life.   
	<LI>(Unfortunately, this works almost exclusively in retrospect.)
	<LI>Enjoy your kids, they grow up way too fast.
