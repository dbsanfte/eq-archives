A little girl and her mother were shopping...<BR>
<BR>
The girl asks her mother: "How old are you?"<BR>
<BR>
The mother says: "Honey, women don't talk about their age, you'll learn later on in life."<BR>
<BR>
The girl then asks: "Mommy. How much do you weigh?"<BR>
<BR>
The mother says: "That's another thing women don't talk about, you'll find out when you are grown up."<BR>
<BR>
The girl still wanting to know about her mother asks: "Mommy, why did you and daddy get a divorce?"<BR>
<BR>
The mother says: "Honey, that is a subject that I don't want to talk about now."<BR>
<BR>
The little girl, frustrated, tells her girlfriend about how her mother didn't answer her questions.<BR>
<BR>
The girlfriend says: "All you have to do is sneak a look at your mother's drivers license. It's just like a report card, it tells you everything."<BR>
<BR>
The next day the little girl says to her mother: "Mommy, I know how old you are. You are 32 years old."<BR>
<BR>
The mother, quite shocked, asks: "Sweetheart how did you do that?"<BR>
<BR>
The girl shrugs and says: "I just know, and I know how much you weigh. You weigh 120 pounds."<BR>
<BR>
The mother is flabbergasted. She asks, "Where did you learn that?"<BR>
<BR>
The little girl says: "I just know, that's all, and I know why you and daddy got divorced. You got an 'F' in sex."<BR>
