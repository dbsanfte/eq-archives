<P>
Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question.<P>
"Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun how many would be left?"  "None," replied Johnny, "because the rest would fly away."
<P>
"Well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "But I like the way you are thinking."
<P>
Little Johnny said, "I have a question for you now.  If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one licking her cone, the second biting her cone, and the third one sucking her cone, which one is married?"<P>
"Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone?"<P>
"No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger.  But I like the way you are thinking."<P>

One day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit.<BR>
<BR>
"Now class, I'm going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of fruit, and you tell what fruit I'm talking about."<BR>
<BR>
"Okay, first:  it's round, plumb and red."<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher wisely ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An apple."<BR>
<BR>
"No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking.  Now, for the second.  It's soft, fuzzy, and colored red and brownish."<BR>
<BR>
Well, Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the teacher to call on him.  But she skips him again and calls on Billy.<BR>
<BR>
"Is it a peach?"<BR>
<BR>
"No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato.  But I like the way you're thinking.  Here's another:  it's long, yellow, and fairly hard."<BR>
<BR>
By now, Johnny is about to expolde as he waves his hand frantically.  The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally.<BR>
<BR>
"A banana," she says.<BR>
<BR>
"No," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but I like your thinking."<BR>
<BR>
Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly.<BR>
<BR>
"Hey, I've got one for you, teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket.  Okay, I've got it: it's round, hard, and it's got a head on it."<BR>
<BR>
"Johnny!"  she cries.  "That's disgusting!"<BR>
<BR>
"Nope," answers Johnny, "it's a quarter, but I like your thinking!"<BR>
