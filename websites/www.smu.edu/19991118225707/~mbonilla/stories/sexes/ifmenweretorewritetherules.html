Rule # 1<BR>
Anything we said six or eight months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after seven days.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 2<BR>
If you don't want to dress like Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 3<BR>
If we say something that can be interpreted in two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other way.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 4<BR>
It is in neither your best interest or ours to make us take those stupid Cosmo quizzes together.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 5<BR>
Let us ogle.  If we don't look at other women how can we know how pretty you are?  <BR>
<BR>
Rule # 6<BR>
Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 7<BR>
You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done - not both.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 8<BR>
Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials or time-outs.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 9<BR>
Christopher Columbus didn't need directions and neither do we.<BR>
<BR>
Rule # 10<BR>
Women who wear Wonderbras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.  <BR>
<BR>
Rule # 11<BR>
When we're turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the off ramp, you saying "This is our exit" is not necessary.<BR>
