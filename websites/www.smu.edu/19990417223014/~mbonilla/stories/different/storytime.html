Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story.  The process is simple.  Each person will pair off with  the person sitting to his or her immediate right.  One of you  will then write the first paragraph of a short story.  The  partner will read the first paragraph and then add another  paragraph to the story.  The first person will then add a third  paragraph, and so on back and forth.  Remember to reread
what has been written each time in order to keep the story  coherent.  The story is over when both agree a conclusion  has been reached.<P>

At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.  The camomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings  at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked camomile.  But she felt she  must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.  His  possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.  So  camomile was out of the question.

Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more  important things to think about than the neuroses of an  air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had  spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  "A.S. Harris to  Geostation 17," he said into his transgalactic communicator.  "Polar orbit established.  No sign of resistance so far..." But before he could sign off a bluish particle beam flashed out of  nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat  and across the cockpit.

He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically  brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities  towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4.  "Congress Passes  Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,"  Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth--when the days had  passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent  wonder at all the beautiful things around her. "Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?" she pondered  wistfully.
<P>
Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral  Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race.  Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships  were on course for Earth,  carrying enough firepower to  pulverize the entire planet.  With no one to stop them they  swiftly initiated their diabolical plan.  The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded.  The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the  ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably  massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million  other Americans. The President slammed his fist on the conference table. "We can't allow this!  I'm going to veto that  treaty!  Let's blow'em out of the sky!"
<P>
This is absurd.  I refuse to continue this mockery of  literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic,  semi-literate adolescent.      
<P>
Yeah?  Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.
<P>
You total $*&.
<P>
Stupid %&#$!.
