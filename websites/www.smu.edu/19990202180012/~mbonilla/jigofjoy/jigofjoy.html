Hello!  You've found the Jig of Joy page.  Anybody who knows me knows that I've created this thing called the jig of joy.  I cooked up the jig of joy a few years ago at one of my sister super bowl parties.  Me and Christina were there, the cowboys had just scored again, and since we had nothing better to do, we started doing this gyrating, arm moving thing that eventually evolved into the jig of joy. So, I'm going to show you how to do the jig of joy.  Enjoy!!  hehehe.
<P>

and start moving your torso lower and lower (Not very far down!)<p>
