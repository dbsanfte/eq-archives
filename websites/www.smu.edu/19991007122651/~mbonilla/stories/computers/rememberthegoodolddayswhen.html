A computer was something on TV<BR>
From a science fiction show<BR>
A window was something you hated to clean....<BR>
And ram was the cousin of a goat.....<BR>
<BR>
Meg was the name of my girlfriend<BR>
And gig was your middle finger upright<BR>
Now they all mean different things<BR>
And that really mega bytes<BR>
<BR>
An application was for employment<BR>
A program was a TV show<BR>
A cursor used profanity<BR>
A keyboard was a piano<BR>
<BR>
Memory was something that you lost with age<BR>
A CD was a bank account<BR>
And if you had a 3 1/2' floppy<BR>
You hoped nobody found out<BR>
<BR>
Compress was something you did to the garbage<BR>
Not something you did to a file<BR>
And if you unzipped anything in public<BR>
You'd be in jail for a while<BR>
<BR>
Log on was adding wood to the fire<BR>
Hard drive was a long trip on the road<BR>
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived<BR>
And a backup happened to your commode<BR>
<BR>
Cut you did with a pocket knife<BR>
Paste you did with glue<BR>
A web was a spider's home<BR>
And a virus was the flu<BR>
<BR>
I guess I'll stick to my pad and paper<BR>
And the memory in my head<BR>
I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash<BR>
But when it happens they wish they were dead.<BR>
