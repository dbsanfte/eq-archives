A man is out in the Chinese wilderness and he's
hopelessly lost. It's been nearly three weeks since he's eaten anything
besides what he could forage and he's been reduced to sleeping in caves
and under trees.
<P>
One afternoon he comes upon an old mansion in the woods.
It has vines covering most of it and the man can't see any other
buildings in the area. However, he sees smoke coming out of the
chimney implying someone is home.
<P>
He knocks on the door and an old man answers, with a
beard almost down to the ground. The old man squints his eyes
and says "What do you want?"
<P>
The man says "I've been lost for the past three weeks
and haven't had a decent meal or sleep since that time. I would
be most gracious if I could have a meal and sleep in your house
for tonight"
<P>
The old Chinese man says "I'll let you come in on one
condition: You cannot mess around with my grandaughter"
<P>
The man, exhausted and hungry readily agrees, saying "I
promise I won't cause you any trouble. I'll be on my way
tommorrow morning"
<P>
The old Chinese man counters "Ok, but if I do catch you
then I'll give you the three worst chinese torture tests ever
known to man."
<P>
"Ok, Ok" the man said as he entered the old house.
Besides, he thought to himself, what kind of woman would live
out in the wilderness all her life?
<P>
Well, that night, when the man came down to eat (after
showering), he saw how beautiful the grandaughter was. She was
an absolute pearl, and while he had only been lost three weeks,
it had been many,many months without companionship. And the girl
had only seen the occasional monk besides her grandfather and
well, they both couldn't keep their eyes off each other
throughout the meal.
<P>
That night, the man snuck into the girls' bedroom and
they had quite a time, but had kept the noise down to a minimum.
The man crept back to his room later that night thinking to
himself, "Any three torture tests would be worth it after that
experience."
<P>
Well, the next morning the man awoke to a heavy weight
on his chest. He opened his eyes and there was this huge rock on
his chest. On the rock was a sign saying "1st Chinese torture
test: 100 lb rock on your chest".
<P>
"What a lame torture test" the man thought to himself as
he got up and walked over to the window. He opened the shutter
and threw the rock out. On the backside of the rock is another
sign saying "2nd worst Chinese torture test: Rock tied to right
testicle".
<P>
The man, seeing the rock was too far out the window to
be grabbed, jumps out the window after the rock. Outside the window is a
third sign saying "3rd worst Chinese torture test: Left testicle tied to
bedpost".
<P>
