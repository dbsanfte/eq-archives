<H2>TO MY DEAR WIFE:</H2>
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times.  I have succeeded 36 times,which is an average of once every ten days.
<P>
<CENTER>The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often:
</CENTER><P>
54 times the sheets were clean<BR>
17 times it was too late<BR>
49 times you were too tired<BR>
20 times it was too hot<BR>
15 times you pretended to be asleep<BR>
22 times you had a headache<BR>
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby<BR>
16 times you said you were too sore<BR>
12 times it was the wrong time of the month<BR>
19 times you had to get up early<BR>
9 times you said weren't in the mood<BR>
7 times you were sunburned<BR>
6 times you were watching the late show<BR>
5 times you didn't want to muss your new hair-do<BR>
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us<BR>
9 times you said your mother would hear us
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 36 times I did succeed,the activity was not satisfactory because 6 times you just laid there, 8 times you reminded me there's a
crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with, 7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished, and one time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move.

<H2>TO MY DEAR HUSBAND</H2>
I think you have things a little confused.  Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did:
<P>
5 times you came home drunk and tried to fuck the cat<BR>
36 times you did not come home at all<BR>
21 times you didn't cum<BR>
33 times you came too soon<BR>
19 times you went soft before you got in<BR>
38 times you worked too late<BR>
10 times you got cramps in your toes<BR>
29 times you had to get up early to play golf<BR>
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls<BR>
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper<BR>
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running<BR>
2 times you had a splinter in your finger<BR>
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day<BR>
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book<BR>
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc.on TV
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the times we did get together the reason I laid still was because you missed and were fucking the sheets. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was ,"would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?"  The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe.
<P>
