Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend3.1 to GirlFriendPlus1.0 
(marketing name: Fiancee1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0 to
Wife1.0 and it's a memory hogger, has taken all his space; and 
Wife1.0 must be running before he can do anything. Although he
didn't ask for them, Wife1.0 came with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 
and BrotherInLaw.
<P>
            <P>Some features I'd like to see in the upcoming 
GirlFriend4.0...</P>
            <P>A &quot;Don't remind me again&quot; button<BR>
Minimize button<BR>
Shutdown feature<BR></P>
An installshield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely 
uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other 
objects)
 <P>
 I tried running Girlfriend 2.0 with Girlfriend 1.0 still installed, 
they tried using the same I/O port and conflicted.  Then I tried to 
uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an uninstall program.  I 
tried to unstall it by hand, but it put files in my system 
directory.  Another thing that sucks-in all versions of Girlfriend 
that I've used is that it is totally &quot;object orientated&quot; and only 
supports hardware with gold plated contacts.
<P>
<CENTER>*****  BUG WARNING  ********</CENTER>
<P>
Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 
before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files
before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to 
install, claiming insufficient resources.
