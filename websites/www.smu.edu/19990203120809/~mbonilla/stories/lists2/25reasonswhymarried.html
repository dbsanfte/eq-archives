<CENTER><H3>25 Snappy Comebacks to the age old question "Why aren't you married yet?"</H3></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
(Most can be modified for either men or women - numbers 2 and 7 are particularly effective!)<BR>
<BR>
1. You haven't asked yet.<BR>
<BR>
2. I was hoping to do something meaningful with my life.<BR>
<BR>
3. What?  And spoil my great sex life?<BR>
<BR>
4. Nobody would believe me in white.<BR>
<BR>
5. Because I just love hearing this question.<BR>
<BR>
6. Just lucky, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
7. It gives my mother something to live for.<BR>
<BR>
8. My fiance(e) is awaiting his/her parole.<BR>
<BR>
9. I'm still hoping for a shot at Miss/Mr. America.<BR>
<BR>
10. Do you know how hard it is to get two tickets to Miss Saigon?<BR>
<BR>
11. I'm waiting until I get to be your age.<BR>
<BR>
12. It didn't seem worth a blood test.<BR>
<BR>
13. I already have enough laundry to do, thank you.<BR>
<BR>
14. Because I think it would take all the spontaneity out of dating.<BR>
<BR>
15. My co-op board doesn't allow spouses.<BR>
<BR>
16. I'd have to forfeit my billion dollar trust fund.<BR>
<BR>
17. They just opened a great singles bar on my block.<BR>
<BR>
18. I wouldn't want my parents to drop dead from sheer happiness.<BR>
<BR>
19. I guess it just goes to prove that you can't trust those voodoo doll rituals.<BR>
<BR>
20. What?  And lose all the money I've invested in running personal ads?
<BR>
21. We really want to, but my lover's spouse just won't go for it.<BR>
<BR>
22. I don't want to have to support another person on my paycheck.<BR>
<BR>
23. Why aren't you thin?<BR>
<BR>
24. I'm married to my career, although recently we have been considering a trial separation.<BR>
<BR>
25. (Bonus reply for Single Mothers) Because having a husband and a child would be redundant.
<P>
