After the grade school class comes back inside, the teacher asks Alice,"What did you do at recess?"   Alice says: "I played in the sandbox."  "That's nice," the teacher says, "If you can go to the blackboard and write `sand' correctly, I'll give you a cookie."  Alice does it and she gets a cookie.<BR>
<BR>
Then the teacher asks Billy what he did at recess.   Billy says: "I played in the sandbox with Alice."  That's nice, " the teacher says, If you can write `box' on the blackboard correctly, I'll give you a cookie."  Billy does and he gets a cookie.<BR>
<BR>
Then the teacher asks Mustafa-Abdul what he did at recess.  "I tried to play with Alice and Billy," Mustafa answers, "but they threw rocks at me." "They threw rocks at you?................................That sounds like blatant racial descrimination," the teacher replied.  "If you can go to the blackboard and write `blatant racial discrimination', I'll give you a cookie."<BR>
