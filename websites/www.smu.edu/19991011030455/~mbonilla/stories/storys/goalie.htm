There was a four story apartment building on fire in Ireland.  Smoke and flames were pouring from the third floor windows and on the fourth floor a woman was holding her baby out the window. A crowd gathered and yelled for the woman to drop the baby, they would catch it--but she didn't trust anyone to catch her baby.
<P>
A man ran up and yelled, "I'm Alec McGuinness, the goalie for the national football team. No one has ever scored on me. I'll catch your baby!". 
<P>
"Never?", yelled the woman.
<P>
"Never!", he replied, "Not in 10 years, and I've never missed a match."
<P> 
So she dropped the baby, but she slipped at the same time and the baby went flying off to one side. It was 30 feet to the right of the goalie, who stood in the classic stance until right at the last minute, he made a terrific diving catch and saved the baby. The crowd yelled and applauded loudly in appreciation.
<P>
He turned to the crowd, nodded in acknowledgement, bounced the baby twice on the pavement and punted it 60 yards down the street.
