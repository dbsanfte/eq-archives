<CENTER><H3>The golf outing...</H3></CENTER>
     
A couple was golfing one day on a very, very exclusive golf course, lined with million dollar houses.  On the third tee the husband said,
<P>
"Honey, be very careful when you drive the ball- don't knock out any windows.  It'll cost us a fortune to fix."    
<P>
The wife teed up and shanked it right through the window of the biggest house on the course.  The husband cringed and said, 
<P>
"I told you to watch out for the houses!  Alright, let's go up there, apologize and see how much this is going to cost."
<P>
They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, "Come on in."
<P>
They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer.
<P>
A man on the couch said, "Are you the people that broke my window?"
 <P>
"Uh, yeah.  Sorry about that." the husband replied.
<P>
"No, actually I want to thank you- I'm a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle.  You've released me.  I'm allowed to grant three wishes-   I'll give you each one wish, and I'll keep the last one for myself."
<P>
"OK, great!" the husband said. "I want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life."
<P>
"No problem-it's the least I could do. And you, what do you want?" the genie said, looking at the wife.  
<P>
"I want a house in every country of the world," she said. 
<P>
"Consider it done." the genie replied.
<P>
"And what's your wish, genie?", the husband said.
<P>
"Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, I haven't had sex with a woman in a thousand years.  My wish is to sleep with your wife."
<P>
The husband looks at the wife and said, "Well, we did get a lot of money and all those houses, honey.  I guess I don't care."
<P>
The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours.  After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife, and said,
<P>
"How old is your husband, anyway?"
<P>
"35." she replied.
<P>
"And he still believes in genies- that's amazing."

A lead hardware engineer, a lead software engineer, and their project manager are taking a walk outdoors during their lunch break when they come upon an old brass lamp. They pick it up and dust it off.  Poof -- out pops a Genie.
<P>     
"Thank you for releasing me from my lamp-prison.  I can grant you 3 wishes.  Since there are 3 of you I will grant one wish to each of you."
<P>
The hardware engineer thinks a moment and says, "I'd like to be sailing a yacht across the Pacific, racing before the wind, with an all-girl crew."
<P>
"It is done", said the Genie, and poof, the hardware engineer disappears.
<P>
The software engineer thinks a moment and says, "I'd like to be riding my Harley with a gang of beautiful women throughout the American Southwest."
<P>     
"It is done", said the Genie, and poof, the software engineer disappears.
<P>
The project manager looks at where the other two had been standing and rubs his chin in thought.  Then he tells the Genie, "I'd like those two back in the office after lunch."
