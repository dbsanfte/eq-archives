For a couple years I've been blaming it on iron poor blood, lack of vitamins, dieting and a dozen other maladies. But now I found out the real reason.  I'm tired because I'm overworked!!!!!  The population of this country is 237 million. 104 million are retired. That leaves 133 million to do the work.
<BR>
There are 85 million in school, which leave 48 million to do the work. Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government.  This leaves 19 million to do the work.  Four million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to do  the work.  Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City Government and that leaves 200,000 to do the work. There are 188,000  in hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.  Now, there are 11,998 people in prisons.  That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me.  And you're sitting there screwing around on email.
<P>
