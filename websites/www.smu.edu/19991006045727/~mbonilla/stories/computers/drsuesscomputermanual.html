If Dr. Seuss wrote a computer manual, it might go something like this...
<P>
If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is
interrupted as a very last resort, and the address of the memory makes
your floppy disk abort, then the socket packet pocket has an error to
report.
<P>
If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, and the
double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, and your data is
corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash, then your situation's hopeless
and your system's gonna crash!
<P>
If the label on the cable on the table at your house, says the network
is connected to the button on your mouse, but your packets want to
tunnel on another protocol, that's repeatedly rejected by the printer
down the hall, and your screen is all distorted by the side effects of
gauss, so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse, then you may
as well reboot and go out with a bang, 'cause as sure as I'm a poet,
the sucker's gonna hang!
<P>
When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, and the
microcode instructions cause unnecessary risk, then you have to flash
your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.  Quickly turn off the
computer and BE SURE TO TELL YOUR MOM!!!!
<P>
