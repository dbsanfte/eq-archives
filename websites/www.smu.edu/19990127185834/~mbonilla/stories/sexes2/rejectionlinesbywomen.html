<H2>Top 10 Rejection Lines Given By Women<BR>(and what they actually mean)</H2></CENTER>
<P>
10.  I think of you as a brother. (You remind me of that inbred banjo-playing geek in 
"Deliverance.") 
<P>     
 9.  There's a slight difference in our ages. (I don't want to do my dad.) 
<P>     
 8.  I'm not attracted to you in 'that' way. (You are the ugliest dork I've ever laid eyes upon.) 
<P>     
 7.  My life is too complicated right now. (I don't want you spending the whole night or else you may hear 
phone  calls from all the other guys I'm seeing.) 
<P>
6.  I've got a boyfriend (I prefer my male cat and a half gallon of Ben and Jerry's.) 
<P>
5.  I don't date men where I work. (I wouldn't date you if you were in the same 'solar system', much 
less  the same building.) 
<P>
4.  It's not you, it's me. (It's you.) 
<P>
3.  I'm concentrating on my career. (Even something as boring and unfulfilling as my job is better 
than dating you.) 
<P>
2.  I'm celibate. (I've only sworn off the men like you.) 
<P>
 ...and the number 1 rejection line given by women (and what it actually  means) 
<P>
1.  Let's be friends. (I want you to stay around so I can tell you in  excruciating detail about all the other men I meet and 
have sex with. It's that male perspective thing)
