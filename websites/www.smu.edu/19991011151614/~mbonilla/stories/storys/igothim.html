A truck driver frequently traveled through a small town where there was a courthouse at the side of the road.  Of course, there were  always lawyers walking along the road.  The truck driver made it a practice to hit any pedestrian lawyers with his truck as he sped by.<BR>
<BR>
One day, he spotted a priest walking along the road and stopped to give him a ride.  A little further along, as he approached the town, he spotted a lawyer walking along the side of the road.<BR>
<BR>
Automatically, he veered his truck towards the lawyer, but...then he remembered his passenger.  He swerved back to the center, but he heard a "whump" and in the rear view mirror he spotted the lawyer rolling across the field.<BR>
<BR>
He turned to the priest and said,  "Father, I'm sure that I missed that lawyer."<BR>
<BR>
And the priest replied, "That's OK, my son, I got him with the door."<BR>
