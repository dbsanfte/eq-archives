General Motors doesn't have a "help line" for people who don't<BR>
know how to drive, because people don't buy cars like they buy<BR>
computers - - but imagine if they did . . .<BR>

HELPLINE:  "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "I got in my car and closed the door, and nothing happened!"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "Did you put the key in the ignition slot and turn it?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "What's an ignition?"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "It's a starter motor that draws current from yourbattery and turns over the engine."<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "Ignition?  Motor?  Battery?  Engine?  How come I have to know all of these technical terms just to use my car?"<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
HELPLINE:  "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "My car ran fine for a week, and now it won't go anywhere!"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "Is the gas tank empty?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "Huh?  How do I know!?"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "There's a little gauge on the front panel, with a needle, and markings from 'E' to 'F.'  Where is the needle pointing?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "It's pointing to 'E.'  What does that mean?"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "It means that you have to visit a gasoline vendor, and purchase some more gasoline.  You can install it yourself, or pay the vendor to install it for you."<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "What!?  I paid $12,000.00 for this car!  Now you tell me that I have to keep buying more components? I want a car that comes with everything built in!"<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
HELPLINE:  "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "Your cars are JUNK!!!"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "What's wrong?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "It crashed, that's what went wrong!"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "What were you doing?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "I wanted to run faster, so I pushed the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor.  It worked for a while, and then it crashed -- and now it won't start!"<BR>
HELPLINE:  "It's your responsibility if you misuse the product. What do you expect us to do about it?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "I want you to send me one of the latest versions that doesn't crash anymore!"<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
HELPLINE:  "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "Hi!  I just bought my first car, and I chose your car because it has automatic  transmission, cruise control, power steering, power brakes, and power door locks."<BR>
HELPLINE:  "Thanks for buying our car.  How can I help you?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "How do I work it?"<BR>
HELPLINE:   "Do you know how to drive?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "Do I know how to what?"<BR>
HELPLINE:   "Do you know how to DRIVE?"<BR>
CUSTOMER:  "I'm not a technical person!  I just want to go places in my car!"<BR>
