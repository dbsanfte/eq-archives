Two friends went out golfing and their tee shots were horrible. One guy hit it way left, the other way right. They decided that the shots were so bad that they'd just meet up at the hole. So the first guy looks and looks and finally finds his ball sitting down deep in a field of beautiful Buttercups.  So he promptly pulls out his 7 iron and starts whacking  away.  Buttercups are flying everywhere but the ball won't come out. Well, finally
<P>
Mother Nature gets mad. She came up from the ground and said to the man "I've created this beautiful field of Buttercups and you have no respect for them at all, now they are ruined. I'm going to have to punish you. Since these are Buttercups your punishment is that you cannot have butter for a year". 
<P>
Well the man started to laugh and went back to whacking at the Buttercups.  Mother Nature said "Hey, this is no laughing matter.  What do you find so funny?" The man looked up and said "My buddy is over on the other side in the Pussywillows."
