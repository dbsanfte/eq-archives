Redmond WA, (AP).<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft (MSFT) has announced a 54 million dollar lawsuit against Tomagotchi maker, Bandai.  Microsoft is claiming that the Tomagotchi (the Japanese electronic pet that's all the rage with the kids) is an infringement of its intellectual property.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft spokesperson, Erik Loregard stated "Software that needs constant, even hourly attention, or else it dies? Sounds like Windows to me.  This is clearly an infringement on our technology".<BR>
<BR>
The Bandai company spokesman refused to comment on the suit.<BR>
