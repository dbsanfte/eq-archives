Picture yourself near a stream.<BR>
Birds are softly chirping in the crisp cool mountain air.<BR>
Nothing can bother you here.<BR>
No one knows this secret place.<BR>
You are in total seclusion from that place called "the world."<BR>
The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a<BR>
cascade of serenity.<BR>
The water is clear and you can easily make out the face of the<BR>
person whose head you're holding under the water.<BR>
Look.  It's the person who caused you all this stress.<BR>
What a pleasant surprise.<BR>
You let them up... just for a quick breath... then ploop!...<BR>
back under they go...<BR>
You allow yourself as many deep breaths as you want.<BR>
There now... feeling better?<BR>
<BR>
