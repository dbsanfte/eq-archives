There would be a "Rehearsal Dinner Kegger" Party.<BR>
<BR>
Bridesmaids would wear matching blue jean cut-offs and halter tops. They would  have NO tan lines and more skin showing than not.<BR>
<BR>
Tuxes would have team logos on the back and the Nike shoes would have matching team colors.<BR>
<BR>
June weddings would be scheduled around basketball play-offs.<BR>
<BR>
Vows would mention cooking and sex specifically, but omit that forsakingall others" part.<BR>
<BR>
The couple would leave the ceremony in a souped up '73 Charger or some other Mopar with racing tires and flame designs on the side of the car.<BR>
<BR>
Better yet, a Harley!<BR>
<BR>
Idiots who tried to dance with the bride (unless they were her daddy or really, really old) would get punched in the head.<BR>
<BR>
Big, slobbery dogs would be eligible for the role of "Best Man".<BR>
<BR>
There would be "Tailgate Receptions".<BR>
<BR>
Outdoor weddings would be held during sporting events at half-time or between innings.<BR>
<BR>
Ceremonies would be short and honeymoons would be long.<BR>
<BR>
Ceremonies and honeymoons would be inexpensive compared to the cost of the bachelor party.  Those strippers and liquor sure do add up.<BR>
<BR>
Men wouldn't ask, "Well, what do you think, dear? The burgundy or the wine colored napkins?"  They'd just grab extras from their local pub or tavern.<BR>
<BR>
Favors would be matchbooks and cigars.  Better yet, free drink passes at the local lounge.<BR>
<BR>
The bride's dress would show cleavage, her navel, and be form-fitted to her ass.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of a sit-down dinner there would be a hog roast or buckets of chicken, pizza and plenty of bar-b-que.<BR>
<BR>
No one would bother with that "Veil Routine." But they would insist that the garter be as high up on her leg as it could go.<BR>
<BR>
The bridal bouquet would be recycled from a previous funeral or something.<BR>
<BR>
INVITATIONS WOULD READ AS FOLLOWS<BR>
Tom (Dick or Harry) is getting the old ball and chain.<BR>
He either:<BR>
a) Knocked her up<BR>
b) Couldn't get a different roommate or<BR>
c) Caved in to her ultimatum.<BR>
Please come <BR>
And meet the woman <BR>
Who will cook and clean for him<BR>
For the rest of his life<BR>
At Soldier Field Stadium<BR>
On the 50 Yard Line<BR>
At Half-time during Sunday's Game<BR>
Please join us at the Moonlight Lounge<BR>
After the game<BR>
For Beer, Nachos and Pizza.<BR>
Oh yeah... B.Y.O.B.<BR>
