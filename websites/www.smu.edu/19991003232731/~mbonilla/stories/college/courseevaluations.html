 1. "This class was a religious experience for me...I had to take it all on faith." <BR>
 2. "Text makes a satisfying 'thud' when dropped on the floor." <BR>
 3. "The class is worthwhile because I need it for the degree." <BR>
 4. "His blackboard technique puts Rembrandt to shame." <BR>
 5. "Textbook is confusing...Someone with a knowledge of English should proofread it." <BR>
 6. "Have you ever fell asleep in class and awoke in another? That's the way I felt all term." <BR>
 7. "In class I learn that I can fudge answers and get away with it." <BR>
 8. "Keep lecturer or tenure board will be shot." <BR>
 9. "The recitation instructor would make a good parking lot attendant. Tries to tell you where to go, but you can never understand him." <BR>
10. "Text is useless. I use it to kill roaches in my room." <BR>
11. "In class the syllabus is more important than you are." <BR>
12. "I am convinced that you can learn by osmosis by just sitting in his class." <BR>
13. "Help! I've fallen asleep and I can't wake up!" <BR>
14. "Problem sets are a decoy to lure you away from potential exam material." <BR>
15. "Recitation was great. It was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing - It's a great stress reliever." <BR>
16. "He is one of the best teachers I have had...He is well-organized, presents good lectures, and creates interest in the subject. I hope my comments don't hurt his chances of getting tenure." <BR>
17. "I would sit in class and stare out the window at the squirrels.  They've got a cool nest in the tree." <BR>
18. "He teaches like Speedy Gonzalez on a caffeine high." <BR>
19. "This course kept me out of trouble from 2-4:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays." <BR>
20. "Most of us spent the 1st 3 weeks terrified of the class. Then solidarity kicked in." <BR>
21. "Bogus number crunching. My HP is exhausted." <BR>
22. "The absolute value of the TA was less than epsilon." <BR>
23. "TA steadily improved throughout the course...I think he started drinking and it really loosened him up." <BR>
24. "Information was presented like a ruptured fire hose--spraying in all directions--no way to stop it." <BR>
25. "I never bought the text. My $60 was better spent on the Led Zeppelin tapes that I used more while doing the problem sets than I would have used the text." <BR>
26. "What's the quality of the text? 'Text is printed on high quality paper.'" <BR>
