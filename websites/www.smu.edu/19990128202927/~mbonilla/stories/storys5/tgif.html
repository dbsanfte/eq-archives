A business man got on an elevator in a building.  When he entered the elevator, there was a blonde already inside and she greeted him by saying, "T-G-I-F"  (letters only).<BR>
<BR>
He smiled at her and replied, "S-H-I-T" (letters only)."<BR>
<BR>
She looked at him, puzzled, and said, "T-G-I-F" again.<BR>
<BR>
He acknowledged her remark again by answering, "S-H-I-T."<BR>
<BR>
The blond was trying to be friendly, so she smiled her biggest smile and said as sweetly as possibly "T-G-I-F" another time.<BR>
<BR>
The man smiled back to her and once again replied with a quizzical expression, "S-H-I-T."<BR>
<BR>
The blond finally decided to explain things, and this time she said, "T-G-I-F,  Thank Goodness It's Friday, get it?"<BR>
<BR>
The man answered, "S-H-I-T.  Sorry, Honey,  It's Thursday."<BR>
