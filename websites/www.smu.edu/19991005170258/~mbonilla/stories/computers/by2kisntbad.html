Dear Valued Employee:
<P>

 Re:  Vacation Pay

<P>
Our records indicate that you have not used any vacation time over  the past
100 year(s).  As I'm sure you are aware, employees are  granted 3 weeks of
paid leave per year or pay in lieu of time off.  One additional week is
granted for every 5 years of service. 
<P>

Please either take 9,400 days off work or notify our office and your  next
pay cheque will reflect payment of $8,277,432.22 which will  include all pay
and interest for the past 1,200 months.
<P>

 Sincerely,
<P>

 Automated Payroll Processing
<P>
