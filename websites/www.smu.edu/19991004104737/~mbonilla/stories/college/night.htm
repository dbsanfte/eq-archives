<CENTER><H3>The Night Before Finals</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Twas the night before finals,<br>
  And all through the college, <br>
  The students were praying<br>
  For last minute knowledge.
<P>
  Most were quite sleepy, <br>
  But none touched their beds, <br>
  While visions of essays<br>
  danced in their heads.
<P>
  Out in the taverns, <br>
  A few were still drinking, <br>
  And hoping that liquor<br>
  would loosen up their thinking.
<P>
  In my own apartment, <br>
  I had been pacing, <br>
  And dreading exams<br>
  I soon would be facing.
<P>
  My roommate was speechless, <br>
  His nose in his books, <br>
  And my comments to him<br>
  Drew unfriendly looks.
<P>
  I drained all the coffee, <br>
  And brewed a new pot, <br>
  No longer caring<br>
  That my nerves were shot.
<P>
  I stared at my notes, <br>
  But my thoughts were muddy, <br>
  My eyes went ablur, <br>
  I just couldn't study.
<P>
  "Some pizza might help," <br>
  I said with a shiver, <br>
  But each place I called<br>
  Refused to deliver.
<P>
  I'd nearly concluded<br>
  That life was too cruel, <br>
  With futures depending<br>
  On grades had in school.
<P>
  When all of a sudden, <br>
  Our door opened wide, <br>
  And Patron Saint Put It Off<br>
  Ambled inside.
<P>
  His spirit was careless, <br>
  His manner was mellow, <br>
  He started to bellow:
<P>
  "What kind of student<br>
  Would make such a fuss, <br>
  To toss back at teachers<br>
  What they tossed at us?"
<P>
  "On Cliff Notes!  On Crib Notes! <br>
  On Last Year's Exams! <br>
  On Wingit and Slingit, <br>
  And Last Minute Crams!"
<P>
  His message delivered, <br>
  He vanished from sight, <br>
  But we heard him laughing<br>
  Outside in the night.
<P>

  "Your teachers have pegged you, <br>
  So just do your best. <br>
  Happy Finals to All, <br>
  And to All, a good test."
<P>
