<CENTER><H2>Before I came to college I wish I had known...</H2>
<P>
That it didn't matter how late I scheduled my first class,<BR>
I'd sleep through it.<BR>
That I could change so much and barely realize it.<BR>
That you can love a lot of people in a lot of different ways.<BR>
That college kids throw airplanes too.<BR>
That if you wear polyester everyone will ask why you are so dressed up.<P>
That every clock on campus shows a different time.<BR>
That if you were smart in high school, so what?<BR>
That I would go to a party the night before a final.<BR>
That Chem Labs/ Architecture studios take up more time<BR>
than all my other  classes put together.<BR>
That you can know everything and fail a test.<BR>
That you can know nothing and ace a test.<BR>
That I could get used to almost anything I found out about my roommate.<P>
That Home is a great place to visit, But I wouldn't want to live there.<BR>
That most of my education would be obtained outside of class.<BR>
That friendship is more than getting drunk together.<BR>
That I would be one of those people that my parents warned me about.<BR>
The free food served until 10 is gone at 9:50.<BR>
That Sunday is a figment of the world's imagination.<BR>
That Psychology is really Biology.<BR>
That biology is really Chemistry, that Chemistry is really Physics and that Physics is really Math.<BR>
That my parents would become so much smarter in the last few years.<BR>
That it's possible to be alone even when you are surrounded by friends.<P><BR>
That friends are what makes this place worthwhile!<BR>
Don't be dismayed at good-byes,<BR>
A farewell is necessary before we can meet again,<BR>
and meeting again, after moments or a lifetime,<BR>
is certain for those who are friends.<BR>
