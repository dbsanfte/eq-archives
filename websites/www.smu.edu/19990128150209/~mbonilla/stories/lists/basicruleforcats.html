1. Doors: Do not allow closed doors in any room.  To get door 
opened, stand on hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is
opened, it is not necessary to use.  After you have ordered an
"outside" door opened, stand halfway in and  out and think about
several things.  This is particularly important during  very cold
weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors are to be
avoided at all costs.
<P>
2. Chairs and Rugs: If you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly.
If you cannot manage in time, get to an oriental rug.  If there is no
Oriental rug, shag is good. When throwing up on the carpet, make sure
you back up so that it is as long as the human's bare foot.
<P>
3. Bathrooms:  Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not
necessary to do anything -----just sit there and stare.
<P>
4. Hampering:  If one of your humans is engaged in some close 
activity and the other is idle, stay with the busy one.  This is
called "helping", otherwise known as "hampering".   Following are the
rules for "hampering"
<P>
a) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the
cook. You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being
stepped on and then picked up and comforted.
<P>
b) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and
book, unless you can lie across the book itself.
<P>
c) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most
appropriate manner so as to obscure as much of the work or at  least
the most important part.  Pretend to doze, but every so often , reach
out and slap the pencil or knitting needles.  The worker may try to
distract you; ignore it. Remember, the aim is to "hamper" work.
Embroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammock in spite of
what the humans may tell you.
<P>
d) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income tax
or christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim.......to
"hamper". First, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged,
watch sadly from the side of the table.  When activity proceeds
nicely, roll around on the papers, scattering them to the best of your
ability.  After being removed for the second time, push pens, pencils,
and erasers off the table, one at a time.
<P>
e)  When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure
to jump on the back of the paper.  They love to jump.
<P>
5. Walking:  As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as 
possible in front of the human, especially: on stairs, when they have
something in their arms, in the dark, and when they first get up in
the morning.  This will help their coordination skills.
<P>
6. Bedtime: Always sleep on the human at night so he/she cannot move
around.
<P>
7. Play:  This is an important part of your life.  Get enough sleep in
the daytime so you are fresh for your nocturnal games.  Below are
listed several favorite cat games that you can play.  It is important,
though to maintain one's dignity at all times.  If you should have an
accident during play, such as falling off a chair, immediately, wash a
part  of your body as if to say "I MEANT to do that!".  It fools those
humans every time.
<P>
Favorite Cat Games
<P>
"Catch Mouse"; the humans would have you believe that those lumps
under the covers are their feet and hands. They are lying.  They are
actually Bed Mice, rumored to be the most delicious of all the mice in
the world, though no cat has ever been able to catch one.  Rumor also
has it that only the most ferocious attack can stun them long enough
for you to dive under the covers to get them. Maybe YOU can be the
first to taste the Bed Mouse!
<P>
"King of The Hill":  This game must be played with at least one 
other cat. The more, the merrier!  One or both of the sleeping humans
is Hill 303 which must be defended at all costs from the other cat(s).
Anything goes. This game allows for the development of unusual
tactics as one must take the unstable playing theater into account.
WARNING" Playing either one of these games to excess will result in
expulsion from the bed and possibly from the  bedroom. Should the
humans grow restless, immediately begin purring and cuddling up to
them.  This should buy you some time until they fall asleep again.  If
one happens to be on a human when this occurs, this cat wins the round
of King of the Hill.
<P>
Favorite Cat Toys:  Any small item is a potential toy. If a human
tries to confiscate it, this means that it is a Good Toy.  Run with it
under the bed.  Look suitably outraged when the human grabs you and
takes it away.  Always watch where it is put so you can steal it
later. Two reliable sources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets.
There are several types of cat toys.
<P>
-Bright shiny things like keys, broaches, or coins should be hidden
so that the other cat(s) or humans can't play with them.  They are
generally good for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors.
<P>
-Dangly and /or string-like things such as shoelaces, cords, 
gold chains, and dental floss also make excellent toys.  They are
favorites of humans who like to drag them across the floor for us to
pounce on.  When a string is dragged under a newspaper or throw rug,
it magically becomes the Paper/Rug Mouse and should be killed at all
costs.  Take care, though.   Humans are sneaky and will try to make
you lose your dignity.  When your humans have  aparty always look for
the person who is alergic or get to it, a good sit in the lap is also
effective, make one last desparate attempt to convert.!!
