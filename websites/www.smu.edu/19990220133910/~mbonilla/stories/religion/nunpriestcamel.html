<H2><CENTER>A Nun, Priest, and a Camel</CENTER></H2>
<P>
A priest and a nun were crossing the desert when their camel died. The camel carried all their food, water and other provisions, and both of them knew that there was no way they could carry enough to make it all the way across the desert. The nun got down on her knees and started praying and making her peace with God.
<P>
The priest had never in his life had any experiences with women, and he figured this was his last chance to try that. So he walked up in front of the nun, dropped trou' and said, "Hey, sister, take a look at this!"
<P>
She looked up, and having never seen anything like that, asked him what it was.
<P>
He thought fast and said, "It's the Staff of Life, Sister!"
<P>
She said, "Then stick it in the camel so we can get out of here!"
<P>
