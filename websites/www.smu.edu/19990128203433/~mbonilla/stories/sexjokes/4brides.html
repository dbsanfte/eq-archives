A woman, getting married for the fourth time, goes to a bridal shop and asks for a white dress.<BR>
<BR>
"You can't wear white.", reminds the sales clerk, "You've been married three times already."<BR>
<BR>
"Of course I can, I'm a virgin!", says the bride.<BR>
<BR>
"Impossible", says the sales clerk.<BR>
<BR>
"Unfortunately not.",  the bride explained,<BR>
<BR>
"My first husband was a psychologist.  All he wanted to do was talk about it.<BR>
<BR>
"My second  husband was a gynecologist.  All he wanted to do was look at it.<BR>
<BR>
"My third husband was a stamp collector.... God I miss him."<BR>
