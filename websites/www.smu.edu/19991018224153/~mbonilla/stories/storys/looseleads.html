Tommy goes into a confessional box and says "bless me father for I have sinned, I have been with a loose woman".
<P>
The Priest says "Is that you Tommy?"
<P>
Yes father, it is I.
<P>
Who was the woman you were with?
<P>
I cannot tell you for I do not wish to sully her reputation.
<P>
The priest asks "Was it Brenda O'Malley"?
<P>
No father.
<P>
Was it Fiona MacDonald?
<P>
No father.
<P>
Was it Ann Brown?
<P>
No father, I cannot tell you.
<P>
The priest says I admire your perseverance but you must atone for your sins.
<P>
Your penance will be five Our Fathers and four Hail Marys.
<P>
Tommy goes back to his pew and his buddy Sean slides over and asks what happened?
<P>
Tommy replies:   "I got five Our Fathers, four Hail Marys and three good leads".
