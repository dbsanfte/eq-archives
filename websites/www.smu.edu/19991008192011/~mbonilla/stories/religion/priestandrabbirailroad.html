A priest and a rabbi found themselves sharing a compartment on a train. After a while, the priest put down his book and opened a conversation by saying,<BR>
<BR>
"I know that, in your religion, you're not supposed to eat pork... but have you really never even tasted it?"<BR>
<BR>
The rabbi closed his newspaper and responded, "I must tell you the truth.  Yes I have, on the odd occasion."<BR>
<BR>
The rabbi had his turn of interrogation.  He asked, "I know that in your religion, you're supposed to be celibate... but..."<BR>
<BR>
The priest interjected, "Yes, I know what you are going to ask, and yes, I have succumbed to temptation once or twice."<BR>
<BR>
The two resumed their reading.  There was silence for a while.  Then the rabbi peeked around his newspaper and said, "Better than pork, isn't it?!"<BR>
