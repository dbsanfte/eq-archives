A horse and a chicken are feeding in a meadow.  The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking.  He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety.  The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found.  So she drives the farmers BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper.  She then throws the other end of the rope to her friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking!  A few days later, the chicken and the horse were eating in the meadow again and the chicken fell into the mud hole.  The chicken yelled to the horse to go get some help from the farmer.  The horse said, "I think I can stand over the hole!  So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, "Grab onto my penis and pull yourself up."  And the chicken did and pulled herself to safety.
<P>
The moral of the story:<BR>
If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks!
<P>
