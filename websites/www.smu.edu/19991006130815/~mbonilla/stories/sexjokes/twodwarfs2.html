Two dwarfs decide to treat themselves to a vacation in Las Vegas. At the hotel bar, they're dazzled by two women, and wind up taking them to their separate rooms.  The first dwarf is disappointed, however, as he's unable to reach a certain physical state that would enable him to join with his date. 
<P>
His depressionis enhanced by the fact that, from the next room  he hears cries of, "ONE, TWO, THREE...HUH!" all night long. 
<P>
In the morning, the second dwarf asks the first, "How did it  go?" 
<P>
The first whispered back, "It was so embarrassing. I simply  couldn't get it up, if you know what I mean." 
<P>
The second dwarf shook his head. "You think that's embarrassing?" he asked. "I couldn't even jump up on the bed!"
<P>
