These 4 gents go out to play golf one sunny morning. One is detained in the 
clubhouse, and the other three are discussing their children while walking 
to the first tee.
<P>
"My son Kent," says one, "has made quite a name for himself in the 
home-building industry. He began as a carpenter, but now owns his own 
design and construction firm. He's so successful in fact, in the last year 
he was able to give a good friend a brand new home as a gift."
<P>
The second man, no to be out done, tells how his son began his career as a 
car salesman, but now owns a multi-line dealership. "Norm's so successful, 
in fact, in the last six months he gave his friend two brand new cars as a 
gift."
<P>
The third man's son, Greg, has worked his way up through a stock brokerage, 
and in the last few weeks has given a good friend a large stock portfolio as 
a gift.
<P>
As the fourth man arrives at the tee, another tells him that they have been 
discussing their progeny and asks what line his son is in.
<P>
"To tell the truth, I'm not very pleased with how my son turned out," he 
replies. "For 15 years, Chico's been a hairdresser, and I've just recently 
discovered he's gay. However, on the bright side, he must be good at what 
he does because his last three boyfriends have given him a brand new house, 
two cars, and a big pile of stock certificates."
