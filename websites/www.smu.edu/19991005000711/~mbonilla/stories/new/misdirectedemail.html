An Illinois man left the snow-filled streets of Chicago for a vacation in
Florida. His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there
the next day. When he reached his hotel in Florida, he decided to send his
wife a quick e-mail. Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had
written her e-mail address, he did his best to type it in from memory.
Unfortunately, he missed one letter and his note was directed instead to an
elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before.
When the grieving widow checked her e-mail, she took one look at the
monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.
At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the
screen:
<P>
 DEAREST WIFE: JUST GOT CHECKED IN. EVERYTHING PREPARED FOR YOUR ARRIVAL TOMORROW.
<P>
 P.S. SURE IS HOT DOWN HERE.
<P>
