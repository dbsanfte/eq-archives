Three engineers are riding in a car. Suddenly the car stops running. They ease over to the side of the road and look at each other, wondering what could be wrong.<BR>
<BR>
"Well," says number one, "I'm an electrical engineer. I think we should strip down the electronics and see where a fault might have occurred."<BR>
<BR>
"Well, I don't know much about cars," says number two. "I'm a chemical engineer. But I think maybe the fuel is emulsifying and blocking something somewhere."<BR>
<BR>
"Well," says number three, "I'm a Microsoft engineer, and I don't know much about anything. But I've got a great idea. Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open all the windows, and maybe it'll work?"<BR>
