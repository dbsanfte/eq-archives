Dear GOD,<BR>
In school they told us what You do.  Who does it when You are on vacation?<BR>
                 * Jane<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Are you really invisible or is that just a trick?<BR>
                 * Lucy<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Is it true my father won't get in Heaven if he uses his bowling words in the house?<BR>
                 * Anita<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Did you mean for the giraffe to look like that or was it an accident?<BR>
                 * Norma<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Instead of letting people die and having to make new ones, why don't You just keep the ones You have now?<BR>
                 * Jane<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Who draws the lines around the countries?<BR>
                 * Nan<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
I went to this wedding and they kissed right in church. Is that okay?<BR>
                 * Neil<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
What does it mean You are a Jealous God?  I thought You had everything.<BR>
                 * Jane<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Did you really mean "do unto others as they do unto you"? Because if you did, then I'm going to fix my brother!<BR>
                 * Darla<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Thank you for the baby brother, but what I prayed for was a puppy.<BR>
                 * Joyce<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
It rained for our whole vacation and is my father mad!  He said some things about You that people are not supposed to say, but I hope You will not hurt him anyway.<BR>
                 Your friend<BR>
                 (But I am not going to tell you who I am)<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Why is Sunday school on Sunday? I thought it was supposed to be our day of rest.<BR>
                 * Tom L.<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Please send me a pony. I never asked for anything before, You can look it up.<BR>
                 * Bruce<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
If You give me a genie lamp like Aladin, I will give you anything you want except my money or my chess set.<BR>
                 * Raphael<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
My brother is a rat.  You should give him a tail.  Ha ha.<BR>
                 * Danny<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
Maybe Cain and Abel would not kill each other so much if they had their own rooms.  It works with my brother.<BR>
                 * Larry<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
I want to be just like my Daddy when I get big but not with so much hair all over.<BR>
                 * Sam<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
I think the stapler is one of your greatest inventions.<BR>
                 * Ruth M.<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
I bet it is very hard for You to love all of everybody in the whole world. There are only 4 people in our family and I can never do it.<BR>
                 * Nan<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
If You watch me in church Sunday, I'll show You my new shoes.<BR>
                 * Mickey D.<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
I would like to live 900 years like the guy in the Bible.<BR>
                 Love, Chris<BR>
<BR>
Dear GOD,<BR>
We read Thomas Edison made light.  But in school they said You did it.  So I bet he stoled your idea.<BR>
                 Sincerely, Donna<BR>
