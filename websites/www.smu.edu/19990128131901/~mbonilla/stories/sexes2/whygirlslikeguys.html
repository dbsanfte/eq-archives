<H3><CENTER>Well here are a few reasons that girls like guys</CENTER></H3>

1. The way they always wear their favorite cologne (which happens to be the one that you bought them for their birthday)<BR>
2. The way the run their hands through out hair<BR>
3. The way that they look at you and you want to die right then and there<BR>
4. The way that they casually put their arms around you<BR>
5. The way that they kiss away your tears<BR>
6. ...and the way that they then get mad at how they can't make your problem go away<BR>
7. The way they show off around their friends, even though you both know that you would love them even if they missed a basket or two<BR>
8. How there eyes light up at the result of 3 hours of preparing for your date<BR>
9. How they always know just what to say to make you blush<BR>
10. How they sometimes think that they know just what to say to make you feel better, even if you think that it is the worst thing that they could say<BR>
11. The way they hold you close when you are cold<BR>
12. How they look at you when your mad at them and all your anger melts away<BR>
13. How they always smile when you are together<BR>
14. The way that they always let you win any game that you play together<BR>
15. ... and then when you point that out to them they pretend to not know what you are talking about<BR>
16. The way that they smile at you<BR>
17. The way that you feel when they call to apologize after you had a big fight<BR>
18. The way that they say I love you<BR>
19. The way that they say I love you in front of their friends<BR>
20. The way that they touch and hold you so gently, like they are afraid that they will break you<BR>
21. The way that they kiss you<BR>
22. The way that they open their arms to you when you are crying<BR>
23. The way that they never admit that you hurt them<BR>
24. The way that they try not to cry when they are afraid that they are losing you<BR>
25. The way that they think that they are your big protector, even though you think that you are theirs<BR>
26. The way that they say I miss you, even though they hate to admit it<BR>
27. The way that you miss everything about them when they are gone<BR>
28. The way that they remember your special moments, or aniversaries when you think that they forgot<BR>

34. How you want to hug them even though they are all sweaty<BR>
35. Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them... it matters not.  Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without a trace of sound, you know that your own life is inevitabley comsumed within the rhythimic beatings of his heart.We love them for a million reasons, No paper would do it justice. It is a thing a feeling, that is only felt.<BR>
