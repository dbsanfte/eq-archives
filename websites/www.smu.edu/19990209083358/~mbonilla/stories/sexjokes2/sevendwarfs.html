One evening Snow White decided she was sleepy and announced to the seven dwarfs that she was going to bed.  After the usual lengthy round of "Good Nights" she went upstairs.  Immediately all seven dwarfs rushed outside and began standing on each others shoulders beneath Snow White's bedroom window.  Tonight was Grumpy's turn to be on the top and as he was the only one who could see in the window it was his duty to inform the other dwarfs what she was doing.
<P>
After a minute or two he hollered down, "She's taking off her blouse!" and this as echoed down the stack "taking off her blouse,"  "she's taking off her blouse,""blouse is coming off," "taking off her blouse," etc.  
<P>
Next Grumpy yelled, "She's taking off her skirt," which was followed by the echoes "taking off her skirt," "she's taking off her skirt," "skirt's coming off," "taking off her skirt," etc.
<P>
Of course the next line from Grumpy was, "She's taking off her bra!" and the echo chorus went down the line.  Then, "She's taking off her panties!" which again cascaded down the dwarf tower.
<P>
Finally Grumpy looked around and from his vantage height saw someone coming through the woods so he yelled, "Someone's coming!" and from the next dwarf to the bottom dwarf was heard, "Me too." "Me too." "Me too." "Me too." "Me too." "Me too."
