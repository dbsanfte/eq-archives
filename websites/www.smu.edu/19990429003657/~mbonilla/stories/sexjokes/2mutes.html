There were two deaf mutes standing on a street corner talking to each other with sign language.<BR>
<BR>
Mute #1 (SIGN)"What would you like to do?"<BR>
<BR>
Mute #2 (SIGN)"I don't know, what about you?"<BR>
<BR>
Mute #1 (SIGN)"Let's get my car, find some girls, drive to a dark space and have some fun."<BR>
<BR>
Mute #2 (SIGN)"Good idea."<BR>
<BR>
So they get in his car, find some girls, drive to a dark spot and are having a ball when the guy in the back seat taps the guy in the front seat on the shoulder.....<BR>
<BR>
Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"What?"<BR>
<BR>
Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"Have you got any protection?"<BR>
<BR>
Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"No.  Don't you?"<BR>
<BR>
Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"No.  We had better go to a drug store and get some."<BR>
<BR>
They proceed to drive to a drug store and the man in the back seat gets out and goes inside.  In 2 minutes he is back outside and taps on the car window.<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?"<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"I've got a problem."<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?"<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"I can't make the druggist understand what I want."<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"I know What to do."<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"What?"<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Go back inside.  Put five dollars on the counter. Put your pecker on the counter.  He'll know what you want."<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"Good idea."<BR>
<BR>
The man goes back into the drug store and 2 minutes later he's back at the car window.<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Well?"<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"It didn't work."<BR>
<BR>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What do you mean?"<BR>
<BR>
Outside Mute (SIGN) "I did what you told me to do.  I went inside.  I put 5 dollars on the counter.  I put my pecker on the counter.  He put his on the counter.  His was bigger than mine.  He took my 5 dollars."<BR>
