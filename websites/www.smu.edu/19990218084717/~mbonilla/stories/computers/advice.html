Dear Marj -
<P>
I am writing to your advice-column because of a serious problem I am
facing. You see, I am a Vietnam-era deserter from the U. S. Marines,
and I have a cousin who works for Microsoft. My mother peddles Nazi
literature to Girl Scouts and my father (a former dentist) is in jail
for 30 years for raping most of his patients while they were under
anesthesia. The sole supports of our large family, including myself
and my $500-a-week heroin habit, are my uncle (master pick-pocket
Benny "The Fingers") and my aunt and kid sisters, who are well-known
streetwalkers.
<P>
My problem is this: I have just gotten engaged to the most beautiful,
sweetest girl in the world. She is just sweet sixteen, and we are
going to marry as soon as she can escape from reform school. To
support ourselves, we are going to move to Mexico and start a fake
Aztec souvenir factory staffed by child labor. We look forward to
bringing our kids into the family business. But -- I am worried that
my family will not make a good impression on hers, once she has a
chance tomeet them.
<P>
In your opinion, Abby: Should I -- or shouldn't I -- let her know
about my cousin who works for Microsoft?
