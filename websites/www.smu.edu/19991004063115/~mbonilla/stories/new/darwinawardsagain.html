GRAVITY KILLS
A 22-year-old Reston man was found dead yesterday after he tried
to use occy straps (the stretchy little ropes with hooks on each
end) to bungee jump off a 70-foot railroad trestle, police said.
Fairfax County police said Eric A. Barcia, a fast-food worker,
taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped an end around one
foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park,
jumped ... and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police
spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his
car was found nearby. "The length of the cord that he had
assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the
ground," Carmichael said. Police say the apparent cause of death
was "major trauma." An autopsy is scheduled for later in the week.

 LAUNCHED ON THE FOURTH OF JULY ...
<P>
Three young men in Oklahoma were enjoying the coming Fourth of
July holiday and wanted to apparently test fire some fireworks.
Their only real problem was that their launch pad and seating
arrangements were atop a several hundred thousand gallon fuel
distillation storage tank. Oddly enough, some fumes were ignited,
producing a fireball seen for miles and miles. They were launched,
no doubt, countless thousands of feet into the air and were found
dead 250 yards from their respective seats.

 DON'T ASK GOD TO PROVE HIMSELF, HE JUST MIGHT...
<P>
 A lawyer [ ! ] and two of his buddies were fishing on Caddo Lake
in Texas. A lightning storm hit the lake and most of the fisherman
immediately headed for the shore. But not our friend the lawyer. He
was alone on the rear of his aluminum bass boat and his buddies
were in the front. This gentleman stood up, spread his arms wide
(crucifixion style) and shouted: "HERE I AM LORD, LET ME HAVE IT!"
Needless to say, God delivered [well, you would, wouldn't you?].
The other two passengers on the boat survived the lightning strike
with minor burns.

CATCH!
<P>
A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. Big deal you may
say, but there's a twist here that makes him a candidate. It seems
he and a friend were playing catch with a rattlesnake. You can
guess what happened from here. The friend (a future Darwin Awards
candidate) was hospitalized.

THEY SAY THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YOU . . .
<P>
Not much was given to me on this unlucky fellow, but he qualifies
nonetheless. You see, there was a gentleman from Korea who was
killed by his cell phone ..more or less. He was doing the usual
"walking and talking" when he walked into a tree and managed to
somehow break his neck. Keep that in mind the next time you decide
to drive and dial at the same time.

 GIMME A LIGHT!
<P>
 Several years ago, in a west Texas town, employees in a
medium-sized warehouse noticed the smell of a gas leak. Sensibly,
management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential
sources of ignition-lights, power, etc. After the building had been
evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched.
Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty
navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights
worked. Witnesses later described the vision of one of the
technicians reaching into his pocket, and retrieving an object that
resembled a lighter. Upon operation of the lighter-like object, the
gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three
miles away. Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter
was virtually untouched by the explosion. The technician that was
suspected of causing the explosion had never been thought of as
"bright" by his peers.

 Runner-up:
<P>
 Vermont native, Ronald Demuth, found himself in a difficult
position yesterday. While touring the Eagle's Rock African Safari
(Zoo) with a group of thespians from St. Petersburg, Russia,
Demuth went over board to show them one of America's many marvels.
He demonstrated the effectiveness of "Crazy Glue" ... the hard
way. Apparently, Demuth wanted to demonstrate just how good the
adhesive was, so he put about 3 ounces of the adhesive in the palms
of his hands, and jokingly placed them on the buttocks of a passing
rhino. The rhino, a resident of the zoo for the past thirteen
years, was not initially startled as it has been part of the
petting exhibit since its arrival as a baby. However, once it
became aware of its being involuntarily stuck to Demuth, it began
to panic and ran around the petting area wildly making Demuth an
unintended passenger. "Sally [the rhino] hasn't been feeling well
lately. She had been very constipated. We had just given her a
laxative and some depressants to relax her bowels, when Demuth
played his juvenile prank," said James Douglass, caretaker. During
Sally's tirade two fences were destroyed, a shed wall was gored,
and a number of small animals escaped. Also, during the stampede,
three pygmy goats and one duck were stomped to death. As for
Demuth, it took a team of medics and zoo caretakers over four hours
to remove his hands from the rhino's buttocks. First, the animal
had to be captured and calmed down. However, during this process
the laxatives began to take hold and Demuth was repeatedly showered
with over 30 gallons of rhino diarrhea. "It was tricky. We had to
calm her down, while at the same time shield our faces from being
pelted with rhino dung. I guess you could say that Demuth was into
it up to his neck. Once she was under control, we had three people
with shovels working to keep an air passage open for Mr. Demuth.
We were able to tranquilize her and apply a solvent to remove his
hands from her rear," said Douglass. "I don't think he'll be
playing with Crazy Glue for a while." Meanwhile, the Russians,
while obviously amused, also were impressed with the power of the
adhesive. "I'm going to buy some for my children, but of course
they can't take it to the zoo," commented Vladimir Zolnikov, leader
of the troupe.
