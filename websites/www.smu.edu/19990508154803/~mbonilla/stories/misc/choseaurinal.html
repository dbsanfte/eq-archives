Men should ace this test ... women may have a little difficulty. There *is* a code of "Restroom Etiquette" that MUST be followed. The following is the urinal configuration in a sample men's room. An X above the number will indicate "in use." 
<P>
(Sample):
<P>
<PRE>
|   |   | x |   |   | x |  (Indicates that urinals  
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |   3 and 6 are occupied.)

 -------------------------

You are to identify correctly, based on urinal etiquette, at 
which stall you are to correctly stand.  Good luck!

 -------------------------

       Easy Section

 -------------------------

1.)

|   | x |   | x |   |   |   (Urinals 2 and 4 occupied.) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------



Your choice: ___

 ----------------------------------------------

Correct answer:  6

It's the ONLY one to go to and every guy 
instinctively knows this.

=============================================== 


2.)

| x |   |   |   |   |   |  (Urinal 1 occupied.) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------


Your choice:  ___

 ----------------------------------------------

Correct answer:  6

Stall 5 is acceptable, but you run a greater
risk of being next to someone who arrives later.

=============================================== 

 -------------------------

  Kind-of-Tricky Section:

 -------------------------

3.)

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   (empty) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------


Your choice:  __

 ----------------------------------------------

Correct answer:

1 or 6

You are tacitly saying, "I don't want anyone next
to me." 

=============================================== 

4.)

|   | x |   | x |   | x |  (2, 4 and 6 occupied) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------


Your choice:  ___

 ----------------------------------------------

Correct answer:  1

You're stuck being next to at least ONE guy, so
you minimize the impact and get a wall on your
left. NEVER go between TWO guys if you can help
it.  Exceptions to this are stadium restrooms
where the herd thunders in.

=============================================== 

 ----------------------------------------------

Subtle, Tricky, But Important-to-Know Section 

 ----------------------------------------------

5.)

|   | x |   |   | x | x |  (2, 5 and 6 occupied) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------


Your choice:  __

 ----------------------------------------------

Correct answer:  4

Believe it or not,  1 and 3 "couples you with the
guy in stall 2.  And we wouldn't want THAT now,
would we?  This differs from question 4 in such a 
subtle way that the nuances cannot be explained.
Suffice to say, only we men would understand!

=============================================== 

 -------------------------

 VERY-Tricky-Indeed Section

 -------------------------

6.)

| x | x |   |   | x | x |   (1, 2, 5 and 6 occupied) 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

 -------------------------


Your choice:  ___

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Correct answer:

NONE!  You go to the mirror and pretend to comb your
hair or straighten a tie until the urinals "open up"
a bit more. If you have to go REAL, REAL BAD --
for God's sake, use a doored stall!
</PRE>
<P>
<CENTER>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</CENTER>
<P>
Other parts of the Unwritten Code of the Urinals:<BR>
-- NO Talking, unless it's a good friend... but even then, keep it terse and unemotional. This ain't no clubhouse.<BR>
-- I don't think I need to tell you, absolutely NO touching of anyone other than yourself. A touch of another's elbow is of the highest offense.<BR>
-- NO Singing. Period.<BR>
-- Glances are for purposes of acknowledgment only..."Yeah, I see you there. I will not look again."<BR>
