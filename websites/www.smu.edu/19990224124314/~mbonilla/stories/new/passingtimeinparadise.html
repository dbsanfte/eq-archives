A newlywed sailor was informed by the Navy that he was going to be stationed a long way from home on a remote island in the South Pacific for two years.<BR>
<BR>
A few weeks after he got there he began to miss his new wife quite badly so he decided to write her a letter.<BR>
<BR>
"My darling," he wrote, "It looks like we're going to be apart for a very long time and already I'm starting to miss you. There's really not much to do here in the evenings. Besides that, we're constantly surrounded by young attractive topless native girls in grass skirts. Maybe if I had a hobby of some kind I would not be so tempted."<BR>
<BR>
So his wife sent him back a harmonica with a book of music, saying, "Why don't you learn to play this?"<BR>
<BR>
Eventually his tour of duty came to an end and he rushed back to his wife. "Darling," he said, "I can't wait to get you into bed so that we can make passionate love!"<BR>
<BR>
"First," she said, "I'd like to hear you play that harmonica!"<BR>
