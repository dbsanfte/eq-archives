A woman could never get her husband to do anything around the house. He would come home from work, sit in front of the tv, eat dinner, and sit some more -- would never do those little household repairs that most husbands take  care of. This frustrated the woman quite a bit.
<P>
One day the toilet stopped up. When her husband got home, she said sweetly, "Honey, the toilet is clogged. Would you look at it?"  Her husband snarled, "What do I look like? The tidy-bowl man?" and sat down on the sofa.
<P>
The next day, the garbage disposal wouldn't work. When her husband got home, she said, very nicely, "Honey, the disposal won't work.  Would you try to fix it for me?" Once again, he growled, "What do I look like?  Mr. Plumber?"
<P>
The next day, the washing machine was on the blink. When her husband got home, she steeled her courage and said, "Honey, the washer isn't running.  Would you check on it?" And again was met with a snarl, "What do I look like? The Maytag repairman?" 
<P>
Finally, she had had enough. The next morning, the woman called three repairmen to fix the toilet, the garbage disposal, and the washer. When her husband got home, she said, "Honey, I had the repairmen out today." 
<P>
He frowned, "Well, how much is that going to cost?"
<P>
"Well, honey, they all said I could pay them by baking them a cake or having  sex with them."
<P>
"Well, what kind of cakes did you bake them?" he asked. She smiled. 
<P>
"What do I look like? Betty Crocker?"

This guy decides he's going to play a little joke on his wife one day. As she steps out of the shower, he grabs one of her breasts and says, "If you firmed these up a bit, you wouldn't have to keep using your bra."  He laughs and laughs.  The next morning, he again catches her as she finishes her shower and grabs her ass and says "If you firmed this up a bit, you wouldn't have to keep using your girdle." Again he laughs and laughs, while his wife plots her revenge.  The next morning as he steps out of the shower, his wife grabbed his penis and says, "If you firmed THIS up a bit, I wouldn't need to keep sleeping with your brother."

 A man walks into a pharmacy and asks for a pack of condoms.  As soon as he has paid for them, he starts laughing and walks out.  The next day, the same performance, with the man walking out laughing, fit to bust. The chemist thinks this odd and asks his assistant, if the man returns, to follow him.  Sure enough, he comes into the store the next day, repeating his actions once more. The assistant duly follows. Half an hour later, he returns.<BR>
 "So did you follow him?"<BR>
 "I did."<BR>
 "And...where did he go?"<BR>
 "Over to your house..."<BR>

 An office manager had money problems & had to fire an employee, either Jack or Jill...  He thought he'd fire the employee who came late to work the next morning.  Well, both employees came to work very early.  Then the manager thought he would catch the first one who took a coffee break. Unfortunately, neither employee took a coffee break.  Then the manager decided to see who took the longest lunch break - strangely, neither Jack nor Jill took a lunch break that day, they both ate at their desk.  Then the manager thought he'd wait & see who would leave work the earliest, and both employees stayed after closing. Jill finally went to the coat rack & the manager went up to her & said, "Jill, I have a terrible problem. I don't know whether to lay you or Jack off."  Jill said, "Well, you'd better jack off, because I'm late for my bus."
