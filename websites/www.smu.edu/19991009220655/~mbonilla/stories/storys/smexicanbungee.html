Two guys are bungee-jumping one day. The first guy says to
the second. "You know, we could make a lot of money running
our own bungee-jumping service in Mexico."
<P>
The second guy thinks this is a great idea, so the two pool
their money and buy everything they'll need - a tower, an
elastic cord, insurance, etc.
<P>
They travel to Mexico and begin to set up on the square. As
they are constructing the tower, a crowd begins to assemble.
Slowly, more and more people gather to watch them at work.
<P>
The first guy jumps. He bounces at the end of the cord, but
when he comes back up, the second guy notices that he has a
few cuts and scratches. Unfortunately, the second guy isn't
able catch him, he falls again, bounces and comes back up
again.
<P>
This time, he is bruised and bleeding. Again, the second guy
misses him. The first guy falls again and bounces back up.
This time, he comes back pretty messed up - he's got a couple
of broken bones and is almost unconscious.
<P>
Luckily, the second guy finally catches him this time and
says, "What happened? Was the cord too long?"
The first guy says, "No, the cord was fine, but what the heck
is a  'pinata'?"
<P>
