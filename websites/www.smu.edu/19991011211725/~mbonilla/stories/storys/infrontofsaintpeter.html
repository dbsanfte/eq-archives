Three men met in front of Saint Peter after they died.  Saint Peter asked them if they ever cheated on their wives.  The first said, I chased anyone that was hot and hollow, and Saint Peter told him "Well then, you get the compact car."
<P>
The second man said, "I was away on business once and slept with another woman one night."  Saint Peter gave him a medium sized car.  The third man told Saint Peter that he was alaways true to his wife, and was awarded with a luxury car.  A short time later, the three men happened to meet, and the man that had the luxury car was terribly upset.  When asked why, the man responded that he had just seen his wife, and she was riding on a skateboard!
