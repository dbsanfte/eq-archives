*Make up fake acronyms.  On-line veterans like to use abbreviations like 
IMHO (in my humble opinion) and RTFM (read the f...... manual) to show 
that they're "hep" to the lingo.  Make up your own that don't stand for 
anything (SETO, BARL, CP30), use them liberally, and then refuse to 
explain what they stand for ("You don't know? RTFM"). 
<P>
*WRITE ALL YOUR MESSAGES IN ALL CAPS AND DON'T USE PERIODS OR RETURNS SO 
THAT EVERYONE HAS TO SCROLL ACROSS THEIR SCREENS TO READ EVERY LINE ALSO 
USE A LOT OF !!!!!! AND DDOOUUBBLLEESS TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT 
BEING HERE!!!!!!! 
<P>
*When replying to your mail, correct everyone's grammar and spelling and 
point out their typos, but don't otherwise respond to the content of 
their messages.  When they respond testily to your 'creative criticism," 
do it again.  Continue until they go away. 
<P>
*Software and files offered on-line are often "compressed" so that it 
won't take so long to travel over the phone lines.  Buy a compression 
program and compress everything you send, including one-word E-mail 
responses like "Thanks." 
<P>
*Upload text files with Bible passages about sin or guilt and give them 
names like "SexyHouseWives," then see how many people download them. 
Challenge your friends to come up with the most popular come-on.  Take 
bets and calculate odds on the results of each upload's popularity. 
<P>
*cc: all your E-mail to Al Gore (vice.president@whitehouse.gov) so that 
he can keep track of what's happening on the information Superhighway 
Internet. 
<P>
*Join a discussion group, and tie whatever's being discussed back to an 
unrelated central theme of your own.  For instance, if you're in a 
discussion of gun control, respond to every message with the observation 
that those genetically superior tomatoes seem to have played an important 
role.  Within days, all discussion of gun control will have ceased as 
people write you threatening messages and instruct all other members to 
ignore you.
