<P>
Some folks have it, some don't. Those who have it would be devastated if it were ever cut off. They think that those who don't have it are somehow inferior. They think it gives them power. They are wrong.<BR>
<P>
Those who don't have it may agree that it's an nifty toy, but think it's not worth the fuss that those who do have it make about it. Still, many of those who don't have it would like to  try it.<BR>
<P>
It can be up or down. It's more fun when it's up, but it makes it hard to get any real work done.

<P>
It has no brain of its own. Instead, it uses yours. If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently. 
<P>
We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual  size and influence warrant. 
<P>
If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you in big  trouble.<BR>
<P>
It has its own agenda. Somehow, no matter how good your intentions, it will warp you behavior. Later you may ask yourself "why on earth did I do that?" 
<P>
It has no conscience and no memory. Left to its own devices, it will do the same damn dumb things it did before.
