Personal Hygiene:<BR>
<BR>
While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<BR>
<BR>
Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.<BR>
<BR>
Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the tastes of finger foods.<BR>
<BR>
Dining Out:<BR>
<BR>
When decanting wine, tilt the paper cup, and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.<BR>
<BR>
If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label.<BR>
<BR>
Entertaining in Your Home:<BR>
<BR>
A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<BR>
<BR>
Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.<BR>
<BR>
Dating (Outside the Family):<BR>
<BR>
Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.<BR>
<BR>
Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: "I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's bathroom wall two years ago."<BR>
<BR>
Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will say 10:00 PM; Others might say "Monday." If the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.<BR>
<BR>
Theater Etiquette:<BR>
<BR>
Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended.<BR>
<BR>
Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.<BR>
<BR>
Weddings:<BR>
<BR>
Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.<BR>
<BR>
Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.<BR>
<BR>
For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.<BR>
<BR>
Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for this special occasion.<BR>
<BR>
Driving Etiquette:<BR>
<BR>
Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; Even if the gun is loaded, and the deer is in sight.<BR>
<BR>
When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.<BR>
<BR>
Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape.<BR>
<BR>
When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<BR>
<BR>
Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.<BR>
<BR>
Tips For All Occasions:<BR>
<BR>
Never take a beer to a job interview.<BR>
<BR>
Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<BR>
<BR>
It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.<BR>
<BR>
If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.<BR>
<BR>
Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.<BR>
