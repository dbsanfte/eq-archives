When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be boss. The
brain said, "Since I control everything and do all the thinking, I
should be boss." The feet said, "Since I carry the body around to
where it wants to go, and get into position to do what the brain
wants, I should be boss." The hands said, "Since I do all the work and
earn all the money to keep the rest of you going, I should be boss."
<P>
And so it went with the heart, the lungs, and the eyes. And
finally, the asshole spoke up and demanded that it be made boss. All
the other parts just laughed and laughed at the idea of an asshole
being boss.
<P>
The asshole was so angered that it blocked itself off and refused
to function. Soon the brain was feverish; the eyes crossed and ached;
the feet were too weak to walk; the hands hung limply at the sides;
the heart and lungs struggled to keep going.
<P>
All pleaded with the brain to relent and let the asshole be
boss. And so it happened. All the other parts did all the work, and
the asshole just bossed and passed out a lot of shit.
<P>
THE MORAL: You don't have to be a brain to be boss, just an asshole.
<P>
