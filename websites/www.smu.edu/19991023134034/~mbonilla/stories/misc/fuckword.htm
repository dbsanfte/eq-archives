<CENTER><H3>How to Use FUCK as a Meaningful Word</H3></CENTER>


Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in the English language today is the word "fuck."  It is the one magical word which, just by its sound, can describe pain, pleasure, love, and hate.  In language, "fuck" falls into many grammatical categories.  It can be used as a verb, both transitive (John fucked Mary) and intransitive (Mary was fucked by John).  It can be an action verb (John really gives a fuck), a passive verb (Mary really doesn't give a fuck), an adverb (Mary is fucking interested in John), or as a noun (Mary is a terrific fuck).  It can also be used as an adjective (Mary is fucking beautiful) or an interjection (Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary).  It can even be used as a conjunction (Mary is easy but, fuck, she's also stupid).  As you can see, there are very few words with the overall versatility of the word "fuck."
