An Australian walked into a bar with a pet alligator by his side. He put the alligator up on the bar and turned to the astonished patrons.<BR>
<BR>
"I'll make you a deal. I'll open this alligator's mouth and place my genitals inside. Then the gator will close his mouth for one solid minute. He'll then open his mouth and I'll remove my unit unscathed. In return for witnessing this spectacle, each of you will buy me a drink."<BR>
<BR>
The crowd murmured their approval. The Australian stood up on the bar, dropped his trousers, and placed his privates in the alligator's open mouth. The gator closed his mouth as the crowd gasped.<BR>
<BR>
After a minute, the Aussie grabbed a beer bottle and rapped the alligator hard on the top of its head. The gator opened his mouth and the man removed his genitals -- unscathed as promised.<BR>
<BR>
The crowd cheered and the first of his free drinks were delivered.<BR>
<BR>
The Australian stood up again and made another offer: "I'll pay anyone $100.00 who's willing to give it a try."<BR>
<BR>
A hush fell over the bar patrons... After a minute of total silence, a hand went up in the back of the bar.<BR>
<BR>
A woman timidly spoke up: "I'll give it a try -- but you have to promise not to hit me on the head with the beer bottle."<BR>
