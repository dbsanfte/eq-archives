A software engineer, hardware engineer and departmental
manager were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were 
driving down a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes failed. 
The car careened out of control, bouncing off guard rails until it 
finally ground to a halt along the mountainside.
<P>
The occupants of the car were unhurt, but they had a problem.
They were stuck halfway down the mountain in a car with no brakes.
<P>
"I know" said the manager. " Let's have a meeting, propose a Vision, 
formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals, and through a 
process of Continuous Improvement, find a solution to the Critical 
Problems and we'll be on our way."
<P>
"No," said the hardware engineer. "I've got my Swiss army knife with 
me. I can strip down the car's braking system, isolate the fault, fix 
it, and we'll be on our way."
<P>
"Wait," said the software engineer. "Before we do anything, shouldn't 
we push the car back to the top of the mountain and see if it happens 
again?"
<P>
