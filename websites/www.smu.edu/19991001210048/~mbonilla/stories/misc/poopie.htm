<P>
Ghost Poo<BR>
You know you've pooed. There's poo on the toilet paper, but not in the
toilet. Where is it?
<P>
Teflon Poo<BR>
So slick and easy you don't even feel it. No trace of poo on the toilet
paper. You have to look in the toilet to be sure you did it.
<P>
Goo Poo<BR>
This has the consistency of hot tar. You wipe twelve times and you still
don't come clean. You end up putting toilet paper in your underwear so you
don't soil it. Permanent skid marks are left in the toilet.
<P>
Second Thoughts Poo<BR>
You're all done wiping and about to stand up when you realize... there's
more to come.
<P>
Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Poo<BR>
This is the kind of poo that killed Elvis. It doesn't want to come out
until you're all sweaty, trembling and purple from straining so hard.
<P>
Weight Watchers Poo<BR>
You poo so much you lose several pounds.
<P>
Right Now Poo<BR>
You'd better be within thirty seconds of a toilet. You burn rubber to get
there and it usually gets its head out before you can get your pants down.
<P>
King Kong Poo<BR>
This one is so big you think it won't go down the toilet unless you break
it into smaller chunks. A wire coat hanger usually works well. This kind of
poo usually happens when you're at someone else's house.
<P>
Cork Poo<BR>
Also known as "floaters". Even after the third flush it's still there,
floating in the bowl. My God! How do I get rid of it?
<P>
Wet Cheeks Poo<BR>
This poo hits the water sideways and makes a bigger splash than the
launching of the QE2, soaking your starfish.
<P>	
Wish Poo<BR>
You sit there all cramped up and fart a few times, but no poo.
<P>
Cement Block Poo<BR>
You wish you'd gotten a spinal block before you pooed.
<P>
Snake Poo<BR>
This poo is fairly soft, about as thick as your thumb and at least three
feet long.
<P>
Morning After Poo<BR>
Happens the day after the night before. Normally your poo doesn't smell
that bad, but THIS one... Usually you're at someone else's house (normally
a girl you're trying to impress) and they're waiting outside to use the
bathroom.
<P>
Mexican Food Poo<BR>
Also called "screamers". You know it's safe to eat again when your bum
stops burning.
<P>
Boo Hoo Poo<BR>
Makes you cry with pain and wonder whether your should risk the stitches or
go for the fuller figure.
<P>
