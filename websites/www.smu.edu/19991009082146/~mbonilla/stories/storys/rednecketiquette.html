<BR>
Redneck Personal Hygiene -<BR>
-----------------------------------<BR>
Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a hand-me-down item.<BR>
<BR>
While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Redneck Entertaining in Your Home<BR>
-----------------------------------<BR>
Do not allow the dog to eat at the table . . . no matter how good his  manners are.<BR>
<BR>
If your dog falls in love with a guest's leg, have the decency to leave them alone for a few minutes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Redneck Dating (Outside the Family) - <BR>
-----------------------------------<BR>
Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.<BR>
<BR>
Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: "I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's bathroom wall two years a go."<BR>
<BR>
If a girl's name does not appear regularly on a bathroom wall, water tower, or an overpass, odds are good that the date will end in frustration.<BR>
<BR>
