One Saturday morning,Glen decided to go fishing.
<P>
He sat there for hours,but nothing.The bottle whiskey
that he've took with him,was also empty.He throw the
empty bottle into pieces against a nearby rock.
<P>
All of a sudden,there was something on the hook.He
pulled the fish out of the water.The only fish for
the day so far.The fish was so small,Glen decided to
throw it back.
<P>
The little fish was so exited,to such an extend,that
it decided to give Glen one wish.
<P>
He asked the little fish for some more whiskey.The
fish said,"Allright then,when you're urinating,it
will be pure whiskey."
<P>
So Glen sat there,and wonder,can this really be ?
Glen took a glass and urinate in it.It was pure,pure
whiskey.
<P>
A while later,a women,who was standing nearby,comes
to him and asks,"sir are you allright ? I saw you
drinking your own piss."no,said Glen,it's whiskey.
<P>
The women laughed.He urinate into the glass,and gave
it to her.She could'nt believe it.
<P>
So they sat there almost for the rest of the day,
drinking whiskey.
<P>
After about the seventh double,she asks Glen for a
nother one.He looked her in the eye,throw the glass
into pieces against the rock and said "What about drinking
out of the bottle ?"
