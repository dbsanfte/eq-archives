When Mr Midas was dying, he devised a plan to take some of his fortune with him. He called the three people he trusted the most - his priest, his doctor, and his personal attorney. He gave them each an envelope with $1 million in cash, and asked them to place the money in his coffin so that he could take it with him. All three agreed to do so.  
<P>
At the funeral, each in turn approached the coffin, and placed their envelope inside. On leaving the cemetery, the priest told the others, "I must confess to you both that I only placed $700,000 in the coffin. My church is in desperate need of repairs, so I took the rest of the money to accomplish this worthy project." The doctor then said, "I must also confess; I took $500,000 to purchase new medical equipment, which my hospital badly needs to save people's lives. I am sure that Mr Midas would have approved, if he had really thought about it". 
<P>
The attorney looked at them both sternly, and said, "You both should be ashamed of yourselves. I followed Mr Midas' instructions to the letter. When I put the envelope into the coffin, it contained my personal cheque for the full $1 million."
