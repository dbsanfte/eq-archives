<CENTER><H3>The Night Before Christmas - Rated R </H3></CENTER>

Twas the night befor Christmas, and God it was neat. <BR>
The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.<BR>
<BR>
The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook, <BR>
It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook. <BR>
<BR>
Momma in her teddy and I in the nude,<BR>
Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube. <BR>
<BR>
When out on the lawn there arose such a cry, <BR>
That I lost my boner, and momma went dry.<BR>
<BR>
Up to the window I sprang like an elf,<BR>
Tore back the shade while she played with herself. <BR>
<BR>
The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built, <BR>
Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt. <BR>
<BR>
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<BR>
But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangey reindeer. <BR>
<BR>
With a fat little driver, half out of the sled, <BR>
A sock in his ear and a bra on his head.<BR>
<BR>
Sure as I'm speaking, he was high as a kite,<BR>
And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right. <BR>
<BR>
Woa Shithead, woa Asshole, woa Stupid, woa Putz,<BR>
Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts. <BR>
<BR>
Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree, <BR>
Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.<BR>
<BR>
They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub, <BR>
Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub. <BR>
<BR>
And then from the roof we heard such a clatter, <BR>
As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder. <BR>
<BR>
I was donning my jockies, to cover my ass,<BR>
When down the chimney Santa came with a crash. <BR>
<BR>
His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,<BR>
He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore. <BR>
<BR>
"That was some brothel," he said with a smile,<BR>
"The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay awhile" <BR>
<BR>
He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink, <BR>
Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink. <BR>
<BR>
I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee, <BR>
The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee. <BR>
<BR>
Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,<BR>
But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.<BR>
<BR>
The first thing he found was a pair of false tits, <BR>
The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.<BR>
<BR>
A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find, <BR>
And six pair of panties, the edible kind.<BR>
<BR>
A bra without nipples, a penis extension,<BR>
And several more things I shouldn't even mention. <BR>
<BR>
A fuck ring, a G-string, and all types of oil, <BR>
And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.<BR>
<BR>
"This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit, <BR>
So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split." <BR>
<BR>
He filled every stocking and then took his leave, <BR>
With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve. <BR>
<BR>
He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead, <BR>
Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.<BR>
<BR>
In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch, <BR>
Saying, "Take me home, Rudolph. This night's been a bitch!"<BR>
<BR>
The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,<BR>
"The best thing about pussy is you can't wear it out!!" <BR>
