A drunk decides to go ice fishing, so he gathers his gear and goes walking around until he finds a big patch of ice. He heads into the center of the ice and begins to saw a hole.  All of sudden, a loud booming voice comes out of the sky.<BR>
<BR>
"You will find no fish under that ice."<BR>
<BR>
The drunk looks around, but sees no one. He starts sawing again. Once more, the voice speaks.<BR>
<BR>
"As I said before, there are no fish under the ice."<BR>
<BR>
The drunk looks all around, high and low, but can't see a single soul. He picks up the saw and tries one more time to finish. Before he can even start cutting, the huge voice interrupts.<BR>
<BR>
"I have warned you three times now. There are no fish!"<BR>
<BR>
The drunk is now flustered and somewhat scared, so he asks the voice,<BR>
<BR>
"How do you know there are no fish? Are you God trying to warn me?"<BR>
<BR>
"No", the voice replied. "I am the manager of this hockey rink."<BR>
