<CENTER><H2>I'm Glad I'm A Woman</H2></CENTER>
I'm glad I'm a woman, yes I am, yes I am<BR>
I don't live off of Budweiser, beer nuts and Spam<BR>
I don't brag to my buddies about my erections<BR>
I won't drive to Hell before I ask for directions<BR>
I don't get wasted at parties and act like a clown<BR>
and I know how to put the damned toilet seat down!<BR>
<BR>
I won't grab your hooters, I won't pinch your butt<BR>
my belt buckle's not hidden beneath my beer gut<BR>
and I don't go around "readjusting" my crotch<BR>
or yell like Tarzan when my head-board gets a notch<BR>
I don't belch in public, I don't scratch my behind<BR>
I'm a woman you see --  I'm just not that kind!<BR>
<BR>
I'm glad I'm a woman, I'm so glad I could sing<BR>
I don't have body hair like shag carpeting<BR>
It doesn't grow from my ears or cover my back<BR>
When I lean over you can't see 3 inches of crack<BR>
And what's on my head doesn't leave with my comb<BR>
I'll never buy a toupee to cover my dome<BR>
Or have a few hairs pulled from over the side<BR>
I'm a woman, you know -- I've got far too much pride!<BR>
<BR>
And I honestly think its a privilege for me<BR>
to have these two boobs and squat when I pee<BR>
I don't live to play golf and shoot basketball<BR>
I don't swagger and spit like a Neanderthal<BR>
I won't tell you my wife just does not understand<BR>
stick my hand in my pocket to hide that gold band<BR>
or tell you a story to make you sigh and weep<BR>
then screw you, roll over and fall sound asleep!<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I'm glad I'm a woman, a woman you see<BR>
you can forget all about that old penis envy<BR>
I don't long for male bonding, I don't cruise for chicks<BR>
join the Hair Club For Men, or think with my dick<BR>
I'm a woman by chance and I'm thankful it's true<BR>
I'm so glad I'm a woman and not a man like you!<BR>
<P>
