A man out playing golf slices off into the woods.  When he goes to find the ball he discovers a witch (hat and all) stirring a cauldron.  So out of curiosity he asks her what she is brewing.  "A magic potion" she replies.  "Well what is it for?" he asks.  "This potion will make anyone an excellent golfer"  At this he gets really excited and asks if he can have some.  She is agreeable but warns him that it will have dire consequences on his sex life.  After a short period of soul searching he decides to try the potion.
<P>
He goes back to the golf course and completes an excellent game of golf. Next he challenges the golf pro and beats him easily.  He spends every possible moment of the next year playing golf at every course he manages to get to and has a wonderful time of it.  After a year he finds himself back at the same course where he found the witch.  Out of curiosity he slices one into the woods so he can talk to her.
<P>
"Well", she asks, "How has your game been?"
<P>
"Great!  This has been the best year of my life.  I have played all over the country and never lost a game."
<P>
"And how about your sex life?"
<P>
"Oh, not bad."
<P>
"Really?  This stuff can really ruin a guy's sex life.  Say, how many times did you have sex last year?"
<P>
"Hmmmm, it was three, no, four times."
<P>
"And you call that not bad?"
<P>
"Well for a priest with a small parish....."
