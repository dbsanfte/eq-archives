questions first<BR>
<BR>
1. u r walking 2 your boy/girl friends house. There r 2 roads 2 get there. 1 is a straight path which takes u there quickly, but is very plain & boring.  The other is curvy & full of wonderful sights on the way, but takes quite a while 2 reach your love's house.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>*-*-*-*- WHICH PATH DO U CHOOSE? short or long?-*-*-*-*</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
2. on the way, u see 2 rose bushes. 1 is full of white roses, 1 is full of red roses. u decide 2 pick 20 roses 4 your boy/girl friend. ( u could pick all of 1 color or half & half or whatever combo)<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>*-*-*-*- WHAT COLOR COMBO DO YOU CHOOSE? -*-*-*-*</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
3. u finally get 2 your boy/girl friend's house. u ring the bell & a family member answers the door. u can ask the family member 2 please get your love , or u may get him/her yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>*-*-*-*- WHAT DO U DO? ask or get your self? -*-*-*-*</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
4. now, u go up 2 your boy/ girl friend's room. no 1 is there. u can leave the roses by the windowsill or on the bed.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>*-*-*-*- WHERE DO U PUT THE ROSES? window or bed? -*-*-*-*</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
5. later its time 4 bed. u & your love goes 2 sleep, in separate rooms. u wake up in the morning & go 2 your boy/girl friend's room 2 check up on him/her. u enter the room:<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>*-*-*-*- IS HE/SHE AWAKE OR SLEEPING? pick 1 -*-*-*-*</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
6. it's time 2 go home now & u start 2 head back. u can take either road home now. the plain, boring 1 thats gets u home fast or the curvy, sight-filled road that u can just take your time with.<BR>

<CENTER>@}--}--- now check your answers ---{--{@</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
1. the road represents your attitude towards falling in love. if u chose the short one, u fall in love quickly & easily. if u chose the long one, u take your time & do not fall in love easily.<BR>
<BR>
2. the number of red roses represent how much u expect 2 give in a relationship. the number of white roses represents how much u expect in a relationship. so, if a person chose all red with 1 white rose, he/she gives 90% in the relationship but expects 2 recive only 10% back.<BR>
<BR>
3. this question shows your attitude in handling relationship problems. if u asked the family member 2 get your love, then your the type to avoid problems if u went 2 get your love yourself then your pretty direct & work out the problem right away.<BR>
<BR>
4. the placement of the roses indicate how often u would like 2 see your boy/girl friend. putting the roses on the bed means u want to see them a lot & if placed by the window meaning seeing each other once & a while is okay.<BR>
<BR>
5. finding your boy/girlfriend asleep: u accept your love the way they r. finding them awake means u expect them 2 change 4 u.<BR>
<BR>
6. the short & long roads now represent how long u stay in love. if u chose the short 1, u fall out of love easily.  if u chose the long 1, u tend 2 stay in love 4 a long time.<BR>
