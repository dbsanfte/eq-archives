A man and his dog are shipwrecked on a deserted island.  After a
few days he decides to take the dog and reconnoiter the island.
He discovers that the only other inhabitants are sheep.  He recalls
how his farm buddies  would brag how they would screw sheep
for kicks and he says to himself:  "I'll never be that desperate."
<P>
Sooooo, a few weeks later he can't get those sheep out of his mind, and
soon he's sneaking up on the flock.  Just as he is about to pounce on
a really cute one, the dog grabs his leg and won't let go.  He snaps
out of it, and thanks the dog for keeping him from making a fool of
himself.
<P>
This same scene happens every night for a month and the guy starts to
get really pissed at the dog.
<P>
Then one day, the man spies a life-raft bobbing in the surf.  In
the raft is a beautiful young girl, barely alive.  He takes her
back to his hut, revives her and nurses her to health.  After a few
days the girl is feeling fine, and that evening a rush of gratitude
sweeps over her....
<P>
She confronts the man:  "I owe you my life.  I'm yours forever.  I'll
do anything you want"
<P>
"Anything?"
<P>
"Anything!!"
<P>
"OK, hold that dog for ten minutes!!!"
<P>
