Scott received a parrot for his birthday.  This  bird was a fully grown parrot with a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary.  Every other word was an expletive.  Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least,  rude.<BR>
<BR>
Scott tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could think of to set a good example.  But nothing worked.  He yelled at the bird and the bird got worse. He shook the bird and the bird got more angry and more rude.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, in a moment of desperation, Scott put the parrot in the freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking and screaming -- then suddenly there was quiet.<BR>
<BR>
Scott was afraid he may have hurt the bird and threw open the freezer door. The parrot calmly stepped out onto Scott's extended arm and said: "I'm sorry that I might have offended you with my language and actions and I ask your forgiveness.  I will endeavor to correct my behavior."<BR>
<BR>
Scott was astonished at the bird's change in attitude and was about to ask what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot continued: "May I ask what the chicken did?"<BR>
