<CENTER><H3>The top 15 biblical ways to acquire a wife</H3></CENTER>

1.  Find an attractive prisoner of war, bring her home, shave her head, trim her nails, and give her new clothes.   Then she's yours. (Deuteronomy 21:11-13)<BR>
<BR>
2.  Find a prostitute and marry her. (Hosea 1:1-3)<BR>
<BR>
3.  Find a man with seven daughters, and impress him by watering his flock.  Moses  (Exodus 2:16-21)<BR>
<BR>
4.  Purchase a piece of property, and get a woman as part of the deal. Boaz (Ruth 4: 5-10)<BR>
<BR>
5.  Go to a party and hide.  When the women come out to dance, grab one and carry her off to be your wife.  Benjaminites (Judges 21:19-25)<BR>
<BR>
6.  Have God create a wife for you while you sleep.  Note:  this will cost you. - Adam (Genesis 2: 19-24)<BR>
<BR>
7.  Agree to work seven years in exchange for a woman's hand in marriage.  Get tricked into marrying the wrong woman.   Then work another seven years for the woman you wanted to marry in the first place.   That's right.  Fourteen years of hard labor for a wife. Jacob (Genesis 29: 15-30)<BR>
<BR>
8.  Cut 200 foreskins off of your future father in law's enemies and get his daughter for a wife.  David  (I Samuel  18:27)<BR>
<BR>
9.  Even if no one is out there, just wander around a bit and you'll definitely find someone.  (It's all relative, of course.) - Cain (Genesis 4: 16-17).<BR>
<BR>
10.  Become the emperor of a huge nation and hold a beauty contest. Xerxes or Ahaseurus (Esther 2: 3-4)<BR>
<BR>
11.  When you see someone you like, go home and tell your parents, "I have seen a woman, now get her for me."  If your parents question your decision, simply say "Get her for me.  She's the one for me."  Samson  (Judges 14: 1-3)<BR>
<BR>
12.  Kill any husband and take HIS  wife  (Prepare to lose four sons though.)  David  (2 Samuel  11)<BR>
<BR>
13.  Wait for your brother to die.  Take his widow.  (It's not just a good idea; it's the law.)  Onan and Boaz (Dueteronomy or Leviticus, example in Ruth)<BR>
<BR>
14.  Don't be so picky.  Make up for quality with quantity.  Solomon (1 Kings 11: 1-3)<BR>
<BR>
15.  A wife?...... NOT!  Paul (1 Corinthians 7: 32-35)<BR>
