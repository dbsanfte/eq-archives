<CENTER><H3>ADVENTUROUS DINING</H3></CENTER>

A man travels to Spain and goes to Pamplona during the great "running of the Bulls" festival.<BR>
<BR>
After his first day there, he goes out late for dinner at a restuarant in the center of the town. He orders the house special and he is brought a plate ,with potatoes, corn, and two large meaty objects.<BR>
<BR>
"What's this?" he asks.<BR>
<BR>
"Cojones, senor," the waiter replies.<BR>
"What are cojones?" the man asks.<BR>
"Cojones," the waiter explains, "are the testicles of the bull who lost at the arena this afternoon."<BR>
<BR>
At first the man is disgusted, but being the adventurous type, he decides to try this local delicacy. To his amazement, it is quite delicious. In fact, it is so good that he decides to come back again the next night and order it again. This time, the waiter brings out the plate, but the meaty objects are much smaller.<BR>
<BR>
"What's this?" he asks the waiter.<BR>
"Cojones, senor," the waiter replies.<BR>
<BR>
"No, no," the man objects. "I had cojones yesterday and they were much bigger than these."<BR>
<BR>
"Senor," the waiter explains, "the bull does not lose every time."<BR>
