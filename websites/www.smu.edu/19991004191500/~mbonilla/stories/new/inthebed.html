Three men were discussing aging at the nursing home. "Sixty is the worst age to be," said the 60-year-old. "You always feel like you have to pee. And most of the time, you stand at the toilet and nothing comes out!"<BR>
<BR>
"Ah, that's nothin'," said the 70-year-old. "When you're seventy, you can't have a bowel movement anymore. You take laxatives, eat bran, you sit on the toilet all day and nothin' comes out!"<BR>
"Actually," said the 80-year-old, "Eighty is the worst age of all."<BR>
"Do you have trouble peeing too?" asked the 60-year-old. "No, not really.<BR>
<BR>
I pee every morning at 6:00 am. I piss like a race horse; no problem at all."<BR>
"Do you have trouble having a bowel movement?" asked the 70-year-old.<BR>
"Well, not really. I have a great bowel movement every morning at 6:30 am."<BR>
<BR>
With great exasperation, the 60-year-old said, "Let me get this straight. You pee every morning at 6:00 am and have bowel movement every morning at 6:30. What's so tough about being 80?" <BR>
<BR>
"I don't wake up until 10:00 am."<BR>
