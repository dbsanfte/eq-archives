<CENTER><H2>Get the balance right</H2></CENTER>

There's more besides joyrides<BR>
Little house in the countryside<BR>
Understand, learn to demand,<BR>
Compromise, sometimes lie<BR>
<BR>
Get the Balance right, get the balance right<BR>
<BR>
Be responsible, respectable,<BR>
Stable but gullible<BR>
Concerned and caring, help the helpless<BR>
But always remain ultimately selfish<BR>
<BR>
Get the balance right, get the balance right<BR>
<BR>
You think you've got a hold of it all<BR>
You haven't got a hold at all<BR>
When you reach the top, get ready to drop<BR>
Prepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall<BR>
It's almost predictable<BR>
<BR>
Don't take this way, don't take that way<BR>
Straight down the middle until next Thursday<BR>
Push to the left, back to the right<BR>
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right<BR>
<BR>
Get the balance right<BR>
