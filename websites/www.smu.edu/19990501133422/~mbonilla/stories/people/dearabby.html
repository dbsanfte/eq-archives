<FONT FACE="" COLOR="#FF0000">DEAR ABBY:</FONT> A couple of women moved in across the hall from me. One is a middle-aged gym teacher and the other is a social worker in her mid-twenties.  These two women go everywhere together and I've never seen a man go into their apartment or come out. Do you think they could be Lebanese?<BR>
<BR>
CURIOUS<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DEAR ABBY:</FONT> I've been married for six years and have five kids. No twins. My husband still wants to have sex every night and sometimes in the morning too. I told him he should get himself a hobby, and he says that is his hobby.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...I have a man I never could trust. Why, he cheats so much I'm not even sure this baby I'm carrying is his.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
I am a twenty-three-year-old liberated woman who has been on the pill for two years. It's getting expensive and I think my boyfriend should share half the cost, but I don't know him well enough to discuss money with him.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...I suspected that my husband had been fooling around, and when I confronted him with the evidence he denied everything and said it would never happen again.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...Will you please rush me the name of a reliable illegitimate doctor?<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...Our son writes that he is taking Judo. Why would a boy who was raised in a good Christian home turn against his own?<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...I joined the Navy to see the world. I've seen it. Now how do I get out?<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...My forty-year-old son has been paying a psychiatrist $50 an hour every week for two-and-a-half years. He must be crazy.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...I was married to Bill for three months and I didn't know he drank until<BR>
one night he came home sober.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...Do you think it would be all right if I gave my doctor a little gift? I tried for years to get pregnant and couldn't and he finally did it.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
My mother is mean and short-tempered. I think she is going through her mental pause.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
I met this nice guy who was in the service. He's the chief petting officer.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
...Then you told some woman whose husband had lost all interest in sex to send him to a doctor. Well, my husband lost all interest in sex years ago and he is a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
--------<BR>
<BR>
...This is the second marriage for both of us. And when my husband said I will" he knew damn well he couldn't.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DEAR ABBY:</FONT> I've been going steady with this man for six years. We see each other every night. He says he loves me, and I know I love him, but he never mentions marriage. Do you think he's going out with me just for what he can get?<BR>
<BR>
GERTIE<BR>
<BR>
DEAR GERTIE: I don't know. What's he getting?<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DEAR ABBY:</FONT> My husband hates to spend money! I cut my own hair and make my own clothes, and I have to account for every nickel I spend.  meanwhile he has a stock of savings bonds put away that would choke a cow.  How do I get some money out of him before we are both called to our final judgment? He says he's saving for a rainy day.<BR>

DEAR WONDERING: The baby was on time, the wedding was late. Forget it.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DEAR ABBY:</FONT> I know boys will be boys, but my 'boy' is seventy-three and<BR>
he's still chasing women. Any suggestions?<BR>
<BR>
ANNIE<BR>
<BR>
DEAR ANNIE: Don't worry. My dog has been chasing cars for years, but if he ever caught one, he wouldn't know what to do with it.<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
