<P>
A young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday,
and as they had not been dating very long, after careful consideration, he 
decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note romantic, but not too 
personal.
<P>  
Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom and     
bought a pair of white gloves.  The sister purchased a pair of panties for
herself.
<P> 
During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the     
gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.  Without checking the contents,   
the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the
following note:
<P>
"I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing   
any when we go out in the evening.  If it had not been for your sister, I   
would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones
that are easier to remove.
<P>
"These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the
pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly
soiled.  I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.
<P>                                                                      
"I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other  
hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you
again. 
<P>
"When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away
as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.
<P>
"Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.  I hope 
you will wear them for me on Friday night.  All my love.
<P>
"P.S.  The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur  
showing."
