Your Favorite Color is the Key to Your Sexual Life
<P>
The clothes you wear, your home furnishings and the car you drive all 
give clues to your sexual personality. The key is the colors you 
select for your possessions. Most people claim they haven't a
favorite color. But look around you, and you'll notice a pattern, especially
in your clothing and home decor. The predominant color for you is the
one that appears most frequently -- it's the one that mirrors the sexual 
you. A panel of psychologists, speaking at the 1975 Home Interior 
Design Forum, explained the association between color and sexual 
patterns.
<P>
RED: People who like red tend to be tigers in the sack. They are 
easily aroused and enjoy sex in every way imaginable. Once the sexual 
spark is ignited, it may take hours to extinguish. When two reds get 
together, the ensuing erotica could make Lady Chatterly blush. Lovers 
of red tend to be aggressors and weaker colors should be aware.
<P>
YELLOW: If you tend to favor yellow, your sexual drives are complex 
and turn toward the adaptable. The favorite color of homosexuals is 
yellow. But don't panic -- not everyone who wears yellow is queer. In 
most cases the person will consent to the stronger partner's desires 
in a passive manner. You will never enjoy sex to the fullest, but you 
will never turn down an invitation from somebody you enjoy or admire.
<P>
PINK: Persons who like pink show a reluctance to mature in sexual 
matters: women tend to tease, to promise more than they intend to 
deliver. In some cases they flaunt their femininity -- but because 
they secretly hate men. A great percentage of prostitutes boast
entire wardrobes in pink. Men who like pink are the philanderers and flirts. 
They are the type who will make three dates for the same evening and 
not keep one, preferring to pick up a dish in some bar instead. Women 
whose husbands like pink should keep a secret nest egg.
<P>
PURPLE: Lovers of purple frequently consider themselves to be too 
sophisticated for a fun romp in the sack. Women sometimes are the
type who hate to mess their hair. Men are business-like in their approach 
to lovemaking. In both sexes purple partners are more concerned with 
their fulfillment than anyone else's gratification.
<P>
BLACK: Black color preferences point to black sex (not necessarily 
meaning black partners). These people are the misfits of the sex
world and seek out each other in kinship. They tend to prefer perverted sex 
and are usually masochistic or sadistic in nature. They are moody 
people and often perform at their peak when under stress or during 
unhappy times. Police psychiatrists claim that sex offenders prefer 
the color black. And it is no coincidence that the uniform of mosters 
and teenage gangs is black attire.
<P>
GREEN: Those who prefer green are fresh and innocent in their
approach to sex. Women who love green will always make love like virgins all 
their life. And a man may always be a trifle clumsy and awkward but
in a charming and endearing sort of way. Green lovers are gentle, but
not passionate. If chosen as a mate, one will never need worry about 
infidelity.
<P>
ORANGE: Lovers of the color orange lean toward sexual fantasies. The 
sex act is regarded as a dramatic one-act play in which they are the 
star. Foreplay is as important as the act of love. They whisper sweet 
nothings, meaningless dialogue; they feel it is their image. Orange 
people often do not experience orgasm -- but they put on a darn good 
act. Men tend to pull their partner's hair, and women leave red welts 
on the sex partner's back.
<P>
BROWN: If you love brown, you're a real treasure for the right mate. 
Brown lovers tend to be warm and deep, sensitive to the needs and 
desires of their partners. Sex is a 24 hour a day thing. Where you 
can't say "I love you" often enough. Snuggling by the fire, walking
in the rain or catching snowflakes on their tongue is a turn-on to a 
lover of brown. They need lots of time and privacy to make love. But 
their emotions are such that one harsh word could end the affair.
<P>
GREY: The color grey a preferred by people who are indecisive. They 
can't get excited about anything -- including color -- so they choose 
a noncommittal shade. Men who prefer grey look at sex as a way of 
relieving tension -- but nothing more, nothing less. It's wham, bam, 
thank you ma'am. Women don't make love, they have intercourse. And
for one of two reasons only: to accommodate their mate, or to become 
pregnant. They count the cracks in the bedroom plaster until the sex 
act is over with and done. But when teamed with another color, the 
grey spouse considers the other's infidelity a blessing. When a grey 
marries another grey, the marriage is made in heaven.
<P> 
BLUE: Lovers of blue are wonderful sex partners. They are sinners, 
affectionate and sensitive to their partner's needs. They consider 
love making a fine art and their approach is elegant. Men who love 
blue are like concert pianists, delicately ravaging their partner
like they would play a baby grand. Women in the blue category enjoy sex to 
the fullest. They are exciting partners but their passion may be 
compared to a tidal wave rather than firery aggression. Both women
and men enjoy foreplay and the aftermath of lovemaking, as much as the
sex act itself. In marriage a blue person is a wonderful mate -- never 
seeking outside interests.
<P>
WHITE: If a person is infatuated with white, sex often seems filthy. 
These people are puritanical in nature. French kissing is obscene and 
to make love in the daylight in unheard of. Women who love white will 
undress beneath the covers. Men will shower before and after the sex 
act. These people still use pet names for their genitals.
