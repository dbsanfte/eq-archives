1. Bitch<BR>
<BR>
2. When asked "Is something bothering you?" reply "no" then get pissed off when you are believed.<BR>
<BR>
3. Become attracted to someone because he is outgoing and loves parties, start dating him, and immediately expect him to stop this behavior.<BR>
<BR>
4. Always take an hour longer than promised to prepare for the<BR>
evening.<BR>
<BR>
5. Always hide very important events in very unimportant terms so you can have something to be pissed about when your boyfriend declines because he has pressing business: i.e. You say "It's no big deal, but I was wondering if you would like to visit my parents with me if you are not busy this weekend." when you mean "It means a great deal to me for you to see my family with me this weekend if at all possible!"<BR>
<BR>
6. Whine<BR>
<BR>
7. If you are trying to sleep, it's because you're exhausted from your almost superhuman level of daily achievement; if he is trying to sleep it's because he is lazy.<BR>
<BR>
8. No matter what the activity, he doesn't do it as well as a past boyfriends.<BR>
<BR>
9. If he pays attention to you, he is smothering you.<BR>
<BR>
10. If he gives you space, he is ignoring you.<BR>
<BR>
11. Complain<BR>
<BR>
12. Hate any bar he likes.<BR>
<BR>
13. Demand to be treated as an equal in everything - except when paying for meals, airplane tickets, concerts, beers, clothes, etc. - these are required gifts proving his love.<BR>
<BR>
14. Declare PMS at any given time.  If he is knowledgeable about your cycle, tell him you're irregular from all the stress of your life.<BR>
<BR>
15. Remember that ANY woman who so much as stares at your boyfriend must be labeled a WHORE and your network of friends must be informed immediately to spread this as quick as possible.<BR>
<BR>
16. Make his life miserable by making him feel guilty about doing anything other than catering to your needs.<BR>
<BR>
17. Break into tears for no apparent reason, then use number 2.<BR>
<BR>
18. Ask for help in some endeavor then become livid when it is given.<BR>
<BR>
19. Weasel yourself into your boyfriend's group of friends, break up with him, then make sure you are present at every gathering for the next month just to rub it in.
