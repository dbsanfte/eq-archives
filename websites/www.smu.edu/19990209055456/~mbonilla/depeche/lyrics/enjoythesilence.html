<H2><CENTER>Enjoy the silence</CENTER></H2>

Words like violence<BR>
Break the silence<BR>
Come crashing in<BR>
Into my little world<BR>
<BR>
Painful to me<BR>
Pierce right through me<BR>
Can't you understand<BR>
Oh my little girl<BR>
<BR>
All I ever wanted<BR>
All I ever needed<BR>
Is here in my arms<BR>
Words are very unnecessary<BR>
They can only do harm<BR>
<BR>
Vows are spoken<BR>
To be broken<BR>
Feelings are intense<BR>
Words are trivial<BR>
Pleasures remain<BR>
So does the pain<BR>
Words are meaningless<BR>
And forgettable<BR>
<BR>
All I ever wanted<BR>
All I ever needed<BR>
Is here in my arms<BR>
Words are very unnecessary<BR>
They can only do harm<BR>
<BR>
Enjoy the silence<BR>

<P>
