The British Military writes OFR's (officer fitness reports).  The form used for Royal Navy and Marines fitness reports is the S206.  The following are actual excerpts taken from people's "206's"....
<BR>
- His men would follow him anywhere, but only out of curiosity.<BR>
- I would not breed from this Officer.<BR>
- This Officer is really not so much of a has-been, but more of a definitely won't-be.<BR>
- When she opens her mouth, it seems that this is only to change<BR>
- whichever foot was previously in there.<BR>
- He has carried out each and every one of his duties to his entire - satisfaction.<BR>
- He would be out of his depth in a car park puddle.<BR>
- Technically sound, but socially impossible.<BR>
- This Officer reminds me very much of a gyroscope - always spinning<BR>
- around at a frantic pace, but not really going anywhere.<BR>
- This young lady has delusions of adequacy.<BR>
- When he joined my ship, this Officer was something of a granny; since<BR>
- then he has aged considerably.<BR>
- This Medical Officer has used my ship to carry his genitals from port to port, and my officers to carry him from bar to bar.<BR>
- Since my last report he has reached rock bottom, and has started to dig.<BR>
- She sets low personal standards and then consistently fails to achieve them.<BR>
- He has the wisdom of youth, and the energy of old age.<BR>
- This Officer should go far - and the sooner he starts, the better.<BR>
- In my opinion this pilot should not be authorized to fly below 250 feet.<BR>
- The only ship I would recommend this man for is citizenship.<BR>
- Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap.<BR>
- This man is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.<BR>
- Only occasionally wets himself under pressure.<BR>
