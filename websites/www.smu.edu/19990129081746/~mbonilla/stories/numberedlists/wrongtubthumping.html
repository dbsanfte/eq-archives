The Original:  I get knocked down, but I get up again, You're never going to keep me down.<BR>

The Wacky: <BR>
15. I see a clown, get the banana skin, <BR>
    I make him slip and then fall down.  <BR>
  <BR>
14. I wear a frown, I lost my job again.  <BR>
    Even though my nose and ears are brown.  <BR>
  <BR>
13. I get rebounds, but never score a ten.  <BR>
    My hair is colored like a clown.  <BR>
  <BR>
12. My panties made her frown, so she yanked off my rug, <BR>
    I better learn to glue it down.  <BR>
  <BR>

    Harmony's tough so we said "What the hell..."  <BR>
  <BR>
10. I got no job, but I'm a hooligan.  <BR>
    I get in fights at soccer games.  <BR>
  <BR>

    by a handkerchief wearing clown.  <BR>
  <BR>
8. We've got one hit.  Now buy the whole CD, <BR>
    you stupid trendy yankee wanks.  <BR>
  <BR>
7. I get blocked up, but Ex-Lax makes me go -- <BR>
    you wouldn't wanna be around.  <BR>
  <BR>
6. The hooker frowns, as i get out a ten, <BR>
    but Mama never gives me more.  <BR>
  <BR>
5. I bet that John, had a fifth of gin.  <BR>
    Denver's in the sea for now.  <BR>
  <BR>
4. I get knackwurst, and some sauerkraut.  <BR>
    I'm never gonna keep this down.  <BR>
  <BR>
3. Goodbye, English Rose...  <BR>
  <BR>
2. I am Geoff Brown, Top5 contributor.  <BR>
