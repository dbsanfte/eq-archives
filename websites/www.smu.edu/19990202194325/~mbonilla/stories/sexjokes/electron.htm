<H2><CENTER> The Sex Life of an Electron </CENTER></H2>
<br>
<p>  One night when his charge was pretty high, Micro Farad decided to
get a cute little coil to let him discharge.  He picked up Millie Amp
and took her for a ride on his megacycle.  They rode across the Wheatstone
Bridge, around the sine wave, and into a magnetic field next to a flowing
current.</p>

<p> Micro Farad, attracted by Millie Amp's characteristic curve, soon
had her field fully excited and he couldn't resistor.  He laid her on the
ground potential, raised her frequency, lowered her resistance, and pulled
out his high voltage probe.  He inserted it in parallel and began to short
circuit her shunt.</p>

  Fully excited, Millie Amp cried, "Mho, Mho.  Give me Mho!"

<p>  "Ohmigod, this is good," shouted Micro.  With his tube at maximum
output and her coil vibrating from current flow, her shunt soon reached
maximum heat.</p>

<p>  The excess heat had gotten her shunt pretty hot and Micro's
capacitance was rapidly discharging, ... draining off every electron.
They fluxed all night, trying various connections and sockets until
Micro's bar magnet had lost all of it's field strength.</p>

<p> Afterward, Millie tried self-inductance and damaged her solenoid.
But it didn't phasor.  With his battery fully discharged, Micro Farad was
unable to excite his transformer.  So they ended up by reversing polarity,
and blowing each other's fuses.</p>
