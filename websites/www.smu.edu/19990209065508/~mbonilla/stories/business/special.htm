<P>
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES<BR>
     FR:  MANAGEMENT<BR>
<BR>
     SUBJECT:   SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING<BR>
<BR>
     In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and<BR>
productivity     from employees, it will be our policy to keep all<BR>
employees well trained through our program of SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY<BR>
TRAINING (S.H.I.T.).  We are trying to give employees more S.H.I.T. than<BR>
anyone else.<BR>
<BR>
     If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the<BR>
job,please see your manager.  You will be immediately placed at the top<BR>
of the S.H.I.T. list, and our managers are especially skilled at seeing<BR>
that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.<BR>
<BR>
     Employees who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in<BR>
DEPARTMENTAL EMPLOYEE EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P S.H.I.T.).  Those who<BR>
fail to take D.E.E.P S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to EMPLOYEE<BR>
ATTITUDE TRAINING (E.A.T S.H.I.T.).  Since our managers took S.H.I.T.<BR>
before they were promoted, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and<BR>
are all full of S.H.I.T. already.<BR>
<BR>
     If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job<BR>
training others.  We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING<BR>
LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).  Those who are full of B.U.L.L.<BR>
S.H.I.T. will get the S.H.I.T. jobs, and can apply for promotion to<BR>
DIRECTOR OF INTENSITY PROGRAMMING (D.I.P. S.H.I.T.).<BR>
<BR>
     If you have further questions, please direct them to our HEAD OF<BR>
TRAINING, SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Thank you,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     BOSS IN GENERAL<BR>
     SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING<BR>
