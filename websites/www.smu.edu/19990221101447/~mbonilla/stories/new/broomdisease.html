<CENTER><H3>Broom Disease...</H3></CENTER>

A young French peasant girl went to work in a local broom factory.<BR>
<BR>
After only four months had passed, she gave her boss a two-week notice that she's going to quit.<BR>
<BR>
The boss was quite unhappy to let her go since she was a hard working peasant girl. He called her into his office...<BR>
<BR>
"But why?" He asked.<BR>
<BR>
"No reason,"She said sullenly. "I just want to quit, that's all."<BR>
<BR>
"Look," he begged, "I'll give you a raise."<BR>
<BR>
"No." She said.<BR>
<BR>
"You can't just quit like that. There must be a reason. Tell me."<BR>
<BR>
"Okay," said the peasant girl, "if you must know..."<BR>
<BR>
She took off her underwear and point to her pubic hair, "Look, this just started to grow-- it's the broom's bristles!"<BR>
<BR>
Tickled by her innocence, The boss took off his underwear and showed his, and said: "See my dear... I have it too!"<BR>
<BR>
"Oh no!" The girl cried with a sob, "I have to quit right now!"<BR>
<BR>
"But why?"<BR>
<BR>
"Not only do you have the bristles," she pointed, "but you've started to grow the broom handle as well."<BR>
