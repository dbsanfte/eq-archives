This story is true, very true...the phrase "that sucks" will take
on a whole new meaning...
<P>
Bill Gale was here on Saturday night, and he told us the funniest
story I have ever heard in my life, about one of his friends (and it's 
true).  (It doesn't matter if you don't know Bill Gale;  this is still 
a great story.  However, if you do know Bill Gale, try to picture him 
telling this one at a bar.)
<P>

<P>
This guy lives in Westchester, NY and goes to school at Ithaca
College.  For two years, he has wanted to ask a certain girl (who is 
also from Westchester and also goes to Ithaca) out on a date, but has 
never had the courage.  Finally, one day over the summer, he sees her 
at home and musters up the courage to ask her out.  She accepts, and 
they make dinner plans for Saturday night.
<P>
Friday night, this guy goes out with all of his buddies, and
drinks like Prohibition is coming back.  Saturday, he is in such bad 
shape that he can't make it through twenty minutes without either 
puking or shitting.  After several hours of this, he is able to stop 
puking, but he is still running to the toilet every 20 minutes to shit. 
 He doesn't want to cancel the date, because he's afraid he won't ever 
talk to her again.  So they meet in Westchester, and take the train to 
New York City (about a 30 minute ride).
<P>
They get to the restaurant, and he excuses himself during the
appetizers to use the bathroom.  They enjoy the rest of the appetizers 
without interruption, but he has to go back again during the entrees. 
They decide to get dessert.  During dessert, our hero feels another 
rumbling, but doesn't want to look like a complete bathroom freak, so 
he holds it.
<P>
After a few minutes, the rumbling subsides, but he still has a bit
of gas stored up.  He decides to let this little bit of gas fly right 
there at the table (discreetly, of course). Unfortunately, this little 
bit of gas came with another little surprise.  "Oh shit," he thinks (and
feels).  Instead of running to the bathroom right away, our hero 
immediately leans on the arms of his chair to keep from sitting on this 
surprise.  He maintains this yoga position for the rest of dessert, 
trying to figure out what to do before his tan pants...  (a) start to 
smell, or (b) start to show stains on the outside.
<P>
He quickly pays for dinner and they leave the restaurant.  Oh, by
the way, he is walking like a cowboy.  On the way to the train station, 
they pass the Gap.
<P>
"Do you mind if I run in and buy a sweater that I was looking at
last week?" he asks.
<P>
"No problem, I'd like to look around too," she replies.
<P>
They go into the Gap.  Fortunately, at the Gap, men's fashions are
on the right, women's fashions are on the left.  They split up.  Our 
hero grabs the first sweater within reach, and hurries back to the 
khakis.  After selecting a pair that most closely resemble his current 
outfit, he brings both items to the register.  His eyes are on his date 
(still on the other side of the store) to make sure that she doesn't 
see him buying the pants.  He doesn't even want the sweater, so he says 
through clenched teeth (just in case his date can read lips from 40 
feet away) "Just the pants."
<P>
"What?" asks the Gap girl.
<P>     
"Just the pants!"  (His eyes still trained on his date.)
<P>   
Gap girl:  "Oh, OK."
<P>
He pays for the pants and walks over to his date, then they leave
the store.
<P>
They board the train just before it leaves the station and find
two seats in the middle of the car.  Without sitting down, our hero 
excuses himself and walks to the bathroom in the back of the car.  He 
gets to the bathroom as the train departs, and quickly rips off his 
pants and boxer shorts.  He rolls them into a ball and throws them out 
the window.  After cleaning himself off, he opens the Gap bag and pulls 
out...just the sweater.
<P>
**PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION.**
<P>As you must have realized, the only solution is to wear the
sweater as pants.  So he squeezes his legs into the arms of the sweater 
and pulls the rest of the fabric tight around his waist.  He can only 
keep himself covered by hunching over.  Walking will be a new challenge 
altogether.
<P>
Rather than going through the absolute trauma of returning to his
seat and explaining (or creating an elaborate lie to explain) the 
entire incident, our hero waits in the bathroom until the train stops 
at the next station.  He waits until the moment the train starts to 
pull away from the station, then dashes out of the bathroom (as quickly 
as a hunched over cowboy with sweater pants can dash) and jumps off the 
train.  He is lost and stranded somewhere between New York City and 
Westchester.
<P>
He hasn't seen the girl since.
