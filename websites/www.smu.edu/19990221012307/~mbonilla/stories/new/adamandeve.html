After a few days on the new Earth, the Lord called to Adam and said, "It  is time for you and Eve to begin the process of populating the earth, so I want you to kiss her."<BR>
<BR>
Adam answered, "Yes, Lord, but what is a 'kiss'?"  The Lord gave a brief description to Adam, who took Eve by the hand and took her to a nearby bush.<BR>
<BR>
A few minutes later, Adam emerged and said, "Thank you Lord, that was enjoyable."<BR>
<BR>
And the Lord replied, "Yes Adam, I thought you might enjoy that. Now, I'd  like you to caress Eve."<BR>
<BR>
And Adam said, "What is a 'caress'?"<BR>
<BR>
So, the Lord again gave Adam a brief description and Adam went behind the bush with Eve.<BR>
<BR>
Quite a few minutes later, Adam returned, smiling, and said, "Lord, that was even better than the kiss."<BR>
<BR>
And the Lord said, "You've done well Adam.  And now, I want you to make love to Eve."<BR>
<BR>
And Adam asked, "What is 'make love', Lord?"  <BR>
<BR>
So, the Lord again gave Adam directions and Adam went again to Eve behind the bush, but this time he re-appeared in two seconds.<BR>
<BR>
And Adam said, "Lord, what is a 'headache'?"<BR>
