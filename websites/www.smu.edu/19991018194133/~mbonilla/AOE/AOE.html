Welcome to my addiction.... Its a horrible horrible thing called Ages of 
Empire. A game of intense combat, collectionion of resources, and 
tons of startegy. I discovered AOE a year ago. I remember 
downloading some random demo and recalling how amusing I found these 
little men with axes running around trying to get some lion and chop 
down a tree. It was too funny and amusing. After playing this game 
for a couple of days, I ran down to my friendly neighborhood Comp 
USA and bought it. WOW did I royally suck at first! But I played 
these scenarios and finally conquered the game. Or so I thought I 
had. This is when I discovered something truly evil.... MULTIPLAYER 
GAMING. Now I played and played against people and came to the 
conclusion that I sucked. I mean, I wasn't that bad, but I definetly 
wasn't great. But then I discovered something even more evil... 
Multiplayer Deathmatch!! Gasp! I finally found a game that suited my 
style. Fast, furious fun! Oh, and I didn't have to worry about 
getting my butt kicked in 10 minutes by some guy with a faster civ. 
So after a little bit of time getting thoroughly abused time and 
time again, I finally got good enough so that I could take some big 
boys on. But then! (now this is truly horrifying) Someone discovered 
that Choson legions were actually good at deathmatch.

Now this little discovery truly made my life 
miserable. Here I was, actually getting good at DM and then someone 
figures out that you can win if you send out hundred and hundereds 
of cheap, quickly produced, powerful men against my massive, slow, 
expensive units.

At first I had no clue what I should do, anything I would do I would get overrun. So I tried to make towers first and put them everywhere. That didn't work, they just built somewhere else. But then, I discovered something truly wonderful. Heavy Horse Archers. Wooohoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get a big-ass group of them (i'm talking like 60, or 70 of the bad boys) and watch them kill, kill, kill!!! Now I was good at AOE again. I still wasn't the best (and I won't be, there are toooo many other good players for that) But I was getting better and better. Then I figured out something new... The earlier I kill someone, the better it is for me :) So I figured out the Elephant rush. And it worked quite well, elephants running through towns, killing everything. But then, Someone decided that they would use these priest guys to steal them away. hmmmmm. Well, I still haven't figured out what to do with them, But eventually I did learn that towers and elephants rampaging through a guys town was a good thing and that the faster I made my stuff and built up my town, the more of an advantage I had over other players. So that's about where I am now. I'm a big bad hittite killing machine (although, I still do get beat badly every once in a while, and the big bad thing is more of a legend in my own mind kind of deal :) But I still love this game, the random maps give the game a great feel as each time is different depending on the map. And I love hanging out in the zone, chatting it up and having big fun with my friends there. Its cool. We have out own little community there, We talk about our favorite game, try to come up with stuff for it, and try to beat each other up. hehehe. But other than that, I would have to say I like AOE because of the great replayability and the fun of playing with a team and hanging out with other people who enjoy the same things. OK, ok, i've rambled more than enough... Now come and gain some knowledge from me, Godzilla (yep! that's right, I'm a big green radioactive lizard when i'm playing Ages of Empire).
