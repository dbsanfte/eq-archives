<CENTER><H3>What the employees really mean</H3></CENTER>1. &quot;Can I help you get a size?&quot; Don't touch that, I just spent an hour folding it and I don't need your grubby little hands messing it up again.<BR>
<BR>
2. &quot;Do you need help with anything?&quot; Quick, my manager is coming around the corner and  I need to look busy.<BR>
<BR>
3. 
            &quot;Welcome to &lt;Insert Store Name Here&gt; Good, another customer to mess up my entire store just to buy a pair of socks.<BR>
<BR>
4. &quot;Have a nice day!&quot; Now that you ruined mine<BR>
<BR>
5. &quot;Thank you for shopping at &lt;Insert Store Name Here&gt;&quot; Thanks for emptying your wallet with us!<BR>
<BR>
6. &quot;Do you need a shopping cart to help you carry your items?&quot; The more you can carry, the more you can buy!<BR>
<BR>
7. &quot;I love your shirt! Where did you get it?&quot; Your shirt is much nicer than the clothes we sell here, hell, why are you even shopping here?<BR>
<BR>
8. &quot;Can I help you get something down?&quot; I'll get a ladder and put it up for you since this other nice customer put in the absolut wrong place.<BR>
<BR>
9. &quot;Don't worry about folding it, I can do it&quot; You would just mess it up again if you folded it.<BR>
<BR>
10. &quot;No, we dont have any more in the back&quot; I just dont want to check<BR>
<BR>
11. &quot;Sorry, I cannot make change of a dollar&quot; I already opened my register with 'No Sale' enough times today to steal 5 bucks in pennies to pay for my dinner, i dont need to open it again for no reason.<BR>
<BR>
12. &quot;Sorry, I can't help you at the moment, I am with another customer&quot; Go Away. I'm on break and shopping for myself, I am just too lazy to take my nametag off.<BR>
<BR>
13. &quot;I'm sorry. We don't have any more of that particular item in stock at the moment, we may be getting some in this week&quot; Your not going to come back anyway, so it is ok if I lie to you, and If you do come back to get it, then the shipment truck was in an accident.<BR>
<BR>
14. &quot;Those polka dot pants with yellow stripes look amazing on you, They make you look so skinny&quot; I'm on commission here and I am lying through my teeth.<BR>
<BR>
15. &quot;Of course that shirt is in style&quot; I grew out of that shirt 7 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
16. &quot;It would make a wonderful birthday gift&quot; If the birthday child was blind that is.<BR>
<BR>
17. &quot;What do you need help with miss?&quot; Am I annoying you yet?<BR>
