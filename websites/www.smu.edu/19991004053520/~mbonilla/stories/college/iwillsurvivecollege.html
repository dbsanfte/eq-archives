At first I was afraid<BR>
Now I'm petrified<BR>
That I can't keep my GPA of 2.5<BR>
I spent all those stupid nights<BR>
Chilling way too long<BR>
And that was wrong<BR>
But now I must be strong<BR>
<BR>
And now they're back<BR>
They're in my face<BR>
3 finals and 2 papers<BR>
to be done in just five days!<BR>
I shouldn't have gone out<BR>
I shouldn't have partied<BR>
'Cause now all this work I have<BR>
Is piling up on me!<BR>
<BR>
And I must go<BR>
to the library<BR>
To do research on those papers<BR>
And, yes, I must study<BR>
It's hell, I'll tell you that<BR>
and you know it's not a lie<BR>
But I can't crumble<BR>
I can't lay down and die<BR>
<BR>
Oh no not I!<BR>
I will survive!<BR>
If I keep a 2 point O<BR>
At least I'll be alive!<BR>
I've got five more days to live<BR>
and I think my brain will give<BR>
But I'll survive!<BR>
I will survive!<BR>
