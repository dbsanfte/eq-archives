<P>
A young woman who was several months pregnant boarded a bus.  When she 
noticed a young man smiling at her she began feeling humiliated on 
account of her condition.  She changed her seat and  he seemed more 
amused.  She moved again and then on her fourth move he burst out
laughing. 
 <P>
She had him arrested and when the case came before the court this was the
man's reply when asked why he acted in such a manner: "When the lady 
boarded the bus I couldn't help noticing she was pregnant.  She sat under
an advertisment which read "Coming Soon The Gold Dust Twins", then she 
moved under one that read "Sloans Liniments remove Swelling".  I was even
more amused when she sat under a shaving advertisment which read "William
Stick Did The Trick".  Then I could not control myself any longer when on
the fourth move she sat under an advertisment which read "Dunlop Rubber 
would have prevented this accident."  He won the case.
