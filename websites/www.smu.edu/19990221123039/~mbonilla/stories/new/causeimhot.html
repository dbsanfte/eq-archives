Wife: Oh, come on.<BR>
Husband: Leave me alone!<BR>
Wife: It won't take long.<BR>
Husband: I won't be able to sleep afterwards.<BR>
Wife: I can't sleep without it.<BR>
Husband: Why do you think of things like this in the middle of the night?<BR>
Wife: Because I'm Hot.<BR>
Husband: You get hot at the darnest times.<BR>
Wife: If you love me I wouldn't have to beg you.<BR>
Husband: If you love me you'd be more considerate.<BR>
Wife: You don't love me anymore.<BR>
Husband: Yes I do, but let's forget it for tonight.<BR>
Wife: (Sob-Sob)<BR>
Husband: Alright, I'll do it.<BR>
Wife: What's the matter? Need a flashlight?<BR>
Husband: I can't find it.<BR>
Wife: Oh, for heaven's sake, feel for it!<BR>
Husband: There! Are you satisfied?<BR>
Wife: Oh, yes, honey.<BR>
Husband: Is it up far enough?<BR>
Wife: Oh, that's fine.<BR>
Husband: Now go to bed and from now on when you want the window open, do ityourself.<BR>
