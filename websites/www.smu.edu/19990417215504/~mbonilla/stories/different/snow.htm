January 10<BR>
<BR>
It's 5:00 P.M. It's starting to snow. The first of the season and
the first we've seen in years. The wife and I took our hot buttered
rum and sat by the picture window watching the soft flakes drift 
down, clinging to the trees and covering the ground. It was so beautiful.<BR>
<BR>
January 11<BR>
<BR>
We woke up to a lovely blanket of crystal white snow covering the 
landscape. what a fantastic sight. every tree and shrub covered with
with a beautiful mantle. I shoveled snow for the first time in my life
and loved it. I did both the driveway and the sidewalk. Later a
snowplow came along and accidentally covered up the driveway with 
compacted snow from the street. The snowplow driver waved and smiled.
I waved back and shoveled again.<BR>
<BR>
January 12<BR>
<BR>
It snowed an additional 5 inches last night and the Tempe has dropped to 
11 degrees. Several tree limbs have been snapped from the snow. I
shoveled the the drive again. Shortly afterwards
the snowplow came again.Now the snow is brownish-gray.<BR>
<BR>
January 13<BR>
<BR>
It warmed today to cause slush which froze again when Tempe dropped.
Bought snow tires for both cars. Fell on my ass in the driveway, $145.00
to a chiropractor. Nothing broken. More snow.<BR>
<BR>
January 14<BR>
<BR>
Still cold as hell. Sold the wife's car. Bought a 4X4 to get her to
work. Slid into a guard rail anyway, considerable damage. Another 8 
inches of snow last night. Both vehicles covered with salt and crud.
More shoveling for me. The god damn snowplow came twice today.<BR>
<BR>
January 15<BR>
<BR>
It's 2 fucking degrees outside. More fucking snow. Not a tree on our
property hasn't been damaged. Power was off most of the night. Tried
to keep from freezing to death with candles and kerosene heater, which
tipped over and nearly burned the fucking house down. Managed to put
the flames out but suffered 2nd degree burns on my hands plus lost all
my eyelashes and eyebrows. Car slid off the road on the way to the
emergency room and totaled it.<BR>

<BR>
More mother fucking god damn white shit keeps coming down. Have to put
on all the clothes we own just to get to the fucking mailbox. If I
ever catch the son-of-a bitch who drives that fucking snowplow, I'll
chew open his chest and rip out his heart. I think he hides around the
corner till I shovel. Power still off. Toilet froze. Roof has started
to cave in.<BR>
<BR>
January 17<BR>
<BR>
Six more fucking inches of fucking white shit and fucking sleet and
no telling what the fuck else fell last night. I wounded the fucking
snowplow asshole with an ice, but he got away. Wife left me, car won't 
start. I think I'm going snowblind, I can't feel my fucking toes.
Haven't seen the sun in weeks. More white shit forecasted. Wind chill
is 22 below. I'm moving my ass back to TEXAS. <BR>
