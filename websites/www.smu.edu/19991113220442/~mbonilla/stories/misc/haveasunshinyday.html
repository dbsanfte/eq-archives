She smiled at a sorrowful stranger.<BR>
The smile seemed to make him feel better.<BR>
He remembered past kindnesses of a friend<BR>
And wrote him a thank you letter.<BR>
The friend was so pleased with the thank you<BR>
That he left a large tip after lunch.<BR>
The waitress, surprised by the size of the tip,<BR>
Bet the whole thing on a hunch.<BR>
The next day she picked up her winnings,<BR>
And gave part to a man on the street.<BR>
The man on the street was grateful;<BR>
For two days he'd had nothing to eat.<BR>
After he finished his dinner,<BR>
He left for his small dingy room.<BR>
He didn't know at that moment<BR>
that he might be facing his doom.<BR>
On the way he picked up a shivering puppy<BR>
And took him home to get warm.<BR>
The puppy was very grateful<BR>
To be in out of the storm.<BR>
That night the house caught on fire.<BR>
The puppy barked the alarm.<BR>
He barked till he woke the whole household<BR>
And saved everybody from harm.<BR>
One of the boys that he rescued<BR>
Grew up to be President.<BR>
All this because of a simple smile<BR>
That hadn't cost a cent.<BR>
