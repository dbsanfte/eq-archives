<H2><CENTER> A Dog Named Sex</CENTER></H2>
 <BR><BR>
 Usually everyone who has a dog calls him Rover or something.
 I call mine 'Sex'.
 <BR><BR>
 Well, Sex is a very embarrassing name.  One day I took Sex for a walk and he
 ran away from me.  I spent hours looking for that dog.  A cop came along and
 asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning.  I said
 I was looking for Sex.  My court case comes up next Thursday.
 <BR><BR>
 One day I went to City Hall to get a license for Sex.  The clerk asked me what
 I wanted, I told him I wanted a license for Sex.  He said ``I would like to
 have one too!''  When I said ``But this is a dog'' he said he didn't care what
 she looked like.  Then I said ``You don't understand. I've had Sex since I was
 two years old.''  He replied ``You must have been a strong boy.''
 <BR><BR>
 When I decided to get married I told the minister that I wanted to have Sex at
 the wedding.  He told me to wait until after the wedding.  I said ``But Sex
 has played a big part in my life and my whole lifestyle revolves around Sex.''
 He said he did not want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us
 in a church.  I told him everyone coming to the wedding would enjoy having Sex
 there.  The next day we were married by the Justice of the Peace.  My family
 is barred from the church.

 My wife and I took the dog along with us on the honeymoon.  When I checked
 into the motel I told the clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and myself
 and a special room for Sex.  The clerk said that every room in the Motel is
 for Sex.  Then I said ``You don't understand. Sex keeps me awake at night''
 and the clerk said ``Me too.''
 <BR><BR>
 One day I told my friend that I had Sex on TV.  He said ``Show off.''
 I told him it was a contest and he told me I should have sold tickets.
 <BR><BR>
 When my wife and I separated we went to court to fight for custody of the dog.
 I said ``Your Honour, I had Sex before I was married'' and the Judge said ``Me
 too.''  When I told him that after I was married Sex had left me, he said ``Me
 too.''
 <BR><BR>
 Well now I've been thrown in jail, been married, divorced and had more trouble
 with that dog than I ever gambled for.  Why just the other day when I went for
 my first visit with the psychiatrist and she asked me ``What seems to be the
 trouble'' and I replied, ``Well, Sex has died and left my life. It's like
 losing a best friend and it's so lonely.'' The doctor said ``Look Mister, you
 and I both know that sex isn't man's best friend. Why not get yourself a
 dog.''
