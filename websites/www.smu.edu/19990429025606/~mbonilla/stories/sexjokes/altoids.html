So is this a potential new sex toy or is just an ingenious new marketing
ploy? You be the judge......
<P>
This is absolutely a true story -- forward it around to friends who
might get a kick out of it.
<P>
Had the most interesting conversation with the top sales weasel at our
company today.  She came into my office and noticed I had a box of
Altoids on my desk - Have you had them?  They are these obnoxiously
strong peppermints made in England.  As soon as she saw them, she burst
into laughter.  Turns out she had recently had an affair with a guy who
called her and left her an incredibly steamy voice mail message after an
encounter.  He went on and on about what a blow job goddess she was, how
amazing she was, how he'd never be the same, etc.  
<P>
She was kind of puzzled, thinking: what did I do to this guy that was so
different from my regular technique?  She finally figured it out: she's
a smoker, and before getting intimate with him, she had gone to the
bathroom to "freshen up."  Not having a toothbrush, she crunched on
about four Altoids and then got busy.  Apparently things went
amazingly.  So she passed this little tidbit on to another female sales
weasel, who immediately tried it out on -her- fiance.  Apparently this guy has
never, ever been into oral sex, but liked the mint sensation so much
that he asked her to stop and chew another Altoid mid-blow job.  (This
is where the story loses credibility.  I mean, who ever heard of a guy
NOT being into oral sex?)  He is now a fellatio gourmand.
<P>
This news has been going around our office.  Having a box of Altoids on
your desk is now like being part of the Secret Blowjob Goddess Society. 
It's the equivalent of having the hottest car or coolest computer.  News
spread like crazy among the females, who all went out at lunch to
Walgreens to buy a box of Altoids (about $2 for 100 or so), and their
partners across the city tonight are getting one hell of a corporate
blow job.  (Again, loss of credibility.  Like any woman is so fond of
performing this act that she would actually go do this.)  As far as
company-wide morale boosting events, it doesn't get much better.  Some
of the men found out, too -- they went out after work to buy them for
their wives.  They strategized on how to get their wives to eat them. 
And people wonder why I work in technology.  For what it's worth -- it
really does work!  It leaves a lasting tingle that is apparently quite
exquisite.  (This is email commentary.  I DO NOT know from either first
hand experience or second hand gossip.)
