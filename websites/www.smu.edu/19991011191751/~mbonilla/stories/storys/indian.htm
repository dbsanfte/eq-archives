One day, an Indian boy asks his father, "Daddy, how did my brother
and sister get their names?"  The father said "Ok..." "When your sister 
was conceived, their was a bright white moon in the sky and so we named 
her White Moon." "Your brother was named Running Deer because right after 
he was born I saw a deer running by." The father hesitated and said..."Why 
do you ask Broken-Rubber?" <BR><BR>
