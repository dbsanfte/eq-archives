<CENTER><H3>A Well Turned Phrase...</H3></CENTER>

Two delicate flowers of French womanhood were conversing on the porch swing of a large white-pillared mansion in New Orleans.<BR>
<BR>
The first woman said, "When my first child was born, my husband built this beautiful mansion for me."<BR>
<BR>
The second woman commented, "Well, isn't that nice."<BR>
<BR>
The first woman continued, "When my second child was born, my husband bought me that fine Cadillac automobile you see parked in the drive."<BR>
<BR>
Again, the second woman commented, "Well, isn't that nice."<BR>
<BR>
The first woman boasted, "Then, when my third child was born, my husband bought me this exquisite diamond bracelet."<BR>
<BR>
Yet again, the second woman commented "Well, isn't that nice."<BR>
<BR>
The first woman then asked her companion, "What did your husband buy for you when you had your first child?"<BR>
<BR>
The second woman replied, "My husband sent me to charm school."<BR>
<BR>
"Charm school!" the first woman smiled, "land sakes, child, what on earth for?"<BR>
<BR>
The second woman responded, "So that instead of saying 'Who gives a damn fuck'; I learned to say, 'Well, isn't that nice'."<BR>
