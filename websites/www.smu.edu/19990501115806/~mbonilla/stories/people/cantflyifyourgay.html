An employee of USAir with the last name of Gay boarded a USAir flight with a free travel voucher. Soon after he sat down, someone else came and claimed he had the same seat assignment, so Mr. Gay moved down do an empty seat.<BR>
<BR>
Soon after that the airplane began to fill up. The rule with the USAir employee vouchers is that if a paying customer needs your seat, you have to surrender it. So when the flight became completely full and still more needed to get on, a flight attendant went to the original seat of Mr. Gay and said the the man now sitting there, "Excuse me, are you Gay?"<BR>
<BR>
The man, somewhat stunned, said, "Well, yes, as a matter of fact I am!"<BR>
<BR>
The flight attendent said, "I'm sorry, but you'll have to get off the plane."<BR>
<BR>
At this point Mr. Gay, who had been watching all of this, jumped up and said, "Excuse me, you've made a mistake - I'm Gay!"<BR>
<BR>
Finally, another man jumped up and said, "Well, hell, I'm gay too! They can't throw us all off!"<BR>
