Mr. Perkins, the biology instructor at a posh suburban girl's junior college, said during class, "Miss Smythe, would you please name the organ of the human body , which under the appropriate conditions, expands to six times its normal size, and define the conditions." <BR>
<BR>
Miss Smythe gasped, then said freezingly, "Mr. Perkins, I don't think that is a proper question to ask me. I assure you my parents will hear of this." With that she sat down red-faced. <BR>
<BR>
Unperturbed, Mr. Perkins called on Miss Johnson and asked the same question. <BR>
<BR>
Miss Johnson, with composure, replied, "The pupil of the eye, in dim light." <BR>
<BR>
"Correct," said Mr. Perkins. "And now, Miss Smythe, I have three things to say to you. One, you have not studied your lesson. Two, you have a dirty mind. And three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment."<BR>
