<P>
Jack is one horny guy and is not sure what to do about it.  He reaches into his  pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill. Jack walks down the street to the local  brothel and knocks on the door. The madam opens the door and asks Jack what she can do for him.  "I'm really horny but I only have $5.  What can you do for  me?",  Jack asks the madam.  She looks over this fellow and tells Jack, "Don't worry we can take care of you.  No problem."  She leads Jack into this room where in the opposite corner is a chicken. Jack thinks about this a second and figures it can't be that bad.  He gives the madam the $5 and closes the door behind her.
<P>
With the eagerness of a young teenager he quickly undresses.  Once naked, Jack wastes no time and starts to fuck the chicken.  As soon as Jack develops a  rhythm he starts to enjoy himself a great deal.  He and the chicken really go at  it for a while until all that built up frustration is finally released. Jack can't remember when he has had such a pleasurable experience.
<P>
One week later, and horny again,  Jack has saved up $10.  Being a satisfied customer he goes back to the same madam and asks what she can do for him for $10.
<P>
"Well for $10 we have a special show", the madam replies.  She leads him into a different room where there are several other people sitting on benches. "Sit  back and enjoy the show, Jack", the madam tells Jack.
<P>
Jack gives the money to the madam and takes a seat on one of benches. Soon after, the lights dim and the blinds open revealing another room on the other side of a two way mirror where two women begin to undress each other.  Jack is very impressed. Clearly these women are unaware anyone is watching as they begin to make love to each other passionately. Apparently there is nothing  they won't do to each other. Jack once again feels like he is getting his money's worth.  He turns to the  person beside him and says, "this is a pretty good show for ten bucks, eh?!"   The guy turns to Jack and says, "That's nothing.....last week we saw a guy fuck a chicken."
