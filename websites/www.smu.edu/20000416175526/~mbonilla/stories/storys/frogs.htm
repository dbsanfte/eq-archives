Once upon a time three frogs who all lived in the same pond all died at the same time.  The first frog approached St. Peter at the gates of Froggy heaven and said,<BR>
"I want in." <BR>
St. Peter said, "What's your name?"<BR>
The first frog said "My name is Frog."<BR>
St. Peter said, "Well, Frog, what did you do with your life?"<BR>
The first frog said, "Oh, I sat around on a lily pad and blew bubbles all day."<BR>
St. Peter said, "I guess that's OK, you can come in."<BR>
Then the next frog approached St. Peter and said, "I want in."<BR>
St. Peter said, "And what's your name?"<BR>
The second frog said, "Frog Frog."<BR>
St. Peter said, "OK Frog Frog, what did you do with your life?"<BR>
And the second frog said, "I just sat around and blew bubbles all day."<BR>
St. Peter said " Ok, you can come in too"<BR>
Next, the third frog approached St. Peter and said, "I want in too."<BR>
St. Peter said, "Let me guess, is your name Frog Frog Frog?"<BR>
And the third frog said, "Oh no, my name is Bubbles."
