<h2>A Question Of Time</h2>

I've got to get to you first<BR>
Before they do<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
Before they lay their hands on you<BR>
And make you just like the rest<BR>
I've got to get to you first<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
<BR>
Well now you're only fifteen<BR>
And you look good<BR>
I'll take you under my wing<BR>
Somebody should<BR>
They've persuasive ways<BR>
And you'll believe what they say<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
It's running out for you<BR>
It won't be long until you'll do<BR>
Exactly what they want you to<BR>
<BR>
I can see them now<BR>
Hanging around<BR>
To mess you up<BR>
To strip you down<BR>
And have their fun<BR>
With my little one<BR>
<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
It's running out for you<BR>
It won't be long until you'll do<BR>
Exactly what they want you to<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I don't blame them<BR>
For wanting you<BR>
You look good<BR>
And they need something to do<BR>
Until I look at you<BR>
And then I condemn them<BR>
I know my kind<BR>
What goes on in our minds<BR>
<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
It should be better<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
It should be better with you<BR>
It's just a question of time<BR>
<P>
