Welcome to the LoveMaker! (v3.1 Erosoft Industries, (c) 1993)<BR>
<BR>
At the prompt, please enter your response.<BR>
<BR>
I am the LOVEMAKER.  A personalized, interactive poetry assistance program.  What is your name?<BR>
<BR>
>JOHN<BR>
<BR>
What a nice name, JOHN.  You must be a man.<BR>
<BR>
>YES<BR>
<BR>
How nice for you.  Who is your poem for, JOHN?<BR>
<BR>
>SHEILA<BR>
<BR>
How nice for SHEILA.  She must be a woman?<BR>
<BR>
>YES<BR>
<BR>
SHEILA must be very special to you, JOHN.  Is she?<BR>
<BR>
>YES<BR>
<BR>
What is the occasion, JOHN?<BR>
<BR>
>VALENTINE'S DAY<BR>
<BR>
SHEILA is a very lucky woman.  I will need information about SHEILA for a poem that best reflects your deep feelings for her, JOHN.  What color are her eyes?<BR>
<BR>
>BLUE<BR>
<BR>
Thank you, JOHN.  But could you be more specific?  Are they blue like the sky after a clearing storm?  Are they the icy blue of the far flung fjords, shrouded in mist and mystery? Are they the steely blue of Walter Gropius's later Bauhaus sketchbooks?  Are they a cornflower blue that speaks of Sunday picnics in simpler times?<BR>
<BR>
>THEY LOOK KIND OF GRAY WHEN SHE'S ANGRY<BR>
<BR>
Thank you, JOHN.  What about SHEILA'S hair?<BR>
<BR>
>BLOND<BR>
<BR>
Thank you, JOHN.  But could you be more specific?  Is it ash blond with some auburn like the silky tresses of Rapunzel? When the sun hits it in a certain way in the late afternoon does it look like spun gold?  Is it the hard, cheap blond of the streetwise trollop or the dazzling, brilliant satin of Renaissance cherubim?<BR>
<BR>
>I THINK SHE DYES IT<BR>
<BR>
Thank you, JOHN.  Are there any other characteristics we should mention in our poem to SHEILA?<BR>
<BR>
><BR>
><BR>
><BR>
<BR>
JOHN, are you still there?<BR>
<BR>
>SKIN?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you, JOHN.  But could you be more specific?  Is it fine and alabaster and tightly grained like antique porcelain, slow-fired by master craftsmen? Or is it pink and lustrous like the hand-burnished silver one's Grandmother might be found polishing with gentle, loving strokes on a rainy Sunday afternoon?<BR>
<BR>
>SHE TANS TWICE A WEEK<BR>
<BR>
SHEILA must be very special to you, JOHN.  You must have deep feelings for SHEILA to write her a special VALENTINE'S DAY poem. <BR>
<BR>
>YES<BR>
<BR>
How nice for you, JOHN.  What kind of poem do you think SHEILA would like?<BR>

JOHN?<BR>
<BR>
>I'M THINKING<BR>
<BR>
May I make a suggestion, JOHN?<BR>
<BR>
>SURE<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps you imagine yourself a hopeless romantic, JOHN.  A man who lives and loves with passion and desire and appetite.  A man who grabs great platters from the groaning board of this world and eats his fill.  A man who takes what he wants the moment he sees it and makes it his own.  A man who kneads fate in his strong hands, shapes it and commands it.  A man with a reckless bent and the courage of fire.  A man who sees beauty in a raindrop and all the truth of the universe in the eyes of a child. A man with needs and wants aflame within him.  A man of power and means of influence, JOHN.  A man destined to be the envy of other men.  A man that few can ever understand and fewer still will have the guts to love. A man of whom it might be said...<BR>
<BR>
Would that Alexander in his age had but half the measure of his strong stout heart or clear hawk's eyes undimmed and true, pooled with azure purpose.  No earthbound mortal he, but master o'er each and all...<BR>
<BR>
Would this describe your self-image accurately, JOHN?<BR>
<BR>
>YES<BR>
<BR>
I thought so.  I'll use my random SEARCH MODE (Alt+S) to choose an appropriate style for you, JOHN.  One that truly expresses your deep feelings for SHEILA on VALENTINE'S DAY.<BR>
<BR>

        Dear SHEILA,<BR>
