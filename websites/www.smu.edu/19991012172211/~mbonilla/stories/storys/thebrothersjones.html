There were identical twin brothers by the name of Jones. John was married and Joe was single, but owned a small, delapidated boat.<BR>
<BR>
It happened that the same day John's wife died, Joe's boat sank. A kind old lady met Joe on the street and, mistaking him for his brother John, said, "Oh, Mr. Jones, I'm sorry to hear of your great loss. You must feel terrible." Joe said, "Well, I'm not a bit sorry. She was rotten from the start.  Her bottom was all chewed up and she smelled of old fish from the first time I got on her. She made water faster than anything I've ever seen. She had a bad hole in the front and a big crack in the back. The hole kept getting bigger everytime I used her. It got so I couldn't handle her at all."<BR>
<BR>
"When anyone else used her, she leaked all over the place. What finished her though, was four guys from the other side of town came over looking for a good time. They asked if they could use her. I rented her to them, but warned them that she wasn't too hot. They still insisted that they would like to give her a try. The result was that the crazy fools all tried to get into her at once.  Well, the strain was too much for her and she cracked right down the middle." <BR>
<BR>
The old lady fainted.<BR>
