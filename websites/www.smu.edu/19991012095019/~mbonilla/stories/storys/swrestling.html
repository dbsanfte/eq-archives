Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event.
 It is narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal.
  <P>  
 Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him
 and said, "Now don't forget all the research we've done on this
 Russian. He's never lost a match because of this "pretzel" hold he
 has.  Whatever you do, don't let him get you in this hold!  If he
 does, you're finished!"  The wrestler nodded in agreement.
    <P>
 Now, to the match:  The American and the Russian circled each other
 several times looking for an opening.  All of a sudden the Russian
 lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him up in the
 dreaded pretzel hold!
    <P>
 A sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd, and the trainer
 buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost. He couldn't
 watch the ending. Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd,
 and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the Russian flying
 up in the air.  The Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the
 American weakly collapsed on top of him, getting the pin and winning
 the match.
    <P>
 The trainer was astounded!  When he finally got the American wrestler
 alone, he asks, "How did you ever get out of that hold?  No one has
 ever done it before!"
    <P>
 The wrestler answered, "Well, I was ready to give up when he got me
 in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this
 pair of balls right in front of my face.  I thought I had nothing to
 lose, so with my last ounce of strength I stretched out my neck and
 bit those babies just as hard as I could.
    <P>
 "So!" the trainer exclaimed, "that finished him off did it?"
    <P>
 "No, but you'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own
 balls!"
<P>
