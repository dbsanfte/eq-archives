The gentleman had a serious problem.  He had made several attempts to get into the men's restroom, but it was always occupied.<BR><BR>
The stewardess noticed that he was taking short steps and had a look of pain on his face.<BR><BR>
"Sir", she said, "You may use the ladies' room if you promise not to touch any of the buttons on the wall."  He would have promised anything and said so.<BR><BR>
The relief was pure joy, and as he sat there savoring the feeling,  he noticed the buttons he had promised not to touch. Each button was identified by letters: WW, WA, PP, and a red one labeled ATR.  Who would know if he touched them?  He couldn't resist. He pushed  WW.<BR> 
<BR><BR>
Warm water was sprayed gently upon his bottom.  What a nice feeling.  Men's restrooms don't have things like this. Anticipating greater pleasure, he pushed the WA button. Warm air replaced the warm water,  gently drying his underside. When this stopped, he pushed the PP button.<BR>
<BR><BR>
 A large powder puff caressed his bottom adding a fragile scent of spring flowers to this unbelievable pleasure. The Ladies' restroom is more than a restroom. It is a place of tender loving pleasure. When the powder puff completed its pleasure, he could hardly wait to push the ATR button, which he knew would bring him supreme ecstasy...<BR>
<BR><BR>
 He knew he was in a hospital as soon as he opened his eyes. A nurse was staring down at him with a "smirk" on her face. "What happened?",he exclaimed.<BR><BR>
"You pushed one too many buttons", replied the nurse. "The last button marked ATR was an Automatic Tampon Remover. Your penis is under your pillow!"<BR>
