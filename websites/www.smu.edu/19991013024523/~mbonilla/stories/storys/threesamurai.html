Back in the time of the Samurai there was a powerful emperor who needed a new head Samurai so he sent out a declaration throughout the country that he was searching for one.  A year passed and only 3 people showed up: a Japanese Samurai, a Chinese Samurai and a Jewish Samurai.<BR>
<BR>
The emperor asked the Japanese Samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be head Samurai.<BR>
<BR>
The Japanese Samurai opened a match box and out pops a little fly.  Whoosh goes his sword and the fly drops dead on the ground in 2 pieces.<BR>
<BR>
The emperor exclaimed: "That is very impressive!"<BR>
<BR>
The emperor then asked the Chinese Samurai to come in and demonstrate.<BR>
<BR>
The Chinese Samurai also opened a match box and out pops a fly.  Whoosh whoosh goes his sword.  The fly drops dead on the ground in 4 pieces.<BR>
<BR>
The emperor exclaimed: "That is really very impressive!"<BR>
<BR>
The emperor then had the Jewish Samurai demonstrate why he should be the head Samurai.<BR>
<BR>
The Jewish Samurai also opened a match box and out pops a fly.  His flashing sword goes whoooooooossshhh whoooooooossshhh whoooooooossshhh whoooooooossshhh whoooooooossshhh.  A gust of wind fills the room, but the fly is still alive and buzzing around.<BR>
<BR>
The emperor, obviously disappointed, asks:  "After all of that, why is the fly not dead?"<BR>
<BR>
The Jewish Samurai smiled, "If you look closely, you'll see that the fly has been circumcised!<BR>
