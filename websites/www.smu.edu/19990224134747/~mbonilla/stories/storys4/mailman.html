Joe the mailman has been delivering mail for over 20 yrs to the same 
neighborhood - pretty boring except for today.
<P>
Today, Christmas eve, Joe finds Mrs Jones waiting for him at the door 
- she invites him in and offeres to cook him breakfast - Joe, 
confused, agrees and enjoys a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon etc.
<P>
Immediately following breakfast Mrs Jones invites Joe upstairs by 
explaining she has something to show him.  
<P>
Joe follows Mrs Jones upstairs and indulges in the GREATEST sex of 
his life.  As Joe is getting ready to leave, Mrs Jones hands him $5.00
 <P>
By this point, Joe is compeltely puzzled and just has to ask why?
<P>
Mrs Jones explains:
<P>
I was talking to my husband last night about what to give you for 
christmas, My husband said "fuck him, give him $5.00"  Breakfast was 
my idea.
<P>
