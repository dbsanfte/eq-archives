Recently a guy in Paris nearly got away with stealing several paintings from the Louvre. However, after planning the crime,  getting in and out past security, he was captured only 2 blocks away  when his Econoline ran out of gas. <BR>
<BR>
When asked how he could mastermind such a crime and then make such an obvious error, he replied:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(brace yourself)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(this is going to hurt.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(really bad.)<BR>
