Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is 
why several of us died of tuberculosis.
<P>
Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word 
itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - 
"mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and 
that's why so is mankind.
<P>
I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they 
don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with 
some good ideas.
<P>
It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at that 
man.
<P>
I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned 
him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, "I 
helped skin Bob."
<P>
I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash 
is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash 
stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and 
go, "What was THAT?!"
<P>
The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the 
face.
<P>
Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can 
bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little 
tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be 
like ambition.
<P>
I'd rather be rich than stupid.
<P>
If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of 
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't 
think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me."
<P>
If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, 
screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, 
I guess I'm a coward.
<P>
I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every 
culture, is the story of Popeye.
<P>
When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if 
they ever press charges.
<P>
To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no 
choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
<P>
What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to 
save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.
<P>
We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at 
them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.
<P>
Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of 
striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
<P>
I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon 
was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, 
pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality.
<P>
To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've 
wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I 
went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.
<P>
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been 
painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can 
make a child look like a deer.
<P>
If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them 
down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.
<P>
Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his 
head out when you're coming home his face might burn up.
<P>
You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown who 
make people happy, but inside he's real sad. Also, he has severe 
diarrhea.
<P>
If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then 
gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away.
<P>
If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to 
keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we 
build to that.
<P>
If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe 
you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, 
hey, free dummy.
<P>
Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someones 
neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, 
because what is that thing.
<P>
He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he 
made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she 
disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to 
dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, 
he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun."
<P>
The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to 
me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was 
- and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there 
were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as 
we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we 
called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went 
home. I guess some things never leave you.
<P>
If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him 
is "God is crying." And if he asks why God is crying, another cute 
thing to tell him is "Probably because of something you did."
<P>
Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the 
world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a shark 
riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything 
they see.
<P>
As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks." Marta 
said it should read "Watch for Pretty Rocks." I told her she should 
write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started 
saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple letter! And 
I thought I was lazy!
<P>
One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to 
take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old 
burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said, "DisneyLand burned down." He 
cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty 
good joke. I started to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was 
getting pretty late.
<P>
If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you 
think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be 
wrong, though. It's Hambone.
<P>
I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to 
town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad.
<P>
As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, 
I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he 
was, and how I named him Flint.
<P>
If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's 
real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you.
<P>
Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first 
instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what is I was an ant, and she 
fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.
<P>
If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you 
friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to 
pretend you were swimming.
<P>
When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school 
we'd all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat 
one of us. It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman 
was a bear.
<P>
