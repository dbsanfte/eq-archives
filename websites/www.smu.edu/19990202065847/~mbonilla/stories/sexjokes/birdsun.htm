<P>
 A man was sunbathing nude on a beach and reading a newspaper.  He saw a
little girl walking towards him and immediately covered himself with
the paper.  
<P>
The girl came up and said,   "Hey mister, whatcha got under the paper?"  To
which he replied, "Nothing kid, it's just my pet bird. Now go away."
<P>
Being curious, the girl then asked, "Can I please see your bird, mister?"
"NO", snapped the man.  Once again, she asked, "Please can't I just pet
your bird?  The man replied angrily, "NO, GO THE HELL AWAY!!!"
The little girl walked away and the man fell asleep.
<P>
Well, the next thing the man knows, he's waking up in a hospital bed
and there's a doctor standing over him, laughing.
<P>
The man demands to know where he is and why and the doctor calls the
little girl who witnessed the whole incident to come in and explain what
had happened.
<P>
Tearfully, the girl walks in and sits next to the man.  The man says,
"Hey, you're the little brat from the beach.  What's going on here?"  To
which the little girl replied, "I'm sorry mister.  I know you told me not
to look at or touch your bird, but after you fell asleep I did anyway."
<P>
"So, that doesn't explain why I'm here," replied the man who was
getting angrier by the minute.
<P>
"Well," the girl continued, "while I was petting it, it spit at me, so I
broke its neck, crushed its eggs, and set its nest on fire."
