AUGUSTA, ME - Four people were injured in a string of  bizarre 
accidents. Sherry Moeller was admitted with a head wound caused 
by flying masonry, Tim Vegas was diagnosed with a mild case of 
whiplash and contusions on his chest, arms and face, Bryan 
Corcoran suffered torn gum tissue, and Pamela Klesick's first 
two fingers of her right hand had been bitten off.
<P>
Moeller had just dropped her husband off for his first day of work
and, in addition to a good-bye kiss, she flashed her breasts at him
"I'm still not sure why I did it," she said later. "I was really close
to the car, so I didn't think anyone would see. Besides, it couldn't
have been for more than two seconds." However, cab driver Vegas did
see and lost control of his cab, running over the curb and into the
corner of the Johnson Medical Building. Inside, Klesick, a dental
technician, was cleaning Corcoran's teeth. The crash of the cab
against the building making her jump, tearing Corcoran's gums with a
cleaning pick.  In shock, he bit down, severing two fingers from
Klesick's hand.  Moeller's wound was caused by a falling piece of the
medical building.

TAOS, NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating three
birth-control vaginal inserts. Her English was so bad she had to draw
a picture describing how she believed she had poisoned herself.  A
translator arrived shortly thereafter and confirmed doctors'
suspicions.  Marie Valishnokov thought the inserts were some kind of
candy or gum, being unable to read the foil wrappers.  After the third
one, she realized something was wrong when her throat and mouth began
to fill with a sour-tasting foam.  She ran for the Poison Control
Center, only a few blocks away where doctors were able to flush the
foam from her mouth, throat and stomach with no ill effects.
<P>
La Grange, GA - Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma
center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum. "My dog
drags the thing all over the house," he said later.  "He must have
dragged it into the shower. I slipped on the tile, tripped against the
dog and sat down right on the thing."  The extraction took more than
three hours due to the fact that the cover to Mr. Mendoza's phone had
opened during insertion.  "He was a real trooper during the entire
episode," said Dr. Dennis Crobe.  "Tony just cracked jokes and really
seemed to be enjoying himself.  Three times during the extraction his
phone rang and each time, he made jokes about it that just had us
rolling on the floor.   By the time we finished, we really did expect
to find an answering machine in there"

TACOMA, WA - Kerry Bingham, had been drinking with several friends
when one of them said they knew a person who had bungee-jumped from
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the middle of traffic.  The conversation
grew more heated and at least 10 men trooped along the walkway of the
bridge at 4:30 a.m.  Upon arrival at the midpoint of the bridge they
discovered that no one had brought bungee rope.  Bingham, who had
continued drinking, volunteered and pointed out that a coil of
lineman's cable lay nearby.  One end of the cable was secured around
Bingham's leg and the other end was tied to the bridge.  His fall
lasted 40 feet before the cable tightened and tore his foot off at the
ankle. He miraculously survived his fall into  the icy river waterand
was rescued by two nearby fishermen.  "All I can say," said Bingham,
"is that God was watching out for me on that night.  There's just no
other explanation for it."  Bingham's foot was never located.
<P>
BREMERTON, WA - Christopher Coulter and his wife, Emily, were 
engaging in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut
butter on his genitals and letting Rudy, their Irish Setter, lick them
clean. Sadly, Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christopher's
penis and testicles. Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked
Emily threw a half-gallon bottle of perfume at the dog. The bottle
broke, covering the dog and Christopher with perfume. Startled, Rudy
leaped back, tearing away the penis.  While trying to get her
unconscious husband in the car to take him to the hospital, Emily fell
twice, injuring her wrist and ankle.  Christopher's penis was in a
styrofoam ice cooler. "Chris is just plain lucky," said the surgeon
who spent eight hours reattaching the penis.  "Believe it or not, the
perfume turned out to be very fortuitous.  The high alcohol content,
which must have been excruciatingly painful, helped sterilize the
wound.  Also, aside from its being removed, the damage caused by the
dog's teeth to the penis per se is minimal.  It's really a very
stringy piece of flesh.  Mr. Coulter stands an excellent chance of
regaining the use of his limb because of this."  Washington Animal
Control has no plans to seize Rudy.
