No, Windows is not a virus. <BR>
<BR>
Here's what viruses do: <BR>
<BR>
They replicate quickly - okay, Windows does that.<BR>
<BR>
Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so - okay, Windows does that.<BR>
<BR>
Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk - okay, Windows does that too.<BR>
<BR>
Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. Sigh... Windows does that, too.<BR>
<BR>
Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, that's with Windows, too.<BR>
<BR>
Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.<BR>
<BR>
So Windows is not a virus.<BR>
<BR>
It's a bug.<BR>
