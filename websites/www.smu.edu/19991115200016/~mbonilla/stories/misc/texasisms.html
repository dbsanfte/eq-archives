She could talk the legs off a chair.<BR>
<BR>
He's all hat and no horse.<BR>
<BR>
So dry the catfish are carrying canteens.<BR>
<BR>
He's so busy, you'd think he was twins.<BR>
<BR>
It's so dry, the trees are bribing the dogs.<BR>
<BR>
Cold as a cast iron commode.<BR>
<BR>
She's two sandwiches short of a picnic.<BR>
<BR>
Ugly? Why she's so ugly that she needs to sneak up on a glass of water else the glass breaks.<BR>
<BR>
Confused as a goat on astro-turf.<BR>
<BR>
Handy as hip pockets on a hog.<BR>
<BR>
So ugly that his mama takes him everywhere she goes so she doesn't have to kiss him goodbye.<BR>
<BR>
Looks like he sorts bobcats for a living.<BR>
<BR>
So buck-toothed that he could eat corn-on-the-cob through a picket fence.<BR>
<BR>
If brains were leather, he couldn't saddle a fly.<BR>
