I was walking down the beach and found a bottle.  One that looked like [I Dream of Jeanie] bottle.  I shook it and heard a sound. Wondering, I then opened the bottle.<BR>
<BR>
A Genie appeared and thanked me for letting him out.  The Genie then said "I am so grateful for getting out of that bottle that I will grant you one Wish."<BR>
<BR>
"One?" I said.  "I thought it was supposed to be three."<BR>
<BR>
"Sorry, it's only one - New Genie Union Labor Agreement - new this year," the genie stated.<BR>
<BR>
"Ok, ok."<BR>
<BR>
I thought for a while and finally said, "I have always wanted to travel to Hawaii but I have never gone because I  afraid to fly, and last year I tried to get on a boat but I freaked out, the doctors said I had claustrophobia.  So I wish for a road from here to Hawaii"<BR>
<BR>
The genie scratched his head and finally said "No, I don't think I can do that.  Just think of all the piling needed to hold up a highway and how deep they would have to go to reach the bottom of the ocean.  Imagine all the steel, concrete dirt and cables needed. No, that's just to much to ask."<BR>
<BR>
 thought some more and came up with the perfect wish.  "I wish to be transformed into a girl for one year so that I would be able to understand women.  You know, what makes them laugh and cry, why they are so temperamental, why they are so difficult to get along with, when they want attention, when they don't.  Basically, what makes them tick."<BR>
<BR>
The Genie considered for a few minutes and said, "So, do you want two lanes or four??"<BR>
