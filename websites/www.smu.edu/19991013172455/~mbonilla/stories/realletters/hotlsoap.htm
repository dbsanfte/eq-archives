Attached is some correspondence which actually occurred between a London
hotel's staff and one of its guests.  The London hotel involved submitted this to the
Sunday Times.  No name was mentioned.

Dear Maid,<BR><BR>
Please do not leave any more of those little bars of soap in my
bathroom since I have brought my own bath-sized Dial.  Please remove
the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest
and another three in the shower soap dish.  They are in my way.<BR><BR>
                                         Thank you,<BR>
                                          S. Berman<BR>

Dear Room 635,<BR><BR>
I am not your regular maid.  She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off.  I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested.  The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind.  This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the management is to leave 3 soaps daily. I hope this is satisfactory.<BR><BR>

Dear Maid -- I hope you are my regular maid.<BR><BR>
Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the
little bars of soap.  When I got back to my room this evening I found
you had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet.
I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my
own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on
 the shelf.  They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc.
 Please remove them.<BR><BR>
                                            S. Berman<BR>

Dear Mr. Berman,<BR><BR>
My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which
we are instructed by the management.  I took the 6 soaps which were
in your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your
Dial was.  I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your
convenience. I didn't remove the 3 complimentary soaps which are
always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and
which you did not object to when you checked in last Monday. Please,
let me know if I can of further assistance.<BR><BR>
                                            Your regular maid,<BR><BR>

Dear Mr. Berman,<BR><BR>
The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this A.M. that you
called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid
service.  I have assigned a new girl to your room.  I hope you will
accept my apologies for any past inconvenience.  If you have any
future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal
attention. Call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you.<BR>

Dear Miss Carmen,<BR><BR>
It is impossible to contact you by phone since I leave the hotel for
business at 745 AM and don't get back before 530 or 6PM.  That's the
reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night.  You were already off duty.
I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little
bars of soap.  The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a
new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my
medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the
bath-room shelf.  In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little
bars of soap.  Why are you doing this to me?<BR><BR>

Dear Mr. Berman,<BR><BR>
Your maid, Kathy, has been instructed to stop delivering soap to your
room and remove the extra soaps.  If I can be of further assistance,
please call extension 1108 between 8AM and 5PM.  Thank you,<BR>
                                            Elaine Carmen,<BR>

Dear Mr. Kensedder,<BR><BR>
My bath-size Dial is missing.  Every bar of soap was taken from my
room including my own bath-size Dial.  I came in late last night and
had to call the bellhop to bring me 4 little Cashmere Bouquets.<BR><BR>
                                            S. Berman<BR>

Dear Mr. Berman,<BR><BR>
I have informed our housekeeper, Elaine Carmen, of your soap problem.
I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our
maids are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a
room. The situation will be rectified immediately.  Please accept my
apologies for the inconvenience.<BR><BR>

Dear Mrs. Carmen,<BR><BR>
Who the hell left 54 little bars of Camay in my room?  I came in last
night and found 54 little bars of soap.  I don't want 54 little bars
of Camay.  I want my one damn bar of bath-size Dial.  Do you realize
I have 54 bars of soap in here.  All I want is my bath-size Dial.
Please give me back my bath-size Dial.<BR><BR>
                                            S. Berman<BR>

Dear Mr. Berman,<BR><BR>
You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed.
Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing
so I personally returned them.  The 24 Camays which had been taken
and the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily (sic).  I don't
know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets.  Obviously your maid,
Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24
Camays plus the 3 daily Camays.  I don't know where you got the idea
this hotel issues bath-size Dial.  I was able to locate some
bath-size Ivory which I left in your room.<BR><BR>

Dear Mrs. Carmen,<BR><BR>
Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap
inventory.<BR><BR>

As of today I possess:<BR>
   - On shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of
     4 and 1 stack of 2.<BR>
   - On Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1
     stack of 3.<BR>
   - On bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, 1
     stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4.<BR>
   - Inside medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1
     stack of 2.<BR>
   - In shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist.<BR>
   - On northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used.<BR>
   - On northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3.<BR><BR>

Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks
are neatly piled and dusted.  Also, please advise her that stacks of
more than 4 have a tendency to tip.  May I suggest that my bedroom
window sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future
soap deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of
bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to
avoid further misunderstandings.<BR><BR>
