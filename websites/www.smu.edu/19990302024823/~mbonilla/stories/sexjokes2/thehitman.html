There are these friends who play golf together every Saturday.  Well, one 
Saturday they were getting ready to tee off when a guy, by himself, asked them 
if he could join them. The friends looked at each other and then looked at the 
man and said "sure."
<P>
So they teed off.  About two holes into the game, the friends got  curious of 
what the lone man did for a living.  So they asked him.  The stranger told them 
that he was a hitman.  The friends kind of laughed.  The man said "no really, I 
am a hitman.  My gun is in my golf bag.  I carry it everywhere I go.  You can 
take a look if you like."  
So one of the guys decided he would.  He opened up the bag and sure enough, 
there was this rifle with a huge scope on it.  He got all excited about it.
He said "WOW!  I bet I can see my house through here!  May I look?"  The 
stranger said "sure."
<P>
So the man looked for a second and said "YEAH!  You can!   I can even  see
through my windows into my bedroom.  There's my wife, naked.  Isn't  she
beautiful?  WAIT!  There's my next door neighbor!  He's naked too!"  This
upset the man, so he asked the hitman how much it would be for a hit.  The
hit man replied "It's $1000 every time I pull the trigger."  The man  said
"$1000, ouch!   Well, ok.  I want two hits.  I want you  to shoot my  wife
right in the mouth.  She is always nagging at me and I can't stand it. Second, I want you to shoot my neighbor right in  the dick, just for  screwing 
around with my wife." The hit man agrees so he gears up and looks through the scope.  
He's looking for about 5 minutes.  Well, the man starts to get  impatient  and
asks the hitman what he is waiting for. The hitman replies "Just hold  on
now...  I'm about to save you a thousand bucks ."
<P>
