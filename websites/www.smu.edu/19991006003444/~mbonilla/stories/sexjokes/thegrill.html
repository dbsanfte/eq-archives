A husband and wife were in their back yard, and he was noticing her expanding backside. He commented, "Boy, your ass is getting big...almost as big as the gas grill here."<BR>
<BR>
She angrily stomped across the yard, and he followed, saying, "Yep, that thing is huge."<BR>
<BR>
At this the wife retreated to the far side of the yard. Soon, he approached with a tape measure, acquired the width and exclaimed, "It IS as big as the gas grill!"<BR>
<BR>
Later that night when they were in bed, the husband started making moves on his wife. She just turned away. "C'mon honey", he said, "What's wrong?"<BR>
<BR>
Her cold reply was, "I'm not firing up the grill for ONE LITTLE WEINER!"<BR>
