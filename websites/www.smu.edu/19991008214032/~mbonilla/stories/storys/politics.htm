Son: Dad, I have a special report for school.  Can I ask you a question?
<P>
Dad: Sure son, what's the question?
<P>
Son: What is politics?
<P>
Dad: Well son, let's take our home for example.  I am the wage earner,
so let's call me the management.  Your mother is the administrator of
the money, so let's call her the government.  We take care of you and
your needs, so let's call you the people.  We'll call the maid the
working class and your baby brother the future.  Understand?
<P>
Son: I'm not really sure dad, I'll have to think about it.
<P>
That night, the boy is awakened by his baby brother's crying, so he
went to see what was wrong.  Discovering that the baby had a heavily
soiled nappy, the boy went to his parent's room and found his mother
fast asleep.  He than went to the maid's room, where, peeking through
the keyhole, he saw his father in bed with the maid.  The boy's
knocking went totally unheard.  The boy went back to his room and went
to sleep.
<P>
The next morning...
<P>
Son: Dad, I think I understand politics.
<P>
Dad: That's great son, explain it to me in your own words.
<P>
Son: While the management is screwing the working class, the
government is fast asleep, the people are being completely ignored and
the future is full of shit.
<P>
