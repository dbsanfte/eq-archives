A very modest lady applied for a job at the factory where they made "Tickle me Elmo dolls".  It was Friday and almost quitting time and hurriedly the boss told her to report for work on Monday.<BR>
<BR>
He quickly explained to her she would be stationed on the assembly line just before the dolls were packed into boxes.<BR>
<BR>
On Monday they started up the line and within twenty minutes had to shut it down because one worker couldn't keep up.<BR>
<BR>
The boss went down the line to find the problem.  The new employee was very busy trying to do her part but she had a bunch of dolls waiting for her.<BR>
<BR>
Closer examination showed she was sewing little cloth bags containing two walnuts in the appropriate place on the dolls.<BR>
<BR>
The boss could not control his laughter and said, "Lady, I said to give each doll Two----Test----Tickles."<BR>
