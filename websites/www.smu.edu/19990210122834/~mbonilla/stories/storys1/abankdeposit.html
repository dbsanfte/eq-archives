This guy walks into a bank and says to the teller at the window, "I want to open a fuckin' checking account"
<P>
To which the lady replied, "I beg your pardon, what did you say?"
<P>
"Listen up dammit, I said I want to open a fuckin' checking account right now."
<P>
"Sir, I'm sorry but we do not tolerate that kind of language in this bank!"
<P>
The teller left the window and went over to the bank manager and told him about her situation. They both returned and the manager asked, "What seems to be the problem here?"
<P>
"There's no damn problem,"  the man said, "I just won 50 million in the lottery and I want to open a fuckin' checking account in this damn bank!"
<P>
"I see sir," the manager said, "and this bitch is giving you a hard time?"
<P>
