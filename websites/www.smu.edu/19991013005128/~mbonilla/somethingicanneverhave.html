i still recall the taste of my tears.<BR>
echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.<BR>
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.<BR>
scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep anymore.<BR>
<BR>
come on tell me.<BR>
make this all go away.<BR>
you make this all go away.<BR>
i'm down to just one thing.<BR>
and i'm starting to scare myself.<BR>
make this all go away.<BR>
you make this all go way.<BR>
<BR>
i just want something.<BR>
i just want something i can never have<BR>
<BR>
you always were the one to show me how<BR>
back then i couldn't do the things that i can do now.<BR>
this is slowly take me apart.<BR>
grey would be the color if i had a heart.<BR>
i just want something i can never have.<BR>
in this place it seems like such a same.<BR>
though it all looks different now,<BR>
i know it's still the same<BR>
everywhere i look you're all i see.<BR>
just a fading f**king reminder of who i used to be.<BR>
<BR>
come on tell me.<BR>
make this all go away.<BR>
you make this all go away.<BR>
i'm down to just one thing.<BR>
and i'm starting to scare myself.<BR>
make this all go away.<BR>
you make this all go way.<BR>
<BR>
i just want something.<BR>
i just want something i can never have<BR>
i just want something i can never have<BR>
think i know what you meant.<BR>
that night on my bed.<BR>
still picking at this scab<BR>
i wish you were dead.<BR>
you sweet and perry ellis.<BR>
just stains on my sheets.<BR>
