<BR>
3) Priests would get married... wait a minute... never mind<BR>
<BR>
4) The Gospels would be Matthew, Mark, Luke and Bruce<BR>
<BR>
5) Mary's hair would be FLAWLESS<BR>
<BR>
6) The Temple would not have been cleansed of money changers, just re-decorated<BR>
<BR>
7) The water at the Wedding Feast of Cana would have turned into dry martinis with just a splash of Curacao for color<BR>
<BR>
8) The Triumphal Entry just screams for a drag number<BR>
<BR>
9) Replace the 'Beatitudes' with "Fabulous are they..."<BR>
