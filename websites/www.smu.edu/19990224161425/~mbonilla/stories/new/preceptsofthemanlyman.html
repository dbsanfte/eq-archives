1.) The floor is considered an acceptable clothing storage location.<BR>
<BR>
2.) Never ask me to purchase feminine products. Assume that I will come home with the wrong thing.<BR>
<BR>
3.) When watching TV hugging is always fine because I can still see the screen. Kissing should only be done during timeouts and commercials. Questions should also be limited to this period as you stand a much better chance of getting an immediate response.<BR>
<BR>
4.) When we are watching your show and I change the channels during a commercial do not hassle me that they are over to change the channel back. I always know when the timing is right. Also, when we are channel surfing do not ask me to go back, there was a good reason why I skipped it.<BR>
<BR>
5.) If you need help with the laundry, I am more than willing to carry it from the bedroom to the washer. In my mind this is half the chore and I am now free to return to the couch.<BR>
<BR>
6.) If I mention that a male friend of mine is allowed to do something it is not necessary for you to call his wife/girlfriend to discuss it.<BR>
<BR>
7.) If you don't like the way I am driving close your eyes. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from making that reverse inhaling alarmed noise. I haven't hit anything yet and if I do it will be your fault.<BR>
<BR>
8.) I go clothes shopping to buy, never to look.<BR>
<BR>
9.) Just tell me what you want me to wear before I get dressed. And remember that this takes me less than ten minutes no matter what the occasion is. After all I am getting dressed, not getting ready.<BR>
<BR>
10.) Don't ask me if I prefer one outfit over another or if a certain accessory should be worn or not. I consider this a no win situation and would rather just wait for you to get dressed while watching TV.<BR>
<BR>
11.) If you want me to put the seat down when I am finished then you should leave the seat up when you are finished. It's only fair. And stop giving me a hard time about missing the bowl. What do you expect from an organ that has a brain of its own.<BR>
<BR>
12.) I will cook anything as long as it is on the BBQ.<BR>
<BR>
13.) Yelling to me across the house sounds exactly like stadium crowd background noise to me. I am not ignoring you.<BR>
