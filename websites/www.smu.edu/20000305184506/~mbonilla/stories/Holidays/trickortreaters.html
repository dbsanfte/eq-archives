1. Give away something other than candy.  (Toothpicks, golf balls, bags of sand, etc.)<BR>
<BR>
2. Wait behind the door until some people come.  When they get near the door, jump out, wearing a costume, and holding a bag, and yell,  "Trick or Treat!"  Look at them, scratch your head, and act confused.<BR>
<BR>
3. Fill a briefcase with marbles and crackers.  Write on it, "Top Secret" in big letters.  When trick-or-treaters come, look around suspiciously, say, "It's about time you got here," give them the briefcase, and quickly shut the door.<BR>
<BR>
4. Get about 30 people to wait in your living room.  When trick-or-treaters come to the door, say, "Come in." When they do, have everyone yell, "Surprise!!!" Act like it's a surprise party.<BR>
<BR>
5. Get everyone who comes to the door to come in and see if they can figure out what's wrong with your dishwasher. Insist that it makes an unnatural "whirring" sound.<BR>
<BR>
6. After you give them candy, hand the trick-or-treaters a bill.<BR>
<BR>
7. Open the door dressed as a giant fish. Immediately collapse, and don't move or say anything until the trick-or-treaters go away.<BR>
<BR>
8. When you answer the door, hold up one candybar, throw it out into the street, and yell, "Crawl for it!"<BR>
<BR>
9. When you answer the door, look at the trick-or-treaters, act shocked and scared, and start screaming your head off. Slam the door and runaround the house, screaming until they go away.<BR>
<BR>
10. Insist that the trick-or-treaters each do ten push-ups before you give them any candy.<BR>
<BR>
11. Hand out menus to the trick-or-treaters and let them order their candy. Keep asking if anyone wants to see the wine list.<BR>
<BR>
12. Get a catapult. Sit on your porch and catapult pumpkins at anyone who comes within 50 yards of your house.<BR>
<BR>
13. When people come to the door, jump out a nearby window, crashing through the glass, and run as far away from your house as you can.<BR>
<BR>
14. Answer the door dressed as a pilgrim. Stare at the trick-or-treaters for a moment, pretend to be confused, and start flipping through a calendar.<BR>
<BR>
15. Instead of candy, give away colored eggs. If anyone protests, explain that the eggs are the only thing you had left over from Easter.<BR>
<BR>
16. Answer the door dressed as a dentist. Angrily give the trick-or-treaters a two-hour lecture on tooth decay.<BR>
<BR>
17. Answer the door with a mouthful of M & M's and several half-eaten candy bars in your hands. Act surprised, and close the door. Open it again in a few seconds, and insist that you don't have any candy.<BR>
<BR>
18. Hand out cigarettes and bottles of asprin.<BR>
<BR>
19. Put a crown on a pumpkin and put the pumpkin on a throne on your porch. Insist that all of the trick-or-treaters bow before the pumpkin.<BR>
<BR>
20. Dress up like a bunny rabbit. Yell and curse from the moment you open the door, and angrily throw the candy at the trick-or-treaters. Slam the door when you're finished.<BR>
