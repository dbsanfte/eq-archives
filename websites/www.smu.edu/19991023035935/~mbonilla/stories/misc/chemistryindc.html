In a recent contest, The Washington Post asked readers to dream up new elements for the Periodic Table. Among the best of the batch:<BR>
<BR>
Limbaughium  Lb<BR>
The heaviest known element. It possesses an ever-expanding mass. Very white.  Acidic. Emits heat but no light. Instantly polarizes all elements that come in contact with it. Repels protons and electrons; attracts only morons.<BR>
<BR>
Billclintium  Bc<BR>
With a slick appearance and slimy texture, this element undergoes a series of interesting changes when in hot water.<BR>
<BR>
Canadium  Eh<BR>
Similar to Americium, but a little denser. Much more rigid. Often called Boron.<BR>
<BR>
Innofensium  Pc<BR>
Precisely equal numbers of electrons, protons, neutrons, leptons, quarks.  Completely inert, utterly useless, but smells like a rose.<BR>
<BR>
Newtium Nt<BR>
Extreme irritant. Carries a strong negative charge. Does not possess magnetic properties. Can be purchased cheaply.<BR>
<BR>
Quaylium Qd<BR>
Einsteinium it ain't.<BR>
<BR>
Budweisium  Ps<BR>
Has no taste or smell; is often indistinguishable from water.<BR>
<BR>
Cabmium  Cb<BR>
Found in abundance, except when needed. Exists in two states, in motion and at rest. When in motion, it cannot be stopped, no matter what you do.  Cabmium has a charge associated with it. The charge is variable, and scientists have not determined the formula for calculating it.<BR>
<BR>
Snot  Sn<BR>
Bonds forever with corduroy.<BR>
<BR>
Politicium  Po<BR>
Contains a great deal of gas. Similar to radon in that it can reach lethal concentrations in the House.<BR>
<BR>
Congress Cg<BR>
Atomic number 525. Can never be found in a solution.<BR>
