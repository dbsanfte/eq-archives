Seattle..... When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a  Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor home near spilled sewage.

Drug possession defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in March in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. The  prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in Christopher's jacket could have been a gun.  Nonsense, said Christopher, who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  He handed it over so the judge could see it. The judge discovered a packet of cocaine in the pocket and laughed so hard he required a five-minute recess to compose himself.<BR>

They misspelled the name of the gas company on the side of the truck.<BR>

Oklahoma City... Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed robbery of a convenience store in a district court this week when he fired his lawyer. Assistant district attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a  fair job of defending himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the robber. Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, "I should've blown your [expletive] head off." The defendant paused, then quickly added, "-if I'd been the one that was there."  The jury took 20 minutes to convict Newton and recommended a 30 year sentence.<BR>

A true story out of San Francisco:  It seems a man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America, walked into the branch and wrote  "This iz a stikkup. Put all your muny in this bag.  "While standing in line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry that  someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller window. So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not the brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stick up note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "Ok" and left. The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the man a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.<BR>
