So, there are these two pirates, eh.  One's got a wooden leg, a hook and
even a patch, too.  The other one's just got the pirate clothes. 
<P>
So the second pirate says to the first, "How'd ya get that wooden leg
mate?" 
<P>
The first replies "Arrr, it done got bit off bye a varment shark." 
<P>
The second pirate is, of course, impressed, "Aye, dat's really a pirate
ting to have happen.  How'd ya get dat metal 'ook?" 
<P>
The first replies "Lost err in a sword fight, bastard cut off me bloody
hand!" 
<P>
"Aye, dat's really a pirate ting to have happen" says the second pirate,
again impressed.  "How'd ya get dat patch on your eye?".
<P>
"Well I was up in the crow's nest eh, and I looked up to spy this
seagull," says the pirate's pirate, "and the damn ting shit reet in me
eye" 
<P>
In disbelief the second pirate says "Well, how'd dat make ya blind?" 
<P>
The first pirate replied: "Arr...first day wit me 'ook."
