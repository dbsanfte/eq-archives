An escaped convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom.  As soon as he had a chance,  the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife, bound up on the bed in a skimpy nightgown, and whispered,  "Honey, this guy hasn't seen a woman in years.  Just cooperate with anything he wants.  If he wants to have sex with you, just go along with it and pretend you like it.  Our lives depend on it."<BR>
"Dear," the wife hissed, spitting out her gag, "I'm so relieved you feel that way, because he just told me he thinks you have a really nice, tight-looking ass!!!!!!!"<BR>
