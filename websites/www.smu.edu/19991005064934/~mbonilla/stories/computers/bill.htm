Bill Gates dies in a car accident.  He finds himself in purgatory, being sized up by God....<BR>
<BR>
"Well, Bill, I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell.  After all, you enormously helped society by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95.  I'm going to do something I've never done before in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."<BR>
<BR>
Bill replied, "Well, what's the difference between the two?"<BR>
<BR>
God said, "I'm willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will help your decision."<BR>
<BR>
"Fine, but where should I go first?"<BR>
<BR>
"I'll leave that up to you."<BR>
<BR>
"Okay then," said Bill, "let's try Hell first."<BR>
<BR>
So Bill went to Hell.  It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with clear waters and lots of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.  The sun was shining; the temperature perfect.  He was very pleased.<BR>
<BR>
"This is great!" he told God.  "If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!"<BR>
<BR>
"Fine," said God, and off they went.<BR>
<BR>
Heaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing.  It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.<BR>
<BR>
Bill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision.  "Hmmm.  I think I'd prefer Hell," he told God.<BR>
<BR>
"Fine," retorted God, "as you desire."  So Bill Gates went to Hell.<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell.  When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons.<BR>
<BR>
"How's everything going?" he asked Bill.<BR>
<BR>
Bill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, "This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beaches, the beautiful women playing in the water????"<BR>
<BR>
"That was the demo," replied God.<BR>
