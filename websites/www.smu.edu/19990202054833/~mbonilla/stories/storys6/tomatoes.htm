<P>
Once there was a beautiful woman who loved to work in her vegetable garden,
but no matter what she did, she couldn't get her tomatoes to ripen.
Admiring her neighbor's garden, which had beautiful bright red tomatoes,
she went one day and inquired of him his secret.
"It's really quite simple," the old man explained.
"Twice each day, in the morning and in the evening, I expose myself in front
of the tomatoes and they turn red with embarrassment."
Desperate for the perfect garden, she tried his advice and proceeded to
expose herself to her plants twice daily.
Two weeks passed and her neighbor stopped by to check her progress.<P>
"So", he asked, "Any luck with your tomatoes?"<P>
"No", she replied excitedly...<P>
"But you should see the size of my cucumbers!"<P>
