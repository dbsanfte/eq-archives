It goes like this - You get on with your partner. There is anxious anticipation as you start.<BR>
<BR>
You start slowly, climbing your way to the top. There are smiles exchanged, and giggles, maybe even caressing or hand holding................<BR>
<BR>
The excitement builds and builds. It nears the top. The expressions on faces become wondrous and excited.<BR>
<BR>
Then as it hits the pinnacle, things move very fast.<BR>
<BR>
There's a quick motion, the heart races with complete excitement; faces are all in total pleasure. Arms are flailing, heads are bouncing, and there is some noticeable screaming going on.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the ride is up and down, twisting and turning, lots of bumping, sometimes in the light, sometimes in the dark, sometimes there's a surprise, and sometimes it becomes all too familiar but always........... always........at the end, there's a big smile on the face, hair is all messed up............ and everyone is talking about how great it is while some of them say<BR>
<BR>
"I wanna go again"..<BR>
