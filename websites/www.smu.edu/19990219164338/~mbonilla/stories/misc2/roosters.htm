An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens.
 The current rooster was still doing an okay job, but he was getting on
 in years.  And the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt
 anything. So he buys a young cock from the local rooster emporium, and
 turns him loose in the barn yard.
 <BR><BR>
 Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he gets
a little worried. So, they're trying to replace me, thinks the old
  rooster. I've got to do something about this.  He walks up to the new
bird and says,
<BR><BR>
 "So you're the new stud in town?  I bet you really think you're hot
stuff, don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping block yet.
 I'll bet I'm still the better bird.  And to prove it, I challenge you
to a race around that hen house over there.  We'll run around it ten
 times and whoever finish's first gets to have all the hens for
 himself."<BR><BR>
 Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he
 was more than a match for the old guy.  "You're on," said the young
  rooster.
<BR><BR>
 "And since I know I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of
  half a lap.  I'll still win easy," said the young rooster.
  So the two roosters go over to the hen house to start the race with
 all the hens gathering around to watch.  The race begins and all the
  hens start cheering the roosters on.  After the first lap, the old
  rooster is still maintaining his lead.  After the second lap, the old
  guy's lead has slipped a little but he's still hanging in there.
Unfortunately the old rooster's lead continues to slip each time
  around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young
 rooster.
<BR><BR>
  By now the farmer has heard all the commotion.  He runs into the
  house, gets his shotgun, and runs out to the barn yard figuring a fox
  or something is after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees the
  two roosters running around the hen house, with the old rooster still
 slightly in the lead.  He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires,
  and blows the young rooster away.
<BR><BR>
 As he walks away slowly, he says to himself  ........
<BR><BR>
  "Damn, that's the third gay rooster I've bought this month."
