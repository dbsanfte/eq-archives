Three nurses died and went to Heaven, where they were met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter.<BR>
<BR>
To the first, he asked, "So, what did you used to do back on Earth? Why do you think you should be allowed to come into Heaven?"<BR>
<BR>
"I was a nurse at an inner city hospital," she replied. "I worked to bring healing and peace to many sufferers, especially poor, helpless children.<BR>
<BR>
"Very noble," said St. Peter. "You may enter."<BR>
<BR>
And in through the Gates she went.<BR>
<BR>
To the next, he asked the same question, "So, what did you used to do?"<BR>
<BR>
"I was a nurse at a missionary hospital in the Amazon basin," she replied. "For many years, I worked with a skeleton crew of doctors and nurses who tried to reach out to as many people across numerous tribes, with a hand of healing and peace, and with the message about God`s love."<BR>
<BR>
"How touching," said St. Peter. "You, too, may enter."<BR>
<BR>
And in she went.<BR>
<BR>
He then came to the last nurse, to whom he asked, "So, what did you used to do back on Earth?"<BR>
<BR>
After some hesitation, she explained, "I was just a nurse at an HMO."<BR>
<BR>
St. Peter pondered this for a moment, and then said, "Ok, you may enter, too."<BR>
<BR>
"Whew!" said the nurse. "For a moment there, I thought you weren`t going to let me in."<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, you can come in," said St. Peter, "but you can only stay for three days."<BR>
