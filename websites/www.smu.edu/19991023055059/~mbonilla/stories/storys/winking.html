A man with a winking problem is applying for a position as a sales representative for a large firm. The interviewer looks over his papers and says, "This is phenomenal. You've graduated from the best schools; your recommendations are wonderful, and your experience is unparalleled.<BR>
<BR>
Normally, we'd hire you without a second thought. However, a sales representative has a highly visible position, and we're afraid that your constant winking will scare off potential customers. I'm sorry....we can't hire you."<BR>
<BR>
"But wait," he said. "If I take two aspirin, I'll stop winking!"<BR>
<BR>
"Really? Great! Show me!"<BR>
<BR>
So the applicant reaches into his jacket pocket and begins pulling out all sorts of condoms: red condoms, blue condoms, ribbed condoms, flavored condoms; finally, at the bottom, he finds a packet of aspirin. He tears it open, swallows the pills, and stops winking.<BR>
<BR>
"Well," said the interviewer, "that's all well and good, but this is a respectable company, and we will not have our employees womanizing all over the country!"<BR>
<BR>
"Womanizing? What do you mean? I'm a happily married man!"<BR>
<BR>
"Well then, how do you explain all these condoms?"<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, that," he sighed. "Have you ever walked into a pharmacy,  winking, and asked for aspirin?"<BR>
