Mark and Sharon decide they don't want to discuss sex in front of their 4 and 6 year old children, so they decide to talk in code. One day Mark is feeling a little bit turned on and says to Katie, "Tell your mother I would really like to type a letter." Katie runs off to find her mom. " Mommy, mommy", shouts Katie, "Daddy would like to type a letter."
<P>
Sharon replies slightly sheepishly, "Katie, go and tell your daddy that he can't type a letter today as there is a red ribbon in the typewriter."
<P>
Katie tears off to her father and says, "Daddy, daddy, mommy says you can't type a letter today as there is a red ribbon in the typewriter."
<P>
A few days later Sharon remembers that Mark was a little bit keen on a bit of nookie and she called Katie, "Katie, tell your daddy that he can type that letter today."
<P>
Katie went off to look for her father and told him, "Daddy, mommy says you can type the letter today."
<P>
"Thats OK, Katie", Mark says, "You can tell your mother that I don't need the typewriter any more, I wrote the letter by hand."
