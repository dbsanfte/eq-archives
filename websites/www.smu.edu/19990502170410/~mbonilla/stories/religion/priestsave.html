A big storm approaches.  The weatherman urges everyone to get out of town. The priest says "I won't worry, God will save me".  The morning of the storm, the police go through the neighborhood with a sound truck telling everyone to evacuate.  The priest says "I won't worry, God will save me".  The storm drains back up and there is an inch of water standing in the street.  A fire truck comes by to pick up the priest.  He tells them  "Don't worry, God will save me."  The water rises another foot.  A national guard truck comes by to rescue the priest.  He tells them "Don't worry, God will save me." The water rises some more.  The priest is forced up to his roof.  A boat comes by to rescue the priest.  He tells them "Don't worry, God will save me."  The water rises higher.  The priest is forced up to the very top of his roof.  A helicopter comes to rescue the priest.  He shouts up at them "Don't worry, God will save me." The water rises above his house, and the priest drowns.  When he gets up to heaven he says to God "I've been your faithful servant ever since I was born!  Why didn't you save me?" God replies "First I sent you a fire truck, then the national guard, then a boat, and then a helicopter.  What more do you want from me!!??"
