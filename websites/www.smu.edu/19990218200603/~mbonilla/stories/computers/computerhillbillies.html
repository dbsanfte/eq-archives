Sung to the tune of the Beverly Hillbillies...<BR>
<BR>
Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed,<BR>
A poor college kid, barely kept his family fed,<BR>
But then one day he was talking to a recruiter,<BR>
Who said, "they pay big bucks if ya work on a computer..."<BR>
<BR>
Windows, that is... PC's... Workstations...<BR>
<BR>
Well, the first thing ya know ol' Jed's an Engineer.<BR>
The kinfolk said "Jed, move away from here".<BR>
They said "California is the place ya oughta be",<BR>
So he bought some donuts and he moved to Silicon Valley...<BR>
<BR>
Intel, that is... Pentium ... big amusement park...<BR>
<BR>
On his first day at work, they stuck him in a cube.<BR>
Fed him more donuts and sat him at a tube.<BR>
They said "your project's late, but we know just what to do.<BR>
Instead of 40 hours, we'll work you 52!"<BR>
<BR>
OT, that is... unpaid... mandatory...<BR>
<BR>
The weeks rolled by and things were looking bad.<BR>
Schedules started slipping and some managers were mad.<BR>
They called another meeting and decided on a fix.<BR>
The answer was simple... "We'll work him sixty-six!"<BR>
<BR>
Tired, that is... stressed out... no social life...<BR>
<BR>
Months turned to years and his hair was turning grey.<BR>
Jed worked very hard while his life slipped away.<BR>
Waiting to retire when he turned 64,<BR>
Instead he got a call and escorted out the door.<BR>
<BR>
Laid off, that is... de-briefed... unemployed...<BR>
<BR>
Now the moral of the story is listen to what you're told,<BR>
Companies will use you and discard you when you're old.<BR>
So gather up your friends and start your own firm,<BR>
Beat the competition, watch the bosses squirm.<BR>
<BR>
Millionaires, that is... Bill Gates... Steve Jobs...<BR>
<BR>
Y'all come back now... ya hear'<BR>
