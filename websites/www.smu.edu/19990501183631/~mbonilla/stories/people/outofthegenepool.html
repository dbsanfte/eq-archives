LICENSE TO STEAL<BR>
Two Kentucky men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck. Instead of pulling the front panel off the machine, though, they pulled the bumper off the truck. They panicked and fled, leaving the chain still attached to the machine, their bumper still attached to the chain, and their license plate still attached to the bumper.<BR>

When asked for her occupation, a woman charged with a traffic violation said she was a schoolteacher. The judge rose from the bench.

OOPS!I BLEW THAT ONE!<BR>
A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried this creative defense: "My client merely inserted his arm into the window and removed a few trifling articles. His arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole individual for an offense committed by his limb."Well put," the judge replied."Using your logic, I sentence the defendant's arm to one year's imprisonment.He can accompany it or not, as he chooses."The defendant smiled.With his lawyer's assistance he detached his artificial limb, laid it on the bench, and walked out.<BR>
