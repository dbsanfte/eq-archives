Some Polish Gangsters decide to rob a bank.  After several days of 
planning they agree on the best plan.  The next day they get to work
and are able to get into the bank relatively easy thanks to their 
planning. 
<P>

Once inside the main vault they discover one wall is full of safety 
deposit boxes and start to work on them immediately.  They drill and
pry open the first box only to find a small container of vanilla 
pudding inside. 
<P>
The Head Gangster says "Okay, well, at least we can eat it."  So
they eat the pudding.  They drill and pry open up the second Safety 
deposit box and there sits another pudding.  They decide to devour
it too. 
<P>
Determined to find the goods, the process continues for the rest of 
the night until all the safety deposit boxes have been opened.  They
didn't find any money or jewelry in any of the boxes.  Disappointed 
the head gangster said "Well, at least they left something for us to
eat".
<P>
The next day, while listening to the news they hear: "Yesterday the 
largest sperm bank in the USA was robbed by an unknown group of 
people".
