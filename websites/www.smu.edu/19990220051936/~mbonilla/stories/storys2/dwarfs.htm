<P>
The seven dwarfs are in Rome and they go on a tour of the city.
After a while they go to the Vatican and meet the pope.  Grumpy, for once,
seems to have a lot to say; he keeps asking the pontiff questions about
the church, and in particular, nuns.<P>
"Your Holiness, do you have any really short nuns?"<BR>
"No, my son, all our nuns are at least five feet tall."<BR>
"Are you sure?  I mean, you wouldn't have any nuns that are, say,
about my height?  Maybe a little shorter?"<BR> 
"I'm afraid not.  Why do you ask?"<BR>     
"No reason."  Pause.  "Positive?  Nobody in a habit that's about
three feet tall, two and a half feet tall?"<BR>        
"I'm sure."<BR>
"Okay."<BR>
Grumpy looks dejected at this news, and the pope wonders why.<BR>
So he listens to the dwarfs as they leave the building.<BR>
"What'd he say?  What'd he say?"  chant the other six dwarfs.<BR>
Grumpy says, "He said they don't have any."<BR>
And the other six start chanting, "Grumpy fucked a penguin!  Grumpy
fucked a penguin!  Grumpy fucked a penguin!"....<BR>
