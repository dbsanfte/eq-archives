If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em go, because, man, they're gone.
<P>
If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?  We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."
<P>
To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around.  That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a hand?"  You can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."
<P>
If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I bet the most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it shoot farther?"  "No, I'm sorry.  That's as far as it shoots."
<P>
Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset?  And he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet.  And also, you're drunk.
<P>
If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
<P>
If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons (maybe by shoving them down his throat).
<P>
Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just call them "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what, can't we all be brothers?
<P>
I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because I was thinking about doing that anyway.
<P>
I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and hand it to him.
<P>
If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.
<P>
It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money.  And I guess that's what I like about it.  It's easy.  Just sitting there, rocking back and forth, wanting that money.
<P>
If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose.
<P>
As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more than a bunch of honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed that way.
<P>
I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate.  And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it.
<P>
I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching.
<P>
Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books.
<P>
What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get drunk?
<BR>
And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to sleep.
<P>
Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window?  The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out.  Wait.  I guess that's like a regular window.
<P>
During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not putting on your armor because you were "just going down to the corner."
<P>
If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like I am now.
