The story goes that there was this lady married to a Caucasian. The poor
lady was not very proficient in English, but anyhow managed to
communicate
with her husband. The real problem arose whenever she had to  shop for
groceries.
<P>
One day, she went to the butcher's and wanted to buy pork legs. She
didn't
know how to put forward her request, and in desperation, lifted  up her
skirt to show her thighs. The butcher got the message and the  lady went
home with pork legs.
<P>
The next day, she needed to get chicken breasts. Again, she didn't know
what
to say, and so unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breast. The
lady got what she wanted.
<P>
The 3rd day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages. She brought her
husband.
<P>
