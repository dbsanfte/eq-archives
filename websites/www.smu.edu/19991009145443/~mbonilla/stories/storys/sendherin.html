A guy met this girl in a bar and asked, "May I buy you a drink?"<BR>
<BR>
"Okay. But it won't do you any good."<BR>
<BR>
A little later, he asks, "May I buy you another drink?"<BR>
<BR>
"Okay. But it won't do you any good."<BR>
<BR>
He invites her up to his apartment and she replies, "Okay. But it won't do you any good."<BR>
<BR>
They get to his apartment and he says, "You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I want you for my wife."<BR>
<BR>
She says, "Oh, that's different. Send her in."<BR>
