A little girl asked her Mom, "Mom, may I take the dog for a walk around the block?"<BR>
<BR>
Mom says, "Sorry, no."<BR>
<BR>
"Why," the little girl asks.<BR>
<BR>
Mom answers, "Because the dog is in heat."<BR>
<BR>
"What's that mean?" asked the girl.<BR>
<BR>
"Go ask your father."<BR>
<BR>
The little girl goes out to the garage where her father is working on the family car. She pleads, "Dad, can I take the dog for a walk around the block? I asked Mom but she said the dog was in heat and that I should ask you."<BR>
<BR>
Dad said, "Bring Susie over here".<BR>
<BR>
He then took a gasoline soaked rag and rubbed the dog's butt with it and said, "Ok, you can go now but keep the dog on the leash and only go one time around the block!"<BR>
<BR>
The little girl left and returned a few minutes later with no dog on the leash.<BR>
<BR>
Astonished, Dad asks, "Where's the dog?"<BR>
<BR>
The little girl smiled, "She ran out of gas about halfway down the block. But it's okay... there's another dog pushing her home".<BR>
