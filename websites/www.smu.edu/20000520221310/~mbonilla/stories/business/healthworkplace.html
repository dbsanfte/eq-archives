<BR>
Send email to the rest of the company telling them what you're doing. For example "If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom."<BR>

<BR>

For a relaxing break, get away from it all with a mask and snorkel in the fish tank. If no one notices, take out your snorkel and see how many you can catch in your mouth.<BR>
<BR>
Send e-mail messages saying free pizza, free donuts etc... in the lunchroom, when people complain that there was none... Just lean back, pat your stomach, and say, "Oh you've got to be faster than that."<BR>
