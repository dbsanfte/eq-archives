A guy dials his home phone number from work.  A strange woman answers.<BR>
<BR>
The guy says, "Who is this?"<BR>
<BR>
"This is the maid.", answered the woman.<BR>
<BR>
"We don't have a maid!"<BR>
<BR>
"I was just hired this morning by the lady of the house."<BR>
<BR>
"Well, this is her husband.  Is she there?"<BR>
<BR>
"Ummm...she's upstairs in the bedroom with someone who I just figured was her husband."<BR>
<BR>
The guy is fuming.  He says to the maid, "Listen, would you like to make $50,000?"<BR>
<BR>
"What do I have to do?"<BR>
<BR>
"I want you to get my gun from my desk in the den and shoot that bitch and the bastard she's with.  I will accept full responsibility."<BR>
<BR>
The maid puts down the phone.  The guy hears footsteps, followed by a couple of gunshots.<BR>
<BR>
The maid comes back to the phone.  "What should I do with the bodies?"<BR>
<BR>
"Throw them in the swimming pool!"<BR>
<BR>
"What pool?"<BR>
<BR>
"Oops... is this 832-4821?"<BR>
