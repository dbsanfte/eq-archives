A new guy in town walks into a bar and reads a sign that hangs over the bar:<BR>
FREE BEER FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS THE TEST! 	
<P>
 So the guy asks the bartender what the test is.
<P>
Bartender: "Well, first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila, the WHOLE thing at once AND, you can't make a face while doing it.  Second, there's a 'gator out back with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands.  Third, there's a woman up-stairs who's never had an orgasm. You gotta make things right for her.
<P>
Man: Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won't do it.  You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from there.
<P>
Well, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, "Wherez zat teeqeelah?"  He grabs the gallon of tequilla with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp and tears streaming down his face.
<P>
Next he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear the most frightning roaring and thumping, then silence.
<P>
The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped and big scratches all over his body.
<P>
"Now" he says "Where's that woman with the sore tooth?"
