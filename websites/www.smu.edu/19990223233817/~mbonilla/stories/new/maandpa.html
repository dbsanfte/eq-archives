<CENTER><H3>Ma & Pa</H3></CENTER>

Ma and Pa are sitting on the porch swing one evening enjoying the warm  breeze and the night sounds. Suddenly, for no reason at all, Ma hauls off and slaps Pa up side the head so hard he falls off the swing.<BR>
<BR>
Dazed, Pa gets up and asks, "What the hell was that for?"<BR>
<BR>
To which Ma replies, "That's for 20 years of bad sex!"<BR>
<BR>
Pa says nothing and gets back on the swing.<BR>
<BR>
About 5  minutes of silence later, he hauls off and slaps Ma up side the head equally hard.<BR>
<BR>
Ma gets up dazed and asks, "What was that for?"<BR>
<BR>
To which Pa replies, "That's for knowing the damn difference!"<BR>
<BR>
