<CENTER><H3>My First Time</H3>
The sky was dark,<BR>
The moon was high,<BR>
All alone just she and I.<BR>
Her hair was soft,<BR>
Her eyes were blue,<BR>
I knew just what <BR>
She wanted to do.<BR>
Her skin so soft,<BR>
Her legs so fine,<BR>
I ran my fingers <BR>
Down her spine.<BR>
I didn't know how,<BR>
But I tried my best;<BR>
I started by placing <BR>
My hands on her breast.<BR>
I remember my fear,<BR>
My fast beating heart,<BR>
But slowly she spread <BR>
Her legs apart.<BR>
And when I did it,<BR>
I felt no shame.<BR>
All at once,<BR>
The white stuff came.<BR>
At last it's finished,<BR>
It's all over now,<BR>
My first time ever,<BR>
At milking a cow.....<BR>
<P>

I know what you were thinking!!! Get your mind out of the gutter!!!!
You're sick.
