<P>

Two weeks ago, was my forty-fifth birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning anyway.  I went into breakfast, knowing my wife would be pleasant and say Happy Birthday and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say Good Morning, let alone any Happy Birthday.  I said, well, that's wives for you.  The children will remember.  The children came into breakfast and didn't say a word.  When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent.
<P>
As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, "Good Morning, Boss, Happy Birthday."  And I felt a little better; someone had
remembered.
<P>
I worked until noon.
<P>
About noon Janet knocked on my door and said, "You know it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch,
just you and me."
<P>
I said, "By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day.  Let's go."
<P>
We went to lunch.  We didn't go where we normally go; we went out into the country to a little private place.  We had two martinis and
enjoyed lunch tremendously.<P>

On the way back to the office, she said, "You know, it's such a beautiful day.  We don't need to go back to the office.  Do we?"
<P>
I said, "No, I guess not."
<P>
She said, "Let's go to my apartment."
<P>
After arriving at her apartment, we had another martini and smoked a cigarette and she said, "Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go
into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable."
<P>
"Sure," I excitedly replied.
<P>
She went into the bedroom and in about six minutes, she came out...
<P>
.. carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife and children.  All were singing Happy Birthday.
<P>
.. and there on the couch I sat...<BR>
.. with nothing on but my socks......<BR>
