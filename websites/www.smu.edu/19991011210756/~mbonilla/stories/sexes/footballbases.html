Do you remember junior high and High school? Do you remember talking about 'the bases' with your friends?...Well forget em!! This is *FOOTBALL*  With the all new standardized guide to football, you can forget any of the previous complications of having to remember the difference between second and third base and all that other shit. And you wonder why there is a strike in baseball and not football. Quite simply, baseball is a boring, confusing and often ambiguous game, especially when trying to compare it to sexual experiences. Whereas Football was invented for the soul purpose of understanding where you and your friends are at. Basically the game of football is one big sex metaphor. No one has discovered this yet, but as you will soon see, the complications of modern romance are easily solved using The Original Handbook Of Football.<BR>

SO NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE FEILD AND ALL THE DEFINITIONS YOU CAN SEE HOW TO USE THEM, HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW USEFULL THE ORIGINAL HANDBOOK OF FOOTBALL REALLY IS.<BR>
<BR>
1. There was an on-side kick to what I thought was a wide receiver but it turned out to be a tight end so there was a turnover.<BR>
<BR>
2. Their was a deep kickoff with no return. I ran the ball to mid- field but then decided to go to the passing game. The passing play didn't work because of a fumble. On the next down a running back took it to their 10 yard line. With 1ST and goal, the action moved from the Hupper to the Quarterback who did a Quarter back sneak. The game turned out to be the highest scoring Fiesta Bowl ever!!!<BR>
<BR>
3. I was Roughed in the massive pileup.<BR>
<BR>
4. It was third down and inches on the 20 Yard line but on the field goal attempt I was short.<BR>
