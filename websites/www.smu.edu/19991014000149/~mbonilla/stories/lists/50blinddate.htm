   to give the impression that you'll stab anyone, including the
   waiter, who reaches for it.
<P>

   restaurant, and balance them in a tower on your table.

4. Make funny faces at other patrons, then sneer at their
   reactions.
<P>

    outstretched, and make airplane sounds.
<P>

<P>
17. When ordering, inquire whether the restaurant has any live
    food.

20. Chew with your mouth open, talk with your mouth full and
    spray crumbs.
<P>

    in front of you.
<P>
22. Excuse yourself to use the restroom. Go back to the head
    waiter/hostess and ask for another table in a different
    part of the restaurant. Order another meal. When your date
    finally finds you, ask him/her "What in the hell took you so
    long in the restroom?!?"
<P>

    you.

    plates.

    waiter for the potato you "never got". When the waiter
    returns with another potato for you, have the first one back
    up on the plate. Repeat later in the meal.
<P>
38. Order beef tongue. Make lewd comparisons or comments.
<P>

    tape, and use good judgement in editing to twist their words
    around.
<P>
40. Discuss boils and lesions, as if from personal experience.
<P>

    lot cheaper than actually feeding her.
<P>
46. Order your food by colors and textures. Sculpt.

    coffee, and fill the thermos one cup at a time, taking advantage
    of the free refills.
<P>
48. Insist that the waiter cuts your food into little pieces. In
    a simliar vein, insist that he take a bite of everything on
