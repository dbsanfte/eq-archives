Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight.<BR>
<BR>
When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires always has the right of way.<BR>
<BR>
Never tow another car using pantyhose and duct tape.<BR>
<BR>
When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer.<BR>
<BR>
Never relieve yourself from a moving vehicle, especially when driving.<BR>
<BR>
Do not remove the seats from the car so that all your kids can fit in.<BR>
<BR>
Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Personal Hygiene -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Unlike clothes and shoes, a toothbrush should never be a hand-me-down item.<BR>
<BR>
If you have to vacuum the bed, it's time to change the sheets.<BR>
<BR>
While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.<BR>
<BR>
Plucking unwanted nose hair is time-consuming work. A cigarette lighter and a small tolerance for pain can accomplish the same goal and save hours.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Its a good idea to keep a bucket of water handy when using this method.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Dining Out -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Remember to leave a generous tip for good service. After all, their mobile home costs just as much as yours.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Entertaining in Your Home -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<BR>
<BR>
Do not allow the dog to eat at the table . . . no matter how good his manners are.<BR>
<BR>
If your dog falls in love with a guest's leg, have the decency to leave them alone for a few minutes.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Dating (Outside the Family) -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.<BR>
<BR>
Be aggressive. Let her know you are interested: "I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the men's bathroom wall two years a go."<BR>
<BR>
If a girl's name does not appear regularly on a bathroom wall, water tower, or an overpass, odds are good that the date will end in frustration.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Theater Etiquette -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended.<BR>
<BR>
Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Wedding Etiquette -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Livestock is usually a poor choice for a wedding gift.<BR>
<BR>
Its is not okay for the groom to bring a date to a wedding.<BR>
<BR>
When dancing, never remove undergarments, no matter how hot it is.<BR>
<BR>
A bridal veil made of window screen is not only cost effective but also a proven fly deterrent.<BR>
<BR>
For the groom, at least rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a natty appearance. Though uncomfortable, say yes to socks and shoes for this special occasion.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>- Redneck Etiquette for All Occasions -</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Never take a beer to a job interview or ask if they press charges.<BR>
<BR>
Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.<BR>
<BR>
Always say "Excuse me" after getting sick in someone else's car.<BR>
<BR>
It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.<BR>
<BR>
Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it's considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.<BR>
<BR>
The socially refined never fish coins out of public toilets, especially if other people are around.<BR>
<BR>
Always provide an alibi to the police for family members.<BR>
