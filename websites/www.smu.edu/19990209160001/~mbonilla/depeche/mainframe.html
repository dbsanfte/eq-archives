<font face="Tempus Sans ITC, Arial, Verdana" size="2"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure why I like dm so much, I guess I just love the music and the wonderful lyrics.  I don't really remember when the first time was I heard dm, but it must have been sometime around the people are people days.  My sister brought home a tape by depeche and from then on I loved them. And since then its been great collecting their records and listening to their wonderful songs.  From the wonderful dance beats of enjoy the silence and behind the wheel to the lyrics of <A HREF="lyrics/somebody.html">somebody</A> and clean, depeche mode has always found a way to keep me coming back for more.  I don't know if that helps answering why I love them so much, but sit back and listen to their music, take in some of their lyrics, and hopefully you'll love them as much as I do.  Enjoy your journey into the space age.</B></font>
