<CENTER><H3>What the employees really mean</H3></CENTER>

1. "Can I help you get a size?" Don't touch that, I just spent an hour folding it and I don't need your grubby little hands messing it up again.<BR>
<BR>
2. "Do you need help with anything?" Quick, my manager is coming around the corner and  I need to look busy.<BR>
<BR>
3. "Welcome to &lt;Insert Store Name Here&gt; Good, another customer to mess up my entire store just to buy a pair of socks.<BR>
<BR>
4. "Have a nice day!" Now that you ruined mine<BR>
<BR>
5. "Thank you for shopping at &lt;Insert Store Name Here&gt;" Thanks for emptying your wallet with us!<BR>
<BR>
6. "Do you need a shopping cart to help you carry your items?" The more you can carry, the more you can buy!<BR>
<BR>
7. "I love your shirt! Where did you get it?" Your shirt is much nicer than the clothes we sell here, hell, why are you even shopping here?<BR>
<BR>
8. "Can I help you get something down?" I'll get a ladder and put it up for you since this other nice customer put in the absolut wrong place.<BR>
<BR>
9. "Don't worry about folding it, I can do it" You would just mess it up again if you folded it.<BR>
<BR>
10. "No, we dont have any more in the back" I just dont want to check<BR>
<BR>
11. "Sorry, I cannot make change of a dollar" I already opened my register with 'No Sale' enough times today to steal 5 bucks in pennies to pay for my dinner, i dont need to open it again for no reason.<BR>
<BR>
12. "Sorry, I can't help you at the moment, I am with another customer" Go Away. I'm on break and shopping for myself, I am just too lazy to take my nametag off.<BR>
<BR>
13. "I'm sorry. We don't have any more of that particular item in stock at the moment, we may be getting some in this week" Your not going to come back anyway, so it is ok if I lie to you, and If you do come back to get it, then the shipment truck was in an accident.<BR>
<BR>
14. "Those polka dot pants with yellow stripes look amazing on you, They make you look so skinny" I'm on commission here and I am lying through my teeth.<BR>
<BR>
15. "Of course that shirt is in style" I grew out of that shirt 7 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
16. "It would make a wonderful birthday gift" If the birthday child was blind that is.<BR>
<BR>
17. "What do you need help with miss?" Am I annoying you yet?<BR>
