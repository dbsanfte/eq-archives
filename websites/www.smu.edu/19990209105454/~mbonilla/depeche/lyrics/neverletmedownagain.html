<H2><CENTER>Never Let Me Down</CENTER></H2>
I'm taking a ride<BR>
With my best friend<BR>
I hope he never lets me down again<BR>
He knows where he's taking me<BR>
Taking me where I want to be<BR>
I'm taking a ride <BR>
With my best friend<BR>
<BR>
We're flying high<BR>
We're watching the world pass us by<BR>
Never want to come down<BR>
Never want to put my feet back down<BR>
On the ground<BR>
<BR>
I'm taking a ride<BR>
With my best friend<BR>
I hope he never lets me down again<BR>
Promises me I'm as safe as houses<BR>
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers<BR>
I hope he never lets me down again<BR>
<BR>
Never let me down<BR>
<BR>
See the stars they're shining bright<BR>
Everything's alright tonight<BR>
<P>
