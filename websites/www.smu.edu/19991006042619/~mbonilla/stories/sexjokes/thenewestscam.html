<P>
A company takes out a newspaper advertisement claiming to be able to supply imported hard core pornographic videos.  As their prices seem reasonable, people place orders and make payments via check. After several weeks, the company writes back explaining that under the present law they are unable to supply the materials and do not wish to be prosecuted.  So they return their customers' money in However, due to the name of the company, few people ever bother to present these to their banks.  The name of the company: 'The Anal Sex and Fetish Perversion Company'.
