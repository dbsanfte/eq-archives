When I was in jr. high, all I wanted was a girl with large breasts.<BR>
<BR>
In high school, I dated a girl with large breasts, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl.<BR>
<BR>
In college, I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, she cried all the time. So I decided I needed a girl with some stability.<BR>
<BR>
I found a very stable girl, but she was boring.  She never got excited about anything.  So I decided I needed a girl with some excitement.<BR>
<BR>
I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.  She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything.  She was directionless.  So I decided to find a girl with some ambition.<BR>
<BR>
After college, I found an ambitious girl and married her.  She was so ambitious, she divorced me and took everything I owned.<BR>
<BR>
Now all I want is a girl with large breasts.<BR>
