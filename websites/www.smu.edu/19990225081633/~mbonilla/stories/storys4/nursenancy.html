Two doctors were in a hospital hallway one day complaining about Nurse Nancy. "She's incredibly mixed up," said one doctor. "She does everything absolutely backwards.
<P>
Just last week, I told her to give a patient 2 milligrams of  morphine every 10 hours. She gave him 10 milligrams every 2 hours. He damn near died on us!"
<P>
The second doctor said, "That's nothing. Earlier this week, I told her to give a patient an enema every 24 hours. She tries to give him 24 enemas in one hour! The guy damn near exploded!"
<P>
Suddenly, they hear this blood-curdling scream from down the hall. "Omigod!" said the first doctor, "I just realized I told Nurse Nancy to prick Mr. Smith's boil!"
<P>
