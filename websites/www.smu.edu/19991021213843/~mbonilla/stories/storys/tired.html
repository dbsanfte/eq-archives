By the time John pulled into the little town, every hotel room was taken. "You've got to have a room somewhere."  he pleaded to the last hotel manager,  "Or just a bed--I don't really care where. I'm completely exhausted<BR>
<BR>
"Well, I do have a double room with one occupant," admitted the manager, "and I'm sure he would be glad to split the cost. But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained all week. I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you." <BR>
<BR>
"No problem," the tired traveler assured him. "I'll take it."<BR>
 <BR>
The next morning John came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  The manager asked him how he survived. <BR>
<BR>
"Never better." John said.<BR>
<BR>
The manager was impressed. "No problem with the other guy snoring, then?"<BR>
<BR>
"Nope. I shut him up in no time." <BR>
<BR>
"How'd you manage that?"<BR>
<BR>
"He was already in bed, snoring away. when I came in the room," John said. "I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'Good night, beautiful,' and he sat up all night watching me."<BR>
