<CENTER><H3>Newt's Book of Acceptable Sexual Positions and Eroticism for Practicing Christian Conservative Republicans</H3></CENTER>

<CENTER>By Robert Mauro</CENTER><BR>
     "Sex" between consenting Christian Conservative Republican 
adults making over $200,000 a year is the wrong word for readers 
of this new book.  "Intercourse" is closer, since it does indeed 
have some bearing in commerce and in foreign monetary exchange. 
Therefore, a more correct way of describing what legally married 
opposite sex Christian Conservative Republican partner's who are 
bona fide citizens of the United States do to reproduce the party 
of their choice is more correctly stated as "a fair exchanges of 
goods for services rendered." <P>
     WARNING: No portion of this book applies in any way to any 
illegal aliens of either sex. <P>
     Now as to acceptable sexual positions for practicing Christian 
Conservative Republicans.  There are many.  According to Newt, the 
proper positions are MAN-ON-TOP, WOMAN-ON-BOTTOM, and variations 
of these.  For example, a true Christian Conservative Republican 
can define MAN-ON-TOP as anything other than WOMAN-ON-TOP.  This 
can include WOMAN-ON-BOTTOM.  Perhaps the most popular position for 
most Christian Conservative Republicans is the MAN-ON-TROPICAL- 
BEACH-WITH-FEET-UP-ON-THE-BRONZE-ASS-OF-SOME-SEXY-BABE-WITH- 
EXTREMELY-LOW-IQ-BUT-EXTREMELY-LARGE-MAMMARY-GLANDS position.  This 
is a difficult position to attain.  It requires two things: a very 
large income and a very dumb babe.  If the man can achieve the 
first, he can usually accomplish the second; however, this is 
becoming increasingly more difficult.  (See section on LORENE 
BOBBITT.) <P>
     Is Oral Sex acceptable for practicing Christian Conservative 
Republicans?  Yes -- as long as Newt does all the talking.  Terms 
like tit, cock, pussy, knocker, balls, cunt, or ass should never 
be used -- even during the heat of passion or during an election 
year, or if an audio and/or video recorder is present.  Be 
especially careful of your language in or around security cameras 
and/or motel mirrors. <P>
     Rather than addressing one's external reproductive organs as 
above, Newt suggest the Christian-Conservative-Republican-fair- 
exchanges-of-goods-for-services-rendered terminology should be 
bosom, family-values jewelry box, wee-wee, mammary gland, black 
bag, woo-woo, and heine.  NOTE: some Ultra-Christian Conservative 
Republicans like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed have 
said that "heine" is still not totally acceptable.  Pat Robertson, 
Ralph Reed and Jerry Falwell has suggested "third circle of hell." 
However, if you are one of those rare and timid Christian 
Conservative Republicans, just say "you-know-whats." <P>
     Self-pleasuring usually involves listening to Rush Limbaugh, 
Mary Matalin, G. Gordon Liddy, Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, or John 
Sanunu.  This is never crudely referred to as Jerking Off by a true 
Christian Conservative Republican.  But it is guaranteed to make 
you reach a climax just in time for the Snapple commercial. <P>
     For those of you who enjoy "dressing up" during "a fair 
exchanges of goods for services rendered," Newt suggests his 
catalogue of Christian Conservative Republican Connubial Bliss 
Clothes and "Political" Patronage Gifts.  Here you can order those 
hard-to-find crotchless Grey Flannel Suits, Eatable Red Ties, 
Eatable Watergate Break-in Panties, and even those Standup-For- 
America Red, White and Blue Contract With America Condoms.  Each, 
of course, generously lubricated with funds from Newt's favorites 
PACs.  You can also order Newt's GOP Cheerleader Costumes.  The 
man's comes with a mask of Rush Limbaugh and the woman's with a 
mask of Mary Matalin.  Into bondage?  Try Newt's Trickie Dickie 
Watergate Co-conspirator Handcuffs.  Enjoy pain?  Newt suggests G. 
Gordon Liddy's WILL, THE BEDROOM EDITION.  It comes complete with 
how to drop hot wax "covertly" in all those "sensitive," 
"classified" areas. <P>
     If you are into abstinence while out on that GOP campaign 
trail or temporarily living with a Liberal (a possible 
abomination), you might want to order the Newt-Approved Nancy 
Reagan JUST SAY NO button.  Push it and it says, "Bill sucks; 
Hillary's a bitch!  Bill sucks; Hillary's a bitch!  Bill sucks; 
Hillary's a bitch!" <P>
     If you are desperate, you can order The Newt Gingrich Safe 
Sex Blow Up Doll.  Just inflate the head, and you are ready for 
evening upon evening of "getting the job done in 100 days or less!" 
It may be a bit rushed and sloppy, but, hey, as long as it 
feeeeeels good! <P>
     For those UNMARRIED Christian Conservative Republicans who 
would like to engage in "a fair exchanges of goods for services 
rendered," order Newt's Personal Responsibility Necklace for the 
woman and Newt's Personal Responsibility Red Tie for the man.  Both 
are completely eatable and at the slightest hint of moisture and/or 
if the wearer and/or wearers are in a horizonal position, the 
<P>
Necklace and/or the Tie will immediately send a satellite-relayed 
message to Newt's carefully chosen team of "budget" cutters who 
will arrive on the scene to take "appropriate action" (See section 
on LORENE BOBBITT).  No need to worry, however, IF unmarried 
partners have contributed at least $1,000 to the Republican 
National Committee and/or GoPac. <P>
     If you like to watch videos, you can order the 18-minute Newt- 
Approved Richard M. Nixon Erotic Video, complete with 18 minutes 
"missing." <P>
     Finally, NEWT'S BOOK OF ACCEPTABLE SEXUAL POSITIONS AND 
EROTICISM FOR PRACTICING CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS is only 
available to those dull, humorless, white male Christian 
Conservative Republicans making over $200,000 a year.  And for your 
privacy, Newt's book is surreptitiously shipped in non-recycled 
brown paper and printed in highly-toxic ink.  Price is just your 
soul -- and please be sure to include your heart and mind for 
shipping and handling.  Proceeds from the sale of this book will 
go to Newt's favorite charity: GoPac. <P>
