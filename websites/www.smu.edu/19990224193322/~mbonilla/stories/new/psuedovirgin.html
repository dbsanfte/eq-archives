Concerned about her relationship, a woman approaches her doctor and says "Doc, I'm getting married this week-end and my fiancee thinks I'm a virgin, is there anything you can do to help me"? 
<P>
After the doctor stopped laughing, he says, "Medically, no, but here's something you can try...on the wedding night, when you're getting ready for bed, take an elastic band and slide it to your upper thigh, when your husband puts it in, snap the elastic band and tell him it's your virginity snapping." 
<P>
The woman loves this idea, and knows her hubby-to-be will fall for this. They have a beautiful wedding and retire to the honeymoon suite. The wife gets ready for bed in the bathroom, slips the elastic band up her leg, finishes preparing and climbs into bed with her man.
<P>
Things begin to progress, her hubby "slips it in", she snaps the elastic band, and the hubby asks, "what the *@#% was that?
<P>
The wife explains, "oh nothing honey, that was just my virginity snapping". 
<P>
The husband cries out, "Well snap it again, it's got my balls!!!!" >>
<P>
