</H1>
Little Johnny was 7 years old, and like other boys
his age,  rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about courting
from  other boys and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day
he  took his questions to his mother, and she became flustered. Instead of
 explaining things to Johnny she told him to hide behind the curtains  one
night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did,  and the
following morning Johnny described everything to his mother.
<P>
Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then  he turned
off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her,  I figured sis
must be getting sick because her face started looking  funny. He must have
thought so too because he put his hand inside her  blouse to feel her heart,
just like the doctor would. Except he's not  as good as the doctor, because
he seemed to have trouble finding  her heart.
<P>
He was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them  started
panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must  have been getting
cold because he put it under her skirt. About this  time, sis got toward
the end of the couch. This was when the fever  started. I know it was a fever
because sis told him she was really  HOT.
<P>         Finally, I found out what was making them so sick.... a big 
eel had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his  pants
and stood there about 9 inches long. HONEST! anyway, he grabbed  it in one
hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she got  really scared.
Her eyes big and her mouth fell open, and she started  calling out to God
and stuff like that. I should tell her about the  ones I saw at the lake!
<P>         "Anyway", sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by bitting
 its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go...
<P> I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held
 it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and sliped it over  the
eels head to keep it from biting again.
<P>         Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor 
lock on it. And he helped by laying on the top of the eel. The eel put  up
a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squeeling and her  boyfriend
almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel  by squishing
it between them.
<P>         After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her
 boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the eel... I knew it  was
dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were  hanging
out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the  battle, but they
went on courting anyway. He started hugging and  kissing her again. And by
golly, the eel wasn't dead after all. It  jumped straight up and started
to fight again. I guess eels are like  cats.... they have nine lives or
something.
<P>         This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting
 on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the  eel.
I know it was dead this time because I saw sis's boyfriend peel  of the skin
and flush it down the toilet.
