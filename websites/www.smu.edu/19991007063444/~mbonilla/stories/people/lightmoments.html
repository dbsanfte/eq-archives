I am a medical student currently doing a rotation in toxicology at the poison control center.  Today, this woman called in very upset because she caught her little  daughter eating ants. I quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital.  She calmed down, and at the end of the conversation happened to mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in order to kill the ants. I told her that she better bring her daughter in to the ER right away.<BR>

Seems that a year ago, some Boeing employees on the field decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were successful in getting it out of the plant and home.  When they took it for a float on the Stilliguamish River, they were quite surprised by a coast guard helicopter homing in on the emergency locator that is activated when the raft is inflated.<BR>

The instructor was demonstrating the wonders of static electricity to his class at MIT.  While holding a plastic rod in  one hand and a wool cloth in the other, he told the class, "You can see that I get a large charge from rubbing my rod..."  That was pretty much the end of learning for that day.<BR>

I worked for a while at a Wal-Mart store, selling sporting goods.  As an employee of Wal-Mart you are sometimes required to make store-wide pages, e.g.,"I have a customer in hardware who needs assistance at the paint counter."  One night a tentative female voice came over the intercom system with the following message:  "I have a customer by the balls in toys who needs assistance."<BR>

A police officer had a perfect hiding place for watching for speeders.  But one day, everyone was under the speed limit, the officer found the problem:  a 10 year old boy was standing on the side of the road with a huge hand painted sign which said "RADAR TRAP AHEAD."  A little more investigative work led the officer to the boy's accomplice, another boy about 100 yards beyond the radar trap with a sign reading "TIPS" and a bucket at his feet, full of change.<BR>

A carpet layer had just finished installing carpet for a lady. He stepped out for a smoke, only to realize he'd lost his cigarettes. In the middle of the room, under the carpet, was a bump.  "No sense pulling up the entire floor for one pack of smokes," he said to himself. He proceeded to get out his hammer and flattened the hump.   As he was cleaning up, the lady came in.  "Here," she said, handing him his pack of cigarettes. "I found them in the hallway." "Now," she said, "if only I could find my hamster."<BR>
