3.  You name your children Eudora, Mozillia and Dotcom.<BR>
4.  You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, like you just pulled the plug on a loved one.<BR>

8.  You start using smileys in your snail mail.<BR>
9.  Your hard drive crashes. You haven't logged in for two hours. You start to twitch. You pick up the phone and manually dial your ISP's access number. You try to hum to communicate with the modem...And you succeed.<BR>
