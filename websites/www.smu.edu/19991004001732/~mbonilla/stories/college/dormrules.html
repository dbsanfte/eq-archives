On the first day of college, the dean/principal addresses the students pointing out some of the rules. "The female dormitory will be out-of-bounds for all male students, so too the male dormitory to the female students. Anybody caught breaking this rule will be fined $20 the first time. Anybody caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught a third time will incur a hefty fine of $180.
<P>
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?".
<P>
To this, a male student in the crowd inquires: "HOW MUCH FOR A SEASON PASS?"
