1. The toilet is blocked and we cannot bathe the children until it is cleared.<BR>
2. I want some repairs done to my stove as it has backfired and burnt my knob off.<BR>
3. This is to let you know that there is a smell coming from the man next door.<BR>
4. The toilet seat is cracked: where do I stand?<BR>
5. I am writing on behalf of my sink, which is running away from wall .<BR>
6. I request your permission to remove my drawers in the kitchen.<BR>

11. Will you please send a man to look at my water, it is a funny color and not fit to drink.<BR>
12. Would you please send a man to repair my downspout. I am an old page pensioner and need it straight away.<BR>
13. Could you please send someone to fix our bath tap. My wife got her toe stuck in it and it is very uncomfortable for us.<BR>
14. I want to complain about the farmer across the road. Every morning at 5:30 his cock wakes me up, and it is getting too much.<BR>
15. When the workmen were here they put their tools in my wife's new drawers and made a mess. Please send men with clean tools to finish the job and keep my wife happy.<BR>
