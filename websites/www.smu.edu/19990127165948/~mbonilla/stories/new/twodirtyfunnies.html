There was a virgin who wanted to marry a farmer boy.  One day, she went to his parents' house for dinner. When they got done eating dinner, they decided to go for a walk through the pasture. While they were walking they came upon the 2 horses that were mating.  She looks at them with wonder because she's never seen anything like this before so she asks the boy,<BR>
"What are they doing?"<BR>
He says "They're making love."<BR>
"Well, what's that long thing his sticking in there?" She ask.<BR>
"Oh, uh, that's his rope" he answered.<BR>
"Well, what are those two round things on the other end?" she ask.<BR>
He says "Those are his knots"<BR>
She says, "Oh, Ok I got it."<BR>
As they continue their stroll, they come to a barn and go in.  She looks at him and says, "I want you to make love to me the way those animals were."<BR>
Surprised and excited, the boy agrees.<BR>
While they're getting at all hot and heavy, she grabs his balls and squeezes.<BR>
"Whoa, what are you doing?" he shouts.<BR>
The girl innocently (??) replies,<BR>
"I'm untying the knots so I'll get more rope."<BR>
<BR>

A guy walks into a bar. He's a rather large, menacing chap. He chugs back a beer and says, "All the guys on this side of the bar are cocksuckers!<BR>
Anyone got a problem with that?"<BR>
Everyone is understandably silent.<BR>
He then chugs back another beer and says, "All the guys on the other side of the bar are motherfuckers! Anyone got a problem with that?"<BR>
Everyone is silent, again.<BR>
Then one man gets up from his stool and starts to walk towards the man.<BR>
"You got a problem, buddy?"<BR>
"No, I'm just on the wrong side of the bar."<BR>
