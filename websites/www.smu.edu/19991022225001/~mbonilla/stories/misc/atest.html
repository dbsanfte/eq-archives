This test does not measure intelligence, your fluency with words, creativity or mathematical ability.  It will, however, give you some gauge of your mental flexibility.  In the three years since the test was developed, few people have been found who could solve more than half of the 26 questions on the first try.  Many, however, reported getting answers long after the testing had been set aside, particularly at unexpected moments when their minds were relaxed.  Some reported solving all the questions over a period of several days.  Take the test as your personal challenge. 16 correct answers out of the 26 = Genius.<BR>
<BR>
Instructions:  Each equation below contains the initials of words that will make it correct.  Furnish the missing words.  For example:  60 =  M in an H. would be 60 = Minutes in an Hour.<BR>
<BR>
GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN.<BR>
