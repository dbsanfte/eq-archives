A guy is not getting along so well with his wife, thinks maybe he'd like to have a pet, goes to a pet shop.<BR>
<BR>
After looking around he spots a parrot sitting on a little perch.  It doesn't have any feet or legs.  The guy says out loud, "Geez, I wonder what happened to this parrot."<BR>
<BR>
"I was born this way," says the parrot.  "I'm a defective parrot."<BR>
<BR>
"Ha, ha," the guy laughs.  "It sounded like this parrot actually understood what I said and answered me."<BR>
<BR>
"I understood every word," says the parrot.  "I am a highly  intelligent, thoroughly educated bird. "<BR>
<BR>
"Yeah?" the guy asks.  "Then answer this:  how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well," the parrot says, "this is a little embarrassing, but since you asked I'll tell you.  I wrap my little parrot penis around this wooden bar, kind of like a little hook.  You can't see it cause of my feathers."<BR>
<BR>
"Wow," says guy, "you really can understand and answer, can't you?"<BR>
<BR>
"Of course.  I speak both Spanish and English.  I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any subject:  politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy ... and I am especially good at ornithology.  You ought to buy me.  I am a great companion."<BR>
<BR>
The guy looks at the price tag.  "$200!"  he says.  "I can't afford that."<BR>
<BR>
"Pssst," the parrot hisses, motioning the guy over with one wing. "Nobody wants me cause I don't have any feet.  You can get me for $20 -- just make an offer."<BR>
<BR>
Guy offers 20 beans and walks out with the parrot.  Weeks go by. The parrot is sensational.  He's funny, he's interesting, he's a great pal, he understands everything, sympathizes, gives good advice.  Guy is delighted.<BR>
<BR>
One day guy comes home from work and the parrot says, "pssst," and motions him over with one wing.  Guy goes up close to the cage.<BR>
<BR>
"I don't know if I should tell you this or not, " says the parrot, "but it's about your wife and the mailman..."<BR>
<BR>
"What?"  says the guy.   "What?"<BR>
<BR>
"Well," the parrot says, "when the mailman came to the door today your wife greeted him in a sheer nightgown and kissed him on the mouth."<BR>
<BR>
"What happened then?"  asks the guy.<BR>
<BR>
"Then the mailman came into the house and lifted up the nightgown and began petting her all over," reports the parrot.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh No!"  the guy says.  "Then what?"<BR>
<BR>
"Then he lifted up the nightgown, got down on his knees and began to lick her body, starting with her breasts and slowly going down and down ..."<BR>
<BR>
The parrot pauses for a long time.<BR>
<BR>
"What happened?  What happened?"  says the frantic guy.<BR>
<BR>
"I don't know," says the Parrot, "I fell off my perch."<BR>
