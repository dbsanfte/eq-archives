A guy goes over to his friend's house, rings the bell, and the wife
answers.
<BR><BR>
" Hi, is Tony home?"
<p>
" No, he went to the store."
<p>
"Well, you mind if I wait?"
<p>
" No, come in."
<p>
They sit down and the friend says "You know Nora, you have the
greatest breasts I have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred bucks if I
could just see one."
<p>
Nora thinks about this for a second and figures what the hell - a
hundred bucks. She opens her robe and shows one. He promptly thanks her and
throws a hundred bucks on the table.
<p>
They sit there a while longer and Chris says
"They are so beautiful I've got to see the both of them. I'll give you
another hundred bucks if I could just see the both of them together."
<p>
Nora thinks about this and thinks what the hell, opens her robe, and
gives Chris a nice long look. Chris thanks her, throws another hundred
bucks on the table, and then says he can't wait any longer and
leaves.
<p>
A while later Tony arrives home and his wife says "You know, your
weird friend Chris came over. "
<p>
Tony thinks about this for a second and says "Well did he drop off the
200 bucks he owes me?"
