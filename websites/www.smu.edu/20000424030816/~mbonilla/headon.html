as soon as I get my head around you<BR>
i come around catching sparks off you<BR>
i get an electric shock from you<BR>
this secondhand living just won't do<BR>
and the way i feel tonight<BR>
i could die and i wouldn't mind<BR>
and there's something going on inside<BR>
makes you wanna feel<BR>
makes you wanna try<BR>
makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky<BR>
and i can't stand up<BR>
i can't cool down<BR>
i can't get my head off the ground<BR>
as soon as i get my head around you<BR>
i come around catching sparks off you<BR>
and all i ever got from you<BR>
was all i ever took from you<BR>
yeah, the world could die in pain<BR>
and i wouldn't feel no shame<BR>
and there's nothing holding me to blame<BR>
makes you wanna feel<BR>
makes you wanna try<BR>
makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky<BR>
and i'm taking myself to a dirty part of town<BR>
where all my troubles can't be found<BR>
i said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<BR>
and i'm taking myself to a dirty part of town<BR>
where all my troubles can't be found<BR>
makes you wanna feel<BR>
makes you wanna try<BR>
makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky<BR>
