One day Superman was feeling a bit horney, so he began to ask his superhero mates for ideas on where he could get a bit of action. <BR>
<BR>
"Hey Batman! Who's a good shag?" <BR>
"Well, Superman, everyone knows that Wonderwoman is the best sex in  Comicland. Why don't you try her?" replied Batman. <BR>
"I'd love to, but Wonderwoman and I are friends. So I don't really want to take advantage of her." <BR>
"Damn shame," said Batman as he waved goodbye to Superman and flew off. <BR>
<BR>
Ten minutes later Superman was flying low over a city when he saw Spiderman swinging from rooftop to rooftop. He flew down. <BR>
"Hey Spidey, I'm cruising for a piece of ass. Who's the best shag in Comicland?" <BR>
"Hey Superman! Everyone knows that Wonderwoman is far and away the best shag in Comicland, why don't you try her?" "Well we are sort of friends," Superman said, "But I didn't realize she had gotten around so much" and flew off in frustration.  <BR>
<BR>
Twenty minutes later he was flying over a field when he saw Wonderwoman lying naked, in the middle of the field, with her legs apart and up in the air. Superman was tempted. "Goddamn it! he thought to himself, "I'm faster than a speeding bullet, I can be in and out of there before she even knows I'm here." So with a blur and a sonic boom he was down, in and gone.   Wonderwoman stared up into the sky with a glazed expression. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??" she exclaimed.  "I don't know," said the Invisible Man as he rolled off, "But my ass is killing me!" <BR>
