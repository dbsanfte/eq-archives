A man took his pregnant wife to the hospital to give birth, and the doctor
told them that he had developed an experimental machine and asked if they'd
like to try it out. He explained carefully that the machine could take some
of the pain of childbirth from the mother and give it to the father.
<P>
Both the husband and the wife thought this was a wonderful idea, and
decided to give it a try. The doctor set the knob on the machine to ten
percent for starters, explaining to the man that even ten percent was
probably more pain than he had ever experienced. But the man was surprised
at how little pain he felt and asked the doctor to go ahead and turn it up
a notch.
 <P>
The doctor twisted the knob up to twenty percent, and checked the husband's
blood pressure, which was fine. Amazed, the doctor turned the knob again
and increased the pain threshold to fifty percent.
 <P>
Still feeling nothing, the husband encouraged the doctor to give him ALL
the pain. Again, dumbfounded, the doctor increased the load to one hundred
percent. After his wife had given birth, the man stood up, stretched a
little, and helped his wife into the car, both of them feeling fine.
<P>
When they got home, they found the mailman dead on the doorstep.

After marrying a beautiful young filly, a ninety-year-old geezer told his
doctor that they were expecting a baby.
<P>
 "Let me tell you a story," said the Doctor. "An absent-minded fellow went
hunting, but instead of his gun, he picked up an umbrella. While hunting in
the woods a bear suddenly charged him. Pointing his umbrella at the bear,
he shot and killed it right there on the spot."
<P>
 "Impossible!" the geezer exclaimed. "Somebody else must have shot that
bear." 
 <P>
 "Exactly," replied the doctor.
