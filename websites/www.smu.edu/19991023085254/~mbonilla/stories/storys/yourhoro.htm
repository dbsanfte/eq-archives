<FONT SIZE="3">Aquarius (1/20 - 2/18)</FONT>  You have an inventive mind and are inclined to 
   be progressive.  You lie a great deal.  On the other hand, you are 
   inclined to be careless and impractical, causing you to make the 
   same mistakes over and over again.  People think you are stupid. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Pisces (2/19 - 3/20)</FONT>  You have a vivid imagination and often think 
   you are being followed by the CIA or FBI.  You have minor 
   influence over your associates, and people resent you for 
   flaunting your power.  You lack confidence and are generally a 
   coward.  Pisces people do terrible things to small animals. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Aries (3/21 - 4/19)</FONT>  You are the pioneer type and hold most people 
   in contempt.  You are quick tempered, impatient, and scornful of 
   advice.  You are not very nice. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Taurus (4/20 - 5/20)</FONT>  You are practical and persistent.  You have a 
   dogged determination and work like hell.  Most people think you 
   are stubborn and bullheaded.  You are a Communist. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Gemini (5/21 - 6/20)</FONT>  You are a quick and intelligent thinker.  Most 
   people like you, as you are bisexual.  However, you are inclined 
   to expect too much for too little.  In other words, you are cheap. 
   Geminis are known for committing incest. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Cancer (6/21 - 7/22)</FONT>  You are sympathetic and understanding to other 
   people's problems.  They think you are a sucker.  You are always 
   putting things off; that's why you'll never make anything of 
   yourself.  Most welfare recipients are Cancer people. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Leo (7/23 - 8/22)</FONT>  You consider yourself a born leader.  Others 
   think you are just pushy.  Most Leos are bullies.  You are vain 
   and dislike honest criticism.  Your arrogance is disgusting. 
   Leo people are thieves. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Virgo (8/23 - 9/22)</FONT>  You are the logical type and hate disorder. 
   This nit-picking is sickening to your friends.  You are cold and 
   unemotional and sometimes fall asleep while making love. 
   Virgos make good bus drivers. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Libra (9/23 - 10/22)</FONT>  You are the artistic type and have a difficult 
   time with reality.  If you are a man, you are more than likely 
   gay.  Chances for employment and monetary gain are excellent. 
   Most Libra women are good prostitutes.  All Libras die of 
   venereal disease. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Scorpio (10/23 - 11/21)</FONT>  You are shrewd in business and cannot be 
   trusted.  You will achieve the pinnacle of success because of 
   your total lack of ethics.  Most Scorpios are murdered. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Sagittarius (11/22 - 12/21)</FONT>  You are optimistic and enthusiastic. 
   You have a reckless tendency to rely on luck, since you lack 
   talent.  The majority of Sagittarians are drunks or dopers. 
   People laugh at you a great deal. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3">Capricorn (12/22 - 1/19)</FONT>  You are conservative and afraid of taking 
   risks.  You don't do much of anything; you are lazy.  There has 
   never been a Capricorn of any importance.  Capricorns should avoid 
   standing still for too long, as they take root and become trees.
