A salesman for a new firm had had a very bad week.  Endless meetings in a
half dozen cities, no sales.  He was bummed and just wanted to relax on his
flight home from Kansas City.  Luckily, it looked like he had all three seats to
himself in his row and he gratefully closed his eyes awaiting take off.
<P>
At the last minute, another passenger plopped down beside him.  "Great, just
great" he thought to himself.  But then he opened his eyes and looked to see an
absolutely gorgeous woman, blonde, green eyes, maybe 5 foot 4 inch, nicely
built, well groomed and well dressed.  Hmm, he thought, maybe my luck is going
to change.  She also still had a nametag on from something.  So he turned to
her and said "Hi, Masra. Are you traveling alone?"
<P> 
She laughed and said "Oh, that's not my name.  I was the keynote speaker at a
convention today and forgot to take the silly thing off. It stands for Midwest
American Sexual Response Association."
 <P>
"Keynote, huh?  That sounds fascinating.  What was your address on?"
 <P>
"Well, I'm a licensed sex therapist and have been doing research on the
ability of the American male to please women.
 <P>
I've discovered that the American male, contrary to many people's uninformed
opinions, is actually quite a good lover.  However, there are three groups of
Americans that really stand out from the crowd as the best of all.
 <P>
One group are the Jewish men because they seem to be able to really
communicate with women on a sexual level.
 <P>
Another is the Native American, basically because as a group they are so well
built 'that way.'
 <P>
The third are the men from down South because of their extraordinary
ability to keep it up a long time.
 <P>
And by the way, my name's Wanda. What's yours?"
 <P>
"Hi Wanda.  I'm Tonto Weisenberg, but all my friends back home just call me
Bubba."
<P>
