 grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having left
 Cleveland at 6:36 pm traveling at 55 mph, the other from Topeka at 4:19
 pm at a speed of 35 mph.
<P>
 The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the period after the Dr. on a
 Dr Pepper can.
<P>
 They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that
 resembled Nancy Kerrigan's teeth.
<P>
 John and Mary had never met.  They were like two hummingbirds who
