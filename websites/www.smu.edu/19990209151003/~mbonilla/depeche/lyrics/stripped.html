<CENTER><H2>Stripped</H2></CENTER>

Come with me<BR>
Into the trees<BR>
We'll lay on the grass<BR>
And let the hours pass<BR>
<BR>
Take my hand<BR>
Come back to the land<BR>
Let's get away<BR>
Just for one day<BR>
<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
<BR>
Metropolis<BR>
Has nothing on this<BR>
You're breathing in fumes<BR>
I taste when we kiss<BR>
<BR>
Take my hand<BR>
Come back to the land <BR>
Where everything's ours<BR>
For a few hours<BR>
<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
<BR>
Let me hear you<BR>
Make decisions<BR>
Without your television<BR>
Let me hear you speaking<BR>
Just for me<BR>
<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
<BR>
Let me hear you speaking<BR>
Just for me<BR>
<BR>
Let me see you<BR>
Stripped down to the bone<BR>
<BR>
Let me hear you crying<BR>
Just for me<BR>
