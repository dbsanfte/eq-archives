15> Teacher enters room to the sound of the SNAP of a latex glove.  <BR>
  <BR>
14> You're naked, you can't find the room, you don't know the subject and pinching yourself is starting to leave welts.  <BR>

4> After wiping your sweaty brow with your palm, you are now the unwitting owner have of one very inky forehead.  <BR>
  <BR>
3> All your carefully written crib notes are now completely obscured due to last night's drunken Mehndi session.  <BR>
  <BR>
2> Getting "Breakfast at Tiffany's" out of your head by humming "The Girl from Ipanema" all morning *seemed* like a good idea at the time.<BR>
