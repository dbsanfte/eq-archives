1. Stick your open palm under the stall wall and ask your neighbor, "May I borrow a highlighter?"<BR>
<BR>
2. Say, "Uh oh, I knew I shouldn't have put my lips on that."<BR>
<BR>
3. Cheer and clap loudly every time somebody breaks the silence with a bodily function noise.<BR>
<BR>
4. Say, "Damn, this water's cold."<BR>
<BR>
5. Drop a marble and say, "Oh shit!  My glass eye!"<BR>
<BR>
6. Say, "Hmmm, I've never seen that color before."<BR>
<BR>
7. Grunt and strain real loud for 30 seconds and then drop a cantelope into the toilet bowl from a height of 6 feet.  Sigh relaxingly.<BR>
<BR>
8. Say, "Now how did that get there?"<BR>
<BR>
9. Say, "Humus.  Reminds me of humus."<BR>
<BR>
10. Fill up a large flask with Mountain Dew.  Squirt it erratically under the stall walls of your neighbors while yelling, "Whoa!  Easy boy!"<BR>
<BR>
11. Say, "Interesting... more floaters than sinkers."<BR>
<BR>
12. Using a small squeeze tube, spread peanut butter on a wad of toilet paper and drop the wad under the stall wall of your neighbor.  Then say, "Whoops, could you kick that back over here please?"<BR>
<BR>
13. Say, "C'mon Mr. Happy!  Don't fall asleep on me."<BR>
<BR>
14. Fill a balloon with creamed corn.  Rush into the stall with your hand over your mouth and let out a lengthy vomit impression while you squeeze the balloon and splatter cream corn all about.  Apologize profusely and blame it on the fettucine alfredo you had for breakfast.<BR>
<BR>
15. Say, "Boy, that sure looks like a maggot."<BR>
<BR>
16. Say, "Damn, I knew that drain hole was a little too small. Now what am I gonna do?"<BR>
<BR>
17. Play a well known drum cadence over and over again on your butt cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
18. Before you unroll toilet paper, conspicuously lay down your "Cross-Dressers Anonymous" newsletter on the floor visible to the adjacent stall.<BR>
<BR>
19. Lower a small mirror underneath the stall wall, adjust it so you can see your neighbor and say, "Peek-a-boo!"<BR>
<BR>
20. Drop a D-cup bra on the floor under the stall wall and sing "Born Free".<BR>
