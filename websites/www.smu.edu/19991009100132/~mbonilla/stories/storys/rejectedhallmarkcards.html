Happy Vasectomy!<BR>
Hope you feel zippy!<BR>
'Cause when I had mine<BR>
I got real snippy.<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
My tire was thumping<BR>
I thought it was flat<BR>
When I looked at the tire<BR>
I noticed your cat...Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
You had your bladder removed<BR>
And you're on the mends<BR>
Here's a bouquet of flowers<BR>
And a box of Depends.<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
Heard your wife left you<BR>
How upset you must be<BR>
But don't fret about it<BR>
She moved in with me.<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
Your computer is dead<BR>
It was once so alive<BR>
Don't you regret installing<BR>
Windows '95?<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
You totaled your car<BR>
And can't remember why<BR>
Could it have been<BR>
That case of Bud Dry?<BR>
