<P>
Having just finished with the Presendtial visit to UCSD and logging many
hours of overtime preparing for the visit, I thought it would be
appropriate to express to you all my feeling on Democracy.
<P>
To me, democracy means placing trust in the little guy, giving the  fruits
of nationhood to those who built the nation.   Democracy  means anyone can
grow up to be president, and anyone who doesn't grow up can be vice
president.
<P>
Democracy is people of all races, colors, and creeds united by a ingle
dream: to get rich and move to the suburbs away from people of all races,
colors, and creeds.
<P>
Democracy is having time set aside to worship<BR>
  -- 18 years if you're Jim Bakker.
<P>
Democracy is buying a big house you can't afford with money you don't
have to impress people you wish were dead.  And, unlike communism,
democracy does not mean having just one ineffective political party; it means having
two or more ineffective political parties.
<P>
Democracy means freedom of sexual choice between any two consenting
adults; Utopia means freedom of choice between three or more consenting adults.
But I digress.
<P>
Democracy is welcoming people from other lands, and giving them something
to hold onto -- usually a mop or a leaf blower.
<P>
It means that with proper timing and scrupulous bookkeeping, anyone can
die owing the government a huge amount of money.
<P>
Democracy means a thriving heartland with rolling fields of Alfalfa,
Buckwheat, Spanky and Wheezer.
<P>
Democracy means our elected officials bow to the will of the people, but
more often they bow to the big butts of campaign contributors.
<P>
Yes, democracy means fighting every day for what you deserve, and fighting
even harder to keep other weaker people from getting what they deserve.
<P>
Democracy means never having the Secret Police show up at your door. Of
course, it also means never having the cable guy show up at your door.
It's a tradeoff.
<P>
Democracy means free television, not good television, but free.
<P>
Democracy is being able to pick up the phone and, within a minute, be
talking to anyone in the country, and, within two minutes, be interrupted
by call waiting.
<P>
Democracy means no taxation without representation, and God knows, we've
just about had the hell represented out of us.
<P>
It means the freedom to bear arms so you can blow the "o" out of any rural
stop sign you want.
<P>
And finally, democracy is the eagle on the back of a dollar bill, with 13
arrows in one claw, 13 leaves on a branch, 13 tail feathers, and 13  stars
over its head -- this signifies that when the white man came  to this
country, it was bad luck for the Indians, bad luck for the  trees, bad luck
for the wildlife, and lights out for the American  eagle.
<P>
