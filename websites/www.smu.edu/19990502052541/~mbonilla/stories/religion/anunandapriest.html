A priest and nun are on their way back home from a convention when their car breaks down. They are unable to get repairs completed and it appears that they will have to spend the night in a motel. The only motel in this town has only one room available so they have a minor problem.<BR>
<BR>
PRIEST: Sister, I don't think the Lord would have a problem, under the circumstances, if we spent the night together in  this one room. I'll sleep on the couch and you take the bed.<BR>
<BR>
SISTER: I think that would be okay.<BR>
<BR>
They prepare for bed and each one takes their agreed place in the room. Ten minutes later...<BR>
<BR>
SISTER: Father, I'm terribly cold.<BR>
<BR>
PRIEST: Okay, I'll get up and get you a blanket from the closet.  Ten minutes later...<BR>
<BR>
SISTER: Father, I'm still terribly cold.<BR>
<BR>
PRIEST: Okay Sister, I'll get up and get you another blanket.<BR>
<BR>
Ten minutes later...<BR>
<BR>
SISTER: Father, I'm still terribly cold. I don't think the Lord would mind if we acted as man and wife just for this one night.<BR>
<BR>
PRIEST: You're probably right... Get up and get your own blanket.<BR>
