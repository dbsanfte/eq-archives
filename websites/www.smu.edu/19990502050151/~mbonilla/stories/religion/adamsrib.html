One day, after a near eternity in the Garden of Eden, Adam calls out to God,<BR>
<BR>
"Lord, I have a problem."<BR>
<BR>
"What's the problem, Adam?", God replies.<BR>
<BR>
"Lord, I know you created me and have provided for me and surrounded me with this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, but I'm just not happy."<BR>
<BR>
"Why is that, Adam?"  God replies.<BR>
<BR>
"Lord, I know you created this place for me, with all this lovely food and all of the beautiful animals, but I am lonely."<BR>
<BR>
"Well Adam, in that case I have the perfect solution.  I shall create a woman for you."<BR>
<BR>
"What's a woman, Lord.?"<BR>
<BR>
"This woman will be the most intelligent, sensitive, caring, and beautiful creature I have ever created.  She will be so intelligent that she can figure out what you want before you want it. She will be so sensitive and caring that she will know your every mood and how to make you  happy.  Her beauty will rival that of the heavens and earth. She will unquestioningly care for your every need and desire. She will be the perfect companion for you," replies the heavenly voice.<BR>
<BR>
"Sounds great."<BR>
<BR>
"She will be, but this is going to cost you , Adam."<BR>
<BR>
"How much will this woman cost me Lord?"<BR>
<BR>
"She'll cost you your right arm, your right leg, an eye, and an ear.<BR>
<BR>
Adam ponders this for some time, with a look of deep thought and concern on his face.  Finally Adam says to God, "Ehhh, what can I get for a rib?"<BR>
<BR>
The rest, as they say, is history.<BR>
