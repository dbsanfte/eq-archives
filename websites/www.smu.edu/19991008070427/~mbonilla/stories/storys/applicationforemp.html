EDUCATION:  Yes.<BR>
<BR>
LAST POSITION HELD:  Target for middle-management hostility.<BR>

My incredible collection of stolen pens and post-it notes.<BR>

<BR>
MAY WE CONTACT YOUR CURRENT EMPLOYER?: <BR>
 If I had one, would I be here?<BR>
<BR>
DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM LIFTING UP TO 50 LBS?:  <BR>

<BR>
DO YOU HAVE A CAR?:  <BR>

<BR>
DO YOU SMOKE?:  Only when set on fire.<BR>
