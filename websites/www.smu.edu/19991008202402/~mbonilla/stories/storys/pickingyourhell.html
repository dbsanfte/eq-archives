A man died and went to hell. Upon arrival he met with the Devil.<BR>
<BR>
Devil: We run things a bit differently nowadays, you get to pick your own personal hell.<BR>
<BR>
Man: That's not so bad, whatcha got?<BR>
<BR>
Devil: Well, I'm going to open a series of doors, look inside, assess the situation and then tell me if that's where you want to spend eternity.<BR>
<BR>
Man: OK.<BR>
<BR>
The devil opens the first door and there's a room of people standing on their heads on a hardwood floor.<BR>
<BR>
Man: Ouch, that seems painful. It's not for me, what's next.<BR>
<BR>
The devil opens the next door to reveal the same situation, only on concrete floors.<BR>
<BR>
Man: That looks worse, got anything left?<BR>
<BR>
The devil opens the third door to reveal a room full of people standing<BR>
<BR>
knee deep in shit drinking coffee.<BR>
<BR>
Man: Well, the shit smells but I could stand the smell and drink coffee all<BR>
<BR>
day. I'll take this one.<BR>
<BR>
Devil: Are you sure this is the one you want.<BR>
<BR>
Man: Absolutely!<BR>
<BR>
The devil then escorts him in the room shuts and locks the door. As soon as the door closes, a whistle blows and a loud speaker says: "Alright, coffee break is over, back on your heads."<BR>
