<P>
        Well, we had all these children out planting trees, see, because we
figured that...that as part of their education, to see how, you know, the
root systems...and also the sense of responsibility, taking care of things,
being individually responsible.  You know what I mean.  And the trees all
died. They were orange trees.  I don't know why they died, they just died.
Something wrong withe soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the
nursery wasn't the best.  We complained about it.  So we've got thirty kids
there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant, and we've got these
thirty dead trees.  All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it
was depressing.
<P>
        It wouldn't have been so bad except that just a couple of weeks
before the thing with the trees, the snakes all died.  But I think that the
snakes--well, the reason that the snakes kicked off was that...you remember,
the boiler was shut off for four days because of the strike, and that was
explicable.  It was something you could explain to the kids because of the
strike.  I mean, none of their parents would let them cross the picket line
and they knew there was a strike going on and what it meant.  So when things
got started up again and we found the snakes they weren't too disturbed.
<P>
        With the herb gardens it was probably a case of overwatering, and at
least now they know not to overwater.  The children were very conscientious
with the herb gardens and some of them probably...you know, slipped them a
little extra water when we weren't looking.  Or maybe...well, I don't like
to think about sabotage, although it did occur to us.  I mean, it was
something that crossed our minds.  We were thinking that way probably
because before that the gerbils had died, and the white mice had died, and
the salamander...well, now they know not to carry them around in plastic bags.
<P>
        Of course we expected the tropical fish to die, that was no
surprise.  Those numbers, you look at them crooked and they're belly-up on
the surface.  But the lesson plan called for tropical-fish input at that
point, there was nothing we could do, it happens every year, you just have
to hurry past it.
<P>
        We weren't even supposed to have a puppy.
<P>
        We weren't even supposed to have one, it was just a puppy the
Murdoch girl found under a Gristede's truck one day and she was afraid the
truck would run over it when the driver had finished making his delivery, so
she stuck it in her knapsack and brought it to school with her.  So we had
this puppy.  As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will
live for about two weeks and then...And that's what it did.  It wasn't
supposed to be in the classroom at all, there's some kind of regulation
about it, but you can't tell them they can't have a puppy when the puppy is
already there, right in front of them, running around on the floor and yap
yap yapping.  They named it Edgar--that is, they named it after me.  They
had a lot of fun running after it yelling, "Here, Edgar!  Nice Edgar!"  Then
they'd laugh like hell.  They enjoyed the ambiguity.  I enjoyed it myself.
I don't mind being kidded.  They made a little house for it in the supply
closet and all that.  I don't know what it died of.  Distemper, I guess.  It
probably hadn't had any shots.  I got it out of there before the kids got to
school.  I checked the supply closed each morning, routinely, because I knew
it was going to happen.  I gave it to the custodian.
<P>
        And then there was the Korean orphan that the class adopted through
the Help the Children program, all the kids brought in a quarter a month,
that was the idea.  It was an unfortunate thing, the kid's name was Kim and
maybe we adopted him too late or something.  The cause of death was not
stated in the letter we got, they suggested we adopt another child instead
and sent us some interesting case histories, but we didn't have the heart.
The class took it pretty hard, they began ( I think, nobody ever said
anything to me directly) to feel that maybe there was something wrong with
the school.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with the school,
particularly, I've seen better and I've seen worse.  It was just a run of
bad luck.  We had an extraordinary number of parents passing away, for
instance.  There were I think two heart attacks and two suicides, one
drowning, and four killed together in a car accident.  One stroke.  And we
had the usual heavy mortality rate among the grandparents, or maybe it was
heavier this year, it seemed so.  And the final tragedy.
<P>
        The tragedy occurred when Matthew Wein and Tony Mavrogordo were
playing over where they're excavating for the new federal office building.
There were all these big wooden beams stacked, you know, at the edge of the
excavation.  There's a court case coming out of that, the parents are
claiming that the beams were poorly stacked.  I don't know what's true and
what's not.  It's been a strange year.
<P>
        I forgot to mention Billy Brandt's father, who was knifed fatally
when he grappled with a masked intruder in his home.
<P>
        One day, we had a discussion in class.  They asked me, where did
they go?  The trees, the salamander, the tropical fish, Edgar, the poppas
and mommas, Matthew and Tony, where did they go? And I said, I don't know, I
don't know.  And they said who knows? and I said, nobody knows.  And they
said, is death that which gives meaning to life?  And I said, no, life is
that which gives meaning to life.  Then they said, but isn't death,
considered as a fundamental datum, the means by which the taken-for-granted
mundanity of the everyday may be transcended in the direction of--
<P>
        I said, yes, maybe.
<P>
        They said, we don't like it.
<P>
        I said, that's sound.
<P>
        They said, it's a bloody shame!
<P>
        I said, it is.
<P>
        They said, will you make love now with Helen (our teaching
assistant) so that we can see how it is done?  We know you like Helen.
<P>
        I do like Helen, but I said that I would not.
<P>
        We've heard so much about it, they said, but we've never seen it.
<P>
        I said I would be fired and that it was never, or almost never, done
as a demonstration.  Helen looked out of the window.
<P>
        They said, please, please make love with Helen, we require an
assertion of value, we are frightened.
<P>
        I said that they shouldn't be frightened (although I am often
frightened) and that there was value everywhere.  Helen came and embraced
me.  I kissed her a few times on the brow.  We held each other.  The
children were excited.  Then there was a knock on the door, I opened the
door, and the new gerbil walked in.  The children cheered wildly.
