<H1><CENTER>The Reason for Angels on top of the Christmas Tree</CENTER></H1>

It was suppose to be a happy time, but it wasn't.  Santa was really
pissed.  It was Christmas eve and NOTHING was going right.  Mrs. Claus
had burned all the Christmas cookies.  The Elves were bitching about not
getting paid for the overtime they had put in while making toys, and the
reindeer had been drinking all afternoon and were dead drunk. They had
taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the day and crashed it into a
tree, breaking off one of the runners.  Santa was beside himself with
anger. "I CAN"T believe it!  I've got to deliver millions of presents all
over the world in just a few hours from now and all my reindeer are
drunk, my Elves are on strike and I don't even have a Christmas tree!  I
sent that stupid Little Angel out HOURS a go to find a tree and he isn't
even back yet!  What am I going to do?"  Just then the Little Angel
opened the front door and stepped in from the snowy night, dragging a
Christmas tree.  He says: "Yo, Santa, where do you want me to stick the
Christmas Tree this year???"  ...And thus the tradition of Angels perched
atop the Christmas trees came to pass.
