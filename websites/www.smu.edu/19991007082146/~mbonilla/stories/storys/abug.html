Every night, Frank would go down to the liquor store, get
a six pack, bring it home, and drink it while he watched TV.
One night, as he finished his last beer, the doorbell rang.
He stumbled to the door and found a six-foot cockroach
standing there.  The bug grabbed him by the collar and threw
him across the room, then left.
<P>
The next night, after he finished his 4th beer, the
doorbell rang.  He walked slowly to the door and found the
same six-foot cockroach standing there.  The big bug punched
him in the stomach, then left.
<P>
The next night, after he finished his 1st beer, the
doorbell rang again.  The same six-foot cockroach was
standing there.  This time he was kneed in the groin and hit
behind the ear as he doubled over in pain.  Then the big bug
left.
<P>
The fourth night Frank didn't drink at all.  The doorbell
rang.  The cockroach was standing there.  The bug beat the
snot out of Frank and left him in a heap on the living room
floor.
<P>
The following day, Frank went to see his doctor.  He
explained events of the preceding four nights.  "What can I
do?" he pleaded.  "Not much" the doctor replied.  "There's
just a nasty bug going around."
<P>
