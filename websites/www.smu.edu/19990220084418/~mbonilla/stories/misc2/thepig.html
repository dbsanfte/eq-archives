 <BR>
 the pig serves as a useful test of the personality  traits of the drawer.<BR>
<BR>
 If the pig is drawn:<BR>
<BR>
 Toward the top of the paper, you are positive and optimistic. Toward the middle, you are a realist. Toward the bottom, you are pessimistic, and have a tendency to behave negatively.<BR>
<BR>
 Facing left, you believe in tradition, are friendly, and remember dates (birthdays, etc.) Facing right, you are innovative and active, but don't have a strong sense of family, nor do you remember dates.<BR>
<BR>
 Facing front (looking at you), you are direct, enjoy playing devil's advocate and neither fear nor avoid discussions.<BR>
<BR>
 With many details, you are analytical, cautious, and distrustful. With few details, you are emotional and naive, you care little for details and are a risk-taker.<BR>
<BR>
 With less than 4 legs showing, you are insecure or are living through  a period of major change. With 4 legs showing, you are secure, stubborn, and stick to your ideals.<BR>
<BR>
 The size of the ears indicates how good a listener you are.  The bigger the better.<BR>
<BR>
 The length of the tail indicates the quality of your sex life!!!! (And again more is better!)<BR>
