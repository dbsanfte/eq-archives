<CENTER><H2>Another Weight Loss Program</H2></CENTER>	
<P>
 Did you hear about the heavyset guy who had tried every diet in
the world in an attempt to lose weight? He tried the Scarsdale
diet, the Navy diet, Weight Watchers, and many more.  None worked.
One day, he was reading the Washington Post when he noticed a small
ad which read:
<P>
<CENTER>Lose weight<BR>
       Only $1.00 a pound<BR>
       Call (202) 208-0238</CENTER>
<P>
The man decided to give it a try and called the number.  A voice
on the other end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to
which the man responded, 'Ten pounds.'  The voice replied, 'Very
well, give me your credit card number and we'll have a
representative over to your house in the morning.'.
	<P>
About 9:00 am the next morning the man gets a knock on the door.
There stood a beautiful redheaded woman, completely naked except
for a sign around her neck stating, 'If you catch me, you can have
me'.
<P>
	  Well, the hefty fellow chased her upstairs, downstairs, over
sofas, through the kitchen, all around the house. Finally, panting
and wheezing like a dog, he did catch her.  When he was through
enjoying himself, she said, 'Quick, go into the bathroom and weigh
yourself!'. He did just that and was amazed to find that he had
lost ten pounds, right to the ounce!
<P>
   That evening he called the number again. The voice on the other
end asked, 'How much weight do you want to lose?', to which the
somewhat less overweight man replied, 'Twenty pounds.'.
<P>
   'Very well', the voice on the phone told him, 'Give me your
credit card number and we'll have a representative over to your
house in the morning.'
<P>
   At about 8:00 am the next morning the man receives a knock on
the door.  When he opens the door he sees a beautiful blond
dressed only in track shoes and a sign around her neck stating 'If
you catch me, you can have me'.  The chase took a good while longer
this time and the man nearly passed out, but he finally did catch
her.  When he was through she told him, 'Quick, run into the
bathroom and weigh yourself!' He ran to the bathroom and found he had lost
another 20 pounds!
<P>
'This is fantastic!', he thought to himself. Later that evening
he called the number again and the voice at the other end asked,
'How much weight do you want to lose?'. 'Fifty pounds!', the man
exclaimed. 'Fifty pounds?', the voice asked. 'That's an awful lot
of weight to lose at one time.'  The man replied, 'Listen buddy,
here's my credit card number, you just have your representative
over here in the morning!', and he hung up the phone.
<P>
About 6:00 am the next morning the man gets out of bed, splashes
on some cologne and gets all ready for the next representative.
At about 7:00 am he gets a knock on the door. When he opens the
door, he sees this large gorilla with a sign around his neck stating,
<P>
'If I catch you, I'm going to screw you'
