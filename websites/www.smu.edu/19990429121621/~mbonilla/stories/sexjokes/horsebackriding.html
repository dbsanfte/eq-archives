An attractive woman from New York was driving through a remote part of Texas when her car broke down.  An Indian on horseback came along and offered her a ride to a nearby town.  She climbed up behind him on the horse and they rode off.  The ride was uneventful except that every few minutes the Indian would let out a whoop so loud that it would echo from the surrounding hills.<BR>
<BR>
When they arrived in town, he let her off at the local service station, yelled one final, "Yahoo!" and rode off.<BR>
<BR>
"What did you do to get that Indian so excited?" asked the service station attendant.<BR>
<BR>
"Nothing. I merely sat behind him on the horse, put my arms  around his waist, and held onto his saddle horn so I wouldn't fall off."<BR>
<BR>
"Lady," the attendant said, "Indians ride bareback"<BR>
<P>
