A bunch of Indians capture a cowboy and bring him back to their camp to
meet the chief. The chief says to the cowboy, "You going to die. But we
feel sorry for you, so give you one wish a day for three days. On
sundown of the third day, you die. What is first wish?"  The cowboy
says, "I want to see my horse."  The Indians get his horse. The cowboy
grabs the horse's ear and whispers something, then slaps the horse on
the ass. The horse takes off.
<P>
Two hours later, the horse comes back with a naked blonde. She jumps off
the horse and goes into the teepee with the cowboy. The Indians look at
each other, figuring, "Typical white man- can only think of one thing."
The second day the chief says, "What is your wish today?" The cowboy
says, "I want to see my horse again." The Indians bring him his horse.
The cowboy leans over to his horse and whispers something in his
horse's ear, then slaps it on the ass.
<P>
Two hours later, the horse comes  back with a naked redhead. She gets
off, and goes into the teepee with the cowboy. The Indians shake their
heads, figuring, "Typical white man--going to die tomorrow--can only
think of one thing."
<P>
The last day comes, and the chief says, "This is your last wish white
man. What do you want?"  The cowboy says, "I want to see my horse
again."  The Indians bring him his horse. The cowboy grabs the horse by
both ears, twists them hard, and yells, "Read my lips! POSSE, damn it!
P-O-S-S-E!!"
