1. Could our relationship be more physical? I'm tired of just being friends.<BR>
2. Go ahead and leave the seat up. It's easier for me to douche that way anyway.<BR>
3. I think hairy butts are really sexy.  <BR>
4. Hey! Get a whiff of that one!<BR>
5. Let me cook tonight. I'm tired of going out to dinner.<BR>
6. Please don't throw that old T-shirt away. The holes in the armpits are just too cute.<BR>
7. This diamond is way too big!<BR>
8. I won't even put my lips on that thing unless I get to swallow.  <BR>
9. Does this outfit make my butt look too small?<BR>
10. I'm wrong. You must be right again.  <BR>
<BR>

3. I think hairy butts are really sexy.  <BR>
4. Her tits are just too big.<BR>
5. Sometimes I just want to be held.<BR>
6. That chick on Murder She Wrote gives me a woody.  <BR>
7. Sure! I'd love to wear a condom.<BR>
8. We haven't been to the mall for ages. Let's go shopping, and I can hold your purse.<BR>
9. Forget Monday Night Football. Let's watch Murphy Brown.<BR>
10. I think we are lost. I'd better pull over and ask for directions.  <BR>
