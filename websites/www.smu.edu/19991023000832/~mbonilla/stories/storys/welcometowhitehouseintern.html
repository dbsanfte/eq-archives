Greetings prospective White House interns!  This year, our program is heading into its 69th year of bringing America's  best and brightest to the Nation's Capitol to help the "Head Man" do his job.  We expect that 1998 will be the most exciting one yet!<BR>

* Get total access to plenty of sensitive Presidential activities!<BR>

Sound like it's for you?  Just listen to this testimonial from a former intern:<BR>

"I couldn't believe it!  After only a few months on the job answering phones and fetching coffee, there I was, debriefing the president. Getting involved in executive branch affairs is just fantastic."<BR>
