After applying some simple algebra to some trite phrases and
cliches, I've learned a new understanding can be reached of the secret to 
wealth and success.
<P>
Here it goes.
<P>
Knowledge is Power
Time is Money and as everyone knows, Power is Work divided by 
Time.
<P>
So, substituting algebraic equations for these time worn bits of 
wisdom, we get:<P>
<CENTER>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K = P<BR> 
&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T = M<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P = W/T<P>
</CENTER>
Now, do a few simple substitutions:
<P>
Put W/T in for P in equation (1), which yields:
<P>
<CENTER>K = W/T  (4)</CENTER>
<P>
Put M in for T into equation (4), which yields:
<P>
<CENTER>K = W/M  (5).</CENTER>
<P>
Now we've got something.  Expanding back into English, we get:
<P>
Knowledge equals Work divided by Money.
<P>
What this MEANS is that:
<P>
1. The More You Know, the More Work You Do, and<BR>
2. The More You Know, the Less Money You Make.<P>

Solving for Money, we get:
<P>
<CENTER>M = W/K  (6)</CENTER>
<P>
Money equals Work divided by Knowledge.
<P>
From equation (6) we see that Money approaches infinity as Knowledge approaches 0, regardless of the Work done.
<P>
What THIS MEANS is:
<P>
The More you Make, the Less you Know.
<P>
Solving for Work, we get
<P>
<CENTER>W = M x K  (7)</CENTER><P>

Work equals Money times Knowledge
<P>
From equation (7) we see that Work approaches 0 as Knowledge 
approaches 0.
<P>
What THIS MEANS is:
<P>
The stupid rich do little or no work.
<P>
Working out the socioeconomic implications of this breakthrough 
is left as an exercise for the reader
<P>
