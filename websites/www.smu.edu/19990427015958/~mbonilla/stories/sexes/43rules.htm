<P>

<P>
11. Trying to provoke a large, dangerous-looking felon from across the room is not funny.
<P>
12. Money does not equate love.  Not even in Nevada.
<P>
13. Any attempt by a man to prepare food, no matter how feeble (ie: Microwaving a burrito, fixing Spaghetti, etc) should be met with roughly the same degree of praise a parent might shower upon their infant when it walks for the first time.
<P>
14. Those male models with perfect bodies are all gay.  Accept it.
<P>

<P>
16. You know, YOU can ask HIM out too...  Let's spread the rejection around a little.
<P>

<P>
28. There is nothing inherently wrong with the word "cunt".
<P>
29. He is the funniest, strongest, best-looking, most successful man you have ever met.
<P>
30. And all your friends think so too.  Especially the cute ones.
<P>
31. Your (select appropriate item:) butt/boobs/hair/makeup/legs look fine. As a matter of fact, it/they look damn good.  Stop asking.
<P>

<P>
37. Yes, Sharon Stone/Pamela Anderson/Cindy Crawford  is prettier than you.  Just like Brad Pitt/Antonio Banderas/Keanu Reeves is better looking than him. But since neither one of you is going to be dating any of these people, love the one you're with.
