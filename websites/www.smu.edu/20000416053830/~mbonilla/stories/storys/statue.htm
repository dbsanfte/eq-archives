 There was this guy who worked as a stockbroker.  Being a stockbroker, he led a very tense kind of life.  So one day, he decided that enough is enough, I am going away to somewhere to relax.  So he visited all the travel agencies in his town, and decided on a trip to a really unpopulated island.
<P>
So off he went.  Upon reaching the island, he was overwhelmed by the beauty of the place.  He had also heard from the locals about this very beautiful lake located  nearby.  So after putting down his stuff, he decided to explore the island by himself, to see the lake for himself.  So he trekked across the terrain, armed with a towel and a cake of soap.  It was then that he saw the lake.  It indeed was most beautiful lake he had ever seen in his whole life.  He could not control his desire to go for a dip in the lake.  However, he also realized that he had forgot his trunks. 
Looking around, he then told himself that it would be rather safe to swim naked here, since there was no one around within 5 miles.
<P>
So off came his shorts, and into the water he went.  What a fantastic feeling!  He was so engrossed that he did not realize a group of young convent nuns approaching.  When he finally did realize, he had run out of time, so he jumped out of the water and pretended to be a statue.  Holding his towel on his right hand and the cake of soap on his left hand, he could only stay very still and pray that the nuns were just passing through.
<P>
As luck would have had it, the group of convent nuns were actually here to have their shower.  As they started to undress, the guy realized that some of them had the most wonderful figures the man had ever set his eyes on.  Naturally, he began to get a hard-on.
<P>
After swimming in the lake for a while, one of the nuns finally saw the 'statue' from afar.  So she ran towards it to take a closer look.  She saw a funny looking lever at the bottom, and started to tug at it.  The man started to squirm, and got weak in his right arm.  Poof, down came to towel.
<P>
 The nun ran back enthusiastically and exclaimed, "Hey look, PULL the lever and get a towel!"
<P>
So a second nun came along and tugged at the lever.  Again, the man started to squirm, and poof, down came the cake of soap.  So the second nun ran back enthusiastically and exclaimed, "Hey look, PULL the lever and get
a free cake of soap!"
<P>
A third nun then came along, and tugged at the "lever", hoping for some freebies.  By this time, the man was already on the verge of a climax, having been handled by two women.  The third nun continued to pull the lever
furiously, but without success.  Finally, she went back and told the earlier two nuns," I pulled the lever so many times, and all I got was some shampoo...".
