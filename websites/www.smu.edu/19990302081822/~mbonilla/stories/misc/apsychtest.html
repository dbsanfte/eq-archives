Answer questions honestly, but also respond with the FIRST thing that comes to your mind!

1.You are on a ship that is sinking.  You jump into the water and  come to a life raft.  As you are getting in, how many other people are there already in the raft?<BR>
<BR>
2. The raft takes you to an island on which a city is located. You have the choice to go straight to the city, go to a room and rest for only a little while, then get up and go to the city, or rest for as long as you want then go to the city.  What do you do?<BR>
<BR>
3.  When you get to the city you come upon a beautiful castle.  You are climbing a long elaborate staircase.  As you ascend you see someone out of the corner of your eye on their way back down.  You recognize them but on briefly.  Its someone you know or have known.  Who is it?<BR>
<BR>
4.  You are on the way to see the queen.  Describe 2 physical characteristics of the queen.<BR>
<BR>
5.  On the way you come to dining room with a long table, draped in white linins.  There is a silver chalice of wine on the table there for you.  Is it full, 1/2 full, or 3/4 full?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Answers interpreted: <BR>
<BR>
1. The number of people on the raft represents the number of true true friends that you feel you have in your life through thick or thin.<BR>
<BR>
2.  This answer represents your work ethic.  If you go straight to the city your work ethic is excessive, number one proirity.  If you rest as long as you want, your personal life comes way ahead.  Choice number two is somewhere in between.<BR>
<BR>
3.  The person you see represents someone you have cared for in your life that you have lost in some way.<BR>
<BR>
4.  The characteristics of the king/queen represent what your husband or wife will look like.<BR>
<BR>
5.  The amount of wine in your chalice is indicative of how much effort you are willing to give to a relationship.  Full being the most effort.<BR>
