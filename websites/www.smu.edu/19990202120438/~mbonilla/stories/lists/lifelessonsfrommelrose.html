Life Lessons from Melrose Place
</H2></CENTER>

1. If your "significant other" leaves town for more than a week,  sleep with whomever you want. After all, you can't be expected to wait around forever.<BR>
<BR>
2. Never sleep with your boss or coworker. Just kidding. You should do both, often.<BR>
<BR>
3. A good way to unwind after a hard day at the office is to build a fire, curl up with a good book, and rapidly drink seven large glasses of straight vodka.<BR>
<BR>
4. Every once in a while, just go ahead and slap somebody in the face, really hard.<BR>
<BR>
5. Pretend you're pregnant.<BR>
<BR>
6. Feeling a little insecure? Buy a gun!<BR>
<BR>
7. If marriage isn't working, consider a divorce. If divorce isn't convenient, fake your own death.<BR>
<BR>
8. Don't walk too fast when feigning blindness.<BR>
<BR>
9. Never base a relationship on lies and deceit. Just kidding! Dishonesty should be an integral part of any relationship.<BR>
<BR>
10. When you leave someone to die of carbon monoxide poisoning, be sure to shut the door tightly on your way out.<BR>
<BR>
11. Don't date drug dealers...unless they're really good-looking...or have a lot of money...or unless you can gain something from it in some way...or...oh hell, go ahead and date drug dealers.<BR>
<BR>
12. Don't get too close to people in comas. Sometimes they wake up and try to choke you.<BR>
<BR>
13. If you get fired, get drunk.<BR>
<BR>
14. Call your ex-wife "Baby."<BR>
<BR>
15. If you've got to fix your Harley, you might as well take off your shirt and do it by the pool.<BR>
<BR>
16. Randomly insult the people around you.<BR>
<BR>
17. Parents will be parents. Sometimes they'll nag. Sometimes they'll be judgmental. Sometimes they'll commit you to a miserable insane asylum where you'll be bound in a straightjacket and heavily sedated.<BR>
<BR>
18. If you lose your job, wait a few minutes and you'll get an even better job at twice the salary.<BR>
<BR>
19. A good way to aggravate your sister is to tell her that Mom liked you best. Another good way is to sleep with her husband a bunch of times.<BR>
<BR>
20. Just because you're in the midst of ruining someone's career doesn't mean that you can't carpool to work with them.<BR>
