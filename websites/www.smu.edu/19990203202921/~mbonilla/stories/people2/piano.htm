A slightly abridged (but otherwise unchanged) article by Kenneth 
Langbell, which appeared in the Bangkok Post on Saturday 27 May, 1967:
<P>
   The recital last evening in the Chamber Music Room of the Erawan 
Hotel by US pianist Myron Kropp can only be described by this reviewer 
as one of the most interesting experiences in a very long time.  Mr 
Kropp had chosen the title "An Evening with Bach"; the evening opened 
with the Toccata and Fugue in D minor.  As I have mentioned on several 
other occasions, the Baldwin concert grand needs constant attention; in 
this humidity the felts tend to swell, causing the occasional key to 
stick, which apparently was the case last evening with the D in the 
second octave.<P>
   Some who attended the performance later questioned whether the 
awkward key justified some of the language which was heard coming from 
the stage during softer passages of the fugue.  However, one member of 
the audience, who had sent his children out of the room by the midway 
point, commented that the workman who greased the stool might have 
done better to use some of the grease on the second octave D key. 
Indeed, Mr Kropp's stool had more than enough grease, and during one 
passage in which the music was particularly violent he was turned 
completely around.  Whereas before his remarks had been largely aimed 
at the piano and were therefore somewhat muted, to his surprise and 
that of those in the Chamber Music Room he found himself addressing 
himself directly to the audience.<P>
   By the time the audience had regained its composure, Mr Kropp 
appeared to be somewhat shaken. Nevertheless he swivelled himself back 
into position and, leaving the D major fugue unfinished, commenced on 
the Fantasia and Fugue in G minor. Why the G key in the third octave 
chose that particular time to begin sticking I hesitate to guess.  
However Mr Kropp himself did nothing to help matters when he began 
using his feet to kick the lower portion of the piano instead of 
operate the pedals.  Possibly it was this jarring, or the un-Bach-like 
hammering to which the sticking keyboard was being subjected: 
something caused the right front leg of the piano to buckle slightly 
forward, leaving the entire instrument listing at approximately a 
35-degree angle.  A gasp went up from the audience, for if the piano 
had actually fallen several of Mr Kropp's toes, if not both his feet, 
would surely have been broken.<P>
   It was with a sigh of relief, therefore, that the audience saw Mr 
Kropp slowly rise from his stool and leave the stage.  A few men in 
the back of the room began clapping, and when Mr Kropp reappeared a 
moment later it seemed he was responding to the ovation.  Apparently, 
however, he had left to get the red-handled fire axe which was hung 
backstage in case of fire, for when he returned that was what he had 
in his hand.<P>
   My first reaction at seeing Mr Kropp begin to chop at the left leg 
of the grand piano was that he was attempting to make it tilt at the 
same angle as the right leg.  However, when the weakened legs finally 
collapsed altogether with a great crash and Mr Kropp continued to 
chop, it became obvious to all that he had no intention of going on 
with the concert.<P>
   The ushers, who had heard the snapping of piano wires and 
splintering of sounding board from the dining room, came rushing in 
and, with the help of the hotel manager, two Indian watchmen and a 
passing police corporal, finally succeeded in disarming Mr Kropp and 
dragging him off the stage.
