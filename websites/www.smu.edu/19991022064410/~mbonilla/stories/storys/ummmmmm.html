I know I haven't known you for a very long time<BR>
And shouldn't be asking you for this so soon. =)~<BR>
But I need it very badly! <BR>
I haven't had it for a very long time.<BR>
I can already feel it going in good & hard<BR>
And coming out nice & soft.<BR>
If you would do this for me,<BR>
No one would ever know .<BR>
I am sure you can satisfy my needs,<BR>
And I'll be very grateful if you would .<BR>
I am very desperate and I need your help.<BR>
You must think by now I have alot of nerve,<BR>
But I can feel my tongue wrapping around it<BR>
And sucking out all the juice until it's very dry.<BR>
Mmmmmmmmmm <BR>
<BR>
It's been on my mind all day and I am not going to beat around the bush anymore ........<BR>
