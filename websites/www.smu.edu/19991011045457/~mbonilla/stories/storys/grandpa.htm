This little boy and his grandfather are fishing.  Granddad pulls out a beer
and the little boy says "Grandpa, can I have one of those?"  
<P>
Grandpa says "Is your penis big enough to touch your asshole?"  to which the
little boy responds "No." "Then you can't have one."
<P>
A while later, the granddad pulls out a cigar and the boy asks, "Can I have
on of those?"
<P>
Grandpa says "Is your penis big enough to touch your asshole?"  to which the
little boy responds "No." "Then you can't have one."
<P>
Later on, Grandpa and Grandson go to the grocery store for food and each buy
a lottery ticket.  Grandpa is unlucky, but the little boy says "I just won
$50,000"
<P>
Grandpa says, "Great, your going to split that with me, right?" 
<P>
The little boy asks, "Grandpa, is your penis long enough to touch your
asshole?"
<P>
"Yes," Says grandpa.
<P>
"Then go fuck yourself"
