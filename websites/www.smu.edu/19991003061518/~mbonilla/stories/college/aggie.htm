Two UT students and an aggie driving the Texas countryside when their car broke down.  Luckily, they were near a farmhouse, so they knocked on the door and asked the gruff old farmer if they could stay the night.  The farmer agreed, but only on one bizarre condition.  He told them to go out to the field, pick any fruit or vegetable they could find, and then return to the farmhouse.
<P>
Some time later, the two longhorns found themselves dead and in line at the pearly gates.  Saint Peter was there, listening to their tale.  
<P>
"OK", said Saint Peter, "You went out and found some fruits and vegetables.  How did you die?"
<P>
 "Well," continued one of the longhorns, "My friends here returned first with a cherry.  Then the farmer pointed his gun at him and commanded, 
<P>
"Stick that cherry up your ass, and if you laugh, I'll shoot you!"
<P>
"And?" Prompted Saint Peter.  
<P>
"He laughed and the farmer shot him"
<P>
"Why did you laugh?" Peter asked the second longhorn.
<P>
"It tickled,"  He said.
<P>
"Then it was my turn,"  continued the first longhorn. 
<P>
"I also brought a cherry, and the farmer pointed his gun at me and told me the same thing.  I laughed and the shot me."
<P>
"And why did you laugh?"  Saint Peter asked.
<P>
"I saw the Agie coming up the walkway with a watermelon."
