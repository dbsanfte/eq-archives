<P>
A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and, being told that there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races.<BR>
<BR>
However, at the local auction, the going price for horses was so steep  that the preacher ended up buying a donkey instead.  He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races.  To his surprise, the donkey came in third.  The next day the headlines read:
<P>
<center>"PREACHERS ASS SHOWS"</center>
<P>
The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the  races again.  This time he won!  The news read:
<P>
<center>"PREACHERS ASS OUT IN FRONT"</center>
<P>
The bishop of the church saw the headline and was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race.  The headlines read:     
<P>
<center>"BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHERS ASS"</center>
<P>
This was too much for the Bishop to take, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the animal.  The preacher decided to give it to a nun in
    a nearby convent.  The headlines read:
<P>
<center>"NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN"</center>
<P>
The Bishop fainted.  He informed the nun that she would have to dispose of the donkey - so she found a farmer who was willing to buy the animal for $10.00.  The headlines read:
<P>
<center>"NUN PEDDLES ASS FOR TEN BUCKS"</center>
<P>
They had to bury the Bishop the next day. The headlines read ...
<P>
<center>"NUN'S ASS KILLS BISHOP"</center>
