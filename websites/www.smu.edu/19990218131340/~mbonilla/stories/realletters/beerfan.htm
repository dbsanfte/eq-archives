The following is a letter sent to Miller Brewing Company earlier this
month. The originator reports he has not yet rec'd a response: 
<P>     
Miller Brewing Company<BR>
Milwaukee, Wisconsin  53201<P>

Dear Sir or Madam,
<P>
I have been a drinker of Miller beer's for many years actually,ever
since that other company donated a big chunk of change to Handgun
Control Inc. back in the mid 80's.  Initially, my beer of choice was
Lite, but sometime in mid 1990 while in Honduras I switched to MGD
smuggled up from Panama.
<P>
Now, for nearly six years, I have been a faithful drinker of MGD.
For these past years, I have come to expect certain things from
Genuine Draft. I expect that whenever I see that gold can of MGD, I am
about ready to enjoy a great, smooth brew. But wait!  Sometime around
the first of the year, my beloved MGD changed colors, so to speak.
That familiar gold can was no longer gold!
<P>
Knowing that I am by nature somewhat resistant to change, I forced
myself to reserve judgment on the new can design.  Gradually, I
grew to appreciate the new label. That was until about May of this year.
That was when I discovered (empirically) that I really didn't like the
new design. Further investigation of the cause of my distress resulted
in the following observations:
<P>
1. Your cans are made of aluminum.<BR>
2. Aluminum is a great conductor of energy.<BR>
3. Your beer is commonly consumed outside, and thus, the container may
   be exposed to sunlight.<BR>
4. Sunlight striking the can causes radiant warming of the surface of
the can.<BR>
5. The resultant heat (energy) is transferred through the aluminum, by
   conduction, to the contents of the can (the beer).<BR>
6. Warm beer sucks.
<P>
This is a process that can be observed in just about any beer.
However, this process is significantly accelerated in MGD because you
painted the damn can black!!! 
<P>
Who was the rocket scientist that designed the new graphic for the
can and implemented the change right before summer?  Granted, this
process
may not be real evident up there in Wisconsin, but down here in
Oklahoma where the summers are both sunny and hot, this effect is
quite a problem. There's no telling what the folks in Texas and
Arizona are having to put up with.
<P>
Knowing that you would probably not address this issue unless you
had firm evidence of a problem, I and several other subjects conducted
extensive experimentation.  The results of these experiments are listed
below.
<P>
The experiments were conducted over two days on the deck next to
my pool. The study included seven different types of beer (leftovers
from a party the previous weekend) that were initially chilled to 38 F
and then left exposed to sunlight for different lengths of time.
These beers were sampled by the test subjects at different intervals.
The subjects, all normally MGD drinkers, were asked at each sampling
interval their impressions of the different beers.
The length of time between the initial exposure to sunlight and
the point where the subject determined the sample undrinkable (the
Suckpoint) was determined.  The average ambient temperature for
the trials was 95 degrees F.

<P>

It was evident that the color of the can directly correlates to the
average suckpoint, except for Coors which was pretty much
determined to suck at any point.
<P>
It is to be hoped that  you will consider re-designing your MGD cans.
All beer drinkers that are not smart enough to keep their beer in the
shade will thank you.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bradley Lee
