A personal guide to what men should say when caught looking at another woman by their wife or girlfriend.<BR>
<BR>
1.  I can't believe that outfit she is wearing.  (Said disdainfully)  <BR>
<BR>
2.  Look at that guy... over there... behind the woman.  <BR>
<BR>
3.  I think that's a man dressed as a woman.   (Incredulous)  <BR>
<BR>
4   Isn't that the actress from the movie Delicatessen?  (Chances are she hasn't seen that movie- and neither have you, but you will get brownie points naming a foreign film, and it will be just obtuse enough to distract her.<BR>
<BR>
5.  I think that's the girl I knew from high school who eventually joined a convent (or was committed to an asylum) and turned out to be a real nut case.<BR>
<BR>
6.  Help me, I got something in my eye... can't see a thing!  <BR>
<BR>
7.  I was staring off into space because I was about to have an epiphany about the direction of my life and the nature of my love for you, but its gone now, thank you very much!<BR>
<BR>
8.  Hey that's the loser I dumped in order to go out with you. Boy am I glad I ever got away from her.  What a moron.<BR>
<BR>
9.  I know you're probably thinking I was staring at a beautiful woman, but to me she is like one of those fancy bakery cakes that looks good, but then you have a bite and it is so sweet that it makes you sick. She makes me sick. (It helps if you convulse a little at the end here.. maybe it will camouflage your drool).  <BR>
<BR>
10. I was just thinking how I felt sorry for her - since she can never hold a candle to you (this one might only get you punched, but its worth a try).<BR>
<BR>
11. Do you think she's prettier than me? (Give her a taste of her own medicine)<BR>
