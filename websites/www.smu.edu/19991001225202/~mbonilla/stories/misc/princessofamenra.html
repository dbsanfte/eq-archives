This claims to be a true story...<BR>
<BR>
Of all tales of the supernatural, this one is perhaps the best documented, the most disturbing and the most difficult to explain .......<BR>
<BR>
The Princess of Amen-Ra lived some 1,500 years before Christ .  When she died, she was laid in an ornate wooden coffin and buried deep in a vault at Luxor, on the banks of the Nile.<BR>
<BR>
In the late 1890s, four rich young Englishmen visiting the excavations at Luxor were invited to buy an exquisitely fashioned mummy case containing the remains of Princess of Amen-Ra.<BR>
<BR>
They drew lots.  The man who won paid several thousand pounds and had the coffin taken to his hotel.  A few hours later, he was seen walking out towards the desert.  He never returned. The next day, one of the remaining three men was shot by an Egyptian servant accidentally.  His arm was so severely wounded it had to be amputated. The third man in the foursome found on his return home that the bank holding his entire savings had failed.  The fourth guy suffered a severe illness, lost his job and was reduced to selling matches in the street.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the coffin reached England (causing other misfortunes along the way), where it was bought by a London businessman. After three of his family members had been injured in a road accident and his house damaged by fire, the businessman donated it to the British Museum. As the coffin was being unloaded from a truck in the museum courtyard, the truck suddenly went into reverse and trapped a passer-by.  Then as the casket was being lifted up the stairs by two workmen, one fell and broke his leg.  The other, apparently in perfect health, died unaccountably two days later. Once the Princess was installed in the Egyptian Room, the trouble really started.  The museum's night watchmen frequently heard frantic hammering and sobbing from the coffin.  Other exhibits in the room were also often hurled about at night.  One watchman died on duty, causing the other watchmen to want quit.  Cleaners refused to go near the Princess too. When a visitor derisively flicked a dustcloth at the face painted on the coffin, his child died of measles soon afterwards. Finally, the authorities had the mummy carried down to the basement, figuring it could not do any harm down there.  Within a week, one of the helpers was seriously ill, and the supervisor of the move was found dead on his desk.<BR>
<BR>
By now, the papers had heard of it.  A journalist photographer took a picture of the mummy case and whe he developed it, the painting on the coffin was of a horrifying, human face.  The photographer was said to have gone home, locked his bedroom door, and shot himself.<BR>
<BR>
Soon afterwards, the museum sold the mummy to a private collector.  After continual misfortune (and deaths), the owner banished it to the attic. A well known authority on the occult, Madame Helena Blavatsky, visited the premises.  Upon entry, she was seized with a shivering fit and searched the house for the source of "an evil influence of incredible intensity"  <BR>
<BR>
She finally came to the attic and found the mummy case. "Can you exorcise this evil spirit?" asked the owner . "There is no such thing as exorcism.  Evil remains evil forever.  Nothing can be done about it.  I implore you to get rid of this evil as soon as possible ." But no British museum would take the mummy; the fact that almost twenty people had met with misfortune, disaster or death from handling the casket, in barely ten years, was now well known.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, a hard-headed American archaeologist (who dismissed the happenings as quirks of circumstance), paid a handsome price for the mummy and arranged for its removal to New York .  In April 1912, the new owner escorted its treasure aboard a sparkling, new White Star liner about to make its maiden voyage to New York.<BR>
<BR>
On the night of April 14, amid scenes of unprecedented horror, the Princess of Amen-Ra accompanied 1,500 passengers to their deaths at the bottom of the Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The name of the ship was Titanic.<BR>
