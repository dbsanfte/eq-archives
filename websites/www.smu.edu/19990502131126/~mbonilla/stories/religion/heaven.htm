<BR><BR>
Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day.  Apparently it
had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one,
"Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit
only people who have had particularly horrible deaths.  So what's your
story?"
<BR><BR>
So the first man replies: "Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been
cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch herred-handed.
 As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong,
but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have
been hiding.Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was
this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground!By now I was really
mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it,
he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a
hammer and starting hammering on his fingers.Of course, he couldn't stand
that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell
into the bushes, stunned but okay.I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into
the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed
on him, killing him instantly.  But all the stress and anger got to me, and
I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony."  "That sounds like a
pretty bad day to me," said Peter, and let the man in.
<BR><BR>
The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full,
and again asks for his story.
<BR><BR>
"It's been a very strange day.You see, I live on the 26th floor of my
apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my
balcony.Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell
over the edge.  But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on
the floor below me.  I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly
this man burst out onto the balcony.  I thought for sure I was saved, when
he started beating on me and kicking me.  I held on the best I could until
he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my
hands.  Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the
bushes below, stunned but all right.  Just when I was thinking I was going
to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me
instantly, and now I'm here."
<BR><BR>
Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible
death.
<BR><BR>
The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was
repeated.  Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story.
<BR><BR>
"Picture this," says the third man, "I'm hiding naked inside a
refrigerator..."
