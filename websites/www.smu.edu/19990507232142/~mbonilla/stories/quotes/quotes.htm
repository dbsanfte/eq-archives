When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon,
he not only gave his famous "One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for
Mankind" statement, but followed it by several remarks - usual com
traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control.  Before
he re-entered the lander, he made the enigmatic remark "Good luck, Mr.
Gorsky."
<P>
Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some
rival Soviet Cosmonaut; however, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in
either the Russian nor American space programs.
<P>
Over the years, many people have questioned him as to what the "Good
luck, Mr. Gorsky" statement meant.  On July 5, in Tampa Bay, FL, while
answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26
year old question to Armstrong.  He finally responded.  It seems that
Mr.  Gorsky had died and so Armstrong felt he could answer the
question.  When he was a kid, Neil was playing baseball with his
brother in the backyard. His brother hit a fly ball which landed in
front of his neighbors' bedroom window.  The neighbors were Mr and
Mrs.  Gorksy.  As he leaned down to pick up the ball, he heard Mrs.
Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, "Oral sex?  Oral sex you want?  You'll
get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!"<BR>

Here is a true story someone found regarding exams at Cambridge University.
It seems that during an examination one day a bright young student popped
up and asked the proctor to bring him Cakes and Ale.  The following
dialog ensued:
<P>
 Proctor: I beg your pardon?
<P>
 Student: Sir, I request that you bring me Cakes and Ale.
<P>
 Proctor: Sorry, no.
<P>
 Student: Sir, I really must insist.  I request and require that you
          bring me Cakes and Ale.
<P>
At this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old
Laws of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and
pointed to the section which read (rough translation from the Latin):
<P>
"Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale".
<P>
Pepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student
sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.
Three weeks later the student was fined five pounds for not wearing a
sword to the examination.
