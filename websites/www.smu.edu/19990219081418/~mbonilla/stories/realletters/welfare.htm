<H1><CENTER>Letters to the Welfare Department</CENTER></H1>

The following are taken from actual letters received by the Welfare Department in applications for support (no bull shit)
<P>
1.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and 6 children.  I had seven but one died which was baptised on a half sheet of paper.
<P>
2.  I am writing the welfare department to say that my baby was born two years old. When do I get my money?
<P>
3.  Mrs. Jones has not had any clothes for two years and has been visited regularly by the clergy.
<P>
4.  I cannot get sick pay. I have six children can you tell me why?
<P>
5.  I am glad to report that my husband who is missing is dead.
<P>
6.  This is my eighth child. What are you going to do about it.
<P>
7.  Please find for certain if my husband is dead. The man I am now living with can't do anything until he knows.
<P>
8.  I am very much annoyed to find out that you have branded my son illiterate. This is a dirty lie as I was married a week before he was born.
<P>
9.  In answer to your letter, I have given birth to a son weighing 10 lbs. I hope this is satisfactory.
<P>
10.  I am forwarding my marriage certificate and my 3 children one of which is a mistake as you can see.
<P>
11.  My husband got his project cut off about two weeks ago and I haven't had any relief since.
<P>
12.  Unless I get my husband's money pretty soon, I will be forced to lead an immortal life.
<P>
13.  You have my changed little boy to a girl, will this make any difference?
<P>
14.  I have no children yet, as my husband is a truck driver and works night and day.
<P>
15.  I want money as quick as I can get it. I have been in bed with the doctor for two weeks and he doesn't do me any good. If things don't improve, I will have to send for another doctor.
<P>
16.  In accordance with your instructions, I have given birth to twins in the enclosed envelope.
<P>
