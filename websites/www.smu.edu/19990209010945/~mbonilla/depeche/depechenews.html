May 22, 1998 ~~ DM is going on tour in the Fall!!!!  It's going to a four month tour starting in Europe.  They should make it to the states in November and December. 
<P>
Feb 13, 1998 ~~ Word is that DM will release a greatest hits record in the summer or fall.  It will include singles from 1986-1997.  There will also be a few new songs on it! woohoo! : )
<P>
Oct 27, 1997 ~~ Useless was released this week in Europe.  Lots of remixes and it includes videos of Barrel of a Gun and It's No Good.  The US release will be out shortly and will include Home and Useless mixes.  And it will have the videos to all 4 singles. woohoo! : )
<P>
Sept 10, 1997 ~~ The next single will be Useless.  Due out in Europe on Oct 6.  No word on an American release date though.  Should be soon after that though.  The band got together on Aug. 29 in Wales to film the video for Useless. Can't wait to see it!  It seems that Home won't be released here in the US though.  Too bad, now I have to go grab those imports!  
<P>
June 16, 1997 ~~ Home was released in the UK.  No word on the US release though.  And also today I found out that I won the Reprise contest and got the U.S. promo It's No Good with the Club 69 mixes on them : )
<p>
May 15, 1997 ~~ The Band played on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  It was very cool.  And also they played a small release party in L.A. the night after.
<p>
April 15, 1997 ~~ The New Record Ultra was released today! Their first record in 4 years.  The record is wonderful, it sounds more like older depeche mode, more synth based.  The record has a nice slow pace to it.  My favorite tracks are Useless, Home, and It's No Good.  But I still like all the rest, I haven't found a track I don't like! : )
