Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.<BR>
<BR>
Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure ecstasy.<BR>
<BR>
When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.<BR>
<BR>
When it's in your best interest, practice obedience.<BR>
<BR>
Let others know when they've invaded your territory.<BR>
<BR>
Take naps and stretch before rising.<BR>
<BR>
Run, romp and play daily.<BR>
<BR>
Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.<BR>
<BR>
Be loyal.<BR>
<BR>
Never pretend to be something you're not.<BR>
<BR>
If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.<BR>
<BR>
When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by and nuzzle them gently.<BR>
<BR>
Thrive on attention and let people touch you.<BR>
<BR>
Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.<BR>
<BR>
On hot days, drink lots of water and lay under a shady tree.<BR>
<BR>
When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.<BR>
<BR>
No matter how often you're scolded, don't buy into the guilt thing and pout...run right back and make friends.<BR>
<BR>
Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.<BR>
