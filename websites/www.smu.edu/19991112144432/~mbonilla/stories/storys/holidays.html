  Don't ya just love the holidays, when everyone is just so full of
the spirit of the season and joy and good will towards men ?  As a
plain old country boy now living in the big city, I wanted to share
the warmth and joy I felt with all these nice city folk.
<P>
  The other day I went to the local religious book store, to locate
something to share with others, and while I couldn't find any with a
Christmas theme, I saw a "Honk if You Love Jesus" bumper sticker.  I
bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car; tell yall what,
I'm really glad I did.  What an uplifting experience followed.
<P>
  I was stopped at a light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought
about the upcoming Holidays and all, and didn't notice that the light
had changed.  That bumper sticker really worked!  I easily found several
people who loved Jesus.  Why, the guy behind me started to honk like
crazy.  He must really love the Lord because, he leaned out his window
and even yelled, "Jesus Christ!!" as loud as he could.
<P>
  Others started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and
smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from
Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a
sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle
finger stuck up in the air.
<P>
  Luckily, I had just asked my two kids just the other week what that
meant.  They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, and told me that
it was the Hawaiian good luck sign.  I leaned out the window and gave
him the good luck sign back.  What a joy to share.
<P>
  Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and
yelled something.  I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like,
"Mother trucker."  How nice that that industry is finally accepting
women drivers and all.  What joyful times we live in.
<P> 
  Then I noticed that the light had changed, and stepped on the gas.
And a good thing I did, because I was the only one to get across the
intersection.  I looked back at them, leaned way out the window, gave
them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign, as I drove
away.  Praise the Lord.  I drove on, my faith renewed for being able
to share my Holiday joy with such wonderful folks.
<P> 
  Tell ya what yall.  Until all this happened, I thought that "City
of "Brotherly Love" stuff was just that -- stuff !  May you all find
ways to share and express the spirit of the season just like I did.
<P>
