A 7 yr. old and his 4 yr. old brother are upstairs in their bedroom. The 7 yr. old is explaining that it is high tme that the two of them begin swearing.  When his little brother responds enthusiastically, the 7 yr. old says, "when we go downstairs for breakfast this morning, I'll say "hell" and you say "ass". The 4 yr. old happily agrees.
<P>
As the two boys are seating themselves at the breakfast table, their mother walks in and asks her older son what he would like to eat for breakfast. The 7 yr. old replies, "Aw hell Mom, I'll just have Cheerios,WHACK!  The surprised mother reacts quickly. The boy runs upstairs, bawling and rubbing his behind.
<P>
With a sterner note in her voice, the mother then asks the younger son,"And what would YOU like for breakfast"?  "I don't know," the 4 yr. old blubbers,"but you can bet your ass it's not gonna be Cheerios"!!!!!
<P>
