This woman walked into a pet store one day & asked the clerk if he had any Parrots...<BR>
<BR>
"Yes" he replied, then leading her to the parrots he said "I have this one here - he's an adolescent & he has NO vocabulary yet... his price is $300.00 -- I also have this young adult here (pointing at next parrot) he's a young adult, with quite an extensive vocabulary... his price is $25.00..."<BR>
<BR>
The woman asks the clerk "That's quite a price difference... why?"<BR>
<BR>
The clerk replies "Well maam, this young adult used to be a mascot in a brothel before it was busted, & most of his language is pretty crude, so most people don't want him because he might offend someone"<BR>
<BR>
The woman says "the reason I ask is I'm buying a present for my husband for his birthday - & he's *always* wanted a talking parrot. I don't have a problem with crude language, & I'd rather spend $25.00 than $300.00, so I'll take the $25.00 parrot."<BR>
<BR>
The clerk takes the parrot & cage to the checkout counter & rings it up, after the woman pays him & starts to leave he tells her "By the way, if you want the parrot to be quiet, because of guests or whatever, just put a cover over the cage & the parrot will go to sleep..."<BR>
<BR>
"Thanks" says the woman & she leaves... when she arrives home she places the birdcage on an end table, then she calls her bridge-buddies up & invites them over for a few games of bridge.  Then, remembering what the clerk said, she places a cover over the cage.<BR>
<BR>
A few hours later, she & her buddies are there playing bridge, smoking, drinking, cracking a few jokes, etc. When her husband George comes home from work.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as he walks in she says "Hi honey! Happy Birthday!" and she points to the covered birdcage... "OH-BOY!" says George, & he walks over to the cage & pulls the cover off...<BR>
<BR>
The Parrot wakes up, pulls it's head out from under it's wing, looks around, then whistles & says "New House..." then eyeballing the card players it says "New Girls..." then it looks at him and says "Same `ole George... Hello George!" <BR>
