<H3>Q:  Why did the Chicken cross the road?</H3>

<H3>Anderson Consultant:</H3>

Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening
its dominant market position. The chicken was faced with
significant challenges to create and develop the competencies
required for the newly competitive market.  Andersen
Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client,
helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution
strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
Integration Model (PIM) Andersen helped the chicken use its
skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to
align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support
of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.
Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road
analysts and best chickens along with Andersen consultants with
deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a
two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their
personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to
enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve
the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting
and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the
continuum of poultry cross-median processes.  The meeting was
held in a park like setting enabling and creating an impactful
environment which was strategically based, industry-focused,
and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message
and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core
values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total
business integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the
chicken change to become more successful.
