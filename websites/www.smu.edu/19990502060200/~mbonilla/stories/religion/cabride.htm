<CENTER><H3>A Nun In A Cab</H3></CENTER>

A nun gets into a cab in New York.  She demurely says in a small,high,voice, 
"Could you please take me to Times Square?" In a thick Brooklyn accent the 
cabbie initiates conversation, "Hey sista, that's kinda a long drive?  You
mind if we, like,  chat? The nun says, "Why no my son, whatever is on your mind?" 
The cabbie, "About dis celibacy thing.  Are you telling me you never think 
about doin' it? The nun, "Why certainly, my son, the thought has crossed my 
mind a time or two.  I am of weak human flesh you understand." The cabbie, 
"Well, woulda ever consider, you know, doin' it?" The nun, "Well, I suppose 
under certain conditions, in a very unique circumstance, I might consider it.
<BR><BR>
The cabbie, "Well what would dose conditions happen to be?" The nun, "Well, 
he'd have to be Catholic, unmarried and well, certainly he could have no 
children." The cabbie, "Well, sista, today is your lucky day.  I am all
three. Why do youse come on up here...I won't even make you really break your vows. 
All you gotta do is go down on me." The nun looks around....they are awfully 
far away from where anyone would recognize her....at the next light she gets 
into the front with the driver.  By the next light, the nun is getting back 
into the rear of the cab, and the cabbie is smiling from ear to ear. As she 
settles in, the nun hears the cabbie begin to laugh. The nun inquires, "Why,
my son, what is so humorous?" The cabbie sneers, "Sista, I got ya.  I'm 
Protestant, I'm married, and I got four kids. And from the back of the cab 
comes the nun's low voiced response, "Yeah, well my name's Dave and I'm on my
Way to a costume party." <BR><BR>
