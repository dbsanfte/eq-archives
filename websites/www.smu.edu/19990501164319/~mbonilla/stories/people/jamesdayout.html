Austin in a nutshell:<BR>
Got plastered Friday night. James A and I told friends to meet us at Club  Paradise at 2am. They went to Club Paradox. 6th street was loud.  My Ex something or other took us home after we waited for 45 minutes in front of the wrong club. I'm lit. She's lit. James A is pissed.  We go back to the house we were going to stay at and there's no body there. We go to our hotel and and crash. Three drunkards. SAT. James told a bunch of his friends that we would go to New Braunfels and attend some Wurstfest(like octoberfest).  We got in at 3:30, to sleep at 4:30  woke up at 8:30. James A is in a hurry. I don't want to go to Wurstfest. I want to see some of my friends. He is in to big a hurry. I'm getting pissed He knows it. I try unsuccessfully to get in touch with my friends and concede to travel 45 minutes to some fucking german festival. That's were the fun starts.<BR>
<BR>
We drive through the quaint town of New Braunfels and there's a Hotel Named after me. Faust Inn. Real pretty place. We get in it looks like crap up front. We go deeper into the festival and man a fucking party explodes.  I have no clue this is going to get better. Immediately we go get beer. I'm still hungover. There's sausage on a stick, Wurst on a stick, Turkey on a stick, Turkey Legs, Krout, applesauce Liederhose, Polka, Dancing, the fucking works. We go fucking Crazy. The friends James A knew were Kool(i knew one from Tech) but their friends were the bomb. We had a blast staying away from everyone else. Brenda, Heather and Allen. We drank two pitchers of beer to every one of James A and his friends.<BR>
<BR>
Did I mention there were rides. Here's the funny part then I'll let you go. James A wants to ride all these fucking rides Ferris wheels, Giant Spinning bears, the Orbitron, The Gravitron and other nefarious amusements. We buy tickets for the Orbitron and the Gravitron. The Gravitron is like the Octopus. It has these tenticles. On each tentacle is a set of three cars. These cars seat two per car. The machine goes in the air and spins. 30-45 ft in the air. James and I get on. We sit in separate cars. There's no seat belt. I converse with the little girl in the car next to me. She says she's stealing the boyfriend of the older girl in front of me. All is joyous. Then the ride starts. First time around, "Whoa this is great!" Second time around. I can hear James having a good time. I yell at our friends on the ground below. 4th and 5th time. The fun stops. The death machine gets going faster and Higher. The cars are spinning clockwise at a vertical angle as the entire machine is spinning flat. I look over at James. He has his head buried in his chest. He hold on for dear life. Remember, there is no seat belt to restrain us. Just a bar that locks down. I"m slipping under the bar. The attendant is laughing. Punk Kid I scream. I start to yell Jesus, Jesus...repeatedly. The little girl repeatedly ask me to stop. "Stop saying that, stop saying that". My reply: "SHUT UP LITTLE GIRL!"  Abruptly the ride stops. We spin to the ground. The attendant(punk kid) runs over to me and says he had to stop the ride because a kid was getting sick. NO shit i replied. James a stumbles off the platform. I get a dirty look from the little girl. I mumble."you have your whole life you little wench".  She runs away.  She was about 11 or 12. James A is Sickly on a bench surrounded by his friends.  They laugh. I'm spinning. I want to kill the ride. James wants to go. We walk back into the food place. James sits. He's green. I want more food. James A is ready to puke. We pick him up and take him to a riverwalk(lovely place). He rest in the green. We decide to head back to Austin. I'm driving this time. James is way sick.<BR>
