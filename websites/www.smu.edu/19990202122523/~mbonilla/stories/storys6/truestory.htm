Karen, a Midwestern housewife, took her first trip to Las Vegas last year.
She had done very well playing the slot machines, winning a bucket full of
quarters.  Karen needed a break and she left the casino heading toward the
elevators, taking her bucket with her.
<P>
She steps into the elevator and before the doors shut, four beefy,
leather-clad African-American men step in.  Karen (never having spent much
time with African Americans) clutches her bucket close to her chest.
<P>
One of the men says, "Hit the floor, lady," and she does: quarters fly
everywhere.  The men bust up laughing and they help Karen collect her
winnings.  One of the men explains that he meant for her to select her
floor.  They help her collect her quarters and the elevator arrives at her
floor.  She leaves embarrassed, and the men are still laughing.
<P>
Later that evening, a dozen roses are delivered to Karen's room. There is a
one hundred dollar bill attached to each rose.  The note attached read:
"Thank you for the best laugh I've had in years! Eddie Murphy."
