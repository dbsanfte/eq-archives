<H2><CENTER>The 5 Toughest Questions Women Ask and Thier Answers.</CENTER></H2>

1.  What are you thinking? <BR>
2.  Do you love me? <BR>
3.  Do I look fat? <BR>
4.  do you think she is prettier than me? <BR>
5.  What would you do if I died? <BR>
<P>
What makes these questions so bad is that every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument and/or divorce if the man does no t answer properly, which is to say dishonestly.<BR>
<P>
For example:<BR>
<P>
1.  What are you thinking?<BR>
<P>
<EM>The proper answer to this question, of course, is "I'm sorry if I've been pensive dear, I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, caring, thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful woman you are and what a lucky guy I am to have met you."  Obviously this statement bears no resemblance whatsoever to what the guy was really thinking at the time, which was most likely one of five things:</EM><BR>
<P>
a.  Baseball <BR>
b.  Football <BR>
c.  how fat you are. <BR>
d.  how much prettier she is than you. <BR>
e.  how to spend the insurance money if you die. <BR>
<P>
<EM>The best answer to this stupid question came from Al Bundy, of Married With Children, who when asked by his wife, Peggy, replied: "If I wanted you to know, i'd be talking instead of thinking."</EM><BR>
<P>
The other questions have only one right answer but many wrong answers.<BR>
<P><HR>
2.  Do you love me?  <BR>
<P>
<EM>The correct answer is "Yes"  For those guys who feel the need to be more elaborate, you may answer, "yes dear."  Wrong answers includ</EM>e<BR>
<P>
a.  I suppose so. <BR>
b.  Would it make you feel better if I said yes. <BR>
c.  That depends on what you mean by "love" <BR>
d.  Does it matter? <BR>
e.  Who, me? <BR>
<P><HR>
3.  Do I look fat?<BR>
<P>
<EM>The correct male response to this question is to confidently and emphatically state, "No, of course not."  and then quickly leave the room.  Wrong answers include:</EM><BR>
<P>
a.  I wouldn't call you fat, but I wouldn't call you thin either. <BR>
b.  Compared to what? <BR>
c.  A little extra weight looks good on you. <BR>
d.  I've seen fatter. <BR>
e.  Could you repeat the question?  I was thinking about your insurance policy. <BR>
<P><HR>
4.  Do you think that she's prettier than me?  <BR>
<P>
<EM>The "she" in question could be an ex-girlfriend, a passerby you were staring at so hard that you almost caused a traffic accident or an actress in a movie you just saw.  In any case, the correct response is a "No, you are much prettier."  Wrong answers include:</EM><BR>
<P>
a.  Not prettier, just pretty in a different way. <BR>
b.  I don't know how one goes about rating such things. <BR>
c.  yes, but I bet you have a better personality. <BR>
d.  only in the sense that she's younger and thinner. <BR>
e.  What did you say?  I was thinking about your insurance policy. <BR>
<P><HR>
5.  What would you do if I died?<BR>
<P>
<EM>Correct answer:  "Dearest love, in the event of your untimely demise, life would cease to have meaning for me and I would proceed to hurl myself under the front tires of the first Domino's Pizza truck that came my way."</EM><BR>
<P>
This might be the dumbest question of the lot, as is illustrated by the following stupid joke:<BR>
<P>
"Dear,"  said the wife/  "What would you do if I died?" <BR>
"Why dear, I would be extremly upset,"  said the husband.  "Why do you ask such a question?" <BR>
"Would you remarry?  persevered the wife. <BR>
"No of course not, dear"  said the husband. <BR>
"Don't you like being married?"  said the wife. <BR>
"of course i do, dear."  he said. <BR>
"Then why wouldn't you remarry?" <BR>
"All right," said the husband, "I'd remarry."  <BR>
"You would?"  said the wife, looking vaguely hurt. <BR>
"Yes," said the husband. <BR>
"Would you sleep with her in our bed?"  said the wife after a long pause. <BR>
"Well yes, I suppose I would," replied the husband. <BR>
"I see,"  said the wife indignantly."  <BR>
"And would you let her wear my old clothes?"<BR> 
"I suppose, if she wanted," said the husband. <BR>
"Really," said the wife icily.  "And would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?" <BR>
"Yes.  I think that would be the correct thing to do."<BR> 
"Is that so?"  said the wife, leaping to here feet.  And I suppose you'd let here play with my golf clubs, too." <BR>
"Of course not, dear,"  said the husband.  "She's left handed." <BR>
