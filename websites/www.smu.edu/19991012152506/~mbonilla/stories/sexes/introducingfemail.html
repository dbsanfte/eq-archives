<P>
This new product will reduce your communications needs considerably.  
Its intuitive interactions will often leave you scratching your head 
in wonder.
<P>
From your minimal communications with this package, it will quickly
presume who your friends are (and even what their habits are), who you  
should be communicating with in order to advance your career, and let  
you know continually whether you are communicating effectively with
the FeMail itself.
<P>
You may find that FeMail reduces your unnecessary communications with  
friends and associates. Your FeMail will intercept incoming
communications from all sources and make a determination as to whether  
or not they should be relayed to you. The FeMail is especially
thorough when examining messages from other FeMail systems. These 
messages will  be examined for intent as well as content.
<P>
Messages that are received from other Mails will be scanned for  
intention by your FeMail. Any messages that will reduce your
productivity at home or at the office (invitations to bars or parties,  
where the FeMail may lose contact with you for more than two hours for  
example) will be delivered to you only after they can no longer be
acted upon. A true productivity increase is then possible, and your FeMail  will
even help you decide how to use this spare time to attend to maintenance issues.
<P>
In fact, you may find that the FeMail methods are far beyond your
comprehension. Often times the FeMail responses you receive will be 180 
degrees different than the direction you thought you were heading.  In  
every case though, you will be compelled to agree with the decisions
that your FeMail makes. Most areas where a FeMail is installed find  
that agreeing with the FeMail is easier than attempting to justify 
opposing logic.
<P>
The FeMail package includes modules for Cognitive Interpretation,
Intuition, Presumptions, Innuendoes (even some you may not realize),  
Inflection, and Encryption. (The encryption package is particularly  
effective, allowing other mails absolutely no chance of interpreting  
interchanges between two FeMails).
<P>
You will find yourself becoming dependent on the interactions that a  
FeMail makes possible. Once the FeMail begins working in your daily  
activities, you may find yourself changing certain actions to avoid  
conflicting with the FeMail suggestions.
<P>
The FeMail is extremely comprehensive, and provides only for a single  
user interface in most cases. The instructions included with your
FeMail indicates that it may interact openly with other Mails in a
conversational mode, but that you should never interact with someone  else's 
FeMail, even in a conversational mode, and most certainly not in an interactive 
mode.  The FeMail communications links have  demonstrated an ability to intuit 
these actions even if you believe your FeMail would be unaware of the 
interaction.  
<P>
Continued interaction with FeMails that are not your own will be
considered a security violation, and you may find yourself cutoff from  
interaction with your own FeMail.
<P>
Because of the complexity and high-level of interface required, there  
are certain times (based roughly on a lunar month) when your FeMail
system may behave erratically. During this particular cycle, your  
interactions with the FeMail should be monitored closely, and
offensive or interpretive language removed. The FeMail 
may misinterpret even  simple communications efforts 
during this short time. This is an unavoidable problem 
that the FeMail has endured since its inception, and we 
are still attempting to overcome this minor glitch.  
Should a misinterpretation occur, your FeMail will store the data  
indefinitely, and only recall the misinterpretation when it can
loosely associate it with other facts not necessarily related to the 
communications process. You will find these recollections and 
associations puzzling, but they all contribute to the operation of the  
FeMail system.
<P>
Obtain Femail today, and you will be surprised at the changes it will  
make in your life!!!!
