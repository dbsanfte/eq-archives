Elvis, Liberace and John Belushi are sitting around in Heaven bored out of their heavenly lives. They go to Gabriel and ask if there's any way they can get out. Apprehensively, he agrees to let them return to Earth for a short while, telling them that if they even *think* of committing a sin, they'll go straight to Hell. So, zap, they're back on Hollywood Boulevard. As they're walking, Elvis sees a bar. He heads towards the door and the moment he touches it, poof!, he's gone. The other two realize that Gabriel was serious. A little while later, John Belushi sees a little packet of white powder lying in the gutter. He thinks for a moment, bends over to pick it up and poof!
<P>
Liberace disappears.
