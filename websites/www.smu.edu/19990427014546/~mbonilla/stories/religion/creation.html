One day, Adam sat outside the Garden of Eden shortly after eating the  
apple, and wondered about men and women.  So looking up to the heavens  
he says, "Excuse me GOD, can I ask you a few  questions?"
<P>
GOD replied, "Go on Adam but be quick I have a world to create." So  
Adam says, "When You created Eve, why did you make her body so curvy and  
tender unlike mine?"
<P>
"I did that, Adam, so that you could love her." "Oh, well then, why  
did You give her long, shiny, beautiful hair, and not me?"  
"I did that, Adam, so that you could love her." "Oh, well then, why  
did You make her so stupid?  Certainly not so that I could love her?"  
"Well Adam, no.  I did that so that she could love you."  
<P>
