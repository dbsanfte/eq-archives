There was a Pope who was greatly loved by all of his followers, a man
who led with gentleness, faith and wisdom.  His passing was grieved by the
entire world, Catholic or not.<P>

As the Pope approached the gates of heaven, it was Saint Peter who greeted
him in a firm embrace.<P>

"Welcome your holiness, your dedication and unselfishness in serving your
fellow man during you life has earned you great stature in heaven.  You
may pass through the gates without delay and are granted free access to all
parts of heaven."<P>

"You are also granted an open door policy and may at your own discretion
meet with any heavenly leader, including the Father without prior appoint-
ment.  Is there anything which your holiness desires?"<P>

"Well yes," the Pope replied.  "I have often pondered some of the mysteries
which have puzzled and confounded theologians through the ages.  Are there
perhaps any transcripts which recorded the actual conversations between
God and the prophets of old?  I would love to see what was actually said,
without the dimming of memories over time."<P>

Saint Peter immediately ushered the Pope to the heavenly library and
explained how to retrieve the vaious documents.  The Pope was thrilled and
settled down to review the history of man's relationship with God.
<P>
Two years later a scream of anguish pierced the stacks of the library.
Immediately several of the Saints and angels came running to the Pope's
side to learn the cause of his dismay.
<P>
There they found the Pope pointing to a single word on the parchment,
Repeating over and over, "There's an 'R', There's and 'R'!!!"
<P>
"Look, the word is celibrate, not celibate!"
