<P>
Running Bear woke up one morning to discover that he was a
man. As such, he deduced, he would require a woman.  So he
trekked on over to the Medicine Man's teepee to requisition a woman.
<P>
"What you want, Running Bear?" queried the Medicine Man.
<P>
"Running Bear want woman!"
<P>
"Hmmm," said the Medicine Man, "do you know what to do with a woman once
you've got her?"
<P>
"Uh," said Running Bear, "no..."
<P>
"Then go into the woods for two months.  Find a tree with a hole in it, and
practice on the tree.  Once you have perfected your
technique with the tree, come back to me and I will give you a woman."
<P>
Running Bear agreed, and set off into the woods.  Sure enough, he found a
tree with the appropriately sized hole, and began his two months of
practice.
<P>
Two months later, he returned to the Medicine
Man with pride in his eyes.
<P>
"Okay," he said to the Medicine Man, "me know what to do.  Give me woman."
<P>
The Medicine Man nodded and brought a pretty young squaw from
the back of the teepee.  "Little Flower," he said to her, "you now belong
to Running Bear.  Do as he asks."
<P>
Running Bear and Little Flower then retire to a vacant teepee where Running
Bear instructs her to bend over.  She shrugs and complies. Running Bear
then gives her a swift kick in the ass.
<P>
"Hey!" cried Little Flower.  "What did you do that for?"
<P>
"Me no stupid," explained Running Bear, "Me check for bees first."
