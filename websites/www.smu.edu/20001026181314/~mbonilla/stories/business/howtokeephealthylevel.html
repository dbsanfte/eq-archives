Page yourself over the intercom. (Don't disguise your voice.)<BR>
<BR>
Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Always wear them one day after your boss does. (This is especially effective if your boss is a different gender than you are.)<BR>
<BR>
Make 
            up nicknames for all your coworkers and refer to them only by these names. &quot;That's a good point, Sparky.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No I'm sorry I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Chachi.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Send 
            e-mail to the rest of the company telling them what you're doing. For example &quot;If anyone needs me, I'll be in the bathroom.&quot;<BR>
<BR>&quot;Hi-lite&quot; your shoes. Tell people that you haven't lost your shoes since you did this.<BR>
<BR>
While sitting at your desk, soak your fingers in &quot;Palmolive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Put up mosquito netting around your cubicle.<BR>
<BR>
Put a chair facing a printer, sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document.<BR>
<BR>
Arrive at a meeting late, say you're sorry, but you didn't have time for lunch, and you're going to be nibbling during the meeting. During the meeting eat five entire raw potatoes.<BR>
<BR>
Insist that your e-mail address be: &quot;zena_goddess_of_fire@companyname.com<BR>
<BR>
Every time someone asks you to do something, ask them if they want fries with that.<BR>
<BR>
Send e-mail to yourself engaging yourself in an intelligent debate about the direction of one of your company's products. Forward the mail to a co-worker and ask him/her to settle the disagreement.<BR>
<BR>
Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair dancing.<BR>
<BR>
Put your garbage can on your desk. Label it &quot;IN.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Determine how many cups of coffee is &quot;too many.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Develop an unnatural fear of staplers.<BR>
<BR>
Decorate your office with pictures of Cindy Brady and Danny Partridge. Try to pass them off as your children.<BR>
<BR>
For a relaxing break, get away from it all with a mask and snorkel in the fish tank. If no one notices, take out your snorkel and see how many you can catch in your mouth.<BR>
<BR>
Send e-mail messages saying free pizza, free donuts etc... in the lunchroom, when people complain that there was none... Just lean back, pat your stomach, and say, &quot;Oh you've got to be faster than that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Put decaf in the coffeemaker for three weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.<BR>
