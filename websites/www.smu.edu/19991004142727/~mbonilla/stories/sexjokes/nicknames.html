This guy walks into a bar and two steps in, he realizes it's a
gay bar but says "What the heck, I really want a drink". When the
gay waiter approaches he says to the customer "What's the name of
your penis?".
<P>
The customer says "Look, I'm just not into that. All I want is a
drink". The gay waiter says "I'm sorry but I can't serve you
until you tell me the name of your penis."  So the customer asks
the man sitting to his left who is sipping on a beer and asks
"hey bud, what's the name of your penis?". The gentleman with a
smile looks back and says "TIMEX".
<P>
The thirsty customer asks, "Why Timex?"  The fella proudly
replies, "'Cause it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!"
A little shaken, the customer turns to the fella on his right
sipping on a fruity margarita.  "So, what do you call your
penis?"
<P>
The other gentleman turns to him and proudly exclaims "FORD".
The customer thinks how this naming thing works and says,
"Because quality is Job 1?" The gentleman replies, "No.  Let me
ask you, Have you driven a Ford,lately?"
<P>
Even more shaken, the customer has to think for a moment before
comes up with a name for his penis.  He turns to the bartender
and exclaims, "The name of my penis is Secret.  Now give me my
beer."
<P>
The bartender begins to pour the customer a beer, but with a
puzzled look asks, "Why secret?"  The customer says "Strong
enough for a man but made for a woman."
<P>
