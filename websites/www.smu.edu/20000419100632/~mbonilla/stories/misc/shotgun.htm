<CENTER><H3>The Shotgun Rules</H3></CENTER>

<br>
   
The rules listed below apply to the calling of Shotgun (the passenger seat)
in an automobile.  These rules are definitive and binding.<p>


<H3>Section I</H3>
<H3>The Basic Rules</H3>

<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>


<LH><LI>  In order to call Shotgun, the caller must pronounce the word "Shotgun"
    in a clear voice.  This call must be heard and acknowledged by the
    driver.  The other occupants of the vehicle need not hear the call as
    long as the driver verifies the call.<BR>

<LI> Shotgun may only be called if all occupants of the vehicle are outside
    and on the way to said vehicle.<BR>

<LI>. Early calls are strictly prohibited.  Shotgun may only be called while
    walking toward the vehicle and only applies to the drive immediantly
    forthcoming.  Shotgun can never be called while inside a vehicle or still
    technically on the way to the first location.  For example, one can not
    get out of a vehicle and call Shotgun for the return journey.<BR>

<LI> The driver has final say in all ties and disputes.  The driver has the
    right to suspend or remove all shotgun priviledges from one or more
    persons.<BR>
</LH>
</OL>

<H3>Section II</H3>
<H3>Special Cases</H3>

These special exceptions to the rules above should be considered in the order
presented; the case listed first will take precendence over any of the
cases beneath it, when applicable.
<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>
<LH>
<LI> In the instance that the normal driver of a vehicle is drunk or
    otherwise unable to perform their duties as driver, then he/she is
    automatically given Shotgun.<BR>

<LI>  If the instance that the person who actually owns the vehicle is not
    driving, then he/she is automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.<BR>

<LI> In the instance the the driver's spouse, lover, partner, or hired
    prostitute for the evening is going to accompany the group, he/she is
    automatically given Shotgun, unless they decline.<BR>

<LI> In the instance that one of the passengers may become so ill during
    the course of the journey that the other occupants feel he/she will toss
    their cookies, then the ill person should be given Shotgun to make
    appropriate use of the window.<BR>

<LI>  In the instance that only one person knows how to get to a given
    location and this person is not the driver, then as the designated
    navigator for the group they automatically get Shotgun, unless they
    decline.<BR>

<LI>  In the instance that one of the occupants is too wide or tall to fit
    comfortably in the back seat, then the driver may show mercy and award
    Shotgun to the genetic misfit.  Alternatively, the driver and other
    passengers may continually taunt the poor fellow as they make a three
    hour trip with him crammed in the back.<BR>
</LH>
</OL>

<H3>Section III</H3>
<H3>*The Survival of the Fitess  Rules *
</H3>
<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>
<LH>
<LI> If the driver so wishes, he/she may institute the Survival of the
    Fitess Rules on the process of calling Shotgun.  In this case all rules,
     excepting  I-4,  are suspended and the passenger seat is occupied by
     whoever can take it by force.<BR>

<LI>  The driver must announce the institution of the Survival of the
    Fitess Rules with reasonable warning to all passengers.
    This clause reduces the amount of blood lost by passengers and
     the damage done to the vehicle.<BR>
</LH>
</OL>

Please follow the above rules to the best of your ability.  If
there are any arguments or execptions not covered in these rules,
please refer to rule I-4.
