1. You're a bitch.<BR>
<BR>
2. When asked, Is something bothering you?, reply NO, then get pissed off when you are believed.<BR>
<BR>
3. Become attracted to someone because he is outgoing and loves parties, start dating him and immediately expect him to stop this behavior.<BR>
<BR>
4. Always take an hour longer than promised to prepare for the evening.<BR>
<BR>
5. Whine.<BR>
<BR>
6. If you are trying to sleep, it's because you're exhausted from your almost superhuman level of daily achievement; if he is trying to sleep, it's because he is lazy.<BR>
<BR>
7. If he pays attention to you, he is smothering you.<BR>
<BR>
8. If he gives you space, he is ignoring you.<BR>
<BR>
9. Demand to be treated as an equal in everything. Except when paying for meals, plane tickets, concerts, beers, etc. These are required gifts proving his love.<BR>
<BR>
10. Declare PMS at any given time. If he is knowledgeable about your cycle, tell him you're irregular from all of the stress of your life.<BR>
<BR>
11. Remember that any woman who so much as looks at your boyfriend/husband must be labeled a whore and your network of friends must be informed immediately to spread this as quickly as possible.<BR>
<BR>
12. Make his life miserable by making him feel guilty about doing anything other than catering to your needs.<BR>
