<P>
a young man goes into a drug store to buy condoms.  The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants.  "Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot.  I want the condoms because I think tonight's  "the" night.  We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out.  And I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that.  Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack." 
<P>
The young man makes his purchase and leaves.   Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents.  He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree.  He begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes.
<P>
The  girl leans over and says, "You never told me that you were such a religious person."
<P>
He leans over to her and says, "You never told me  that your father is a pharmacist."
