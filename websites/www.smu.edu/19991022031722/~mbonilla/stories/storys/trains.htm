<P>
There is this kid playing with his toy train in the living room and his mother is in the kitchen doing the dishes. The kid stops the train and says "OK, all you mother fuckers gettin' off get off, all you sons-a-bitchs gettin'on get on. Well his mother heard this and came running into the room, couldn't believe what came out her sons mouth and sent her son to his room. "Now you stay in here for two hours and think about using that kind of language. Well the two hours past and the mom told the son he could go back to playing with his train, if he learned his lesson. The son goes back and the train starts, round and round. The son stops the train and says "OK, all you mother fuckers gettin'off get off, all you sos-a-bitchs gettin' on get on and anyone who has a complaint about the two hour delay, talk to the bitch in the kitchen.
