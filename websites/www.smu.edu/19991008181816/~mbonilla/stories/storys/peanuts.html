It seems that the recreational director of a mental hospital
wanted to take a well behaved group of inmates to a baseball
game. The General Manager of the club was a little leery of
this. However the Recreational Director asked " If I prove to you
how well behaved they are, will you let them in?" It was agreed.
<P>
They sat down and "Stand up, nuts" Everyone stood up "Sit
down, nuts" Everyone sat down. "Look behind you nuts"
Everyone turned around. Pleased with that, the General
Manager let them in. About the 3rd inning or so, he heard a
tremendous commotion, people running helter skelter. He
asked what happened.
<P>
A person said "Someone called out "Peanuts".
