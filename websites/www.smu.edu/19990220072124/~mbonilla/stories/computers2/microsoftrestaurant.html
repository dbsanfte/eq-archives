Patron: Waiter!<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Hi, my name is Bill and I'll be your Support Waiter. What seems to be the problem?<BR>
<BR>
Patron: There's a fly in my soup!<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Try again, maybe the fly won't be there this time.<BR>
<BR>
Patron: No, it's still there.<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Maybe it's the way you're using the soup; try eating it with a fork instead.<BR>
<BR>
Patron: Even when I use the fork, the fly is still there.<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Maybe the soup is incompatible with the bowl; what kind of bowl are you using?<BR>
<BR>
Patron: A SOUP bowl!<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Hmmm, that should work. Maybe it's a configuration problem; how was the bowl set up?<BR>
<BR>
Patron: You brought it to me on a saucer; what has that to do with the fly in my soup?<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Can you remember everything you did before you noticed the fly in your soup?<BR>
<BR>
Patron: I sat down and ordered the Soup of the Day!<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Have you considered upgrading to the latest Soup of the Day?<BR>
<BR>
Patron: You have more than one Soup of the Day each day?<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Yes, the Soup of the Day is changed every hour.<BR>
<BR>
Patron: Well, what is the Soup of the Day now?<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: The current Soup of the Day is tomato.<BR>
<BR>
Patron: Fine. Bring me the tomato soup and the check. I'm running late now.<BR>
<BR>
Waiter leaves and returns with another bowl of soup and the check]<BR>

Patron: This is potato soup.<BR>
<BR>
Waiter: Yes, the tomato soup wasn't ready yet.<BR>
