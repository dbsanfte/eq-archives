In response to the popular "Woman's 50 Rules for Men", John Calvit has designed the "Man's 25 Rules for Women"
<BR><BR>
1. Learn to work the toilet seat: If it's up, put it down. <BR>
2. Don't cut your hair. Ever.<BR>
3. Don't make us guess.<BR>
4. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<BR>
5. Sometimes, he's not thinking about you. Live with it. <BR>
6. He's never thinking about "The Relationship."<BR>
7. Get rid of your cat. And no, it's not different, it's just like every other cat.<BR>
8. Dogs are better than ANY cats. Period. <BR>
9. Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<BR>
10. Shopping is not everybody's idea of a good time. <BR>
11. Anything you wear is fine. Really.<BR>
12. You have enough clothes.<BR>
13. You have too many shoes.<BR>
14. Crying is blackmail.  Use it if you must, but don't expect us to like it. <BR>
15. Your brother is an idiot.<BR>
16. Ask for what you want. Subtle hints don't work. <BR>
17. No, he doesn't know what day it is.   He never will. Mark anniversaries. <BR>
18. Share the bathroom.<BR>
19. Share the closet.<BR>
20. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<BR>
21. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<BR>
22. Nothing says 'I love you' like a blowjob in the morning. <BR>
23. Foreign films are best left to foreigners.<BR>
24. Check your oil.<BR>
25. Golf is sacred.<BR>
