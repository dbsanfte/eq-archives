A few months ago, often-shocking radio personality, Howard Stern hosted Julie Cailini ('96 Playmate of the Year) and Stacey Sanchez ('97 Playmate of the Year) for a morning of sordid joviality.The ladies, who were promoting their latest calendars, answered ten questionsfrom Howard, ostensibly to demonstrate how important it is for them *AS ROLE MODELS* for young women to stay up on current affairs.The ladies'answers were amusing (and a bit sad), but the bit did prove that you don't have to be a neurosurgeon to earn a pile of cash!Love him or hate him, you have to appreciate Howard's sense of the absurd.<BR>
