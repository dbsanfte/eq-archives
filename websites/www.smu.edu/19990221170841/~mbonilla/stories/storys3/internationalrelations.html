There is a plane crash in between several Caribbean islands. There are only 15 survivors who manage to make it to a small deserted island. The survivors are:<BR>
<BR>
3 Italians (two men and a woman)<BR>
3 French (two men and a woman)<BR>
3 Germans (two men and a woman)<BR>
3 Greeks (two men and a woman)<BR>
and 3 Brits (two men and a woman).<BR>
<BR>
Six months later....<BR>
<BR>
One Italian man had killed the other, and was living with the woman.<BR>
The French had a delightful menage a trois.<BR>
The Germans had a system of strict rotation.  Hans on odd days, Franz on even. The Greek men were living together and had the woman doing the housework.<BR>
And the Brits..... were still waiting to be introduced to each other.<BR>
<P>
