Dear Mom and Dad:<P>
     Since I left for college I have been remiss in writing and I
am sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before.  I
will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit
down.  You are not to read any further unless you are sitting
down. <P>
Okay?<P>
Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture
and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my
dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is
pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital
and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick
headaches once a day. <P>
     Fortunately, the fire in the dormitory, and my jump was
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and 
he was the one who called the Fire Department and the ambulance.
He also visited me in the hospital and since I have nowhere to
live because of the burned-out dormitory, he was kind enough to
invite me to share his apartment with him. It's really a basement
room, but it is kind of cute.  He is a very fine boy and we have
fallen deeply in love and are planning on getting married. We
haven't got the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.  Yes mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I
know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I
know that you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and
devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.  The
reason for the delay in our marriage is that me boyfriend has a
minor infection which prevents us from passing our premarital
blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.<P>
     I know that you will welcome him into our family 
with open arms.  He is kind,  and, although not well educated, he
is ambitious.  Although he is of a different race and religion
than ours, I know your often-expressed tolerance will not permit
you to be bothered by that.  <P>
     Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you
that there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion 
or skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant,
I am not engaged, I am not infected and there is no boyfriend in
my life.  However, I am getting a D in Calculus and F in
Chemistry and I want you to see those marks in their proper
perspective.
<P>
                         Your loving daughter,
<P>
                         Susie<P>
