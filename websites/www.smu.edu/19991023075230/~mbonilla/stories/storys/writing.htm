 A teenager comes home from school with a writing assignment.  He asks
 his father for help.  "Dad, can you tell me the difference between
 potential and reality?"
<P>
 His father looks up, thoughtfully, and then says, "I'll display it to
 you.  Go ask your mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for a
 million dollars.  Then go ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad
 Pitt for a million dollars.  Then come back and tell me what you've
 learned."
<p>
 The kid is puzzled, but he decides to see if he can figure out what his
 father means.  He asks his mother, "Mom, if someone gave you a million
 dollars, would you sleep with Robert Redford?"  His mother looks around
 slyly, and then with a little smile on her face says, "Don't tell your
 father, but, yes, I would."
<p>
 Then he goes to his sisters room and asks her, "Sis, if someone gave you
 a million dollars, would you sleep with Brad Pitt?"  His sister looks up
 and says, "Omigod! Definitely!"
<p>
 The kid goes back to his father and says, "Dad, I think I've figured it
 out. Potentially, we are sitting on two million bucks, but in reality,
 we are living with a couple of whores."
