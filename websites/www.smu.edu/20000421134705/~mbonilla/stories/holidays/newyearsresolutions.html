Well as it is the time of year when people make resolutions and all that stuff, I thought I would let you know what my resolutions are.<BR>
<BR>
1. I want to gain weight.  Put on at least 30 pounds.<BR>
2. Stop exercising.  Waste of time.<BR>
3. Read less.<BR>
4. Watch more tv.  I've been missing some good stuff.<BR>
5. Procrastinate more.<BR>
6. Drink.  Drink some more.<BR>
7. Take up a new habit: smoking.<BR>
8. Spend at least $1000 a month on hookers.<BR>
9. Spend more time at work.<BR>
10. Take a vacation to someplace important: like to see the largest ball of twine.<BR>
11. Stop bringing lunch from home: I should eat out more.<BR>
12. Quit giving money & time to charity.<BR>
14. Start being superstitious.<BR>
15. Have my car lowered and invest in a really loud stereo system.  Get the windows tinted.  Buy some fur for the dash.<BR>
16. Speak in a monotone voice and only use monosyllabic words.<BR>
17. Only wear jeans that are 2 sizes too small and use a chain or rope for a belt.  Only wear white T-shirts with those fashionable yellows tains under the arms.<BR>
18. Personal goal: bring back disco.<BR>
