A man goes into a pet store looking for a monkey.  "I don't want any old monkey," he says to the store owner, "I want one that can do something special."<BR>
<BR>
The store owner points towards three identical looking monkeys in politically-correct, animal-friendly natural mini-habitats.  "The one on the left costs $500," says the store owner.<BR>
<BR>
"Why so much?" asks the customer.<BR>
<BR>
"Because it can program in C," answers the store owner.<BR>
<BR>
The customer inquires about the next monkey and is told, "That one costs $1500, because it knows COBOL and is willing to work YR2000 conversions."<BR>
<BR>
The startled man then asks about the third monkey.  "That one costs $3000," answers the store owner.<BR>
<BR>
"3000 dollars!!" exclaims the man.  "What can that one do?"<BR>
<BR>
The owner replies, "To be honest, I've never seen it do a single thing, but it calls itself a Consultant."<BR>
