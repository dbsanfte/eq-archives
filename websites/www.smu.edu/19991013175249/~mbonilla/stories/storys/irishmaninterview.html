An Irishman went for an interview with one of the major blue chip computer
companies.  When the interview was over the interviewer told him that all applicants had to complete a test.
<P>
The interviewer took a piece of paper and drew six vertical lines in pairs of
two on the paper and placed it in front of the Irishman.
<P>
"Could you please show me a clever way to make this into nine?"
<P>
After thinking for a while the Irishman took the pencil and drew a canopy of
leaves on top of the three pairs of lines, and handed the paper back to the
interviewer. 
<P>
The interviewer looked at the drawings and said: "But that is not nine!" 
<P>
"Oh yes it is", said the Irishman with a broad Irish accent, "Tree + Tree +
Tree make nine!"
<P>
The interviewer handed the paper back to the Irishman and asked him to make it
99. After thinking for a longer while the Irishman scribbled up and down the
trunks and handed the paper back to the interviewer.
<P>
The interviewer looked at the drawings and said: "But that is not ninety nine!"
<P>
"Oh yes it is", said the Irishman, "Dirty tree + dirty tree + dirty tree make
ninety nine."
<P>
The interviewer was now a bit cheesed off so he decided to do the Irishman once
and for all, therefore, he handed the paper back to the Irishman and asked him
to make it 100.
<P>
After thinking for a considerably longer time the Irishman suddenly grabbed the
pencil and drew a little blop (hundelort) on the bottom right hand side of each
three and handed the paper back to the interviewer. 
<P>
The interviewer looked at the drawings and said: "But that is not 100!"
<P>
"Oh yes it most certainly is", said the Irishman with a much broader Irish
accent, "Dirty tree and a turd + dirty tree and turd + dirty tree and a turd
make 100!!!!!"
<P>
