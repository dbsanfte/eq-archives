1. Grasp cat firmly in your arms.  Cradle its head on your elbow, just
as if you were giving baby a bottle. Coo confidently, "Thats a nice
kitty."  Drop pill into its mouth. 
<P>
2. Retrieve cat from top of lamp and pill from under sofa. 
<P>
3. Follow same procedure as in 1, but hold cat's front paws down with
lefthand and back paws down with elbow of right arm. Poke pill into
its mouth with right forefinger. 
<P>
4. Retrieve cat from under bed. Get new pill from bottle. (Resist
impulse to get new cat.) 
<P>
5. Again proceed as in 1, except when you have cat firmly cradled in
bottle-feeding position, sit down on edge of chair, fold your torso
over cat, bring your right hand over your left elbow, open cat's mouth
by lifting the upper jaw and pop the pill in - quickly. Since your
head is down by your knees, you won't be able to see what you're doing.
That's just as well. 
<P>
6. Leave cat hanging on drapes. Leave pill in your hair. 
<P>
7. If you're a woman, have a good cry. If you're a man, have a good
cry. 
<P>
8. Now, pull yourself together. Who's the boss here anyway? 
Retrieve cat and pill. Assuming position 1, say sternly, "Who's the
boss here, anyway?"  Open cat's mouth, take pill and...Oooops! 
<P>
9.This isn't working, is it?  Collapse and think. Aha! Those flashing
claws are causing the chaos. 
<P>
10. Crawl to linen closet. Drag back large beach towel. Spread towel
on floor. 
<P>
11. Retrieve cat from kitchen counter and pill from potted 
plant. 
<P>
12. Spread cat on towel near one end with its head over long 
edge. 
<P>
13. Flatten cat's front and back legs over its stomach. (Resist 
impulse to flatten cat.) 
<P>
14. Roll cat in towel. Work fast; time and tabbies wait for no 
man....or woman. 
<P>
15. Resume position 1. Rotate your left hand to cat's head. Press its
mouth at the jaw hinges like opening the petals of a snapdragon. 
<P>
16. Drop pill into cat's mouth and poke gently. Voila! It's done. 
<P>
17. Vacuum up loose fur (cat's). Apply bandages to wounds (yours). 
<P>
18. Take two aspirins and lie down.
<P>
