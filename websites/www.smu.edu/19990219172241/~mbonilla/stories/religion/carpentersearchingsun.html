St. Peter gets fed up with standing at the pearly gates and giving or denying access to Heaven.  St. Peter needed to take a break, so he noticed Jesus walking by and asked him to watch the front desk for a bit.  Jesus said he'd be happy to.<BR>
In a little bit an old man came up to the desk very slowly.  Jesus took out form 85-A/j and started getting the information.<BR>
"I'm looking for my son." the old man says.<BR>
"And who are you?" says Jesus.<BR>
"I'm his Father; well not really." says the man.<BR>
"Where are you from?"  The old man said he was from the Mediterranean Sea area.<BR>
"What did you do in life?"<BR>
"I was a carpenter," was the reply. <BR>
Jesus smiled because this was a profession he could relate to.  "Did you have many children?" he asked kindly.<BR>
The old man said, "Just one son, and he was unlike any other child on earth."  Jesus looked closely at the old man and asked,<BR>
"Did anything unusual occur the night he came to you?"<BR>
"Oh yes," the old man said, "There was this incredibly brilliant star in the sky that lit up all the heavens."<BR>
"And does your son have holes in his hands and feet?" asks Jesus excitedly.<BR>
"He does!" shouts the man Jesus put down the 85-A/j form and holds out his hands, "Father!"<BR>
The old man looked at Jesus with joy on his face and asked,<BR>
"Pinocchio??"<BR>
<P>
