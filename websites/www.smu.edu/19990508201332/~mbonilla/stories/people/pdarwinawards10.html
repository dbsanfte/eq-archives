 themselves in.

 A 34-yr. old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of
 suffocation, police said. He was approximately 6' 2" and 225 lb.  He
 was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes
 and a woman's wig. It appeared that he was trying to create a
 schoolgirl's uniform look.  He was also wearing a military gas mask
 that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its
 place. The other end of the hose was connected to a hollow wooden
 section of bedpost approximately 12 inches long and 3 inches in
 diameter.  This bedpost was inserted into his rear end for reasons
 unknown, and was the cause of his suffocation. Police found the task
 of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family members
 "very awkward".

 Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude
 when another plane approached. It appears they decided to "moon" at
 the occupants of the other plane, but lost control of the plane and
 crashed. They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants
 around their ankles.

 A police officer in Ohio responded to a call that was made to 911. She
 had no details before arriving except that someone was reporting that
 his father was not breathing.  Upon arrival, the officer found the man
 face down on the couch, naked. When she rolled him over to check for a
 pulse and to start CPR if necessary, she noticed burn marks around his
 genitals. After the ambulance arrived and removed the man (who turned
 out to be dead on arrival at hospital), the police made a closer
 inspection of the couch, and noticed that the man had made a hole
 between the cushions. Upon flipping the couch over they discovered
 what caused his death. Apparently the man had a habit of putting his
 penis between the cushions, down into the hole and between two
 electric sanders (with the sandpaper removed for obvious reasons).
 According to the report, after his orgasm the...ahem...discharge
 shorted out one of the sanders, electrocuting him to death.

 (AP) LOS ANGELES - Police officials would not release the name of a
 Pacoima man who was found dead yesterday after responding to
 complaints from neighbors that a bad smell was coming from his
 apartment.  Upon entering the apartment, officers were surprised to
 see that every square inch of the apartment, including appliances and
 even the inside of the toilet, were covered with pornographic images
 cut from magazines. "The visual effect was very unsettling," said
 Officer Hradj of the Pacoima Police. "Because everything looked the
 same, you could not tell where one wall ended and a doorway began."
 The surprises did not end there, however. Police described the man as
 having "concocted a wire frame around his head" upon which he had
 taped various pornographic images, apparently so he could freely move
 about his apartment without ever losing his close-up view of nude
 bodies. Small slits had been cut into the paper so he could find his
 way, but according to Hradj, "He had almost no peripheral vision. He
 could barely see a thing."  The man was found nude with this wire
 frame entangled in a hanging lamp. "We think he had been dusting,"
 said another police officer, "because a feather duster was lying
 nearby, and his head gear had somehow become caught in the lamp, which
 was chained to the ceiling."  The man allegedly choked to death trying
 to extricate himself from his predicament.  According to his apartment
 manager, the white male in his mid-30's never left his apartment, and
 had food delivered weekly. Funeral services are planned for next week.
 His next of kin requested that his name be withheld.

 A young Inuit man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply
 because he had no money to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk.  Not
 surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the
 fireplace in his house.  The resulting explosion and fire burned his
 house down, killing both him and his sister.

 A 27 year-old French woman lost control over her car on a highway near
 Marseilles and crashed into a tree, seriously injuring her passenger
 and killing her.  As a commonplace road accident, this would not have
 qualified for a Darwin nomination were it not for the fact that the
 driver's attention had been distracted by her Tamagotchi keyring,
 which had started urgently beeping for food as she drove along.  In
 attempting to press the correct buttons to save the Tamagotchi's life,
 the woman lost her own.
