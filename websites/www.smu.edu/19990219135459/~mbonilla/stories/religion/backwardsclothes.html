A Catholic priest is walking around a fairgrounds one afternoon when a
young lady walks up and says. "Excuse me sir, but are you aware you have your
shirt on backwards".
<P>
The priest replies "No, you don't understand.  I'm a father".
<P>
The young lady says "Well if you are a father you should set a good
example and put your clothing on properly".
<P>
The priest exclaims "No, I'm afraid you still don't understand.  I'm a
father to thousands".
<P>
"In that case" snapped the young lady, "Perhaps you should put your pants
on backwards".
<P>
