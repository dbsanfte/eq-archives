A North Carolina man, having bought several expensive cigars, insured them against... get this... fire.
<P>
After he had smoked them, he then decided that he had a claim against the insurance company and filed. The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigar normally. The man sued. The judge, stated that since the company had insured the cigars against fire, the were obligated to pay.
<P>
After the man accepted payment for his claim, the company then had him arrested for... arson.
<P>
