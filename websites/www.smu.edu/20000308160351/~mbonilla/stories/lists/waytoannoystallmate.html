1.  Stick your open palm under the stall wall and ask your neighbor, "may I borrow a highlighter?" <BR>
<BR>
2.  Say, "uh oh, I knew I shouldn't have put my lips on that." <BR>
<BR>
3.  Cheer and clap loudly every time somebody breaks the silence with a bodily function noise. <BR>
<BR>
4.  Say, "Damn, this water's cold." <BR>
<BR>
5.  Drop a marble and say, "Oh no! My glass eye!" <BR>
<BR>
6.  Say, "Hmmm, I've never seen that color before." <BR>
<BR>
7.  Grunt and strain real loud for 30 seconds and then drop a cantelope into the toilet bowl from a height of six feet. Sigh relaxingly. <BR>
<BR>
8.  Say, "Now how did that get in there." <BR>
<BR>
9.  Say, "Humus.  Reminds me of humus." <BR>
<BR>
10. Fill up a large flask with Mountain Dew. Squirt it erratically under the stall walls of your neighbor's while yelling, "Whoa!  Easy boy!" <BR>
<BR>
11. Say, "Interesting............. more floaters than sinkers.'" <BR>
<BR>
12. Using a small squeeze tube, spread peanut butter on a wad of toilet paper and drop the wad under the stall of your neighbor.  Then say, "Whoops, could you kick that back over here please?" <BR>
<BR>
13. Say, "C'mon Mr. Happy! Don't fall asleep on me now." <BR>
<BR>
14. Fill a balloon with cream corn. Rush into the stall with your hand over your mouth and let out a lengthy vomit impression while you squeeze the balloon and splatter cream corn all about. Apologize profusely and blame it on the fettucine alfredo you had for breakfast. <BR>
<BR>
15. Say, "Boy, that sure looks like a maggott." <BR>
<BR>
16. Say, "Damn, I knew that drain hole was a little too small.  Now what am I gonna do?" <BR>
<BR>
17. Play a well known drum cadence over and over again on your butt cheeks. <BR>
<BR>
18. Before you un-roll toilet paper, conspicuously lay down your "Cross-Dressers Anonymous" newsletter on the floor visible to the adjacent stall. <BR>
<BR>
19. Lower a small mirror underneath the stall wall, adjust it so you can see your neighbor and say, "Peek-a-boo!" <BR>
<BR>
20. Drop a D-cup bra on the floor under the stall wall and sing "Born Free." <BR>
