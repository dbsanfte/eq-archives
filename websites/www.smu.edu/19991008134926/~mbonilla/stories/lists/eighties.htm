effects are much better, the characters are cool, and you want one of
every collectible out there. Return of the Jedi hits the theaters...you are
now a  teenager, and you cannot get your eyes off Princess Leia's
breasts or Han Solo's butt. You fantasize forever and ever about it, and
send off to join every fan club for them on the planet, hanging posters,
photos, and "teen"-type magazine spreads all over your walls and
lockers at school.

Hospital)
