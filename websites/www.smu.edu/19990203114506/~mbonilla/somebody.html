I want somebody to share<BR>
Share the rest of my life<BR>
Share my innermost thoughts<BR>
Know my intimate details<BR>
Someone who'll stand by my side<BR>
And give me support<BR>
And in return<BR>
She'll get my support<BR>
She will listen to me <BR>
When I want to speak<BR>
About the world we live in<BR>
And life in general<BR>
Though my views may be wrong<BR>
They may even be perverted<BR>
She'll hear me out<BR>
And won't easily be converted<BR>
To my way of thinking <BR>
In fact she'll often disagree<BR>
But at the end of it all<BR>
She will understand me<BR>
Aaaahhhhh....<BR>
<BR>
I want somebody who cares<BR>
For me passionately<BR>
With every thought and<BR>
With every breath<BR>
Someone who'll help me see things <BR>
In a different light<BR>
All the things I detest<BR>
I will almost like <BR>
I don't want to be tied<BR>
To anyone's strings<BR>
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of<BR>
Those things<BR>
But when I'm asleep<BR>
I want somebody<BR>
Who will put their arms around me <BR>
And kiss me tenderly<BR>
Though things like this<BR>
Make me sick<BR>
In a case like this <BR>
I'll get away with it<BR>
Aaaahhhhh....<BR></FONT>
