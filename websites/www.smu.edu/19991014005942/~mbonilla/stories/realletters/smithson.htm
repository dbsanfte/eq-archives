<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Thank you for your latest submission to the Institute, labeled
211-D, layer seven, next to the clothesline post. Hominid
skull. We have given this specimen a careful and detailed
examination, and regret to inform you that we disagree with your
theory that it represents conclusive proof of the presence
of Early Man in Charleston County two million years ago.
Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a Barbie doll,
of the variety one of our staff, who has small children, believes
to be the Malibu Barbie. It is evident that you have
given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this specimen,
and you may be quite certain that those of us who are familiar
with your prior work in the field were loathe to come to
contradiction with your findings. However, we do feel that there
are a number of physical attributes of the specimen which might
have tipped you off to its modern origin:</p>

<p>1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are
typically fossilized bone.</p>

<p>2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9
cubic centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest
identified proto-hominids.</p>

<p>3. The dentition pattern evident on the skull is
more consistent with the common domesticated dog than it is with
the ravenous man-eating Pliocene clams you speculate
roamed the wetlands during that time. This latter finding is
certainly one of the most intriguing hypotheses you have submitted
in your history with this institution, but the evidence seems to
weigh rather heavily against it. Without going into too much detail,
let us say that:</p>

<p>A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a
dog has chewed on.</p>

<p>B. Clams don't have teeth.</p>

<p>It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny
your request to have the specimen carbon dated. This is partially
due to the heavy load our lab must bear in its normal operation,
and partly due to carbon dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils
of recent geologic record. To the best of our knowledge, no
Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956 AD, and carbon dating is
likely to produce wildly inaccurate results. Sadly, we must also
deny your request that we approach the National Science
Foundation's Phylogeny Department with the concept of assigning
your specimen the scientific name Australopithecus
spiff-arino. Speaking personally, I, for one, fought
tenaciously for the acceptance of your proposed taxonomy, but was
ultimately voted down because the species name you selected was
hyphenated, and didn't really sound like it might be Latin.</p>

<p>However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this
fascinating specimen to the museum. While it is undoubtedly not a
hominid fossil, it is, nonetheless, yet another riveting example
of the great body of work you seem to accumulate here so
effortlessly. You should know that our Director has reserved a
special shelf in his own office for the display of the specimens
you have previously submitted to the Institution, and the entire
staff speculates daily on what you will happen upon next in your
digs at the site you have discovered in your back yard. We
eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that you
proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing the
Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in hearing
you expand on your theories surrounding the
trans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a
structural matrix that makes the excellent juvenile
Tyrannosaurus rex femur you recently discovered take on the
deceptive appearance of a rusty 9-mm Sears Craftsman automotive
crescent wrench.</p>
