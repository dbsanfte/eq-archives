A penguin is driving down the road when his car starts to give him all kinds of trouble...the engine sputters, steam pours out of his hood and there's fluids pouring out on the road. He pulls into a garage and the mechanic tells him it'll be at least a half-hour until he can even tell him what the problem is.<BR>
<BR>
The penguin walks around, has a cup of coffee and then comes across an ice cream shop, where he orders a double vanilla cone, getting it all over his face. He goes back to the garage and asks the mechanic if he's found the problem.<BR>
<BR>
The mechanic looks up and tells him "Looks like you've blown a seal."<BR>
<BR>
The penguin says "No! Really, I just had an ice cream cone!"<BR>
