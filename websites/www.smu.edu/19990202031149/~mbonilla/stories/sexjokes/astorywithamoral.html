There is this fish in the water, and he is looking at a fly hovering over the water. "If that fly would drop six inches, I could jump out and grab it!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a bear on the bank of the lake, and he is saying "If that fly would drop six inches, the fish would jump out to get it and I could grab the fish!!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a hunter in the forrest, taking aim at the bear. He says "If that fly would drop six inches, then the fish would jump out and the bear would reach for the fish and come into the clear, then I could shot it!!!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a mouse, hidden behind the hunter. He is looking at the hunter's cheese sandwich. He say's "If that fly would drop six inches, the fish would go for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, the  hunter would put down his cheese sandwich and go to shoot the bear and  I could grab the cheese sandwich!!!!"<BR>
<BR>
There is a cat standing further back from the mouse. She is saying, "If that fly would drop six inches, the fish would jump for the fly, the bear would go for the fish, the hunter would put down his cheese sandwich to shoot the bear, the mouse would run for the sandwich, and I could grab that mouse in a second!!!!!"<BR>
<BR>

The fish jumped up and got the fly!<BR>
The bear reached out and grabed the fish!!<BR>
The hunter put his cheese sandwich down and shot the bear!!!<BR>
The mouse ran and picked up the sandwich!!!!<BR>

<BR>
