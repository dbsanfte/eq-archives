 One Payday, Mr. Goodbar wanted to Skor, so he took Mrs. Hershey to the Pot of Gold motel on the corner of Aero and Fifth Ave., to show her some Twix.  He began to feel her Mounds, which was pure Almond Joy.  It made her Tootsie Roll and made him want to Eatmore.  When he saw her Cherry Blossom, he gasped: "Sweet Marie, this is Wonderbar!"  He let out a Snicker as his Butter Finger went up her Kit-Kat and caused a Milky Way.  She screamed: "Oh Henry" as she grabbed his Big Turk and squeezed his M & M's.  Mrs. Hershey said: "You're even better than the Three Musketeers", to which Mr. Goodbar replied:  "When you are this good, they call you Mr. Big."  Soon, she was a bit Chunky and nine months later, she had a Baby Ruth.<BR>
