that she decided to end her life by throwing herself into the ocean. When
she went down to the docks, a handsome young sailor noticed her tears, took

slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, "I'll keep you happy, and
you'll keep me happy."

her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought
her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love
until dawn.

Three weeks later, during a routine search, she was discovered by the captain.
"What are you doing here?" he asked.
