12.  Money does not equate love.  Not even in Nevada.<BR>
<BR>
13.  Any attempt by a man to prepare food, no matter how feeble (ie microwaving a burrito, fixing Spaghetti, etc.) should be met with roughly the same degree of praise a parent might shower upon their infant when it walks for  the first time.<BR>
<BR>
14.  Those male models with perfect bodies are all gay.  Accept it.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
17.  If you truly want honesty, don't ask questions you don't really want he answer to.<BR>
<BR>
18.  Of COURSE he wants another beer.<BR>
<BR>
19.  The guy doesn't ALWAYS have to sleep on the wet spot.<BR>
<BR>
20.  Dogs good.  Cats bad.<BR>

<BR>
25.  He was not looking at that other girl.<BR>
<BR>
26.  Well, okay...maybe a little.<BR>
<BR>
27.  Okay, so what!  He was looking at her.  Big deal.  Like you never looked at another guy....<BR>
<BR>
28.  There is nothing inherently wrong with the word "tit".<BR>
<BR>
29.  He is the funniest, strongest, best-looking, most successful man you have ever met.<BR>
<BR>
30.  And all your friends think so too.  Especially the cute ones.<BR>
<BR>
31.  Your (select appropriate item:) butt/boobs/hair/makeup/legs look fine. As a matter of fact, it/they look damn good.  Stop asking.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
33.  It is not necessary to discuss the heaviness of your menstrual flow with  him.<BR>

<BR>
36.  Dirty laundry comes in several categories:  Looks fine/smells fine; Looks  fine/smells bad; Looks dirty/smells fine.  Unless you intend to wash it, do not try to disrupt piles organized in this manner.<BR>
<BR>
37.  Yes, Sharon Stone / Pamela Anderson / Cindy Crawford is prettier than you. Just like Brad Pitt / Antonio Banderas / Keanu Reeves is better looking than him.  But since neither one of you is going to be dating any of these people, love the one you're with.<BR>
<BR>
