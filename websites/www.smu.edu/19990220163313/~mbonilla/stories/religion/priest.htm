A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.  After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.  The monsignor
replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."  So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice.  At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon return to his office after mass, he found the following note on his door:<P>

 1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.<P>
 2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.<P>
 3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.<P>
 4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.<P>
 5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.<P>
 6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.<P>
 7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior, and Spook.<P>
 8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.<P>
 9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.<P>
10.  We do not refer to the cross as the Big T!<P>
11.  When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and eat it, for it is my body", he did not say, "Eat me."<P>
12.  The Virgin Mary is not reffered to as the, "Mary with the Cherry".<P>
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: "Rub-A-dub-dub, thanks for the grub, yeah God"<P>
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy-pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a peter-pulling contest at St. Taffy's.<P>
