Are you feeling old?  If not, consider this:<BR>
* The people who are starting college this fall across the nation  were born in 1980.<BR>
* The Iranian hostage crisis occurred before they were conceived.<BR>
* They have no memory of a time before M-TV.<BR>
* "New Wave" is their PARENTS musical generation.<BR>
* Cyndi Lauper, Boy George, the Pretenders, the Kinks, the Sex Pistols -- are all old music they have heard of, if they have  heard of it at all.<BR>
* They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan era.<BR>
* They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged.<BR>
* If they have heard the name "Oliver North," it was probably as a losing Congessional candidate, or perhaps in some obscure survey history text's reference, such as might be made to Huey Long or Teapot Dome.<BR>
* Black Monday 1987 is a significant to them as the Great Depression.<BR>
* Their world has always included AIDS.<BR>
* Having not lived through the Disco Scare, they can romanticize the 1970s.<BR>
* They see "Family Ties" as something middle aged ladies watch.<BR>
* They watched "Star Wars" years ago, when they were kids -- on video.<BR>
* Atari predates them, as do vinyl albums and cassette audiotapes.<BR>
* From their earliest years, a camera was something you used once and threw away.<BR>
* As far as they know, stamps have always cost about 32 cents.<BR>
* The oil crisis is history or which they probably know nothing -- and why anyone WOULDN'T buy a suburban is beyond them.<BR>
* Most of them have probably never seen a real nun, even if they went to Catholic schools.<BR>
