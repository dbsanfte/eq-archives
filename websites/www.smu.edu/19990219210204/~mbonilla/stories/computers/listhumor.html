	<LI>203 to demand that cross posting to alt.grammar, alt.spelling and alt.punctuation about changing light bulbs be stopped.

	<LI>14 to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly, and to post corrected URLs.
	<LI>3 to post about links they found from the URLs that are relevant to this list which makes light bulbs relevant to this list.
