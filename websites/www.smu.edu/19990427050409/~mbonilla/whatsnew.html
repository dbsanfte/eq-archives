(10/31/97) Hey everybody!!!! The long arm of the law finally made its way to the Little Island.  Seems the Mattel saw some amusing funnies about Barbie on my homepage and well, didn't find them nearly as amusing as I did. hehehe. So they send a nasty letter to SMU, then SMU called me, and well, the offending pages have to come down, or at least the Barbie stuff had to go away.  But check out the pages, their is some amusing smart ass comments by me there and also, info on how to get the funnies.  *smile*<BR>

<p>
(10/7/97) OK, so it's only taken me a month to update the funnies this time, but I do have good excuses!  I had lots of tests one week and then the next week I moved into a new apartment and well the phone company didn't feel like connecting my service until two weeks after I had ordered it. So I couldn't connect and give the Island lots of new funny stories. : )  So get off my back and enjoy all the great new funny stories!!!!!  Also add a fun new link to the Links page, very amusing and entertaining. : )  And i added a new picture to the pictures page.  Enjoy everyone. And get this, I get an email today, saying I was over my ten meg limit, so I had to get rid of some mp3's and movies.  oh well...
<P>
(9/10/97) Today, I added a new category in the stories page, and also changed the way the links page looks like. Nothing exciting, but still, I think I looks better than before.
<P>
(9/5/97) Ok, ok, sorry about being late with the update, but there were a ton of funnies to sift through this time. And they're all really good. All right, everyone give a big cheer for Joe!  He made that great picture you saw on the <A HREF="http://www.smu.edu/~mbonilla/index.htm">opening page</A>. THANKS JOE! Besides I had class start again, so I've been busy, so back off. : )  And also, I never realized that moving the guestbook to the top of the page make such a difference.  Thanks to everyone who has signed it!!!  OK, I also changed some stuff on the index page.  So it loads super-duper fast now.  And I also changed the colors on the Funny Pages. I got tired of the yellow and funny dots. : )  But that's it for now, See you soon!
<p>
(8/19/97) Added a bunch of new storie a few days ago.  Some gems in there. : )  I also (as you can see if you're a regular visitor)  changed the look of the index page.

(6/9/97) Okee Dokee, I added one small picture to the Depeche Mode pics page.  I made that one up.  If your a Depeche Mode fan, it makes for a good desktop wallpaper.  I also added the giggle award I got the other day. And i also changed some link colors, and I changed the Computer Gaming Picture link. Just for everyone that visits the Funny Pages regularly.  I'm going to try to update the Funny Pages on the 1st and the 15th of the month.  That should satisfy everyone's appetite for more and more funnies : )

Hope you enjoy the changes. : )

Well today(4/15/97) I did it, I did a monstertruck update to the little island. : )  I guess the release of the new depeche mode album just inspired me.  So I've added the dM page.
