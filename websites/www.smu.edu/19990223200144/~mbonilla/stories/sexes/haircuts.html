Women's version:<BR>
================<BR>
Woman2: Oh!   You got a haircut!  That's so cute!<BR>
<BR>
Woman1: Do you think so?  I wasn't sure when she gave me the mirror. I mean, you don't think it's too fluffy looking?<BR>
<BR>
Woman2: Oh God no!  No, it's perfect.  I'd love to get my hair cut like that, but I think my face is too wide.  I'm pretty much stuck with this stuff I think.<BR>
<BR>
Woman1: Are you serious?  I think your face is adorable.  And you could easily get one of those layer cuts - that would look so  cute I think.  I was actually going to do that except that I was  afraid it would accent my long neck.<BR>
<BR>
Woman2: Oh - that's funny!  I would love to have your neck! Anything to take attention away from this two-by-four I have for a shoulder line.<BR>
<BR>
Woman1: Are you kidding?  I know girls that would love to have your shoulders.  Everything drapes so well on you.  I mean, look at my arms - see how short they are?  If I had your shoulders I could get clothes to fit me so much easier.<BR>
