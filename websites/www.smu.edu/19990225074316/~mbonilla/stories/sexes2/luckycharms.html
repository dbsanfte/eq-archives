Amazing new study shows that your favorite Lucky Charms marshmallow bit 
shape determines what you're like in bed! Yes, it's true--just take this 
simple test to determine your true bedroom personality:
<P>
GREEN CLOVERS: If your favorite Lucky Charms marshmallow shape is the
green clover, you're a happy-go-lucky type in bed. You don't take 
anything too seriously in the bedroom or elsewhere and always manage to 
have a good time, even if you have someone else with you. You don't have 
any patience with depressed people and tend to sit on them until 
theycheer up.
<P>
BLUE DIAMONDS: If your favorite marshmallow shape is the blue 
diamond,your thoughts in bed are mostly about what you'll get later. "If 
he really enjoys this, will  he buy me that mink coat?" is probably 
what's going through your mind.  People who like blue
diamonds have a notebook of preprinted fill-in-the-blank palimony suit 
forms and are the people most likely to file their nails while making 
love.
<P>
ORANGE STARS: If your favorite shape is the orange star, you expect 
to be the center of attention in bed. You expect your partner to spend 
most of his time pleasing you and when you do something for him, you 
expect enthusiastic moaning if not applause. People who like orange 
stars often have mirrors over their beds, not because they are turned 
on by watching what is being done, but because they want to be able to 
watch themselves having a good time. They often moan out their own names 
while making love.
<P>
PINK HEARTS: If you like pink hearts, you're the romantic type. You like 
your partner to whisper romantic phrases into your ear and, if he's too 
distracted to form coherent phrases, you'll settle for romantic 
syllables. People who like pink hearts read most of the romance novels 
published and are turned on by people wearing armor.
<P>
PURPLE HORSESHOES: If purple horseshoes are your thing, your tastes 
are modern, uninhibited, and somewhat warped. You like variety in the 
bedroom, especially when you can include handcuffs, chains, swingsets, 
and chocolate pudding.. Be careful when going out on a picnic with 
anyone who likes purple horseshoes--she's/he's likely to pin you down 
with croquet hoops when you're not looking and who knows what could 
happen next?
<P>
YELLOW MOONS: If you're the yellow moon type, you're more interested 
in satisfying your partner's needs than your own. You prefer to lie back 
and wait for your partner to jump on you and express her/his needs 
verbally or nonverbally. People who like yellow moons usually own 
several pairs of handcuffs and other instruments of kinky sex just in 
case someone should ever want to tie them up and ravish them.  Keep your 
eyes open for anyone who eats all the yellow moons out of her cereal as 
soon as she opens the box.
<P>
Those little oat bits that aren't marshmallows at all: If you prefer 
the little oat bits, you probably don't like sex anyway and don't need 
to read this article. People who prefer the oat bits usually become 
accountants, librarians who work at the reference desk, or government
employees; these people like to chow down on a big bowl brimming with
oat bits before a tough day of protesting suggestive lyrics in rock 
music. People who like oat bits have more time to spend writing letters 
to the editor than any other type.
