I am the son<BR>
and the heir<BR>
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar<BR>
I am the son and heir<BR>
of nothing in particular<BR>
<BR>
You shut your mouth<BR>
how can you say<BR>
I go about things the wrong way<BR>
I am Human and I need to be loved<BR>
Just like everybody else does<BR>
<BR>
I am the son<BR>

of a shyness that is criminally vulgar<BR>
I a the son and heir<BR>
of nothing in particular<BR>
<BR>
You shut your mouth<BR>
how can you say<BR>
I go abut things the wrong way<BR>
I am human and I need to be loved<BR>
Just like everybody else does<BR>
<BR>
There's a club, if you'd like to go<BR>
you could meet somebody who really loves you<BR>
so you go, and you stand on your own<BR>
and you leave on your own<BR>
and you go home, and you cry<BR>
and you want to die<BR>
<BR>
When you say it's gonna happen "now"<BR>
well, when exactly do you mean?<BR>
see I've already waited too long<BR>
and all my hope is gone<BR>
