Entry 1<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I'm so excited! Just got a job as an intern at the White House.... and I don't know a thing about medicine. Don't even know what my duties are yet, but I hope it's a "hands on" position.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 2<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
You won't believe this! I snuck into the Oval Office when no one was looking.  But then I dropped one of my contacts. So, I got down  on my hands and knees and was looking for it when -- guess what -- the president walked in. He said, "You must be the new intern." That man is psychic! I hope he likes me.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 3<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I think the president likes me. Today he dropped his contacts on the rug and asked me to find them.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 4<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
He really likes me.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 5<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I have been sent to the stupid Pentagon to work. It is such a drag. Like they're going to put me in charge of heat-seeking missiles or something.  But I still talk to my Bubba-cakes on the phone. He calls me "1-900" Monica." (That means he thinks I'm one in nine hundred.  That's pretty special.)<BR>
<BR>
Entry 6<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I met a really nice girl today. Her name is Linda. She's really cool except for that clown hair. Has she ever heard the word "conditioner?"  She looks like Mrs. Ronald McDonald.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 7<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I think Linda is hard of hearing. She keeps asking me to speak louder whenever we go out for a quiet dinner.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 8<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
Oh-oh. The bad news: I've been subpoenaed. The good news is that Vernon Jordan is my new best friend. I'm going job hunting with him tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 9<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I had to give an affidavit in that stupid Paula Jones' case.  What is she talking about? There are no distinguishing marks. And, by the way, I am way cuter than her. She looks like David Brenner in drag.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 10<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I've had it. I'm never going to be an intern again. I'm going back to Hollywood where they pay you for that kind of work.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 11<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
Finally got home to L.A. and hugged Daddy so hard I thought I  would pop.  It's the first time in six months I called a man "daddy" that I was actually related to.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 12<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
It is so totally fabulous being back in Brentwood where they really understand me. O.J. stopped by -- he said not to worry because, "If there's no spot on the dress, it's anybody's guess."<BR>
<BR>
Entry 13<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
All my girlfriends are so jealous of all the attention I'm getting from Kenneth Starr. I think they have a subpoena envy. And Linda Tripp. I hate her. I'm thinking of selling a Linda Doll. You wind it up and it stabs a Barbie doll in the back.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 14<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
Got to remember to tell Bubba-cakes my totally do-able solution to this whole wacky Iraqi crisis. He forgets that I worked at the Pentagons.  Just have Vernon Jordan get Saddam Wahtsisname a job at Revlon. (God, it's a no brainer!)<BR>
<BR>
Entry 15<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
They keep asking me if I had sexual relations with the president. I mean, give me a break. That is so crazy. I mean, just because every day, when I worked at the White House, his name was at the top of my  "To Do"  list.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 16<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
Sometimes I wish some of the other girls who were in my position would stand up and be counted. But they might hit their heads on the President's desk if they did.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 17<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
They keep talking about immunity... like I caught something from the President or something. The truth is, there was always a secret service man outside the Oval Office protecting us. Now, that's what I call safe sex!<BR>
<BR>
Entry 18<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
Omigod. Mom and I are both going to the grand jury. What is that about anyway? Sounds like some big hotel. Anyway, I guess I shouldn't  have told mom about taking dictation in the Oval Office.  Me and my big mouth!<BR>
<BR>
Entry 19<BR>
Dear Diary,<BR>
I'm not really worried. I've got offers to do some really cool movies that are going straight to video and starring me! The Full Monica, a  sequel to In And Out, A Pack-O-Lips Now, Wag the Willy and my most favorite: Good Bill Humping. I hope Speilberg will direct.<BR>
