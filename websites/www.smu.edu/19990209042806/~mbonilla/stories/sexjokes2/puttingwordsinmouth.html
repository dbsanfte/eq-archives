This man finally after 1 year of being with his girlfriend finally realizes how
much he loves her.... So, he wants to do something for her that no one has ever
done for her.... So, he goes to a tattoo parlor and tells the man who works
there that he wants him to tattoo "I LOVE YOU" on his penis.  Well, the man
looks at him and says " can I ask you why"? The man tells him why and the
tattoo artists says well its your money and does it....  That night be picks up
his girlfriend and brings her to a beautiful restaurant and dines her so
romantically and tells her that he has something for her that she will never
believe that he did.... She says whatever.... Since he hasn't done shit for her
so far she thought who cares... Well after dinner they go back to his place and
he dims the lights, puts on some nice slow music and walks back to the couch
and sits beside her and tells her I want to show you what I did for you... So
he pulls down his pants and shows her.. Well she screams out " NO NO NO NO.. I
KNOW WHAT YOUR TRYING TO DO.... YOUR TRYING TO PUT WORDS IN MY
MOUTH"....................
