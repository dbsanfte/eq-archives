<CENTER>In the beginning was the Plan.
<P>
And then came the Assumptions.
<P>
And the Assumptions were without form.
<P>
And the Plan was without substance.
<P>
And darkness was upon the face of the Workers.
<P>
And they spoke among themselves, saying, "It is a crock of shit and it
stinks."
<P>
And the Workers went unto their Supervisors and said, "It is a pail of
dung
and we cannot live with the smell."
<P>
And the Supervisors went unto their Managers, saying, "It is a
container
of excrement and it is very strong, such that none may abide by it."
<P>
And the Managers went unto their Directors, saying, "It is a vessel of
fertilizer and none may abide its strength."
<P>
And the Directors spoke among themselves, saying to one another, "It
contains that which aids plant growth and it is very strong."
<P>
And the Directors went to the Vice Presidents, saying unto them, "It
promotes growth and it is very powerful."
<P>
And the President looked upon the Plan and saw that it was good.  And
the
Plan became Policy.
<P>
And this is how shit happens.</CENTER>
