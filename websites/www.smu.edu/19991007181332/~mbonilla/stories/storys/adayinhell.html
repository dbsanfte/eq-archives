Guy:  Sure,  I love to drink.  Love the drinks.<BR>
Demon:  Well you're gonna love Mondays then.  On  Mondays that's all we do is drink.  Whiskey,  tequila,  Guinness,  wine coolers,  diet tab, and fresca...we drink till we throw up and then we drink some more!<BR>
Guy:  Gee that sounds great.<BR>
<BR>
Demon:  You a smoker?<BR>
Guy: You better believe it!  Love the smoking.<BR>

Demon:  That's right!  Thursday is drug day.  Help yourself to a great big bowl of crack. or smack.  Smoke a doobie the size of a submarine. You can do all the drugs you want and if ya overdose - that's right - you're dead - who cares!  O.D.!!<BR>
Guy:  Yowza!  I never realized Hell was such a swingin' place!!<BR>
