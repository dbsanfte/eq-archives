 If you've ever noticed, when Bart Simpson is writing something
 100,000 times on the chalkboard as a punishment in the opening
 sequence of the Simpsons, he is always writing something different
 and often quite hilarious.  These are the collected writings of Bart
 Simpson from the chalkboard exercises during the opening credits.
