A man was out hunting. He just happened to be hunting bears. As he
trudged through the forest looking for the beasts, he came upon a
large and steep hill.  Thinking that perhaps there would be bear on
the other side of the hill, he climbed up the steep incline and, just
as he was pulling himself up over the last outcropping of rocks, a
huge bear met him nose to nose.
<P>
The bear roared fiercely. The man was so scared that he lost his
balance and fell down the hill with the bear not far behind. As he
tumbled down the hill, the man lost his gun. When he finally stopped
at the bottom, he found that he had a broken leg.  Escape was
impossible and so the man, who had never been particularly religious
(in fact this just happened to be a Sunday morning), prayed, "God, if
you will make this bear a Christian I will be happy with whatever lot
you give me for the rest of my life." 
<P>
The  bear was no more than three feet away from the man when it
stopped dead in its tracks... looked up to the heavens  quizzically...
and then fell to its knees and prayed in a loud voice, "O Lord, bless
this food of which I am about to partake."
<P>
