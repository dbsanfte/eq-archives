2nd 
            Person:&nbsp; &quot;A little.&nbsp; What's wrong?&quot;&nbsp; 1st Person:&nbsp; &quot;Well, I sent a fax, and the recipient called back to say all she received was a cover-sheet and a blank page.&nbsp; I tried it again, and the same thing happened.&quot;<BR>
2nd Person:&nbsp; &quot;How did you load the sheet?&quot;<BR>
1st Person:&nbsp; &quot;It's a pretty sensitive memo, and I didn't want anyone else to read it by accident, so I folded it so only the recipient could open it and read it.&quot;<BR>

I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside her car.  &quot;Do you need some help?&quot; I asked.&nbsp; She replied, &quot;I knew I should have  replaced the battery in this remote door unlocker.&nbsp; Now I can't get into my car.&nbsp; Do you think they (pointing to a distant convenience store) would have a battery for this remote thingy,'&quot;she answered, handing it and the car keys to me.<BR>
As I took the key and manually unlocked the door, I replied, &quot;Why don't you drive over there and check about the batteries...it's a long walk.&quot;<BR>

My friend called his car insurance company to tell them to change his address from Texas to Vermont.&nbsp; The woman who took the call asked where Vermont was.&nbsp; As he tried to explain, she interrupted and said, &quot;Look, I'm not stupid or anything, but what state is it in?&quot;<BR>

Several years ago we had an intern who was none too swift.&nbsp; One day he was typing and&nbsp; turned to a secretary and said, &quot;I'm almost out of typing paper.&nbsp; What do I do?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Just use copier machine paper,&quot; she told him. With that, the intern took his last remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to make five blank copies.<BR>

I was working the help desk.&nbsp; One day one of the computer operators called me and asked if anything &quot;bad&quot; would happen if she dropped coins into the openings of&nbsp; her PC.&nbsp; I asked her if this was something she was thinking of doing. She&nbsp; said, &quot;never mind&quot; and hung up. So I got out my trusty tool kit and paid her a visit.&nbsp; I opened her CPU&nbsp; case and sure enough, there was 40 cents.<BR>

One of our servers crashed.&nbsp; I was watching our new 
            system administrator trying to restore it.&nbsp; He inserted a CD and needed to type a path name to a directory named &quot;i386.&quot; He started to type it and paused, asking me, &quot;Where's the key for that line thing?&quot;&nbsp; I asked what he was talking about, and he said, &quot;You know, that one that looks like an upside-down exclamation mark.&quot; I replied, &quot;You mean the letter &quot;i&quot;?&quot; and&nbsp; he said, &quot;Yeah, that's it!&quot;<BR>

This person had a broken lamp which he wanted to discard. Unfortunately, the power cord ran under his refrigerator, making it impossible to move the lamp while the cord was attached.&nbsp; He decided to cut the cord, since the lamp was unusable anyway.&nbsp; He didn't remember to unplug it first. I found him in the hallway rolling back and forth.<BR>

I was in a car dealership a while ago when a large motor home was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle was in dire need of repair and the whole thing generally looked like an extra in &quot;Twister.&quot;&nbsp; I asked the manager what had happened.&nbsp; He told me that the driver had set the cruise control, then went in back to make a sandwich.<BR>

I called a company and asked to speak to Bob.&nbsp; The person who answered said, &quot;Bob is on vacation.&nbsp; Would you like to hold?&quot;<BR>

            <P>I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed that I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card.&nbsp; She informed  me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed. When I asked why, she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature on the credit card with the signature I just signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit card in front of her. She carefully compared that signature to the one I signed on the receipt.&nbsp; As luck would have it, they matched.<BR>

Warning!<BR>
At a grocery store in San Jose, they have new credit card/bank card readers at the checkout stands.&nbsp; If you don't know how to orient your card to swipe it through the reader, the checkout person will say, &quot;Strip down, face toward ne.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER>~~~~~</CENTER>A customer at a sub shop 
            ordered &quot;a small soda.&quot; The owner responded, &quot;I'm sorry, sir, but we don't have small, just medium and large.&quot; (Both cost 99 cents.) The kicker came when the customer, a rather well-dressed business type, disappointedly said, &quot;Okay, I guess I'll just have to have the medium then.&quot;<BR>

Idiots and Geography:<BR>
<BR>
After interviewing a 
            particularly short-spoken job candidate, I described the person to my boss as rather monosyllabic.&nbsp; My boss said, &quot;Really? Where is Monosyllabia?&quot; Thinking that he was just kidding, I played along and said that it was just south of Elbonia. He replied, &quot;Oh, you mean over by Croatia?&quot;<BR>

Idiots in the Neighborhood:<BR>
<BR>
I 
            live in a semi-rural area.&nbsp; We recently had a new neighbor call the local township administrative office to request the removal of the Deer Crossing sign on our road.<BR>
The reason:&nbsp; Many deer were being hit by cars and he no longer wanted them to cross there.<BR>
<BR>

Idiots and Computers:<BR>
My neighbor works in the operations department in the central office of a large bank.&nbsp; Employees in the field call him when they have problems with their computers.&nbsp; One night he got a call from a woman in one of the branch banks who had this question:<BR>
<BR>&quot;I've got smoke coming from the back of my terminal.&nbsp; Do you guys have a fire downtown?&quot;<BR>

Idiots Are Easy To Please<BR>
<BR>
I was sitting in my science class, when the teacher commented that the next day would be the shortest day of the year.&nbsp; My lab partner became visibly excited, cheering and clapping.&nbsp; I explained to her that the amount of daylight changes, not the actual amount of time.<BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, she was very disappointed.</P>

My 
            daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked the individual behind the counter for &quot;minimal lettuce.&quot;&nbsp; He said he was sorry, but they only had iceberg.<BR>

Idiots Do Math:<BR>
A co-worker was 
            telling us about her sister who was coming to visit her for the holidays.&nbsp; Someone asked how old her sister was, at which she paused, thought for a bit, and then answered, &quot;She's half as old as I am, that's how I always remember.&quot;&nbsp; So someone else (okay, it was me) said, &quot;That's neat...  So every year that you age, she only ages half a year?&quot;&nbsp; My co-worker thought about that, and then said, &quot;Oh, yeah, I guess it only works on even years.&quot;<BR>
