I was driving home yesterday and going 20km above the speed limit.
Sure enough, there was a police car with its red lights on behind me
soon enough. I had some liquid courage in me so me thinks: "I can
outrun this guy," and floor it. Going 70, 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.
Finally, as the speedometer passes 110, I figured "what the heck,"
give up and pull over to the curb. The police officer gets out of his
cruiser, approaches the car, leans down and says "listen mister, I've
had a really lousy day, and I just want to go home. Give me a good
excuse and I'll let you go. But it better be good, you were going well
over 100." I though for a moment and than said: "Officer, three weeks
ago, my wife ran off with a police officer. When I saw your cruiser in
my rear view mirror, I thought you were that guy and you were trying
to catch up with me to give her back!"
