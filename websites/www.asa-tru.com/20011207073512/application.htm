<div align="center"><b><font color="#FF9900" size="5" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Greetings, 
  Traveler. </font></b> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hello! Thank you for expressing 
    an interest in joining Asa-Tru. Since we are a guild that prides itself on 
    being a &quot;Family&quot; type guild, and one with a high level of honor, 
    integrity and prestige, we have made some changes to the induction process. 
    Please read this page fully, before completing the application, as, if you 
    do not meet the following criteria, you will not be considered for membership. 
    Please read carefully, before you submit the application.</font></p>
  <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">**Due to the fact that many 
    of our current members have gone beyond level 50, and many of the Alternate 
    Characters they have are between 30 and post 50 in levels, we have had to 
    do a minor revision to our application requirements. This change will become 
    effective on September 1st, 2001, until that date, the Minimum Level for Applicants 
    is still level 15.**</font></i></b></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. All Applicants must be of at 
    least 25th level or higher.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. All members must be sponsored 
    by a minimum of 2 current, qualified Asa-Tru Members (if you wonder who is 
    qualified to sponsor you, see the member list).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. All Applicants must group with 
    current members, a minimum of 5 separate times, for a duration of at least 
    1 hour, each time. This is in order to evaluate the Applicant's group behaviour 
    and general way of behaving.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. All Applicants must <b>READ</b>, 
    <b>UNDERSTAND</b> and <b>AGREE</b> to the Asa-Tru Charter, as well, you must 
    be aware of who the Masters and Mistresses of Truth are, as they are the GUILD 
    MASTERS of Asa-Tru.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">5. Once you have met all the requirements, 
    and are sponsored, you will be given a &quot;pop-quiz&quot; by one of the 
    officers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">6. Once all the above is complete, 
    it will be put forth to a vote by members of the guild, who will vote to either 
    accept or reject your application.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Once the vote is completed, you 
    will be contacted, and notified of the result. If accepted into the guild, 
    you will enter the guild as an Initiate of Truth, and enter a 30 day probationary 
    period, during which, you may be removed from the guild, for breaking any 
    of the rules. We do this to protect all our members who have worked very hard 
    to give us the good reputation that we hold on the server.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thank you, once again, for your 
    interest in joining Asa-Tru. If you continue on to the Application, best of 
    luck to you, may we see your name in Guild Chat.</font></p>
