  <p><font color="#6699FF">Updated the Charter to reflect the new application 
    process, the Hierarchy to reflect the Keepers of Truth, and shortly will be 
    adding a new section to the message boards, to reflect the changes to the 
    charter. Also, I fixed a couple broken links that were pointed out to me. 
    I will see you all this afternoon, as we prepare to go to fear.</font></p>

  <p>Added some Screenshots, which you can view by clicking <a href="screenshots.htm">HERE</a>. 
    I spent the better part of the evening in the Plane of Growth, last night. 
    You can see them by following the link in this post or by going to the screenshots 
    section and looking at it. I will be updating the charter and hierarchy/member 
    list either later today or tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Updated the Member List, Charter, Hierarchy and Application sections again. 
    The Application is now open again. Before submitting an application, be sure 
    that you read the Charter, and understand it, also check out the Hierarchy, 
    and see how the Guild Structure is set up. Additional information will be 
    added as I have time to do so.</p>

  <p><font color="#6699FF">Updated the Member List, Charter, Hierarchy and Application 
    sections yesterday and today. Due to the rapid growth of the guild over the 
    past couple months, we have decided to put a temporary freeze on new applicants, 
    while the officers go over the induction procedures, and make some decisions 
    regarding them. As other things happen, I will keep everyone as informed as 
    I can, and recommend that you all monitor the Guild Forums regularly, to note 
    any changes, or list anything that you would like to see here, as I monitor 
    the forum regularly, even if I don't post on every message.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#6699FF">Complete update on the page, including some new sections 
    that have yet to be implimented. New Menu section, trying something out that 
    I learned a bit of... Let me know what you think. Will be adding more sections 
    and completing them, as time allows. If you have any ideas, or want to see 
    something specific, please let me know.</font></p>
