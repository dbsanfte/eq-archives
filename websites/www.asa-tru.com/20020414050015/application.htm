<div align="center"><b><font color="#FF9900" size="5" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Greetings, 
  Traveler. </font></b> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Hello! Thank you for 
    expressing an interest in joining Asa-Tru. Since we are a guild that prides 
    itself on being a &quot;Family&quot; type guild, and one with a high level 
    of honor, integrity and prestige, we have made some big changes to the induction 
    process. Please read this page fully, before completing the application, as, 
    if you do not meet the following criteria, you will not be considered for 
    membership. Please read carefully, before you submit the application.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4"><b><i></i></b></font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">1. All Applicants must 
    be of at least 25th level or higher.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">2. All Applicants must 
    be asked, by a current member, to submit an application.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">3. All Applicants must 
    group with current members, a minimum of 5 separate times, for a duration 
    of at least 1 hour, each time. This is in order to evaluate the Applicant's 
    group behavior and general way of behaving.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">4. All Applicants must 
    <b>READ</b>, <b>UNDERSTAND</b> and <b>AGREE</b> to the Asa-Tru Charter, as 
    well, you must be aware of who the Masters and Mistresses of Truth are, as 
    they are the GUILD MASTERS of Asa-Tru.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">5. Once you have met 
    all the requirements, and are sponsored, you will be given a &quot;pop-quiz&quot; 
    by one of the officers, probably the Sentinel, a Crusader, or, possibly, a 
    Guardian or the Guild Master.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">6. Once all the above 
    is complete, it will be put forth to a vote by members of the guild, who will 
    vote to either accept or reject your application.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Once the vote is completed, 
    you will be contacted, and notified of the result. If accepted into the guild, 
    you will enter the guild as an Initiate of Truth, and enter a 30 day probationary 
    period, during which, you may be removed from the guild, for breaking any 
    of the rules. We do this to protect all our members who have worked very hard 
    to give us the good reputation that we hold on the server.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Thank you, once again, 
    for your interest in joining Asa-Tru. If you continue on to the Application, 
    best of luck to you, may we see your name in Guild Chat.</font></p>
