  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Note: First, The Hunters would like to 
    start by apologizing. When we lead a raid, we are sometimes horrible, awful, 
    tyrannical, insensitive, screaming psychotics. Its not because we don&#146;t 
    think you are incapable, its not because we think you don't know what to do, 
    its not because you haven&#146;t proven over and over that you know what you 
    are doing. Its because its our job to make sure no one messes up. It&#146;s 
    our job to keep everyone on their toes. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, IF one person messes up, its 
    not HIM/HER that looks bad...Its all of AT. EVERYONE pays for it. The WHOLE 
    raid loses because of one person. Its The Hunters job to make sure THAT doesn&#146;t 
    happen. So consider this our apology before hand for screaming at you. Don&#146;t 
    take it personally, it ISN'T personal, we scream at everyone. </font></p>
</div>
<ol>
  <li>
    <div align="left">Raids are not about EXP. Anyone caught continually complaining 
        about EXP will be Translocated out or asked to leave a raid. Raids are 
        about achieving goals, not EXP.</div>
<li>
<p align="left">People will be asked to fulfill certain rolls (puller, Main Assist, 
  snarer, Tasher, Haster, etc.), please do ONLY your roll unless asked. Doing 
  more than your asked or not only what you are asked creates chaos. Everyone 
  wants to be important: Main Buffer, Main Assist, Main Healer, Main Mezzer, etc, 
  but we all can't be. Typically we will put the most appropriate person for the 
  job in each roll, but not always. Example: Weesheewuz has been trying out different 
  Main Assists lately and he also varies the Main Mezzer.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Talk ONLY in the channel designated to you. The raid leader will 
  designate ONE channel to be used by people with raid jobs. Slower, mezzer, puller, 
  lotto person, will all use this channel and NO ONE ELSE!</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> No wandering off. Some people have a tendency to get bored and 
  wander away from the group and try to explore on their own. This WILL get everyone 
  killed. Stay put and wait for the Raid Leader to tell you what to do. We are 
  going to be severe here and have a very low tolerance.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> No one speaks for the raid except the Raid Leader and the Hunters. 
  If another group wants to share space with us, the general raid populace does 
  not say a thing in representation of the raid. People not with us might be using 
  SHOUT and AUCTION, but do not answer them. Only the Raid Leaders and Hunters 
  speak to them. REMEMBER THIS ALWAYS!!!!!</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Try to BE EARLY. If you think there is even a CHANCE you might 
  be late, camp out at the starting location the night before. WE WILL BE TURNING 
  AWAY PEOPLE WHO COME TOO LATE.... now here&#146;s the qualifier to that... IF 
  I still have slots open, and IF I can get you to where we are, and IF this can 
  all be achieved WITHOUT disturbing the flow of the raid TOO much, than you MAY 
  be allowed to join. NO ONE who shows up late is PROMISED a spot, even if we 
  have it.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> No one calls clerics to camp except the Raid Leader or the person 
  designated BY the raid leader. NO ONE ELSE CAMPS!!! No melee should EVER camp. 
  And no other spell casters camp until at least one cleric is known for sure 
  to be out. Sometimes ONLY the NAME of the person I tell to camp will be camping.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! 
  We DO watch for people NOT assisting. You WILL be publicly called out if you 
  are on a different mob than the Main Assist when you shouldn&#146;t be. Consider 
  this your First, Second, and Last warning on THAT subject. </p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Lotto's.... There will be some new, intricate Lotto rules posted, 
  look for the post in the near future, when its posted, read, learn, and understand.</p>
<li>
<p align="left">&quot;No loot for me so I am not going on the raid.&quot; Everyone 
  will want help on their epics eventually OR with getting that one uber item 
  in a particular dungeon, thus we had better not hear of people using this logic 
  to justify not coming to raids. And people HAVE been silly enough to tell me 
  this. I would rather hear, &quot;I just don't feel like raiding today&quot;. 
  The Hole is not a great place for melee&#146;s, though they do have some loot 
  there, but it is awesome for casters. Chardok is weak for casters but great 
  for melee, as is Sebilis. Just come to the raids and have fun and eventually 
  you will be rewarded. Let me tell you, I like helping people who help others 
  and themselves. .... There may be rules implemented in the near future to ENSURE 
  people don&#146;t use that form of logic to justify missing a raid.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> No complaining about the kind of REZ you get. Period. Level or 
  no level.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> And while we are at it...NO COMPLAINING about anything. Loot, 
  EXP, color of the sky, the temperature...keep it to yourself. This lowers the 
  guild morale, and makes things tougher on everyone. As the old saying goes, 
  &quot;If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all.&quot;</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Once a Hunter or Raid Leader is on sight making groups, then 
  the raid is officially on, and ALL the above rules apply.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> Try to keep excess chatter to a minimum. Its very hard to actually 
  GET all the tells for who is and who isn&#146;t there when you're suffering 
  from a horrid scroll because everyone is chatting vigorously. Its also hard 
  for everyone to see any instructions they are supposed to be getting when they 
  have to deal with that same scroll. Too many times we've heard people say &quot;I 
  didn&#146;t see that&quot; </p>
<li>
<p align="left">Don&#146;t ask who Main Assist, and Mezzer and Slower, and yada 
  yada yada is going to be. It WILL be announced, if we somehow START the raid 
  and it HASNT been announced, let the Raid Leader know, and they'll handle it.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> REMEMBER... Only the Raid Leaders should be giving instruction 
  of ANY kind. This includes telling people who is doing what job.</p>
<li>
<p align="left"> ONLY The Raid Leader, the Main Assist, and The Main Mezzer will 
  EVER call targets.</p>
</ol>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Folks... We have 101 things to deal with 
  when leading a raid, We don&#146;t always respond to people, We CANT keep up 
  with what EVERYONE is saying. This is a problem. We should ONLY be getting tells... 
  A: from group leaders, if you have something that needs to be communicated to 
  us, TELL YOUR GROUP LEADER. Get them to talk to us. B: People I request tells 
  from. C: Hunters, they can send me tells =D That&#146;s about it.... Loot/lotto 
  should be to the lotto leaders. If we haven&#146;t assigned someone in charge 
  of lotto, THEN you can send those tells to me. If we don&#146;t catch it right 
  away, try again. IF we don&#146;t answer you, and you had a suggestion, observation, 
  etcetc, that doesn&#146;t mean we didn&#146;t get it, it means we couldn&#146;t 
  respond. Either assume we got it or........... tell your group leader to tell 
  us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">NOTE: These are the Raid Rules as they stand 
  now, they can and will be edited as necessary, any time they are changed we 
  will be posting a reminder to re-read them.<br>
