  <p><b><font color="#CCCC33" size="5">Loot Rules</font></b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">Need before Greed applies ALWAYS. 
    If you have something, if you wont use something, if you only need it to sell, 
    if it isn't an upgrade to an existing item, on the Character you brought, 
    than DONT roll for it. Transgressions against THAT rule will result in heavy 
    disciplinary action in one form or another, be it through Strikes, or through 
    the loss of Lotto privileges for an amount of time determined at the time 
    the transgression is found.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">On multi-class loot, there are some items that 
    are multi-class, but fit certain classes more than others. Or fit all classes 
    that it CAN be used for equally, BUT... benefits the guild more as a whole 
    in the hands of certain classes. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">How to do this fairly? Much debate... 
    Much discussion, compromise of sorts was come to after much discussion on 
    this. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">No one can argue that some items are better off 
    going to some classes, and that some items are just more fair going to certain 
    classes, even when other classes CAN use them. Solution?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">BEFORE the raid, we research, 
    what comes out of this zone?<br>
    All the items we can find on the web for that zone, even if we think there 
    is little or no chance of that item dropping, we post the classes that will 
    be allowed to roll on each item, and we check the board each day to make sure 
    there were no questions as to why we did it like that, and if there were we 
    answer them, if people have further question or comment on a particular item 
    after we have answered their post, we make time to talk to them in game, hear 
    them out, hear their reasoning, and actually consider their opinion. If we 
    still feel the same way they get a heartfelt apology, but the decision stands. 
    IF we change our decision, we post it, and it stays that way. The Hunters 
    refuse to flip flop continually on items, if the privilege of having The Hunters 
    hearing your agreements seems to be abused, this privilege will be revoked.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">The person assigned to doing lotto's performs 
    ALL lotto, while the raid leader has final say. Everything is done by random 
    number assigned basis, and rolled by the person assigned by the raid leader 
    to do lotto's.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">Note: Winning a Multi-class item 
    WILL count as your loot until everyone from your class wins something.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">The raid leader will determine ahead of time 
    what is and isn't &quot;uber&quot; loot and make that posted as well, and 
    will also make the determination as to whether or not &quot;uber&quot; loot 
    is separate from &quot;normal loot&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">In raids where the vault is paying 
    for regents, we MUST remember to include ALL classes that will be using them 
    for the raid, clerics, Enchanters, Mages (call of hero has a regent). The 
    treasurer and the Hunters will handle this. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">In raids where the vault is NOT paying for the 
    regents, we MUST remember to include those classes in the loot system for 
    the cleric loots, even if it's in a different capacity (such as providing 
    runes).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">As far as No Drop class only 
    loot goes, this was a long debated issue, here's what we came up with. If 
    you win something, you're out until all other people from your class have 
    won something; there IS an exception to that. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">There are certain, though not many, pieces of 
    armor that most everyone would consider Junk for their class, a good example 
    is the cleric bracers from Hate, which we've had to, in the past, INSIST *SOMEONE* 
    *ANYONE* we don't care WHO loot, just so it doesn't rot, because NO ONE wanted 
    them, especially if it was going to count as their loot for the raid. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">No one wants to see something 
    rot, and we came up with a dozen different scenarios as to how to handle this, 
    and could find none that didn't have some kind of bug to them. The eventual 
    decision was that each class would discuss BEFORE the raid amongst themselves, 
    what was and wasn't to be considered Junk. They then tell the raid leader 
    what was Junk, and he in turn informs the lotto leader. Thereafter, anyone 
    from that class can roll on that item, for that raid, and it WON'T count as 
    their loot. IF an item drops, and YOU consider it Junk, but the raid leader 
    wasn't informed that this was to be considered Junk loot, and anyone from 
    your class disagrees with it being Junk loot even if no one else wants it, 
    it counts as your loot. If an item defaults to you because everyone else has 
    it, and you take it, and it wasn't Junk, that is your loot, until everyone 
    from your class has won something.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">Kickbacks&#133;something else long debated. Should 
    a person who won something be able to, for the chance to lotto on something 
    else, be able to give back an item he already won? And if so, should he lose 
    the original item?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">Here's the deal folks&#133;If 
    you win something, and later on something else drops that you would like to 
    be in on the roll for, you can Kick-Back the item you already won, for a chance 
    at winning on the item that just dropped (note, this only applies with non-no-drop 
    items). IF you win on the new lotto, you give back the item you had won originally. 
    If you lose, you keep your original item. YOU MAY ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER RAID. 
    Be sure that it is the item you want to kickback, you don't get another chance.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">Example1: Warrior01 wins the Boomstick of Buttkicking!<br>
    Later, the Uber-Boomstick of MUCH Buttkicking drops. Warrior01 wishes to roll 
    on the Uber-Boomstick. He offers up his Boomstick, and rolls on the Uber-Boomstick, 
    he loses, keeps his Boomstick, but cannot offer it up again to roll on something 
    else that drops. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#CCCCCC">Example2: Warrior01 wins the 
    Boomstick of Buttkicking!<br>
    Later, the Uber-Boomstick of MUCH Buttkicking drops. Warrior01 wishes to roll 
    on the Uber-Boomstick. He offers up his Boomstick, and rolls on the Uber-Boomstick, 
    he wins, gets the Uber-Boomstick, and then the Boomstick goes BACK to the 
    lotto pool, and is rolled on by everyone who can and will use it. Warrior01 
    may NOT offer up the Uber-Boomstick to roll on something else.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">These are the lotto rules as they stand now, 
    they can and will be edited as necessary, and any time they are changed we 
    will be posting a reminder to re-read them.<br>
