  <font color="#FFFFFF">**Actions known as &quot;above and beyond&quot; can be 
  called Medals of Asa-Tru. We need to track these. We need a member list that 
  will have an icon of a Medal and we can put a dot under each person's name for 
  each Medal they earn. We are able to then track this, others can see their accomplishments, 
  and we'll know who's ready for promotion.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">OR</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Above and Beyond&quot; can be earning awards from 
  the guild. And we come up with 4 or 5 VERY FAST and when they earn a Medal, 
  they get that icon (small icon) under their name and when they get the right 
  mound, we see who's ready for promotion and others see what medals another person 
  has received.<br>
  (I think you get the idea for both concepts.)</font></p>
