<p>Note: <b>/who</b>

<p><b>/who wiz all</b> - generates 
  a list of all Wizards online in all zones<br>
  <b>/who 1 5 all</b> - generates a list of all players 
  in online who are between levels 1 and 5.<br>

  </p>
<p align="center"><b>Pauses 
  in Social Batches</b></p>
<p>You may now enter 
  pauses in social batches with the <b>/pause</b> command. <b>/pause</b> takes 
  an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths 
  of seconds (i.e. <b>/pause 100</b> will yield a 10 second pause). </p>
<p>For example, a social 
  consisting of:</p>
<p><b>/sit off<br>
  /cast 1<br>
  /pause 100<br>
  /sit on</b></p>
<p>...would cause you 
  to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED 
  casting the spell, and sit down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you 
  can also use the <b>/pause</b> command on the same line as another social by 
  separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified 
  first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><b>/sit off<br>
  /pause 100,/cast 1<br>
  /sit on</b></p>
<p>...would have the 
  same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can 
  only be used to separate a <b>/pause</b> command from another, and MUST be specified 
  first on the line. <br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Custom 
  Animation Text</b></p>
<p>EverQuest has default 
  text for all existing animations. For instance, when typing <b>/point</b>, or 
  <b>/point</b> with a specified target (e.g. <b>/point Blibby</b>), your character 
  will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and &quot;CharacterName points 
  at &lt;target&gt;&quot; will be displayed to all other characters in your vicinity. 
  </p>
<p>You can now use 
  the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you need to specify 
  the &quot;target&quot; after the command as &quot;say&quot; followed by your 
  custom text. For instance, typing &quot;<b>/point say points at a dangerous 
  creature indicating that he is ready to kill it</b>&quot; will cause your character 
  to execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and display &quot;CharacterName points 
  at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; to those 
  nearby.<br>
   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Emote 
  Codes</b></p>
<p>When creating custom 
  socials, you can now use a series of &quot;%-codes&quot; that expand into various 
  pieces of information when the social is executed.<br>
  <br>
  The %-codes are: </p>
<p><b>%T</b> - Returns 
  the current target.<br>
  <b>%S</b> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun 
  for the target (He, She, It).<br>
  <b>%O</b> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun 
  for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>
  <b>%P</b> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun 
  for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>
  <b>%R</b> - Returns the race of the target (only works 
  on Player characters).</p>
<p>For example, if 
  you have a target of &quot;a gnoll&quot;, the following emote:</p>
<p><b>/point say points 
  at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.</b></p>
<p>...Your character 
  will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation with a text output of &quot;CharacterName 
  points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it.&quot;<br>
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>User 
  Interface</b></p>
<p>The User Interface 
  features new options and screens that allow players to remain in the &quot;Full 
  Screen&quot; video mode when playing the game, rather than switching to the 
  lower resolution &quot;Overlay&quot; mode. As a result, the additional windows 
  superimposed on the full screen UI are greater in number and support additional 
  options:</p>
<p align="center"><b>Positioning</b></p>
<p>Windows can now 
  be moved to a location of your preference by clicking on the upper left-hand 
  corner of each window, moving it to a location of your preference, and clicking 
  again to set it into place. This option is set on a &quot;per-resolution&quot; 
  basis, so you can have different window positions for each resolution.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Scaling</b></p>
<p>The Chat and Spell-effect 
  windows can be scaled in size by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging 
  to the desired size, then clicking again to set the option. This option is set 
  on a &quot;per-resolution&quot; basis, so you can have different window scaling 
  for each resolution.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Enabling / Disabling 
  Windows</b></p>
<p>Each window in full 
  screen mode can be enabled or disabled for viewing by engaging the customizable 
  hot-key combination for that feature and window. The defaults are:</p>
<p><b>ALT - B</b>: Buff/Spell 
  Effects Window<br>
  <b>ALT - P</b>: Party (Group) Window<br>
  <b>ALT - C</b>: Chat Window<br>
  <b>ALT - S</b>: Spell Gem Window<br>
  <b>ALT - H</b>: Hotbox Window<br>
  <b>ALT - T</b>: Target Window<br>
  <b>ALT - Y</b>: Self-Status Window<br>
  <b>ALT - M</b>: Menu Window<br>
  <b>ALT - L</b>: Lock down window position<br>
