      am still working on the HTML so that they can all be viewed, however, I 
      do have 3 pages of them done, with 45 thumbnails per page. Some of the pages 
      may take a bit to load, but, until I get everything organized,and have them 
      all working, it will have to do. The mailserver for the domain is still 
      not working, so, I am not receiving any mail to the krystoff@asa-tru.com 
      email address, for the time being, I can be reached at the krystoff@hitter.net 
      address. I apologize for this, and am working with our host to see what 
      we can do to get the mail working properly again. See you all soon.</font></p>

      Currently working on the links link, adding links to informational sites, 
      other guilds and message boards. I will be redoing the color scheme of the 
      message boards a little later. Also updated the links page, and did some 
      revisions to other areas of the site. If you see something or have any links/alliance 
      information, please email it to me.</font></p>

      you will see 4 sections, and their description. I am working with Layers 
      now, and trying to enhance the look and feel of the site. Some of the things 
      on the right are ideas that I had, others are ideas submitted by many of 
      the members of the guild. I am working on getting all the members listed 
      properly, and I would actually like to get some small screenshots of each 
      member, so that I may post them along with their name, race, class and level. 
      As I get new additions to the site, I will post them here.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Did a complete revision of the website, 
      still working on getting some sections of it done to my satisfaction, I 
      will keep everyone updated as to it's status. This area will be for the 
      news/information, mostly regarding the site itself, however, I will also 
      post information that I feel important enough that everyone should take 
      a look at it, in this area as well. Thank you to everyone for the praise 
      and positive comments that you have all been giving me since I took over 
      as the Scribe. I greatly enjoy making our site one that is a joy to browse, 
      and I will do my best to add many features to the site, that were missing 
      before. Once again, should you encounter any problems with the site, drop 
      me an email at <a href="mailto:krystoff@asa-tru.com">krystoff@asa-tru.com</a> 
      and I will take a look at it and get any problems with the site fixed as 
      quickly as possible. Thanks for your encouragement and positive thoughts. 
      Safe Hunting All!!!</font></p>
