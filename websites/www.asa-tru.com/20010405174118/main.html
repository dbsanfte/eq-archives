    <p align="center"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Here's the ***PATCH DAY*** 
      message, for your viewing enjoyment.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">*Spell Changes and Additions*</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- A new teleportation spell 
      has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards. These are self-only 
      gate spells to the Dreadlands. These spells should be available on the more 
      exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Increased the drop rate on some 
      Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those 
      spells as the game evolves.</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><br>
      - Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain 
      types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available 
      in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">*Item Changes*<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Changed the effects on the Singing 
      Steel Boots and Greaves. After a fair amount of concern from players, we 
      have removed the summon food and water effects from these items. They have 
      been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling 
      Screech (greaves).<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- The Incandescent Bracer can now 
      be worn on the wrist rather than the waist.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- The Incarnadine Breastplate must 
      now be worn to activate.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons 
      of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">*Bug Fixes*<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Fixed a bug that was causing some 
      players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Corrected an error with the Bixie 
      Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were 
      unable to Feign Death after Foraging.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are 
      now seen as animals.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison 
      vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">*Enhancements*<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Fixed a problem that occurred when 
      players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut 
      for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such 
      an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. <br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Added /showspelleffects. Using this 
      toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle 
      effects for spells. This will only affect spells, not world effects like 
      waterfalls or weapon particle effects. This should allow you to turn off 
      many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects 
      of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like 
      those on certain paladin weapons...<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Added server-side filtering for 
      chat and combat messages. This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, 
      auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses 
      me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at 
      the server instead of at the client. This can reduce that amount of data 
      sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections 
      with better performance and connectivity.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Ships will now be announcing their 
      arrival in most zones. They will also be announcing their progress to any 
      zone they travel through. Any of those zones that they are not currently 
      making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will 
      now repeat in the chat window. This means that when editing what you've 
      typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor 
      will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release 
      the keys.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- The spell slot number will now show 
      up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the 
      Alt-Spell Number method.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- View perspective in wolf form has 
      been fixed. First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather 
      than a few feet above it. At the same time, perceiving other players in 
      wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a 
      few feet above it.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- Trade skill success and failure 
      messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, 
      as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients. Failure of 
      the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message 
      being sent.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- In order to prevent a few trade 
      scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window. You will have 
      to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved 
      in the trade.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">- We're now sending hitpoint updates 
      to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when 
      the spell lands. This will allow those casters that try to stand as far 
      back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the 
      messages should be surpressed.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">*Quest*<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Several new quests have been added 
      as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might 
      have new information for you.<br>

      us... Can't you just feel the love... Hopefully, we'll see some good, positive 
      changes with the patch, as I have not seen anything released for it, as 
      yet, I will update the site, as soon as information is available for it. 
      Keep an eye out. I also updated the Members' List, to reflect some recent 
      additions and promotions, not to mention updating the levels on some of 
      our members... It's amazing to watch us grow in strength and size, we're 
      getting closer to being able to do a lot of raids on our own...<br>
      More to come when patch update info is available.</font></p>

      </font></b><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Today is PATCH DAY!!!! YAY! (Sarcasm 
      is thick...) Some decent changes on the live servers, however, got to give 
      them credit, they are working on attempting to make it a better game. Here 
      is the patch message, for those of you who simply press &quot;Play EverQuest&quot;, 
      instead of reading what the patch was all about.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#CCCCCC"><font color="#FFFFFF">*General 
      Changes*</font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="2">-- Doubled the chance 
      gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <br>
      -- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others 
      once casted upon yourself.<br>
      -- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>
      -- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book 
      or alt+b.<br>
      -- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>
      -- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One 
      on Antonica and two others on Kunark. NPCs at these locations can fill you 
      in on the details. Good hunting.<br>
      -- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the &quot;Celestial 
      Healing&quot; effect has been increased to one minute. We understand that 
      this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing 
      alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch. We did, however, 
      need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on 
      the group tank. When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied 
      to those items retroactively. <br>
      -- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill 
      values over 100. Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>
      -- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players. 
      You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing 
      /inspect. <br>
      -- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over 
      the chat window.<br>
      -- Fixed &quot;Breath of the Sea&quot;. It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br>
      -- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone. 
      This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists 
      and clean up your pet.<br>
      -- &quot;Voice Graft&quot; will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) 
      of your pet.<br>
      -- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>
      -- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125. It was the 
      intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before 
      the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better. With 
      the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>
      -- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.</font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="2">*NPC AI Adjustments*</font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="2">-- Level 60 players with 
      the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 
      60 to 65. Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<br>
      -- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount 
      of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies. Prior 
      to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this. This is why 
      NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>
      -- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much &quot;temporary hate&quot; 
      when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>
      -- The maximum amount of &quot;hate&quot; that an NPC can add when witnessing 
      a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>
      -- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number 
      of hitpoints healed. Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point 
      of hate. Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.</font></font></p>
