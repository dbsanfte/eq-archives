Application Process: The application process to join Asa-Tru has changed.  Please read this section CAREFULLY, especially if you are thinking about joining Asa-Tru. 
**Change in Application Requirements, Effective May 13, 2002 - All Applicants must be at a Minimum Level of 20 before the Application will even be considered. All Applicants must be sent to fill out an application by a current member of Asa-Tru, and must follow the procedures listed herein to join Asa-Tru.**<br><br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
1.	To even be considered for membership to Asa-tru, Applicants must be of 20th level or above. If you are not this level, your application will not even be considered. Applicants must be sent to our website via a current member of Asa-Tru. If this is not the case, the application may not get the consideration that it is warranted.<br><br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
2.	All applications to the guild must go through the Application section of the Asa-Tru Application Page.  Post your Character Name, Race, Class, Level, Times you can be contacted in game, who you know in Asa-Tru, and alternate characters that you would like to have us contact should you not be on your applicant character.<br><br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 
3.	Any potential member MUST know who the guild master is and have a basic understanding of the guild charter. If they do not, then applicants need not be considered for this guild. It is the job of the Officers to determine if they meet this requirement.<br><br>
        </td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
4.	Once an applicant has sent their form to the guild via the application page, that person must group with Asa-Tru members at least 5 times. Those who group with the applicant should then post their opinions of said applicant under that person's thread in the Potential Members board. The post should also include the date that the member grouped with the applicant. Any post that does not include a date of the group will be deleted. Only Warders and above can post on this board. After the Applicant has met the grouping requirement, they may then be voted upon by the guild.<br><br>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
5.	Any officer may lead the vote. The vote will be done online in guild chat. There must be a minimum of 10 members of the rank of Warder and above online for the vote. The officer leading the vote must note the names of those voting and the vote that they made. This is to be posted under the Applicants name on the Sponsor board. The vote must be unanimous. Any applicant not receiving a unanimous "aye" vote will be declined membership into this guild. 
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
Assuming that the Applicant received a unanimous "aye" vote, the Officer who led the vote will then post under the Potential Member board that the Applicant is approved for membership. Any Officer may then induct the Applicant into the guild.
