  <p><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="5">Loot Rules</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Need before Greed applies ALWAYS. If you 
    have something, if you wont use something, if you only need it to sell, if 
    it isn&#146;t an upgrade to an existing item, on the Character you brought, 
    than DONT roll for it. Transgressions against THAT rule will result in heavy 
    disciplinary action in one form or another, be it through Strikes, or through 
    the loss of Lotto privileges for an amount of time determined at the time 
    the transgression is found.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">On multiclass loot, there are some items 
    that are multiclass, but fit certain classes more than others. Or fit all 
    classes that it CAN be used for equally, BUT... benefits the guild more as 
    a whole in the hands of certain classes. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">How to do this fairly? Much debate... 
    Much discussion, compromise of sorts was come to after much discussion on 
    this. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">No one can argue that some items are better 
    off going to some classes, and that some items are just more fair going to 
    certain classes, even when other classes CAN use them. Solution?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">BEFORE the raid, we research, what comes 
    out of this zone?<br>
    All the items we can find on the web for that zone, even if we think there 
    is little or no chance of that item dropping, we post the classes that will 
    be allowed to roll on each item, and we check the board each day to make sure 
    there were no questions as to why we did it like that, and if there were we 
    answer them, if people have further question or comment on a particular item 
    after we have answered their post, we make time to talk to them in game, hear 
    them out, hear their reasoning, and actually consider their opinion. If we 
    still feel the same way they get a heartfelt apology, but the decision stands. 
    IF we change our decision, we post it, and it stays that way. The Hunters 
    refuse to flip flop continually on items, if the privilege of having The Hunters 
    hearing your agreements seems to be abused, this privilege will be revoked.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">ALL lotto is performed by the person assigned 
    to doing lotto&#146;s, raid leader has final say. Everything is randomed on 
    a number assigned basis, and rolled by the person assigned by the raid leader 
    to do lotto's.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Note: Winning a Multiclass item WILL count 
    as your loot until everyone from your class wins something.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">The raid leader will determine ahead of 
    time what is and isn&#146;t &quot;uber&quot; loot and make that posted as 
    well, and will also make the determination as to whether or not &quot;uber&quot; 
    loot is separate from &quot;normal loot&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">In raids where the vault is paying for 
    regents, we MUST remember to include ALL classes that will be using them for 
    the raid, clerics, enchanters, Mages (call of hero has a regent). This will 
    be handled by the treasurer and the Hunters. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">In raids where the vault is NOT paying 
    for the regents, we MUST remember to include those classes in the loot system 
    for the cleric loots, even if its in a different capacity (such as providing 
    runes)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">As far as No Drop class only loot goes, 
    this was a loooong debated issue, here's what we came up with. If you win 
    something, you're out until all other people from your class have won something, 
    there IS an exception to that. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">There are certain, though not many, pieces 
    of armor that most everyone would consider Junk for their class, a good example 
    is the cleric bracers from Hate, which we've had to, in the past, INSIST *SOMEONE* 
    *ANYONE* we don&#146;t care WHO loot, just so it doesn&#146;t rot, because 
    NO ONE wanted them, especially if it was going to count as their loot for 
    the raid. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">No one wants to see something rot, and 
    we came up with a dozen different scenarios as to how to handle this, and 
    could find none that didn&#146;t have some kind of bug to them. The eventual 
    decision was that each class would discuss BEFORE the raid amongst themselves, 
    what was and wasn&#146;t to be considered Junk. They then tell the raid leader 
    what was Junk, and he in turn informs the lotto leader. Thereafter, anyone 
    from that class can roll on that item, for that raid, and it WON&#146;T count 
    as their loot. IF an item drops, and YOU consider it Junk, but the raid leader 
    wasn&#146;t informed that this was to be considered Junk loot, and anyone 
    from your class disagrees with it being Junk loot even if no one else wants 
    it, it counts as your loot. If an item defaults to you because everyone else 
    has it, and you take it, and it wasn&#146;t Junk, that is your loot, until 
    everyone from your class has won something.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Kick-Backs&#133;Something else long debated. 
    Should a person who won something be able to, for the chance to lotto on something 
    else, be able to give back an item he already won? And if so, should he lose 
    the original item?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Here&#146;s the deal folks&#133;If you 
    win something, and later on something else drops that you would like to be 
    in on the roll for, you can Kick-Back the item you already won, for a chance 
    at winning on the item that just dropped (note, this only applies with non-no-drop 
    items). IF you win on the new lotto, you give back the item you had won originally. 
    If you lose, you keep your original item. YOU MAY ONLY DO THIS ONCE PER RAID. 
    Be sure it&#146;s the item you want to do it on, you don&#146;t get another 
    chance.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Example1: Weesh wins the Boomstick of 
    Buttkicking!<br>
    Later, the Uber-Boomstick of MUCH Buttkicking drops. Weesh wishes to roll 
    on the Uber-Boomstick. He offers up his Boomstick, and rolls on the Uber-Boomstick, 
    he loses, keeps his Boomstick, but cannot offer it up again to roll on something 
    else that drops. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Example2: Weesh wins the Boomstick of 
    Buttkicking!<br>
    Later, the Uber-Boomstick of MUCH Buttkicking drops. Weesh wishes to roll 
    on the Uber-Boomstick. He offers up his Boomstick, and rolls on the Uber-Boomstick, 
    he wins, gets the Uber-Boomstick, and then the Boomstick goes BACK to the 
    lotto pool, and is rolled on by everyone who can and will use it. Weesh may 
    NOT offer up the Uber-Boomstick to roll on something else.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">These are the lotto rules as they stand 
    now, they can and will be edited as necessary, any time they are changed we 
    will be posting a reminder to re-read them. </font></p>
