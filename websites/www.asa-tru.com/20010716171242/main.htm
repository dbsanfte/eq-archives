      for you.</font></p>

  <ol>
    <li><font size="2">Impending Merger<br>
      -The merger with Order of the Unjust has been put on hold, indefinately, 
      while we do some restructuruing and they determine if they would like to 
      still go through with the merger.<br>
      -Just to note, it has nothing to do with either guild not liking the other, 
      it has to do with our restructruing and the fact that Order of the Unjust 
      is actually growing in leaps and bounds, and are becoming a force unto themselves.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Structural Changes to Asa-Tru<br>
      -The Structural Changes to Asa-Tru will be happening soon, Malek, our illustrious 
      Guild Master, has made it clear that there will be some definate changes 
      to the way our guild is organized.<br>
      -The changes that are planned, from my understanding, are mostly for the 
      better, and will more aptly define the Structure of Asa-Tru, making it easier 
      to find the definative Chain of Command within the guild.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Site Change<br>
      -In case you didn't notice, the new site is in place.<br>
      -The new message boards are not 100% operational, yet, bear with me.<br>
      -I will be sending out a mass email, within the next week or so, with the 
      information that I require, in order for you to have access to the new boards, 
      some of you already have the information in to me, and I will send you what 
      you need, once I get the boards operational.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Updating<br>
      -I, hopefully, will be able to maintain a more regular schedule of updating 
      the site, however, I am only one (1) man, and I can only do so much by myself.<br>
      -I will be getting a little more help from some members, who have voiced 
      that they would like to help. You know who you are.</font></li>

      <br>
      -- Aggro Changes: We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their 
      targets. It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense. But 
      we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and 
      so that you won't think that it is a bug. NPCs are now much more aware of 
      the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets. 
      NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that 
      they can't harm.</font></div>
    <font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FFFFFF">--Spell 
    and Item Interruption: Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly. You will 
    no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells. This will not 
    affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect 
    all items, even those with song-like effects.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#CC9933">Spell 
    Changes</font></b><br>
    <br>
    -- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though 
    not with each other).<br>
    -- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br>
    -- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br>
    -- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br>
    -- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br>
    -- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br>
    -- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists 
    if the target is not summoned far enough.<br>
    -- Egress will now work indoors.<br>
    -- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's 
    Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be 
    cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br>
    -- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, 
    Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br>
    -- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with 
    Acumen.<br>
    -- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br>
    -- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br>
    --Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br>
    -- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br>
    -- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br>

    <br>
    -- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste 
    buffs.<br>
    -- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the 
    higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win 
    out. This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br>
    -- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 
    30 minutes. This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br>
    -- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, 
    it will only be wearable on the finger.<br>
    -- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look 
    more unique.<br>
    -- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game. The Circlet of Shadows, 
    can now be found in its place. This item differs from the original only in 
    that it has a five-second casting time. Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain 
    the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at 
    some future date.<br>

    you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br>
    --When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player 
    that had them targeted will lose their target. This is true for all servers, 
    but has the greatest implications on PvP servers. The use of spells that allow 
    you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if 
    that target hides or goes invisible.<br>

    cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br>

    weeks. For example we have corrected all misspellings of &quot;deity&quot; 
    in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br>
    -- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br>
    -- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting 
    after starting it will cancel it. <br>
    -- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101. This was a problem 
    for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100. <br>
    -- The messages for eating and drinking now say &quot;Chomp... Chomp,&quot; 
    or &quot;Glug... Glug...&quot; so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br>
    -- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first 
    person view when in combat. <br>
    -- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit. It should be a more interesting zone 
    now. <br>
