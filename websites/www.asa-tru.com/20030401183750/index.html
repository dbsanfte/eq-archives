    <TD width="100%"><FONT face=Verdana size=2>On the 24th of March 2003, 
      Yvonne Ridley and John Rees, as part of Teesside Against the War's weekend of demonstrations and events to raise awareness of the issues surounding the Iraq 'war', gave 
      a talk on the Iraq crisis at the Middlesbrough Town Hall crypt here in the UK. A video was 
      taken of the event with the intention of providing a web presentation of 
      the talks for Internet users who were unable to attend the event for various reasons.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>The audio in the video is pretty quiet as the facilities where the video was shot did not have an 'audio out' connection and so we had to rely on the camera's inbuilt microphones but the result is still audible if you turn up the volume on your speakers.</FONT></P>
