  <p>Hello! Thank you for expressing an interest in joining Asa-Tru. Since we 
    are a guild that prides itself on being a &quot;Family&quot; type guild, and 
    one with a high level of honor, integrity and prestige, we have made some 
    changes to the induction process. Please read this page fully, before completing 
    the application, as, if you do not meet the following criteria, you will not 
    be considered for membership. Please read carefully, before you submit the 
    application.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>1. All Applicants must be of at least 15th level or higher.</p>
  <p>2. All members must be sponsored by a minimum of 2 current, qualified Asa-Tru 
    Members (if you wonder who is qualified to sponsor you, see the member list).</p>
  <p>3. All Applicants must group with current members, a minimum of 5 separate 
    times, for a duration of at least 1 hour, each time. This is in order to evaluate 
    the Applicant's group behaviour and general way of behaving.</p>
  <p>4. All Applicants MUST READ AND UNDERSTAND the Asa-Tru Charter, as well, 
    you must be aware of who the Masters and Mistresses of Truth are, as they 
    are the GUILD MASTERS of Asa-Tru.</p>
  <p>5. Once you have met all the requirements, and are sponsored, you will be 
    given a &quot;pop-quiz&quot; by one of the officers.</p>
  <p>6. Once all the above is complete, it will be put forth to a vote by members 
    of the guild, who will vote to either accept or reject your application.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Once the vote is completed, you will be contacted, and notified of the result. 
    If accepted into the guild, you will enter the guild as an Initiate of Truth, 
    and enter a 30 day probationary period, during which, you may be removed from 
    the guild, for breaking any of the rules. We do this to protect all our members 
    who have worked very hard to give us the good reputation that we hold on the 
    server.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Thank you, once again, for your interest in joining Asa-Tru. If you continue 
    on to the Application, best of luck to you, may we see your name in Guild 
    Chat.</p>
