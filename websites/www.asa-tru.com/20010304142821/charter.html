  <font color="#FFFFFF">ASA-TRU is a guild of High Honor. As a member of this 
  guild, your loyalties are required to have this obligation. ASA-TRU has determined 
  that the enjoyment of roaming the lands of Norrath be the Number One (#1) priority. 
  We are here to build one of, if not, THE, Best guild in the lands. This guild 
  provides friendship, loyalty and protection. In general, ASA-TRU is here for 
  you, and all other members. To betray any one member is to betray the entire 
  guild. If you are attacked by an outsider, you shall have the entire guild standing 
  beside you. There is no tolerance for breaking of the rules stated below. There 
  is, also, no tolerance for treachery or lack of self-discipline. Be brave and 
  honorable, and the guild will flourish, as will all of the members who support 
  it.</font></p>

<p><a name="#deception">B. <b>Deceptions and Falsehoods</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">An 
  ASA-TRU Member will not promote lies, cheats, &quot;Bug Usage&quot; or insults,

  <font color="#FFCC33">1.</font> If an ASA-TRU member becomes bored and decides 
  to turn in their Tome of Discord, and become a Player-Killer, he/she will be 
  immediately exiled and they will NEVER be welcome back into the Guild.</font><br>
  2.<font color="#FFFFFF"> Intentionally training aggressive monsters or NPC's 
  upon another player, no matter what the circumstances, is considered Player-Killing, 
  and is a BANISHABLE offense, if you are caught doing it, you will be banished 
  from the Guild. If there is a question as to whether or not you did so, intentionally 
  or not, you will be questioned by the officers, as will all parties involved. 
  If you admit to doing this, you will be asked to leave the Guild, of your own 
  accord, or will be removed by one of the Officers.</font></p>

<p><a name="#betrayal">D. <b>Betrayal</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">Any ASA-TRU 
  member who has been charged with betraying the Guild, attempt to subvert the 
  Guild, or, in any way attempt to break down the moral structure or morale of 
  the guild, etc., will, immediately, go before a review by the Officers. If found 
  guilty of the said charges, they, and all other ASA-TRU characters they may 
  have, are to be removed from the guild, at once. Anyone found to be supporting 
  a person in the same fashion will be brought for review, as well.</font></p>

<p><a name="#language">E. <b>Language</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">No ASA-TRU 
  member will use language considered being obscene or vulgar, period. If you 
  are caught using vulgarity, you will be given a warning, depending on the content 
  or severity of your language. The Officer or Officers on line will document 
  each subsequent offense, as they occur. Should it appear that there is a pattern 
  to this behavior, you will be given a strike for each offense thereafter. Continued 
  abuse will lead to a probationary period, where you will remain in the guild, 
  but, be under constant scrutiny of the entire guild. You will be re-evaluated, 
  upon the completion of the probationary period. The decision to allow you to 
  remain in the guild will be decided at that time. (Note: If you group with people, 
  and you know them well, what you do and say with them is up to you. If you offend 
  one or more of them, and they report you, that is your fault.) <font color="#00FF00">*If 
  the language you are thinking of using is questionable to you, the best recourse 
  is to not use the language. The best policy is to just not use any language 
  that could be considered to be an expletive...</font></font></p>

<p><a name="#dropping">F. <b>Guild Dropping</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">On 
  more than one occasion, members have left the guild, then, later, decided that 
  they still wanted to be a member. Any member who leaves the guild has forfiet 
  their right to membership from that time forward. If you worked at a company, 
  quit and later decided that you wanted to go back to that company, the chances 
  of your rehire are exceptionally small. The lack of faith, duty, trust, loyalty 
  and other issues arise from such an action. ASA-TRU is a family. If you choose 
  to leave that family, you must face the consequences. Think before you react. 
  We all work hard at making a family atmosphere, remember that we all have good 
  and bad days. If you are having a bad day, log off and think about it. What 
  you add to the ASA-TRU family is as important as what you take out of it, should 
  you leave. Talking of leaving the guild, frequently, is just as bad as actually 
  leaving the guild. Talk of leaving the guild or game, on a consistent and frequent 
  basis, is demoralizing and will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</font></p>

<p><a name="#discipline"><b>III. Discipline</b></a><br>
  <font color="#00FF00">The breaking of every rule has its consequences. These 
  ARE circumstances which will follow the associated breach of conduct.</font></p>
  
<p><a name="#strikes">A. <b>Three Strike Rule</b></a>:<font color="#FFFFFF"> Each 
  ASA-TRU member gets three strikes, that will gauge their status in the guild. 
  Your behaviors and actions will dictate if you get a strike. Violation of any 
  of the guild by-laws listed herein can prompt an Officer to give a member a 
  strike. The severity of one's actions can bring about more severe sentence, 
  such as two strikes for one action, or summary dismissal from the Guild. As 
  certain offenses do not necessarily warrant a strike, a verbal warning may be 
  issued. The officers will monitor strikes and after 3 strikes; a person will 
  be put on probation for a period of two weeks. If, during that time, the person 
  brings dishonor to him/herself or the guild, or breaks another by-law, they 
  will be removed from the guild. After a period of one month of &quot;good&quot; 
  behavior, each strike against an individual can be removed. Exceptional deeds 
  can also prompt the removal of a strike, based on the decision of the Officers. 
  You cannot build up good deeds and &quot;bank&quot; them to wipe out negative 
  deeds, as they appear.</font></p>

  can be deguilded at any time during their probationary period, for any reason, 
  whatsoever. Asa-Tru is a guild of high honor, and one that is strict in its 
  rules, therefore, we will attempt to weed out those that would tarnish the guild 
  name, before they have a chance to. If you have a problem with this, then you 
  may wish to consider whether Asa-Tru is the guild you wish to join.</font></p>

<p><a name="#member">A.<b> Membership</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">All members 
  can and are encouraged to suggest people to apply to become members of ASA-TRU. 
  All hopeful members must contact a Crusader or the Sentinel for interview/questioning. 
  All applicants must be of level 15 or higher, must have read and understand 
  our charter, rank structure, and know who the Guild Masters are. From there, 
  all potential members must group with existing Asa-Tru members a minimum of 
  8 times for a duration of one hour, or more, each time. Once that is completed, 
  the applicant must be sponsored by a minimum of two members. If the person is 
  OK'd by the Crusader or the Sentinel, they will put that person up for a vote 
  to the Officers. The recruitment team is in charge of making sure that all members 
  are notified of the result of each voting session. For a person to become a 
  member, they must have two or more members sponsor them for induction. NO candidate 
  will be made a member until they have provided information to the Guild Scribe 
  regarding any character that is to be Guilded. Information needed is: Email 
  Address, Character Name, Character Race, Character Class, Character Level, ICQ 
  # (if applicable), and your real first name (last name is optional).</font></p>

<p><a name="#application">B. <b>Application Process</b></a>:<font color="#FFFFFF"> 
  The application process to join Asa-tru has changed, there is a bit more to 
  it, now. Please read this section CAREFULLY, especially if you are thinking 
  about joining Asa-Tru.</font></p>
  <li>
  <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">1. To even be considered for membership to Asa-tru, 
    Applicants must be of 15th level or above. If you are not this level, your 
    application will not even be considered.</font></b></p>
<li> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>2. All applications to the guild must go through 
    the Sentinel via the web site application. The Sentinel will do the initial 
    evaluation of all prospective members. The Sentinel will post the name, class, 
    race, and level of any applicant meeting with his approval in the Potential 
    Members section of the Guild Message Boards. </b></font></p>
<li> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>3. Any potential member MUST know who the guild 
    masters are and have a basic understanding of the guild charter. If they don't, 
    then they do not need to be in this guild. It is the Sentinel's job to determine 
    if they meet this requirement. All Keeper's must also verify this requirement 
    before they sponsor an Applicant. </b></font></p>
<li> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>4. Once a person has been posted on the Potential 
    Members board, that person must group with Asa-Tru members at least 5 times. 
    Those who group with the applicant should then post their opinions of said 
    applicant under that person's thread in the Potential Members board. The post 
    should also include the date that the member grouped with the applicant. Any 
    post that does not include a date of the group will be deleted. Only Warders 
    and above can post on this board. After the Applicant has met the grouping 
    requirement, the Sentinel will verify that all grouping reviews were favorable. 
    If so, then the Sentinel will place the Applicant on the Sponsor board. The 
    Applicant will then need 2 sponsors. These sponsors must be of the rank of 
    Keeper of Truth or above. No Keeper may sponsor more than TWO applicants in 
    a 30 day period. Once the Applicant has received 2 sponsorships, the matter 
    may then move to a vote. </b></font></p>
<li> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>5. Any officer may lead the vote. The vote will 
    be done online in guildchat. There must be a minimum of 10 members of the 
    rank of Warder and above online for the vote. The officer leading the vote 
    must note the names of those voting and the vote that they made. This is to 
    be posted under the Applicants name on the Sponsor board. The vote must be 
    unanimous. Any applicant not receiving a unanimous &quot;aye&quot; vote will 
    be declined membership into this guild. </b></font></p>
<li> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>6. Assuming that the Applicant received a unanimous 
    &quot;aye&quot; vote, the Sentinel will then post under the Sponsor board 
    that the Applicant is approved for membership. The Sentinel or any Crusader 
    may then induct the Applicant into the guild. </b></font></p>
  <p><a name="#support">C. <b>Support</b></a>: <font color="#FFFFFF">If a person 
    is in need of a specific event, item, spell, level or anything else, they 
    should ask the guild for support. The Guild is meant to function as one body. 
    Higher-Level character members should take it upon themselves to help newer 
    or lower level members, as appropriate. Lower level characters should not 
    abuse this, nor ask for it too often. Try to find other members or people 
    to group with that you feel good about hunting with. Those people may make 
    good members in the future.</font></p>
