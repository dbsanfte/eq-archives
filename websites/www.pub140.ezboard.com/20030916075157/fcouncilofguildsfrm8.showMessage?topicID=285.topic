I have talked with several people about the leadership that have approached me, and I have finally come to a point to declare who my replacement will be.<br>
<br>
Qamgine, supported by his guild Royal Knights of Light, will be taking over as Dragon Raid Liaison from me, effective after the next Vox raid.  His first raid will be the Lord Nagafen Raid most likely (unless something screwy happens on rotations).  I am very confident of his abilities to lead these raids successfully, in the tradition of the Dragon Leaders before him.  I want to wish him luck with this honor, though hopefully he will not need it.<br>
<br>
I want to thank everyone that has supported me over my term as Dragon Liaison.  It has been a great honor to lead you all in battle, and I have loved every minute of it.  I will try to show up to support when I can, but I will not be at every raid like I was before.  I hope everyone will give Qamgine the same support you gave me.  I will see you all at the planes raids. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

You help to continue the leadership of one of the noblest and most visionary gathering of people on Karana or any server.<br>
<br>
That everyone, regardless of class, guild, or level has an opportunity to at least see and help to kill a Dragon in Everquest.<br>
<br>
KCoG still represents the finest example of people coming together not for loot, or money, or prestige, or glory; but rather to make sure that the experience itself is open to everyone equally.  Life, even in a virtual fantasy world like Everquest, isnt always fair.  But its through the hard work and dedication of those who have stood up to lead that everyone else's time here on Karana is made better and brighter.<br>
<br>
It is not an easy thing.  And there will be times you will be pounding your head against your keyboard, or possibly the wall, asking yourself why you're even doing this.  Yet, I can assure you that when all is said and done, when you are sitting back a year from now, you will be glad you did this.<br>
<br>
And always remember, the rest of us are still out there when you need help.  I'm always available either in game, on the board, or even through email.  And I'm pretty sure the rest of our former raid leaders are similarly available.<br>
<br>
While many of us have moved beyond KCoG, and that is a good thing because growth is good, I think you'll find none of us have forgotten what we owe to KCoG and those whose vision first created it so long ago.<br>
<br>
So I wish you congratulations in advance of the good times, and my condolences for the bad.  You have taken the road less travel by and I think it will make all the difference.<br>

Yup, Kellory as usual summed it up lol. It's tough, sometimes it's pretty bitter but in the end it's alot of fun and we never do forget <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Alot of people are usually nervous to go on raids when there is a new leader in town, prove them wrong hun! and I will be there when I can to cheer you on hehe. Some people pass through CoG and never look back, others come back again and again to support and to encourage and to help. We don't always have alot of time to share but we do our best. Don't be shy to drop me a tell if there is a raid (I'm usually a bit oblivious to alot of things heh) but I love to come along if I don't have a target that evening.<br>
<br>
So, good luck to you in good and bad times and we will always cheer you on from the sidelines!<br>

There were people who thought back then that we couldn't do it, and not only have we proven them wrong, time and again, we've managed to stand the test of time. <br>
<br>
This will be one of the most rewarding and frustrating things you've ever done, and there will be moments when you'll wonder what you are doing it for. But you'll know it when you see it. There's not much better than the feeling of leading 50 or 60 strangers on an experience they'll likely never forget. It will affect both your game life, as well as the things you think about real life leaders as well. <br>
<br>
As always, I am just an email away from any questions you have, at haemish@mail.com. Good luck, I could think of no better replacement for Farrnusno. <br>
<br>
And I'd like to also offer a word of thanks to Farrnusno, for stepping up and fulfilling the duties of the job with panache and savoir faire. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Following a class act like Azure was no easy thing, but you pulled it off.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>
