<br>
&quot;LET'S BE PERSONAL&quot; Broadcast June 5, 1973 CFRB, Toronto, Ontario <br>
<br>
Topic: &quot;The Americans&quot; <br>
<br>
The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the earth. <br>
<br>
As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtze. Who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did. <br>
<br>
They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. <br>
<br>
When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. <br>
<br>
When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries into help... Managua Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped. <br>
<br>
The Marshall Plan .. the Truman Policy .. all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war-mongering Americans. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. <br>
<br>
Come on... let's hear it! Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar or the Douglas 107? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or women on the moon? <br>
<br>
You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times ... and safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them ... unless they are breaking Canadian laws .. are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here. <br>
<br>
When the Americans get out of this bind ... as they will... who could blame them if they said 'the hell with the rest of the world'. Let someone else buy the Israel bonds, Let someone else build or repair foreign dams or design foreign buildings that won't shake apart in earthquakes. <br>
<br>
When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke. I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. <br>
<br>
Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. <br>
<br>
Our neighbours have faced it alone and I am one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. <br>
<br>
I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians. And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th Annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. <br>
<br>
This year's disasters .. with the year less than half-over… has taken it all and nobody...but nobody... has helped. <br>

<br>
Chill Out.<br>
<br>
There was nothing inflamatory nor derogatory about Lagdalen's post.  Perhaps you dont agree with it, but thats life.  She was not the one using profanity here.  One of the many differences between us and the terrorists is that we are supposed to be able to tolerate different and conflicting viewpoints.  One of the great things about America is that we not only allow people to publicly trash and humiliate us, but we actually encourage it.  Its called free speech.  When you try to limit that for nothing more than differing views then you really are starting on a slippery slope that can only end by becoming as intolerate and narrow minded as those who who perpetrated this act.<br>
<br>
And as a matter of fact, Lagdalen does have a good point.  The world has changed a lot in the last 30 years.  But regardless America does not, and never has, stand alone.  While it is true that America does head many humanitarian groups so do many other countries.  As we have aided other nations in the past, so to are those countries stepping forward to provide what aid they can now.  Thats what being part of a global community is all about.  Not a lot different from what CoG is all about.  <br>
<br>
Instead of focusing solely on the loss and the negative I suggest we look to the positives.  How America has come together over this.  How we heard countless tales of people helping others, even as these buildings collapes around them.  Hero's arent born in war and destruction, they're born of people who put others ahead of their own safety.<br>
<br>
Just remember, it is hatred and intolerance that leads down the path to evil.  There is no One Way and tolerance is something we are all supposed to be striving to maintain.  More so today than at any other time.<br>

<br>
I think maybe people need to take a step back before posting any kind of political stuff here.  Follow the kitten link from my earlier post and calm down before starting new flame wars within the CoG boards.  That's not what we're here for.<br>
<br>
While I will back anyone to the fullest the freedom to voice their opinion, I think good taste and restraint are also in order.  People are still in shock, still hurt, and indeed, still suffering from recent events and we need to take that into account before making remarks here.  I'm not saying opinions shouldn't be voiced... I'm just saying that making inflametory remarks at a time like this is going to attract all the hot-heads to respond with venom.<br>
<br>
So take a step back and think about what you are posting before you post it... that's all I ask.  And if someone posts something you don't agree with... take the time to remember that freedom of speech is one of the founding principles of this great nation before you call for them to be censured for thinking differently than you. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.
