We had 3 ful groups and had 19 people in total show for this.<br>
<br>
They are as follows:<br>
Vanissa, enchanter<br>
Cyan, druid<br>
Titanyia, druid<br>
Perciful, paladin<br>
Cassia, enchanter<br>
Faydin, warrior<br>
Sarmadlor, wizard<br>
Fingolfinn, warrior<br>
Lumari, cleric<br>
Jusaridus, ranger<br>
Darkform, necro<br>
Ottersoul, ranger<br>
Horudil, shaman<br>
Brennen, cleric<br>
myself warrior<br>
and 4 others, am sorry my notes do not have the others.<br>
<br>
We were able to start very close to a<br>
our start time, the first group left just after 2pm. This group was led by Brennen and was quick to gain the Pit, the other 2 groups followed shortly after.  My group went the end of the gorge and found Enynti, who yielded a Rune of Fortune for Vanissa's enchanter mask.  <br>
<br>
The 3 groups then assembled outside the front gates of the castle after Brennen's group had cleared the area.  We made our first attempt to enter the castle itself and were dealt a serious setback in the Grand Hall.  Many died. <br>
<br>
Darkform and others pulled corpses to the zone to be res'd by Lumari. We did so in a reasonable time considering the number.  <br>
<br>
Our next sortie saw groups 1 and 3 led by myself and Jusaridus attempt to gain the front entrance and Brennen's group 2 gain entry from the Grave Yard. Brennen's group was successful and made it to the Bath.  The other 2 groups secured the front of the castle and then cleared the Grand Hall.  Seeing that it was a short walk fromm the Hall to the Bath we made our way to the 2nd floor and headed toward our destination.  Unfortunately a wrong door was opened enroute.  Many poured out into the corridor, dividing us and trapping us in that corridor.  Many died again.  <br>
<br>
Corpse recovery was much more difficult this time requiring both undead and normal invis to drag corpses back.  It was not until 8pm cst that all were recovered.  <br>
<br>
Some people lost levels during this, some spent much time naked at the zone waiting for corpse recovery.  At the end Dban, a rogue, and Brennen's group did good work in helping assist recovery.  <br>
<br>
Personal Lessons<br>
Working 3 groups together is much harder than 1 group of 6, someone else in the group would be better to run the group<br>
/shout is better than /tell to comunicate with other groups<br>
<br>
Group Lessons<br>
As a whole we did not do /assist well.  This is essential to maximize the benefit of enchanters.  Too often we negated that benefit and had to fight several small fights rather than 1 at a time.  Even if we had done this per group our effectiveness would have been enhanced.  Every group should have a designated target for /assist, when a MOB is killed wait for the next to be selected and /assist again.<br>
When moving in a dungeon let the one selected as guide open doors, others opening doors cost us dearly this day.  We were 2 doors from the Bath when we got boxed in the corridor, I saw several doors opened, all with trouble behind.  Stay behind the guide and just follow.<br>
<br>
Committment<br>
Mistmoore was chosen because it would be a challenge, not because people would not die.  In such hunts it should be expected to loose and not gain experience.  This event was advertised as such and regrettably lived up to it.  <br>
<br>
I would like to thank all that attended for the cost endured and their thanks.  I am glad that many indicated they enjoyed the event considering what happened.  <br>
<br>
I welcome comments from or on behalf of those that attended.  <br>

<br>
I tried to lead 3 groups of Lightbringers into Mistmoore once before with some serious firepower.  We never made it to the bath on 2 attempts due inpart to one person wandering off to &quot;check&quot; the maid and butler.  The 3rd time we got routed due to casting to close to the tower and training those mobs.  After that experiance I knew what not to do but all it takes is one bad apple &amp; it will not matter how good everyone else is.<br>
<br>
I actually had to spend some time with one of the tanks in our group explaining how to setup a Social with /assist Perciful.  To his credit he started useing it rather effectively.<br>
<br>
*now if I could just get them to stop attacking pets and go after the caster's 1st*<br>
