<br>
This was so much fun last time, we are ready to do it again!!!<br>
<br>
On Saturday, Novembe 18th, the Silver Daggers will be hosting a raid on Kedge Keep. Our allies and friends are welcome to attend. The raid is being organized by Cassia Spellsinger of the Silver Daggers.<br>
<br>
What: Raid on Kedge Keep<br>
Who: Silver Daggers, Seekers of Knowledge, Illuminatus, Storm's Justice, Flame of Eternal Chaos, and friends.<br>
When: Saturday Nov 18th 1pm CST, 2pm EST, 11am PST. (The dungeon will be entered 30 minutes after the listed time.)<br>
Where: We'll be gathering outside of the entrance to the Estate of Unrest.<br>
Level: 35+ <br>
Goal: To acquire the bone needed to complete the level 49 paladin spell quest for Kellmourn.  (Or to take Phinigel if Kell already has his bone.)<br>
<br>
Dogedme Kingson of the Seekers of Knowledge will be battle commander for this raid, and will be making a follow up post about how we will attain our objectives.<br>
<br>
Those needing teleports need to arrange them prior to 30 minutes to the meeting time. Once it is 1pm CST there will be no teleports given by those who are already gathered. Please make arrangements the night before, or come on before the event with enough time to get there.<br>
<br>
The primary objective of this raid is to clear Phiny's room so that Kellmourn can pick up the bone needed as the final component for his spell quest.  If Kellmourn has already acquired his bone by the time of this raid, the primary objective will switch to taking down Phinigel Autropos, with a secondary of holding the room and allowing other paladins to collect the needed finger bones.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that the primary purpose of this raid is to complete a quest. Exp gain, loot, and all other things are secondary considerations. It is very likely we will acquire those things, but they are not the purpose.<br>
<br>
Items will be lotto'd among the classes present who can use them using the /random 1 200 command. Ties will roll again. If no one present can use the item, the item will be lotto’d among all present. When a lotto item is looted, the group leader should /tell me immediately what the item is. I will coordinate with the battle commander to hold the lotto between fights, with the group leader being responsible for handing off the item to the winner.<br>
<br>
I will be in charge of handling lottos and loot problems. Please coordinate with me, and not the battle commander. Group leaders will designate someone to loot. The primary purpose of looting in Kedge is to clear the fish so that we can see and target. Fish scales should be handed to the EB caster, shaman should be allowed to pick up the quest item for the totemic BP (as well as anyone else who wants), Mages should be given the shark skin, and otherwise, unwanted or duplicate lore items should be destroyed. Items of value (drops off of named mobs and gems, things of that nature) will be lotto'd. Please check if an item is no drop, there are a number of nice no drop things in Kedge, /tell me if it is a no drop item, and the classes present who can use it will lotto for it. Otherwise, loot immediately, and /tell me what the item is.  Note:  Most of the stuff Phiny drops is no drop, please be very careful when looting.<br>
<br>
Fingerbones for paladins:  Kellmourn (if he does not already have his) will be the first to pick up the bones.  After that, it will be decided by level.  The highest ranked paladin who needs the bones will loot, and then the next highest, and so on down the line.  If two paladins are of equal level, they will roll to see who will pick up the bones next.  I believe the bones spawn every 15 minutes or so.  If we are able to break the room, paladins will be getting the bones for so long as we can hold it.  Please do not attempt to get them without talking to the raid commander, even if it is your turn, he will coordinate that, as well as all other movements on the raid.<br>
<br>
Late arrivals should wait outside Unrest. Contact me, and I will talk to the battle commander. Ultimately, it's his decision. Once the raid progresses down near Phiny's lair, I doubt late comers will be able to join, but give me a tell, and I'll ask the battle commander. Attempting to reach us on your own will almost certainly result in death, please wait until we can either escort you in, or inform you that it's not possible.<br>
<br>
A puller will be designated by the battle commander. <br>
<br>
A special note about pullers: Once we reach the staging area for Phiny, the pullers will need to be monks. If you know a high level monk who would like to come, invite them along. If you are a high level monk, you can almost bet that you will be pulling Phiny's room. Please read this guide: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Phreekittys_Ultimate_Guide_to_Kedge_Keep.htm">everquest.allakhazam.com/...e_Keep.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
in particular, near the bottom where it discusses pulling the seahorses from Phiny's lair. The battle commander will be in charge of all decisions, but the more informed you are, the better. This raid cannot succeed without the help of high level monks. <br>
<br>
All communication with me, as the raid organizer, will be via /tell, leaving the public channels open for use by the battle commander. As a reminder, we are attempting to increase our raid success rate by paying more attention to group and raid discipline. Players who repeatedly break discipline may be asked to leave the raid. Warnings, and removal from the raid in the unlikely event that should become necessary, will be handled by me via /tell at the request of the battle commander.<br>
<br>
Another special note about spell resists: The fishies here are almost entirely immune to cold spells. They are said to be susceptable to fire and electric based spells.  <br>
<br>
I leave it up to the Battle Commander to select the beverage of choice.  Our first attempt at this was a great deal of fun, for all involved, and I welcome you all back to join us.  If you have questions or wish to contact me, please do so at skylarlumin@aol.com.  Space on this raid may be limited, so please sign up at:<br>

Let's go again!<br>
<br>
This raid will proceed much like our last one, for those who participated. The movement plan for getting to the objective worked extremely well, and we'll attempt to duplicate that on this raid. The primary difference will be that we're going to pull Phinigel's lair using a Monk, as we'd hoped to do last time, but were unable to accomplish. Additionally, I believe Cassia is trying to line up an Enchanter or two of sufficient level to Mez the Guardians if things go wrong on the pull. Mana Sieve will remain a primary component of the lair battle, as that worked extremely well.<br>
<br>
We'll group and organize outside the entrance to Unrest. I'll send someone down during this time for a camp check. Once organized, we'll move down and zone in. When you zone in, move immediately away from the entrance, and be alert for any group camping the entrance. Do not interfere with their pulls. Our point man should give us notice if there is a group working the entrance.<br>
<br>
Once we're in, we'll pull to the second floor. We've done this part enough that I expect it to go smoothly. We'll set up in one of the rooms on the second floor, and from there begin pulls to clear the way to the Patriarch room. Be alert for movement orders, as we'll move as soon as the puller has the way clear for us. Mana and buff management will be paramount here to make sure we're not caught short once the way is clear.<br>
<br>
From there, we'll move to the ledge, rest/med/buff, then invite Phinigel and friends up for a chat, one at a time if at all possible.<br>
<br>
We've worked hard on raid and group discipline on our last few raids, and here is the payoff. Any one person breaking discipline can destroy this raid. Raid discipline on our last Kedge raid was phenomenal and I'd love to see that happen again this time!<br>
<br>
Assist will be on the puller. We'll have enchanters, and we must allow them to control multiple pulls for us.<br>
<br>
Movement orders will be given using /shout. Please make sure you have the shout channel turned on before we zone in. LD, AFK, etc (any unusual situation) will be done via /ooc, while group leader reports should be done using /say. Additionally, the puller(s) should change their inc hotkey to use /ooc.<br>
<br>
Finally, exp and loot are NOT the purpose of this raid. Please do not attend if that is what you expect to achieve. The purpose of the raid is to retrieve the bone from the floor of Phiny's lair, which neccessitates killing Phinigel. Any exp or loot gained in addition to this objective is strictly secondary in nature.<br>
<br>
See you all in Cauldron!<br>

<br>
<br>
Thank you for contacting Verant Interactive Technical Support.<br>
<br>
Crashing to the desktop is mostly related to sound issues rather than <br>
video. I didnt see a listing to what sound card you have. This is most <br>
common with Sound Blaster Live series but can happen in others also.<br>
<br>
This problem may be fixed by adjusting the 'Sound Acceleration in the <br>
DirectX Diagnostic Tools.  Please follow the instructions below.<br>
<br>
Click on the Start Menu,<br>
Click on Run,<br>
Type in dxdiag and click OK.<br>
<br>
This will load DirectX Diagnostic Tools.<br>
<br>
Select the Sound Tab,<br>
Adjust Sound Acceleration down to Basic.<br>
<br>
If that setting does not work try turning it down to None, that will <br>
turn all sounds off.  Please try these settings and see if they help.<br>
<br>
If you have any further questions please feel free to email us again, or<br>
call us  Monday through Friday, 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. PST, at either <br>
1-888-STATION (1-888-782-8466) or (85<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  537-0898.<br>
<br>
Just something to try, if you experienced this problem last time, or experience it on Saturday.<br>

I had a blast at the last Kedge raid and I'm looking forward to being able to help out on this one. This time some of my brothers and sisters from the Stormseeker family and some of our wonderful friends are ready lend their assistance as well. So far I have tentative confirmation from:<br>
<br>
Zealpath<br>
Zetta - 47 Bard<br>
Xeni - 37 or 38 Bard<br>
Faldron - 47 Enchanter<br>
<br>
and me!! Lilyana - 47 Paladin<br>
<br>

Our rather large band of merry adventurers gathered this fine Saturday morning outside of Unrest.  Dogedme put us into groups (there were 6 groups in the beginning).  Thank you everyone for your patience.  It's always difficult to divide that many people into equal, strong, balanced groups.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We moved in a great deal faster than the last time, and immediately Kellmourn began pulling the first floor.  We breezed through the dungeon.  Really, little stood much of a chance in front of us.  Unfortunately, none of the named spawns were up on the first few floors.   Fortune did shine upon us in Boil's lair, we encountered the tainted seahorse.  This was a glorious battle, with the corrupted seahorse spawning immediately in the place of the tainted.  Neither stood a chance against our combined might.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sadly, at this time I made a few errors, which resulted in me dying 3 times in rapid succession, and therefore, when it came time to lotto the epic quest item, I was sunning myself outside of Unrest, being rezzed, and then lazing about in the sun again.  Because of this, Minnx (who had also died) was not given a rez quickly enough to be included in the lotto.  (The person handling it in my stead did not have a list of who should be in the lotto.)  I am sorry, Minnx, and I want to thank you for your patience and understanding.  Congratulations to Lindam, who won the lotto.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  We made it to the ledge in Phinigel's room, and were instantly greeted by two swirlspine seahorses.  I'm not really too sure where they came from, but they might have heard of our approach, and just decided we merited a friendly greeting.  We took them down with relative ease, considering the trouble we had with them last time.  Kellmourn began to pull the seahorses, and things were going very well...with one exception, Phinigel decided not to show his face.  Halagar, and Dogedme petitioned, and we were told they would repop the zone.  We kept the spawn clear for a while, merrily killing off seahorses and working on getting Lilyana her bone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her untimely demise slowed up the operation, but soon after she was rezzed, she recovered the finger bones needed for her quest.  Congratulations, Lilyana!!  We continued to take down seahorses, and a paladin who had died trying to get the bone earlier, Sinyatis (sp?) was able to loot the bone as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We were working on getting the last bone we needed for Reeiyna, when ill fortune caused Kellmourn to go link dead on a difficult pull.  It seemed that he would be okay, he wasn't losing health, but just before he was to leave the group, he died.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Our ill fortune continued, when Turtil and Zetta's efforts at finding his body so we could rez him were unsuccessful. Thank you both for trying so hard to find it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We persevered though, and Pippi had the great idea of trying invis to get the bone for our remaining paladin.  We'd heard of both success and failure with this technique, so we invised Turtil, our guinea pig puller, and sent him down to determine the viability of the idea.  We found that neither the swirlspine, nor the guardians see through invis.  The danger exists only when Phinigel is in the lair, and then, for certain you will be spotted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So Dogedme sent Reeiyna down invis, and we all held our breaths.  She returned moments later, victorious, and holding the bone!  That was three we had looted for the day, and all of the paladins on the raid had acquired their bones.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We faced a very difficult pull at one point, in which Samdorla (our only remaining cleric) actually camped.  I believe at the time we were facing (we were only about 4 groups now, none of them full) 2 Swirlspine Guardians, and 1 swirlspine seahorse.  Our druids, Pippi and Lindam worked hard to charm the Guardians.  The magic resistance is so high on the swirlspine that they were unable to charm it, but their work with the two Guardians swung the tide of the fight.  Though we lost many people (I'd wager over half our force), we emerged victorious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Gm's informed us that they were not going to repop the zone, and so we had one thing left to do.  Find Kellmourn's body.  We finally suggested, after what was over an hours worth of searching for it, that he should petition.  While he was waiting for word from the Gm's, and Samdorla was working hard to rez our fallen friends, on a whim, I /tar Kell, and too my great surprise, managed to target his body.  I still wasn't hopeful, having done this very thing with Shoji's body the other night, and being unable to summon it.  To our surprise and delight, however, when I tried to drag the corpse...it came to me.  We believe that it must have been buried in the wall, and that's why we were unable to find it. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this time, most of the raiding party had gone their separate ways, and only two groups remained.  We acquired 1 more bone, and had a few more pulls, but for the most part, the raid was over.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One very exciting pull, where Kellmourn got the unwanted attention of two swirlspine seahorse.  Knowing that our force was probably too light to take their combined might, he promptly stopped, and told us to let him die.  For a reason that I cannot discern, after he died, the two seahorses continued along his path, and engaged us.  This was a very close, pitched battle (Lagdalen's generosity was of great help here...) in which we emerged victorious with only 2 deaths.  Thank you Laoliel and Jaykay for helping out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This raid a complete success.  Though we were disappointed that Phinigel did not present himself for our revenge, we did manage to ensure the looting of 4 finger bones, as well as take some much needed revenge upon the seahorses.  We acquired a few nice items in addition to that, and were able to accomplish our primary goal many times over, which was to get bones for paladins.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We did have a very brief chat with the Seahorse Patriarch.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He so very kindly gave up the fight quickly, and Katellin won the Wand of Ice.  We also acquired words of bondage, which Lagdalen won, and Breath of Ro, which Barbel won.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you, Dogedme for leading another wonderful raid!  Well done!  Thank you to Turtil and Kellmourn for pulling.  Thank you, Kellmourn for your incredible patience while we struggled to find your body, and thank you to everyone who stayed to ensure that happened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you, Munson, for bringing gnoll hide lariats for the mage pets.  Those worked really well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Thank you for all of your help, Pippi, and Kellmourn.  Thank you for your services, Ogun...I believe I dinged into 44 6 times in a 24 hour period, mostly in part to your diligent efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Special thanks to Lagdalen.  I had newly acquired the spell Rune IV, and had forgotten to purchase peridots.  She not only went out of her way to buy me a stack, but expended her own money to do so.  (This is quite an expenditure...the gems cost 10p apiece, and she purchased 20 for me.)  Lagdalen, I want you to know that nearly every one of those peridots saved a life.  Just ask Pippi.  Thank you so much for your generosity, and I want you to know that it truly made a big difference.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Very special thanks to Samdorla.  With the late arrivals, and the early departures, the groups were constantly fluctuating.  Because Enduring Breath cannot be overridden by a caster of a lower level, this very often presented problems in getting everyone on the same pace in a group...requiring a delicate and carefully timed switch by the person with the EB and the caster.  Most unfortunately, Samdorla died because of this.  She very graciously accepted a revive, forgoing the exp rez she could have given herself.  She was the only remaining cleric on the raid capable of an exp rez, and she sacrificed that to ensure the overall success of the raid.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once again, thank you everyone for coming.  Had Phinigel dared to show his face, I have no doubt that he would have met a quick death.  As it was, we were successful in our primary goal, many times over, and I believe everyone had a great time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Thank you Dogedme for leading this raid, as always, you did a fine job.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of attendees...again, because of late arrivals and early departures, my list may be incomplete.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We were blessed yet again with an outstanding, patient group of players!<br>
<br>
Kellmourn, Pippi, Lilyana, Munson, Lindam, Minnx, Turtil, Zetta, Ogun, Samdorla, Azuriem, Sareny, Mananin and Grayfox all get special mention, which is a huge number of standouts for one raid. In truth, virtually everyone should be mentioned as standouts this time around. As I go down the list of names, there are very few that do not bring to mind at least one act that warrants mention. Thank you all.<br>
<br>
Group leaders were nothing short of outstanding. I never had any doubts as to the status of any group the entire day, which made decision making a breeze. As always, we were very short of Clerics for a group this size. In the long run, I think we suffered little penalty for this shortfall. Oddly, we were also a little short of Druids/Shamans, leaving us short healers across the board for the entire raid. I do think we paid a small price for that shortage, but again, due to the skill which everyone displayed, the impact was not critical. The final shortage of note was, again as always, Enchanters.<br>
<br>
On the plus side, tanks and damage casters were plentiful the entire time. In addition to Pippi and Lindam, damage casters were pivotal for the 3 horse battle Cassia mentioned.<br>
<br>
Discipline was, for the most part, excellent. We did have some sightseers once we were on the ledge, but a quick word was all that was needed to pull them back to the ledge. One severe break in discipline did cost several deaths when a player left the ledge to search for Kellmourn's body after being explicitly told not to. He came charging back with a pull to a raid that needed time to rest before another battle. On the search for Kell's body, I'll echo Cassia's thanks to Zetta and Turtil for their hard work. If it had not been bugged, I've no doubt that between the two of you it would have been recovered.<br>
<br>
I'm disappointed in two things. One was the frequency of drops. In our previous visits, we've had a lot of success sending people away with a shiny new item from Kedge, but this time, there was just nothing in the way of loot. I find it hard to believe we killed that many horses and didn't get a single haste belt, but we did. The other was the failure of Phinny to show up for the party. We had some brief hope when I first petitioned, as the answering guide indicated a GM would indeed repop the zone for us. However, a half-hour or so later when the GM came on, he politely but firmly refused to do so. We were in the dungeon well beyond the normal spawn time if our information was correct on when Phin was last killed. Just bad luck, is all.<br>
<br>
Nothing really to add to Cassia's description of the raid. The very long 3-horse battle was everyone's highlight, I believe (unless you count those of us who got to take vortex rides &lt;grin&gt;). It was extremely well-fought by everyone there. No one lost hope even after I asked Samdorla to camp, though at the time I actually had little hope for victory in that one. Once Pippi fell to the onslaught, I thought sure we were done for, as she and Lindam were crucial to the fight, but everyone hung in and fought hard to see it through. I doubt there was an ounce of mana left in the survivors at the end, and we had several badly beat-up tanks, but almost exactly half our current number were still standing.<br>
<br>
Final observation is that I would ask everyone to please be on time if you plan on attending a raid. The only severe disruption we had was late arrivals. Latecomers are always a disruption, but in a Kedge raid that fact is magnified due to the absolute necessity of having a certain mix in each group.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, all, for making this a lot of fun! Cassia did a huge job putting this together and keeping it running for us... Thanks Cass!<br>
