I'm Rredd Soulfreer a 52 Paladin and officer of &lt;Souls of the Valiant&gt; I have done 4 or 5 KCoG Dragon raids starting in my low 40s.  When I was getting my own resist gear I did a ton of research.  Since then I have become our guilds resist gear expert and have been asked to write up something on resist gear.<br>
<br>
KCoG has stated a resist requirement for dragon raids.  The problem is that we don't have time to actually check each person's resists to see whether they meet the requirement so we have to take people's word that they meet the requirements.  That said, from personal experience, less than half the people there actually meet the requirements.  Usually this is because of a percieved expense for the gear plus the pain in the butt factor.  Keep on reading to find out more about why these requirements exist and how you can easily and reasonably meet the requirements as well as becoming a larger contributor. <br>
<br>
Vox raids require 70 Cold Resist and 70 Magic Resist. Nagafen raids require 70 Fire Resist and 70 Magic Resist. Why do we have these requirements?  Read on!  <br>
<br>
Fire/Cold Resistance: Nagafen breaths fire, Vox breaths ice.... sounds nasty...  it is!  This is an area of effect cold/fire attack that will affect all people in close range.  This means all melees and int casters (who have to close to melee range to land spells) are going to be hit with this breath weapon.  The higher your resistance, the more you will resist this.  So, for Naggy bring your FR gear and Vox your Cold gear.  I am always a little over the requirements on FR/CR and on dragon fights where I did not get any melee hits, I only took maybe 2 bulbs of damage from the FR/CR attack.  The only time I died I was at the front of the charge and Naggy decided to melee me first :-)<br>
<br>
Magic Resistance:  Both Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen have an AOE Fear effect.  What this means is that when the raid leader (Farrnusno) calls ATTACK 20 melee toons run in and start hacking away.  About 5 seconds after this about a third of the melee characters immediatly turn around and run away from the dragon...  In the case of Vox, some of them walk into a pit and fall down into the polar bears resulting in a painfull corpse recovery.  Firstly, let me say that this has NEVER happened to me... why?  Because I wear resist gear.  Typically my unbuffed MR for Dragon raids is 99 which exceeds the requirement.  The people that got feared most likely were under the required magic resistance.  How much damage are you doing to the dragon if you are running the other way?  The lower your level the more important the resist gear is.  Level plays a part in the resist equation as well but Gear is very important as well.  I would recommend getting the minimum required cold resist and as much MR above and beyond the requirement as you can.<br>
<br>
AC?  Well.... Vox/Naggy mostly melees one person at a time.  Sooooo if that person is not you, and it probably won't be, your AC is totally meaningless.  For dragons, consider MR + CR/FR to be your AC.  Getting those numbers as high as you can is what increases your survivability.<br>
<br>
So in summary here what one should have is an entire suit of resistance gear that you keep in the bank and pull out for dragon raids.  Sometimes you find other uses for it...   I was camping Cyndeerela in Ferrot at the entrance to fear yesterday. Cyndee is a Necro, dark blue to a 52 and with my MR at 117 she never feared me once.  I resisted fear probably once or twice per fight for maybe 20 pops.<br>
<br>
Now that you are hopefully sold on the very idea of resistances... the question is how to get it?  There is a TON of items that can be had for CHEAP that you can use to build a suit of resistance gear.  High end guilds REQUIRE that you have a resistance suit as they take down a lot of these dragon type mobs.  I have helped a number of people assemble resistance suits for reasonable cost so here is an assemblage of my favorite items seperated into price ranges, you may do better than this with Bazaar...<br>
<br>
&lt;50pp<br>
5FR 1AC - Earring of Fire Reflection (purchase from gypsies in Lavastorm) &lt;-- get 2<br>
10MR 6ac 3str Bloodstained Mantle (Plate + Chain Classes) Drops in Unrest - Nice place to visit...<br>
7MR Wolf's Eye Golden Bracelet (low end jewelcrafted item)&lt;-- get 2<br>
8 MR/CR/FR Dwarven Ringmail Tunic (chain/plate - Dwarf Gnome Dark Elf Halfling Wood Elf High Elf)  drops off of Emporer Crush in CB incase you had any old debts to settle....<br>
4mr/pr/dr 6ac 3dex 3agi Giant Needlite Wing (int casters)<br>
<br>
50-200pp<br>
20CR 8ac 10hp Cloak of the Ice Bear (drops off of Martar and Karg Icebear in Everfrost)<br>
10FR 8ac 5str Fireclaw Carapace<br>
10FR 7ac 2wiz 2int Kunzar Cloak<br>
10MR 15ac 2wiz 11hp Sarnak Headguard<br>
6 MR/FR/CR/PR/DR Blackened Alloy Coif (head item for plate/chain classes)<br>
10CR 5mr Crystalline Robes (int casters)<br>
Most Rygorr has some resists too.<br>
<br>
~500pp  <br>
8 MR/FR/CR/PR/DR Velium Diamond Ring (Very nice ring, probably this will always be a part of your resist gear right to end game) 2x<br>
3MR 10FR 10CR 5PR 5DR Golden Diamond Mask (also end game grade)<br>
20CR/FR Crown of the Froglok Kings<br>
<br>
There are Mage summoned resist blankets that you can put in your back or shoulder slot but we do not reliably have a high level Mage present at KCoG dragon raids.<br>
<br>
Really the bazaar has made all this soooooo much easier to do.  Basically go to bazaar, type /bazaar.  select your race and class then in the &quot;select by stat&quot; box select Vs Magic or cold or fire and check out the cheap stuff.  Look for items that have like 7+ resistance in one of the stats and pick yourself out a resist suit )<br>
<br>
Check mine out using my magelo link in my signature then by clicking on the fire and cold alternate profiles.<br>

After reading that, it makes me wonder if I don't want to use my mithril greaves for both dragons instead of icy greaves for Vox.  My CR is plenty high, but with the CR gear, my MR isn't much over 70.<br>
<br>
Also:<br>
<br>
If you're too big for the Dwarven Ringmail, a Cured Tizmak Surcoat has 7MR, although no CR or FR.  I think I looted this off a Tizmak someone left to rot in GD one night, they should be relatively cheap if you can find them at the bazaar, or relatively simple to get.<br>
<br>
Cape of the Midnight Mist (Neck slot) (7MR, 5STR, AC2) -- don't have a clue on cost or drop location.<br>
<br>
Runed Bone Fork (10MR/10FR/10CR) is great for melee types (except paladins, apparently... not quite sure why they're the only melee class that can't use it), in the range slot if nothing else.  I got mine at the bazaar for about 300pp, can't remember off hand where they actually drop, but it's an investment... as long as you don't accidentally throw the thing (like I did with my dragoon dirk), you'll be using it for a long time to come.<br>
<br>
Also a note on the BS mantle... if you're high enough level to be doing dragons, these should be easy for you to get... two of us went and camped this guy one night looking for oppaline earrings and I think we got about 8-10 (maybe more) BS mantles and not one earring.<br>
<br>
I'm still working on my resist gear, but you might find some more suggestions here:<br>

<br>
On the MR vs CR/FR score... I made a number of posts around and the consistent answer was MR&gt;CR/FR ESPECIALLY if you are lower level.  If you are getting feared you NEED more MR. The FR/CR is damage mitigation and the fights typically don't last all that long.<br>

We had a group of 5. Myself, 52 Ranger, 50 Druid, 54 Shaman, and a 51 Monk. We made our way to the King easily. Then we just pulled one at a time and the King spawned. The only problem was actually getting the spot. We had to wait about 1 hour and a half. But we got the King and I was lucky enough to get the crown. It's great resist. Can't beat 20FR/CR.<br>
<br>
Bazaar is great for it. And most don't over charge for it. You can easily get your FR/CR/MR up to 70 each without too much problem. May require farming or saving up pp. But it's worth it in the end.<br>
<br>
Melee's you don't have to worry too much about sacrificing AC/Melee Stats for the sVGear. I leave all my other armor the same except, head, face, one wrist, one finger, and neck. Those items are my sv gear. I loose some AC/Str/and HP but the little bit I loose will save me from those casts that would wipe me out even if I did have the HP/AC. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Most times, if you know what you are doing, you'll only get hit two or three times by Vox or Naggy, and AC won't help much in that. It's the AOE's that you have to worry about. They usually melee for around 225, but others will get aggro before you die, if you turn off auto attack the minute it turns its attentions on you. However, the AOE's can do up to 1200 or so hit points if not resisted; the higher your resists, the less damage you'll take. <br>
<br>
On my first raid (yes, the old one is reminiscing now), I was only level 39 (I was leading it, so couldn't not go for level). I was feared almost constantly, even with higher than a 70 magic resist. The next dragon raid I was 40, and just the difference in one level meant my time being feared was cut in half. The more levels I got, the easier it was to resist the fear, especially if I kept my magic resist up. By the time I was 49, I'd have fights in which I was feared for less than 1 second only once during the battle. <br>

Here is CastersRealms listing of Resist Gear for all classes. They allow you to sort by a slot. Great way to do a little 'homework' before you hit the bazaar or camp mobs.<br>

They drop: Tattered Gnomish Cloak.  This, a metal rod, and firewater can be combined ( trivial 82 - tinkering ) to make a Gnome only Thermal Cloak, which gives 20 SVF and AC 6. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

This need not be expensive yes blue diamond stuff is nice, but you can put together some good equipment really quite cheaply.  And Magic resistance is the most important resist to have high. See top post, it says it all.<br>
