I am just going to point out what some of the breakdowns I saw were.<br>
<br>
First of all, when I arrived to help, I was VERY confused on who the Raid Leader was.  IMHO, the leader needs to be confident, in control, and above all, have as much knowledge as possible about the zone to be raided.  If that person is lacking in knowledge, that person needs to be willing to accept info and help from others that may save the raid, or at least save someone's butt.<br>
<br>
Second.  If you came for planar armor and/or epic drops:  don't expect to get them.  Don't ask if the mobs that drop these items will be pulled soon.  Don't ask if they are up.  Don't worry about anything farther away than listening for the puller to say &quot;INC&quot; or the MA to say &quot;assist&quot;.  Period.  End of Story.  If your mob gets pulled, be thankful.  If the item drops, be surprised.  If you get it, be elated.<br>
<br>
Third.  The break.  Sometimes the break goes surprisingly well.  More often than not, the break will take AT LEAST an hour.  Sometimes considerably longer.  I've heard varying numbers, but there are somewhere around 20 mobs to take out near the zone in.  They tend to come to the break group in 3's and 4's, all the while chatting to the rest of the zone on their cellphone about this great party in the SW corner of the zone.  Chain aggro can and will wipe a break in group.  In case you have not seen it in action, it's a lot like getting adds when a creature gets pulled - except that anything in aggro range of the add also can aggro.  And anything in range of the add's add can also aggro.  I have seen and heard about large chunks of the zone being pulled by accident because someone sat down at the break in camp.<br>
To sum it up, the break in takes time.  And the more people get antsy while waiting for the break to get done, the more spam I see in the raid channel.  Bring a book, talk to group members, let your pets duel, whatever.  Just don't be a burden to the break group - or the RL while he's trying to make sure that he doesn't have to call for a rescue party because 40+ people just died .<br>
<br>
Third.  If you have a suggestion for the RL, /tell the RL.  Or your group leader.  Don't announce it in a raid channel.  This leads to confusion, and more deaths.  If you are the RL, take all the help you can get.  But don't let someone else take control, unless you are willing to hand over that control.<br>
<br>
A couple of suggestions I have for future Fear raids:<br>
1) try and get a group of level 60+ to be the break in group, and if possible, have them in zone at or before the meeting time.  This will not often be possible, I guess its sort of a pipe dream.  But they will have a smaller aggro range because of their level, and should have a evac'er to save on deaths.  Its more important to get them out safely and whole than to take on more than they can handle.  If they can get about the first 10 mobs, another group should be able to come in to help, and shortly after that, the rest of the raid.  Works in theory, anyway.<br>
2) Farr did this, and it ended up working pretty well:  Figure out how many groups you will have, and start assigning people to be group leaders.  I think on the last couple of Fear raids he did this, we met at 8ish, and had most at the first camp by 9:30ish, so it definitely saves time.<br>
3) I think this has been pointed out many times before (as with the rest of this post...), but FEIGN DEATH DOES NOT WIPE AGGRO IN FEAR.  If you FD because of aggro, do not stand back up until you have either camped out, or you have watched every creature that had aggroed you die.  the biggest reason for this (other than wiping the camp is bad) is that the Amy you aggroed may have decided to wander.  Up towards... say... the castle.  As he's running back to pound you, since you stood back up, he has a good chance of bringing with him everything he passes by on his way.  Imagine being that RL when some monk stands up to loot his corpse after feigning his way to camp.  And about 45 seconds after he stands, about 30 mobs run into camp, including at least one mini.  I know I would have to seriously strain myself to not dump that person from the raid, put him on ignore, and completely abandon him.<br>
4)  If you do not have an assist button already made by the time you get high enough to go on a planes raid, you prolly do not need to go.<br>
<br>
Ok, I think I've rambled enough.  You will always have mistakes on a raid.  It will always be someone's first raid, and there will always be someone who doesn't know anything about the zone.  What I'm trying to do here (along with everyone else that has made a post like this - and there are a LOT) is point out that if we can do everything possible to make sure the mistakes are small.  The best raid to Fear I've ever been on was with KCoG.  As well as the worst.  The only real differences between those two raids was the cooperation, knowledge and tactics.  It is up to each individual to make the next raid better than the last. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ffejdoowsk>ffejdoowsk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/18/03 12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why Fear Didnt go as well</span><hr size=1> <br>
I think we were able to get back on our feet and have a decent first attempt at Fear. What we need to do for next time:<br>
<br>
Break In:  Get a good game plan.  There are NUMEROUS ways of breaking in Fear and we just need to figure out which is best for us.  There is NO ONE WAY to do the break in.  I think it depends on the groups experience.<br>
<br>
Here are some suggestions:<br>
<br>
1.  NIGHT BEFORE:  Find out who has Fear the night before us and when they actually started.  This way you have a timer on the repops.  Zone in the night before to the wall and camp out.  This method only works good if you can get one high level or two group to do it.  Its is the safest way to break in Fear.  Everyone who camps out plays alts till the raid is suppost to start or goes to a chat channel to know when to log in.  Once this group has cleared the 12 mobs (There are 12 mobs that roam near the portal), then the rest zone in.  <br>
<br>
2.  Camp Out Theory:  We did this alot on the Rathe and it worked well.  Send in each group 10 secs apart.  The entire goal of the break in is to camp out as many people as possible.  The first group trys to kill as many mobs as possible and keep the mobs engaged.  You want to get a cleric camped out so they can do the rez.  You log out to a chat channel or alt and then when told to do so you camp back in.  One person must FD to keep an eye on the camp to tell when its clear to camp back in. <br>
<br>
3.  Full Charge Theory:  Man idea here is to try to kill the mobs in camp.  Send in the main group then the other groups 10 sec apart.  The key here is not to agro additional mobs.<br>
<br>
Also, I think we need to make sure everyone knows and more suggestions:<br>
<br>
1.  THESE MOBS CAN FEAR AND SUMMON.  If you get sent out of camp, DONT COME BACK.  Just died right there.  The worst thing you can do is bring more mobs into camp.  I watched one person last raid run around and bring 4 more mobs into camp.  <br>
<br>
2.  IF YOU GET LOST OR TURNED AROUND ON ZONE IN.  Dont come to camp!  Just die where you are.  Thats what coffins and summon corpse is for.  The worst thing you can do is bring more mobs into camp.<br>
<br>
3.  CALL OUT THE MAIN ASSIST AND DONT CHANGE IT.  Everyone needs to know from the start who the main assist is and to set up a key.  This should be done before the first group enters Fear.<br>
<br>
4.  ASSIGN SOMEONE TO CALL OUT LOOT.  Its a fact of life, folks get excited in Fear and thats part of the fun.  To cut down on the spam, someone should assigned the task of calling out the loot for each and every mobs.  This keeps folks happy.  Let folks know that loot WILL ONLY BE CALLED OUT after battles.  Have the person in charge of assigning the loot also in charge of handing it out in a random/fair manner.<br>
<br>
5.  START THE RAID ON TIME.  Fear raids can last up to 6 hours or more.  I would suggest starting the raid at a time that keeps that in mind.  Nothing is worse than the raid losing steam and folks gating out.  If the raid is suppost to start at 7:00 then tell folks to be there at 6:00 to get ready.  It helps the flow if the first group is going into Fear right at the start time.  <br>
<br>
6.  GET FOLKS COMMITTED AHEAD OF TIME.  It helps to know that you will have X number of clerics, X number of chanters, etc. coming to the raid and how long they can stay.  <br>
<br>
7.  ONLY EXPERIENCE IN FEAR WILL IMPROVE HOW FEAR GOES.  I would perhaps suggest that the first timers are put into a group and only zone in after the portal and surrounding area is clear.  This would be for their own safety and the raid. Then they can be put into other groups.  Mixing first timers with experiened players also helps to keep them out of trouble.  <br>
<br>
This last raid was a BIG SUCCESS because it was a learning experience.  Sure we made some mistakes but we learned from them.  The leader did the best job they could and should be saluted for taking on such a role.  <br>
<br>
We will get FEAR next time!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ebzent>Ebzent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/18/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Fear Didnt go as well</span><hr size=1> I agree with pretty much everything you said, ffejdoow, but for KCoG the hardest part of Fear has always been the break.  I will happily admit there are many ways to do this (including one of the more interesting ones I've heard, have 5-6 people zone in and try to pull as much as possible to the portal, where a bunch of casters basically AE everything to death).<br>
<br>
But in my experience, every single time KCoG has done well in Fear, it was because we've had a solid break in group.  In some cases 2 groups.  Not the whole raid force, not even close.<br>
<br>
The tactics are simple:  Kill anything that comes near you, until someone gets below 40% health.  Evac.  Go back in and do it again.  Once the break in group is having to start to pull, instead of waiting for a wanderer, the other groups start coming in.<br>
<br>
And again, not to point fingers, EVERY SINGLE KCoG fear raid I have been on has had people:<br>
FD &amp; stand without clearing aggro.<br>
attack mezzed mobs.<br>
Dot mezzed mobs.<br>
Not use assist.<br>
Not know who the MA/SA was.<br>
Sit in camp before it is safe.<br>
etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Introducing some of the break tactics you mention IMHO is asking for trouble.  They require teamwork, trust, and familiarity, which is hard to put together in a somewhat &quot;pick-up&quot; environment.  While sign up posts are helpful, things do change, and people get added and subtracted from the raid even an hour after the meeting time.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to say that any or all of these tactics should not be tried.  I'm just saying that it will take some practice as a (large) group, and practicing on one of our few chances at Fear may not be the best way to go.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there are other zones in the game where these tactics could be tried, and they don't have rotations.  If someone is willing to step up, Fear raids could me a lot more interesting, if nothing else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morrlokk>Morrlokk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/18/03 3:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Suggestion</span><hr size=1> Why don't we have people list the times they have been on a certain raid (Fear, Hate etc...)

Unless we can make that a bit more consistent (not sure how), I don't think counting on the sign-up lists is going to help more than a little.<br>
<br>
As I believe someone else mentioned, discipline is a big problem for us.  Because of the nature of KCoG, it probably always will be.  We just aren't going to be able to get a cohesive group that raid together regularly, and we almost always have a LOT of people new to that particular type of target (dragon, plane, etc.) on our raids.  Once people get a bit of experience, their guild has often (fortunately not always) gotten big enough to join the rotations on their own.  That's a handicap we're going to have to work around, because I don't see it going away.<br>
<br>
We also have the handicap of not being able to have a set discipline procedure in place.  With a single guild or formal alliance, if someone breaks raid discipline, they can be barred from some number of future raids or even kicked out.  We don't have that option... if we barred everyone who screwed up, we wouldn't have any raid force left, and who would keep track of it anyway?<br>
<br>
Also, getting one full group of 60+ for break-in isn't something I'd ever count on... there are many days when we'd be lucky to find a full group of 55+ in a raid.  <br>
<br>
That being said, I think there have been some very good points made here, and I think we can all learn alot from discussing what we need to do differently next time.  <br>
<br>
Also, there is discussion going on about changing the way the PoF rotation works.  It has been suggested (and is still being discussed) that the minis be put on rotation and the rest of the plane either be FFA or on a sign-up system.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that happens, I expect many of the guilds currently on the PoF rotation will drop out, and we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>may</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> find a bit more help from people currently are unable to help us because their guilds are in the rotation. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
1) 55+ Break<br>
Get a solid group of 55+ (preferably 60+) people.  You will need the following:<br>
- a tough tank (60+ Warrior, Paladin, or SK for preference)<br>
- good crowd control (60+ 'chanter or Bard)<br>
- a slower (Shaman or 'chanter for preference, as a Bard will most likely be on crowd control)<br>
- a solid healer (Cleric or CH'ing Druid/Shaman)<br>
- someone who can snare mobs in fear without being resisted much<br>
- as much damage as you can pack in to the group after the above requirements are met<br>
<br>
There are 14 mobs that patrol close enough to the break-in camp to agro someone who is 55+<br>
Keep everyone who is under 55 out of the zone until the camp is clear and safe.  Additional 55+ people can be brought in once the first group is at the camp and stabilized.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Bard Kite<br>
You will need one or two very brave bards who do not tire easily and a group capable of killing fear mobs.<br>
<br>
Send the bard(s) in and have them agro mobs to the south (and north as well if you have more than one bard) and kite them around in a circle.  The bards should NOT damage the creatures, as they will then summon and kill the bard.  Simple KoS agro should be plenty.<br>
<br>
After the bards enter, send in the kill group.  When they get to the camp, begin pulling creatures off the bards one by one (a simple non AE spell, arrow, or thrown object should be fine). As long as the puller is farther from the group of creatures than the bard kiting them, theoretically, only the tagged critter should agro on the puller.  Kill the creatures in the camp until there are none left.<br>
<br>
The patrol routes that can agro the camp tend to come from the north and south, so if there are bards circling there they should agro the bards first, and not bother the group in camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some other rules to remember about fear:<br>
<br>
- Do not sit down during the break in, ever (horses are ok).<br>
Sitting down more than doubles your agro radius.  For lower levels, sitting down can make creatures agro from almost as far away as you can see them with the clip plane all the way out.<br>
<br>
- Always assist the Main Tank (duh), and, this is important too, don't attack until they have called the target!<br>
On mez'd critters, attacking early, before the MT/MA has had time to taunt the creature can cause it to run over and slay whoever was keeping it mez'd.<br>
On multiple pulls, the MT/MA may need a bit of time to select the target that needs to be killed first, simply yamming on your assist key and attacking the first thing the MA targets can result in you breaking mez and getting everyone killed. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.chrometiger.com/~anubis/stuff/kommisig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
We used the single group break in method.  The key here is that you probably have groups 1-3 that are capable of doing the break so the idea is that you don't throw all your cards on the table at once, play one at a time.<br>
<br>
1 - Build 3 good strong balanced, potentially independant, groups with highest level people in group 1.  Hopefully all 55+, basically this is Kommisar's first strategy, the 55+ break.<br>
<br>
2 - Invite enough other trusted people to be group leaders to get the rest of the LFG people into groups.  Leave them to their own devices during the break to make groups.<br>
<br>
3 - Send in some FDers (like ebby here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) to scope out the west wall camp.<br>
<br>
4 - When the FD scrouts say that things are as clear as they can be, the first group goes in invisable.  Turn left, head to camp being VERY aware of any aggro that they have.  <br>
<br>
5 - Start clearing, if this group manages to kill 4-5 mobs before having to evac then they did GREAT!  Point here is to evac before you start loosing key people. <br>
<br>
6 - After evac Group 1 gathers again outside the portal, replacing anyone who died with people pulled from farther into the raid.<br>
<br>
7 - Repeat steps 4 &amp; 5 untill you have cleared or have things very well under control and the portal is clear.  If things look safe then you can bring in group 2 to speed up clearing the immediate area.  Again, each group 2 person on zoning in, swivel around to check for aggro, then walk carefully to camp, checking behind you for a train.  If things get out of control then you will have to evac again and go back to step 4.<br>
<br>
8 - Once the portal, the camp and all nearby wanderers are dead then you can bring in the rest of the people.  The reason to wait this long is that it keeps the lower level (MUCH higher aggro radius) people out of the zone untill the area is cleared.  Also, every person you have sitting outside the zone is a potential addition to the Next break group if the one before wipes out - basically they are insurance.<br>
<br>
9 - Everyone is now in camp, get a pull team working and get those mobs killed fast.  Clear all the wanderers and work towards any minis that you want to kill.<br>
<br>
A couple of points:<br>
<br>
Clearing Plane of Fear is generally done in a fairly methodical manner.  Pull everything you can to that first camp, this includes the whole west wall (not too far north if CT is up though) and about half of the south wall.  Then you move the camp along the south wall clearing the south side.  From the south wall you pull up the middle... again this all depends on what minis are up.<br>
<br>
Mobs are pulled in an order that is dictated by the LARGER strategy of clearing the whole plane and minis asap.  The puller is not picking and choosing which mobs to pull, they are clearing areas.  Asking the puller or raid leader to pull something specific NOW is foolish because they already have a larger order in mind and they will NOT be changing their mind on the order of things.  Pulling in PoFear takes 110% of the pullers concentration.  If you annoy the puller with requests then they are just as likely to pass up pulling your mob given the choice!  However as I said, the puller really doesn't have any choice - they are told by the raid leader to Pull an area clean, they will be taking the easiest and closest pulls first and nothing will be missed.<br>
<br>
Using a Pally for tanking here is a good idea because you won't be very successfull in getting people to wait for a warrior to get aggro.  With a Paladin tank and pally snap aggro abilities, as soon as the tank is swinging, everyone can attack.  This means faster clearing time.  I will admit a small conflict of interrest here :P<br>
<br>
Having people who have done PoFear before be your group leaders and have them reassuring the troops that yes.. it is supposed to go like this etc is a good idea.  <br>
<br>
One of the reason that Farr was so successfull in fear is that we were able to provide from SOTV and IoS our alliance a set of group leaders that had for the most part done lots of KCOG planar raids in the past, seen the good, the bad, and the ugly.  He also didn't take any crap from anybody.<br>
<br>
All that said, any PoFear raid where you got the plane broken and got some progress done was a good raid.  Seriously, if you aren't doing CR till 4AM it was a good night, regardless if you left a couple of minis up or wiped a few times, that happens.<br>
<br>
The no sitting thing is important, particularly before the camp area is 100% secure.  Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Pets - Pet control is a MUST here.  You must activly be aware of the location of your pet at all times.  The little imp guys proc a shadowstep on the main tank which throws him away from the camp, then the mob leaves the camp looking for the tank.  If pets chase him when he does this and then manage to get aggro on him then the tank won't be able to drag the mob back to camp and the pet will be out in the middle of nowhere soloing the mob... and it's friends... which become our friends when the pet dies.  If your pet is misbehaving you will be asked to kill it.  Do so immediatly and once you are ready to pay closer attention, you can have another one.  If the RL shouts &quot;Kill the air pet&quot; then kill it because it is probably out of your sight doing something it shouldn't be.  <br>
<br>
While things are still hairy in the main camp, the raid leader may choose to not allow pets at all.  This is not an insult to you personally.  Yes, he is probably aware of how pet aggro works nowadays.  The RL is also well aware that of all the pet classes on the raid, someone is probably a little tired tonight and not 100% on their game and so untill things are secure, they may not want pets around.<br>
<br>
Earth Pets = rooting pets = very very bad.  Root aggro rules are that the mob attacks the closest toon, not the main tank.  This means the mob is nearly untankable, dont do this please!  No earth pets allowed.<br>
<br>
Low Level Pets - There should be no low level pets in Fear ever.  Druid and SK pets fall into thie category - they are cute but they do insignificant DPS and while pets don't aggro when not aggressive, a level 30 boo boo bear attacking for 2 dps has a HUGE aggro radius and a mob that would otherwize have walked right on past will instead charge in.<br>
<br>
Nuff said for now :P<br>

With the change over at the KGC I felt it best not to seem to give too much favoritism to any particular group.<br>
<br>
But from what I've seen, and heard, over the last few weeks have led me to believe that was not really the best move.<br>
<br>
Anyway.  To address a few points here.<br>
<br>
You may not enter Fear early.  I will not hesitate to hand out a penalty to KCoG for breaking this rule.  Period.  The only way you may enter the plane early is if they allow you.  It doesnt even matter if that guild is no longer IN the plane.  It belongs to them and them alone until 12AM KCoG local time.  And then only if the other guild has left.  The guild up has until 3am EST to clear out.<br>
<br>
Okay, thats the rules crap out of the way.  Here's the main of it all.<br>
<br>
The Break-In.<br>
<br>
Preliminary break.  When I was running KCoG Planar raids I used 3 Break Groups max.  It didnt matter if I had 80+ people, only the 3 break groups went in until things were clear.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Simple.  Its far easier to control 3 groups than 12 on the fly with the crap flying.  Fear breaks have the potential with aggro and pathing issues to be one of the hardest in the game when it goes wrong.  Limiting yourself to only 3 groups is one of the easier ways to control that.<br>
<br>
Second, its far easier to find 2 other good group leaders than 12.  Just as its easier to find 18 good people than 80.<br>
<br>
Third.  Possibly the most important depending on how pessimistic you are, 3 groups max means that even if it goes to hell, you still have as many as 10 more groups ready to make a go at it before you need to call in the CR teams.<br>
<br>
So...3 groups.  Is the makeup important?  Or can I just slap together a bunch of tanks and healers?<br>
<br>
Absolutely.  The number 1 job of the Raid Leader at this stage is group makeup.  You screw this up, and you can kiss your raid goodbye.  No matter how many level 65's you have.  I've seen few things more sad in my life than 2 groups of Nightbane with 12 level 65's with 2 sets of warriors, clerics, and enchanters, along with their support get wiped trying to break Fear.  If they could screw it up, anyone can.<br>
<br>
My basic group setup was as follows for the break:<br>
<br>
Group 1 - AKA The Command Group<br>
<br>
Slot 1: Puller (FD capable)<br>
Slot 2: Tank (3rd most capable tank available)<br>
Slot 3: Healer type<br>
Slot 4: Enchanter/bard (your mezzer goes here)<br>
Slot 5: Random DPS class. (wizard preferable)<br>
Slot 6: Me (if you are not an evac class, than slot 5 must be an evac'r)<br>
<br>
Group 2 - AKA Main Assist Group<br>
<br>
Slot 1: Your Main Assist (Best tank available)<br>
Slot 2: Your Main Healer (Best healer available...usually a cleroc)<br>
Slot 3: Paladin<br>
Slot 4: Evac'r<br>
Slot 5: Shaman<br>
Slot 6: Random DPS class<br>
<br>
Group 3 - AKA Secondary Assist Group<br>
<br>
Slot 1: Your Secondary Assist Tank (2nd Best tank available)<br>
Slot 2: Your Second Best Healer<br>
Slot 3: Paladin<br>
Slot 4: Evac'r<br>
Slot 5: Random DPS class<br>
Slot 6: Random DPS class<br>
<br>
I always made sure my Raid Second (You know, that guy who will make all the raid calls like evac) is in Group 3 somewhere.<br>
<br>
You will note, none of the 3 groups are really perfect.  But they are geared towards one thing.  Mutual support.  You will also note there is only 1 enchanter here.  Resist the temptation to include multiple enchanters.  Unless they are used to working with each other, they will probably just get in each other's way and end up killing the other one.  Also, in case it goes to hell, you'll want a fully clothed enchanter in reserve.  Always keep an eye on your tactical reserves.<br>
<br>
Strategy<br>
<br>
Wait...this is a break.  Isnt it just go in and kill?<br>
<br>
After going through all that trouble of making the groups, nope.<br>
<br>
Okay.  So first off, get SoE or lev on everyone in the break groups.  Second, invis them all.  Yes, mobs at the portal see invis, but invis does lower aggro radius, and more important, some of the mobs at the portal DONT see inivis.  Half of a cake is better than none.<br>
<br>
Make sure your people know what they're doing.  Make sure they understand that once they enter Fear they are to turn LEFT and run to West Camp.  That they are NOT to move forward.  Not a single step.  They are to stand there, use the arrow key to turn LEFT and then move.  Or wait till they can.  Moving even a single step forward or to the right can cause aggro from a different direction if you are unlucky.  And the risk only increases as you move more.<br>
<br>
I cannot stress how often I see wipes because of this.  Never, ever, ever move forward or to the right on a Fear break.  Ever.  Burn this into your mind.  If this is the only thing you take away from this post, that needs to be it.<br>
<br>
So, you are going LEFT to west camp.  Bring your mobs.  Yes, dont stop.  Dont die.  BRING them all.<br>
<br>
Now here you have 2 different strategies.<br>
<br>
Typical Break.  Once you are in West camp you should have some mobs in camp.  1 or 10 it doesnt really matter.  Believe me, so long as your enchanter is halfway decent and does more on a daily basis than whore KEI or C2 in PoK they will be able to control up to 6-8 mobs at once.  I've seen the best keep close to 16 mobs mez'd and charmed and controlled at once in Fear.<br>
<br>
Then have your MA and SA pick their own seperate targets and engage.  Only use this method if you have many mobs in camp.  Otherwise, have everyone assist the MA.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do here.  Always use assist.  And be prepared to expel the first non-MA/SA person to break mez from the raid permenently.<br>
<br>
As long as your enchanter is alive, you can and probably will live.  As soon as your enchanter goes down, its time to evac.  Bottom line.  In this type of Fear break, no class is more important to success than your enchanter.  Break mez and get banned from KCoG raids along with your guild if necessary.  You need to be firm here, otherwise you might as well stay at home.<br>
<br>
In this break you want to always be prepared to evac to South Ro.  Here druids are better evacer's than wizards.  But remember, if you use a druid to evac, they cannot be a healer or nuker at the same time.  They must remain invis'd at all times till the break is over.<br>
<br>
Calling the evac is a tough call.  You want to kill as many wanderers as possible before evacing, but you dont want to lose anyone if possible.  Done right you shouldnt ever have to evac, but if you do, its an easy run back.  Do this 2 or 3 times right and you'll have cleared the wanderers easily.<br>
<br>
AE Break.  You can use the same group makeup (or slightly different one) to do an AE break.  This requires the Enchanter to chain stun.  And it would be preferable to have 2 enchanters.<br>
<br>
I'm not a fan of the AE break as most KCoG raids dont have an abundance of enchanters.  I feel its better to do a typical melee break and leave your spare enchanter(s) in reserve in case of a bad break.  AE breaks can be fun, and can clear the zone in an hour or two.  But they can also be very dangerous unless your people are used to working with each other.<br>
<br>
I've done both with KCoG raids, and I can say I prefer the melee breaks.<br>
<br>
Now here's the main thing.  Experience.  You want to have your most experienced people in those 3 break groups.   Those will remain your main groups throughout the raid.  Please note who and where I placed people in each group.  That was not by accident.<br>
<br>
You want your puller in the same group as the enchanter so they can easily coordinate.  Sure, there are /raid channels and normal channels, but nothing beats the simplicity of group chat, and you wont have the rest of the raid hearing this communication.  The last thing you want are people complaining because they know ahead of time the mob they want isnt coming right now.  <br>
<br>
Also, keeping the enchanter out of a melee group means your healer only has to keep an eye on the enchanter realistically.  The tank is not there in the group to fight, but rather to shield the enchanter and taunt the mob off him/her.  I would fully expect the tank to fight to the end here and die while the healer heals the enchanter and ignores the dying tank.  Their job is not to live or win or do damage, but to protect the enchanter.<br>
<br>
Also, you want your raid commander to be in the group with the puller and enchanter so he/she can more easily keep an eye on whats going on.  You'll note he/she too is not in the MA group.  This is because the last thing the raid leader needs to do is be distracted by combat.  They need to keep a close eye out on the general situation.  As a raid leader, distance yourself from combat as much as possible.  It is true you need to lead from the front, but also remember a dead leader is a useless leader.  And a confused one is even worse.<br>
<br>
As a Raid Leader always do your best to avoid any sort of combat role for yourself.  Its not as fun or glamorous, but the bottom line is that you are responsible for the success of the raid.  A Raid Leader cannot be distracted by anything unecessary.  They need to be watching the action and calculating the risks of staying vs doing something different.  The line between successfully breaking Fear and living wiht only 1 or 2 people left, or totally wiping out is very slim and you need to know which is which.<br>
<br>
Oh, and here's another important TIP.  Since you went through the trouble of putting experienced people in your 3 break groups...LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.<br>
<br>
I can count the number of times I've overruled my MA or Enchanter or puller on one hand with 4 fingers left over.  You put them in good positions, let them make the calls.  Have your type commanders call their shots and you'll have lifted half the burden off you.<br>
<br>
So to recap:<br>
<br>
3 groups max to break.<br>
<br>
Make sure its your best people.  And try to follow the group layout when possible.  Changes must be made here and there, but in general this is one of the best multicapable setup's I've come up with for KCoG raids.<br>
<br>
Make sure you are invis'd and everyone knows to turn LEFT.<br>
<br>
Keep your evac'r invis'd at all times during the break.  The evacer is not ever supposed to break invis for any reason or do anything to draw aggro for any reason till the break is done.  Nothing will screw your chances of a good clean break faster than losing your enchanter followed by that nuking wizard/druid and now losing 1-3 groups instead of just 1 or 2 people.<br>
<br>
Melee vs AE break.  Its up to you.  But unless you are positive you can do it, and have done it before, and your people are good...I'd suggest a melee break for KCoG.  It might not seem as sexy, but its far safer generally.<br>
<br>
Keep control and discipline in your raid.  If you are the raid commander it is your paramont job to keep control.  You need to be on top of all channels and be ready to boot people if necessary.  You'll note the raid commander is not even needed in the Command Group for any real combat potential.  As the group evacer I usually just stood around and watched and made sure things went according to plan.  I never engaged in combat and only occasionally healed on my raids.<br>
<br>
Delegate combat responsibilities to your type commanders and let them do their job.  If you cant trust them to do it, you have no business going into the plane in the first place.<br>
<br>
Experience is always better than levels.  Good people over levels will always win out.  I've had a level 60 ranger MA'ing in Fear over a 60 epic equiped warrior because the Ranger was far more reliable in his judgement.<br>
<br>
Will this guarantee a successful raid?  Of course not.  But I'll tell you this, my Fear raids rarely ran over 4 hours.  Often they were only about 3.  And we generally cleared most of the plane.  And this was almost 2 years ago now.  KCoG shouldnt have any problems today the way equipment, levels, and spells have changed.<br>
<br>
To put things in perspective.<br>
<br>
My guild, The Watchmen, usually only fields about 8-12 people for a Fear raid.  We will break, clean, and are done with all mobs and mini's in Fear within 3 hours of start time.  This is with no one over 63 really, and only 1 enchanter and occasionally no clerics.<br>
<br>
And this is using a melee approch.  If we wanted to AE (as we sometimes need to if we have something else scheduled that night) we will AE and be done in an hour or so.<br>
<br>
Many other guilds can do Fear in similar or better times with as many people.<br>
<br>
KCoG should have no problems with the numbers they can field today.<br>
<br>
The one thing I disagree with Rhedd about is using a paladin to tank.  He's right about their abilities and its good.  But if aggro is an issue because people are not waiting for the assist call, then they need to get punted from the raid and banned from KCoG raids.<br>
<br>
The one thing I always stressed was raid discipline.  And continue to do so.  Failue to abide by assists or wait for them has always been grounds for immediate dismissal from my guild.  Its a rare thing, we usually handle that sort of thing with a few private talks, but we have been known to expell people from the guild in the middle of a raid because of that.<br>
<br>
/assist is a raider's most impotant tool.  Use it or be it.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, for the average raider my only advice is this:<br>
<br>
Shut Up and Listen.<br>
<br>
Bottom line.  Your job as a raider is to do whatever job the Raid Leader has told you to do.  Period.  Even if you dont agree or think its stupid or dont want to do it.  Either do it without question, or go home.<br>
<br>
For you Raid Leaders or Potential Raid Leaders, all I can do is quote my Sensei.<br>
<br>
With Rank Comes Responsibility.  The More Rank, The More Responsibility.<br>
<br>
Remember that.  Its not your job to remind people of how good you are, or how well you can crit, or anything else.  Its your job to make sure you win with the least amount of casualties.  And dont be afraid to wield a large club.  Do not be afraid to punt people if they are not listening to you.<br>
<br>
Everyone is new once.  Everyone makes mistakes.  No one should be allowed to continue making the same mistakes and jeapordising an entire raid though.<br>
<br>
Be fair, but firm.<br>
<br>
Okay, this has gone on too long, and I'd be surprised if people made it down this far.  Pat yourself on the back if you did.<br>
<br>
You know...I also forgot the most important thing here.<br>
<br>
Have Fun.<br>

<br>
Those little impy guys proc something like shadowstep.  Shadowstep is a funny thing, it will ONLY take you down hill.  If the MT is levved he is going to go a LONG ways.  I found from tanking there myself that if I could stand in a small depression that the shadowsteps were mostly very short.  If the mob got pushed up a slope away from my little depression and I had to follow it, then that proc could send me most of the way to the fetid fiend house. Which COULD be problematic. <br>
<br>
As MT I hate these impy guys worse than I hate the dispelling cone looking guys.<br>

I can see chanters wanting LEV and a TALL illusion if they are gnomes.  I can see some of the non-tank melees wanting lev.  Just don't lev the MT.<br>

<br>
These days with a good break group I dont believe in just trying to get to the camp wihtout aggro.  I find aggro useful generally.<br>
<br>
You want to kill the mobs.  Thats why even if you have aggro, I say bring the mobs in.  Dont die.  Bring them to the camp.<br>
<br>
I do suppose it does depend on how good your tanks are.  But in general I find its not hard to find mobs with only 18 or so people in West Camp.  As long as your using /assist it doesnt really matter either.  Only the enchanter needs to know what mobs are in camp.  Since usually its the enchanter calling the shots in regard to which mob to kill next too.<br>
<br>
And yeah, the imps do shadowstep.  I find this more an annoyance than anything else though.  With 18 people, 15 of whom can engage in combat, I find they die fast these days.  Hell, as long as everything is mostly mez'd and your people are doing /assist right, the clerics can nuke too to help your DPS.<br>
<br>
And if you are fighting inside West Camp as you should be, shadowstep wont toss you anywhere really dangerous.  You might get another wanderer or two, but its all good.  As you are there to kill wanderers after all.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and another thing.<br>
<br>
I have 1 easy way of making sure people use /assist and do not over aggro.<br>
<br>
As you might have remembered, when I was running KCoG Planar Raids, if a group didnt assist or got aggro, I'd simply remove the healers from that group.  There is nothing like taking the healers out to get melee's to start watching their aggro.<br>
<br>
More importantly, if you have more than 3 groups, you dont really need healers in each group.  Only the MA and SA and Command group really need healers.  For the other groups, the healer is nothing more than another DPS class really as they should never get hit.<br>
<br>
But then again, I dont believe in playing it too safe.  I believe in going in, using good tactics, and kicking ass.  I dont use perfect groups, I dont care about ever getting them.  I just care about clearing the zone.  heh.<br>
