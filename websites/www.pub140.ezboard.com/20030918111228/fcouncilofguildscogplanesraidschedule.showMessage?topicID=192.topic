And boy, let me say again.  WE KICKED ASS.  But with any recap, let me start from the begining.<br>
<br>
Well, I got in early and picked up 12 Hate port stones.  Now I had no intention of taking up more than 10 groups and had bought the extra two as backups in case we got screwed up there.  All well and good, but this came out to be about 3000pp.  Of which I covered half from whats left of my bank account.  I believe I had about 20pp left.  But thats another sob story.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I got to Sro and we began signups.  Fortunatly Zellex appeared and decided he'd help us poor lost souls by pulling.  Thanks Zellex!  Althalonas was kind enough to help with with the signin's and things went quite smoothly.  By 12:30pm we had well over 45 people signed up and so I decided to end the sign up's as planed to keep from getting overwhelmed with 65+people signed up.  This is where it got weird.<br>
<br>
Skids, a member of CoLS, asked if he could go along with us for the sole purpose of rolling on the mage epic staff if it dropped.  Now then, while we do have an open door policy in CoG raids, I had already closed the signups and we already had 4 mages from non-planar capable guilds who only have this shot at the piece if it drops so I told him no.  I did try to be polite since I really didnt want to upset another guild if possible.  Unfortuantly he kept at me constantly asking me why he couldnt come, he just wanted to roll for the piece since it was rare, etc.  He even went as far as publicly asking the raid mages if it was okay for him to come along.  Now I dont know if this behavior is standard for CoLS, but their officers and I are definitly going to have some words over this.  Disrupting someone else's raid just isnt done.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly this little incident took up well over half an hour and it was now past 1pm and I still didnt have groups made up.  So Zellex decided to take a bunch of the Circle of Unity folks up to break the camp and get the cleric in.  Since the Highest level enchanter and cleric, as well as several of the wizards and tanks were part of CoU I figured might as well.  This will help simplify matters since they're used to working together.  Unfortunatly this played hell with my groups since they're designed for overall survivability and the CoU folks were integreated heavily into them already.  As a result once they went up, I was forced to simply make temp groups and everyone rushed upstairs.  In most cases to die due to a portal wanderer.<br>
<br>
However, CR went very quickly and so by 3pm we were setup and ready to start killing.  Yeah, it took us 2 hours to get there, but once we got there, things started to fly.  Zellex immediatly began by pulling several trains.  Ordinarily this would be our death sentence, however, the enchanters were awesome at mezzing the adds and with 60 people inzone we kicked ass.  Wait...60 people?  But I thought Kellory closed the signups at about 48 you say?  Well yes, unfrotunatly in the confusion it seems a number of people who didnt sign up with me or Althalonas slipped in.  This caused me major confusion once we were upstairs.  Still, I managed to work all the groups out.<br>
<br>
At this point I was still in tell hell.  As a result I had forgotten to inform Althalonas he was also the Loot Master for the raid.  At the very last second he graciously accepted.  Unfortunatly it seems no one was paying attention to my shouts of who the Loot Master was.  I am NOT the loot master.  I never will be.  Please do NOT send me tells asking what to do with loot, or that you think it was unfair, or that there was a problem.  Send those tells to the loot master.  His word is basicly law.  I trust Althalonas to be fair and so I will totally back him up.  If there are any problems, they were probably honest mistakes and by talking to him you can probably clear them up.  If not, THEN talk to me.  But dont try to hopskotch the chain of command.  Also, I really dont care if his name is too difficult to spell.  Do an /ooc with the loot or something.  Dont keep coming to me with it just because my name is easier to spell.  I've got the raid to work and getting bogged down with things like that is just bad.<br>
<br>
Now if it seems I was getting stressed a bit, I was.  I finally had to spam the shout channel, in caps no less, to get everyone's attention.  Around this time a raid member died.  Hmmm, not a major deal eh since people have been dying all night.  True, except this once told the rezing cleric he prefered a level56 rez.  Our only 56+ cleric was busy keeping the main tank alive at the time and was LoM.  This is precisly the reason why you are NOT allowed to refuse a rez.  This one thing stopped the raid for several minutes while we figured out what was going on, and pissed off a number of the clerics.  <br>
<br>
With my screen being tell hell, in addition to all the other channels, I basicly decided to enforce the rez rules in totallity.  I basicly declared the next person to refuse a rez would simply be left there to retrieve their corpse at their own convience.  Was that harsh?  Yes, probably much more than was needed.  However, considering how few people seem to have read the board, or even signed up previously, I felt harsh measures were necessary.  This caused some major disagreements with said raid member disbanding from the raid along with one of teh enchanters and both leaving.  As for my actions I do believe I could have been a bit more diplomatic.  However, I had the entire raid to look out for and I could not afford to keep getting into small problems like this.  These problems were why the raid was already several hours late in starting.  I believed I had to put my foot down, and put it down hard.  Now, had the concerned parties contacted me in person I would have pointed out these were just threats.  Worst case senarios and that in all probablity we'd simply rez them after the raid or simply force them to take a lower level rez.  We would not leave them up there unless they decided to simply log and we couldnt get them period.  However, I'm not going to say that on an open channel.  Sometimes it takes open threats and scaring people to get them to toe a line.  Disicpline is what sets the major guilds apart from the smaller ones.  We dont ask for much here at CoG but refusing (and even asking for a different one IS a refusal) a rez is one thing we cannot afford here.<br>
<br>
Now things were looking somewhat bad.  We had just broken into Hate and were now down to 2 enchanters.  However.  We rallied.  We reformed.  In about 10 minutes we were back to killing Zellex trains.  I can honestly say I have never been more proud to be part of a CoG raid than last night.  Even knowing we were short on enchanters people still rallied in the name of fun and kicked ass.  Within an hour we had cleared the church and the SW corner.  Zellex then procceeded to pull everything else.  The idea was to at least get to Maestro before we had to call it quits.  I mean, this is a CoG raid right?  Heh.  Anyway, within 2 more hours we had totally cleared to the Maestro room.  With remarkably few deaths.  Most fights with multiple mobs didnt even result in a death.  Amazing good work by all.  We then moved quickly to the Maestro room and procceded to kick some major ass there.<br>
<br>
Everyone moved quickly and orderly to the Maestro room and listened to Zellex as he went over battle stratagies.  We then formed up and got trained somehow.  Just a few minor little mobs we quickly dispatched without even using the warriors to conserve their buffs.  Arent we baddasses?  Zellex then pulled the Maestro and...well...I guess the Maestro should've spent more time training instead of playing his silly organ cause he was dead about 30 seconds later.  We quickly got ourselves together and moved on to the Hand of the Maestro.  Heh, probably the only green mob in Hate, but he spawns A Very Unpleasant Hand.  A mob on the equal with the Maestro.  For those of you folks who were were CoG when we first hit the New Hate the week after the patch we had no clue what this mob was and totally wiped out even tho we had killed the Maestro.  Surprise is a major advantage.  This time, we got our revenge.  We spawned the Very Unpleasant Hand and it too lasted about 45 seconds.  Congrats to Rmog who had won the earlier roll to get the Hand of the Maestro for his warrior epic.  You were a great Main Assiast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     We then pulled the Magi who has his staff.  I believe it was the Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth used for the Mage epic.  If so, congrats to Conjouous for getting one of the harder parts of an already hard epic.  That is one of the mage epic bottlenecks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Now this is where CoG Hate raids usually pack up.  We call things a success and say cool, lets roll.  But it was still only about 7pm PST and there were mobs to kill still.  Zellex then proceeded to Feign Link Death and died a couple of times.  Ouch.  But he got himeself back together and we pulled all the remaining first floor mobs. What was that?  Yes, we totally clear the first floor.  Let me say that again, We Totally Cleared the First Floor of ALL mobs.  Except for the rapid respawn wanderers.  Other than that, we cleared it.  Everyone who was there and who helped get us to that point, even if you left early, congrats.  Thats a major victory.<br>
<br>
But wait!  We didnt stop there!  No, it was still early and we still had raiders, and Slickone would've had me fried broiled alive and my furry hide used for slippers had we left then.  We then proceeded upstairs to the SECOND floor of Hate.  Now then, anyone who's done the second floor knows a couple of things.  These mobs are way harder than downstairs.  The pathing up there is the worst example of bad pathing in the game, its buggy as hell and the loot is mostly FS.  Of course, if you get lucky...damn it totally uber loot on par with ToV and high end PoG stuff.  And we got lucky.<br>
<br>
We ended up with the Pally BP, 2 Cullers, and a druid belt.  I swear Nalmaric, your never coming on another CoG raid!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Heh, just kidding, Congrats to all.  Considering we only killed about 20 percent of the second floor mobs that was an amazing haul.<br>
<br>
Let me say again how proud I am to have been a part of this raid.  We had some rocky moments and a rough start, but everyone rallied together and stuck together.  I'm proud of each and every one of you and would be proud to be part of any raid with you in the future.  Best of all, we never ended with the traditional CoG wipeout.  Even on the second floor we were forced to camp, but most people got away.  It looked hairy from my bind point next ot Chardok for a bit, but we once again rallied together, kept our heads and made it.  This too with what seemed to be half the raid being summoned to the portal entrance.  I dont know how this happened and I should've camped us all out immediatly, but honest I dont know how we got aggro.  Especially since Aquin was one of the first summoned and he had camped earlier while I was getting pounded on.  <br>
<br>
Oh well, we made it and all I can say is, gosh.  We cleared the entire first floor including all the minis there, and then proceeded to the second floor and cleared there.  Congrats to all who won loot.  Congrats also to anyone who made it through to the end of this.  Woohoo!  Ya'll kicked ass and I cant begin to say how awesome it was.  We're not a very good group when it comes to raids.  Lack of experience and equipment means we cant do things easily that other guilds or alliances do.  But last night at least, we showed that we are capable of doing some very cool things.  I'm proud of you all.  You all KICKED ASS!<br>
<br>
Maybe next time we'll be coming for you Inny! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
We have been owning the planes!  I just wanted to add one thing a few things that where not on the loot list.<br>
<br>
I know that a rogue got a book for his epic piece.  So grats to the rog!<br>
<br>
Also, it was not stated above that the Maestro was up.  So did we kill him?  Heck ya we did!  We wasted him and his pretty little hand to!  I was lucky enough to win the roll for the Warriors and loot his wonderfull hand.  One more part of the impossible epic down.  <br>
<br>
For a 13 hour raid, I have to say, that there was hardly a time where I was not having a blast barshing and smacking innys wossy friends around.  <br>
<br>
Looking at that loot list above, I would have to say I was not the only one that had a good time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I had a great group also.  You guys know who you are.  We kicked some major but most of the night and had a smile on our face while doing it.<br>

<br>
At the beginning (before reading Kellory's post, so I had no idea at the time) I was a bit disappointed at the way it was starting out. I must say I thought it was the biggest joke around, and was seriously rethinking attending CoG raids when I'm of the level (10 to go) to visit the planes. HOWEVER!!!! After reading what was actually happening, man Kellory, you have my total respect. Having to deal with all the headache of an unanticipated want-to-be PLUS dealing with trying to get groups together, (lol, I want to say sucks to be you) you did an amazing job. <br>
<br>
I realize that these raids are geared more towards just giving people the chance to get to a plane that otherwise would not have a hope of getting there, more than teaching them planes and otherwise large target techniques. And throwing 60+ people at a plane doesn't really involve techniques the way doing it with 30 - 45(yes, I've done that) people does.<br>
<br>
And the loot that dropped was amazing as well, the last time I attended a planes raid was before the patch that upped the drops, so I was totally suprised at the amount of gear that dropped.<br>
<br>
Anyway, backhanded as my compliments may seem, I think you did a really good job at running this raid, and if I may, I am looking forward to attaining lvl 46 so that I can revisit fear and hate with the CoG. <p>Mairi<BR>

This was my first raid with CoG and my first plane raid and it was a blast... although very long.  By the end I had to leave a little before completion 2:30am est, which was 11.5 hours total.  All in all it was a great experience and I hope more CoG raids go like this.  Great job guys!<br>

Kellory, for your own piece of mind, it sounds to me like you made the right choices as raid commander. Sometimes, you have to do things that make people think you are an asshole. But when it's one person's wants vs. the needs of 45 other people there (i.e. the 56+ rez situation), you have to let the good of the many outweigh the good of the few or the one. And lest anyone think this is too harsh, the difference in the 49th level rez and the 56th level rez is probably 5-10 kills in Sebilis, if that (maybe a good hour or two). Your 7% difference in exp. regain is NOT worth the waste of 45 other people's time, the headache for the clerics involved, nor the stress you just put on the raid commander. <br>
<br>
As for late comers, at some point you have to say &quot;Enough.&quot; If you call attendance, it's called.... no more latecomers unless they are absolutely crucial to the success of the raid (i.e. one more enchanter or cleric when you have only one or none). When you already have 4 mages, you don't need another. As I said, you did the right thing, Kellory. <br>

The raid was a success not really because of anything I did, but because of the coordinated efforts of all involved.  Praise deserves to be meted out to Zellex for once again pulling for CoG and helping to coordinate both the break in and the mini assaults and the second floor.  And then there is Aquin the cleric who not only was our sole 56+ cleric but kept Rmog who was our main assist alive throughout most of the raid.  And yes, Rmog did a wonderful job as the main assist as did Buun (?) for being the second assist and later Gengus who took this over.  As we cant overlook Haker and Lavaflow and the other rogues (Lava is a monk) for helping with the breakin CR and once again making that a quick process.  Then there were our enchanters Odini and Sophelia who did an awesome job in keeping the adds mez'd, buffs up, haste going, and all the thousand and one other jobs an enchanter has to do and recieves little praise for.  And while we're at it our other clerics Fildiar, Thaime, Sybok, Sanilie, Aarodar, Natacia, and Axemaster who kept their groups alive and in many cases rez'd and buffed.  While its expected one will have a number of clerics on a Hate raid, they are still very essential and did their jobs so well most of the time no one realized they were doing a job.  I could go on forever listing the people who came and did a great job.  Everyone who came did more than their part and they are the ones who should be congratulated.<br>
<br>
As the leader of the raid my job was simply to make sure it all worked together.  I neither need nor find any particular wish for praise.  Its a job that needs to be done in order for the raid to happen perhaps, but its the people that make these things happen.  I could be the server's best Raid Commander, but if no one showed up to the raid or if they refused to listen to me or work together, things would only fall into trouble.  I have no wish for people to think that I'm starting a Kellory Mutual Appreciation group.  While I must admit the idea does sound rather tempting its not why I do this.  I run these because no one else was able or willing to step up.  One day I'll find a successor and step down for someone else to run these things.  My ego needs neither petting nor praise for it to swell to unheard of proportions.  It will do so all on its own.<br>
<br>
So if anyone wants to praise anyone for a successful raid, please remember all the people who went into making it a success and not just the person who wrote the recap. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
