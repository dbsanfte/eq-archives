I want them sorted out now rather than later.  <br>
<br>
VS is a big step for KCoG as an organization.  More than a few people on the server think that there is no way that we can pull this off.  I personally want to prove them wrong.  If we can take out VS, I think that we can use the momentum to take out even tougher targets, with much bigger and better rewards.<br>
<br>
VS has a nasty lifetap for 1.5k damage.  He can proc this up to twice a second.  Therefore in order to take him out you have to be doing well over 3k dps, or you have to eliminate his lifetap.  The only way to eliminate this lifetap, is to use disciplines that only high level warriors can use.  At level 59 a Warrior can give us a 17 second grace period against VS, where lifetaps will not be effective.  What this means is if we have 1 59 Warrior, we will have 17 seconds to do 16k damage.  It sounds like a lot, but it really isn't.  For instance, both Vox and Naggy have 32k hp, and we normally take them out in about 30 seconds give or take, and that is with a level limit of 52.  Now, it is possible with practice and disipline to stack two 59 Warriors, and with that we could have about 30 seconds to do the 16k that way.  <br>
<br>
The main thing here is going to be proper aggro management.  We need VS to be attacking the MT, and only the MT.  If someone else gets aggro, we can go ahead and give it up, because 3k healing per a second will wipe everything that we have done damage wise.  In other words, an instant death sentence for everyone there.  We need to work together well, this isn't a zerg wave sort of deal.  We will need to go in with proper strategy and disipline, and be very careful to follow the script.  One person can easily wipe us by not paying attention, or not listening to the leadership.<br>
<br>
I hope a lot of people are interested, because this is going to take a dedicated force.  This is not something we will be able to walk into, we need to know how to work together well.  This is going to take doing some raids together, and so in the very near future I will be reviving the KCoG mixer raids.  We will be doing raids to take out mobs like Yael and Scalemaster in the Hole, Phinny in Kedge Keep, mobs in PoN/PoD/PoJ/PoI, VS remains (weaker version of VS), Chardok Royals, etc.  If you plan on going to VS, plan on going to at least some of these.  These are going to be training raids for the VS raid.  I will require that everyone that goes on the VS raid have been on an as yet to be determined number of mixer raids in preperation.  This isn't something I am going to make exceptions for, at all.  If I feel at any point that this is falling through, I will remove us from the rotation, no questions asked.<br>
<br>
In summary, help me prove everyone wrong.  Show how determined KCoG can be to do things that no one else thinks we can do. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

Try and keep tank runed (Wont stop the healing part of the tap but stops the tank from taking the 1500 dmg) or use war might strike to keep him stuned or a reposit strat with WS rangers and reposit tanks.<br>

Help me out, Rmog.  What is this strategy?  I'm guessing &quot;reposit&quot; is short for &quot;reposition&quot;, so do you mean to back the tanks out every 6 seconds and replace with rangers?  What is WS?  Are my car windows up?<br>

<br>
A Riposte tank will simply block any attack during the discipline's timeframe and automatically attack back.  I believe this is similar to the enrage attack on mobs.<br>
<br>
A 59+ warrior gets 2 disciplines that allow for auto riposting.  One lasts for about 9 seconds, the other about 8 seconds, which gives you about 17 seconds of free and clear damage without worrying about the Lifetap.<br>
<br>
WS is a discipline called Weaponshild.  As I understand it, thats a 20 second free damage disc rangers get at 60.  Not sure if anyone else gets it.  However, I'm not sure if it'll stop a Lifetap.<br>
<br>
Autoriposte works because as far as the game is concerned, a riposted attack simply never lands.  Hence the lifetap never has a chance to proc.  If an attack is simply deflected then the lifetap will still have a chance at hitting.  IE: Even is VS misses you 8 times in a row due to your AC alone, he will still have 8 chances to land his lifetap.  If he misses due to a Riposte disc or say a dodge then he cant.  I believe a lifetap will still land if you parry.  I'm not totally sure about that though.<br>
<br>
My guess though is that unless someone has specific first hand information on it, that Weaponshield will not stop his lifetap.  20 seconds seems an inordinately long time for a disc that will stop something like that.  Not to mention I've never heard of people using a level 60 Ranger to MA VS before.  Weaponshield should allow for 2 rangers to give 40 seconds of freedom.  That I dont see that happening tends to lead me to believe WS doesnt work against the lifetap in the same way the riposte disc's do.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure what VS your up against Rmog...but from my experience he lifetaps a lot more than once every 6 seconds.  We used a 58 tank once who forgot to use his disc and he lasted a grand total of approximatly 8 seconds.  During which he absorbed about 4 lifetaps.  I personally in that same raid lasted about 1.5 seconds during which I took 3 hits and 2 lifetaps.  For good measure he landed an additional hit and lifetap after I had already died.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen, and the log parses I've read and done, he seems to have roughly a 50% chance of doing a lifetap.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, a level 60 warrior does have a much higher mitigation factor than any other class.  Which would probably help a lot.  As dodge and regular riposte will affect the landing of a lifetap even without a discipline.<br>
<br>
As AC and hps dont really factor into avoiding a lifetap, any level 60+ warrior should work regardless of equipment I'm thinking...<br>
<br>
So on further reflection with a 60+ warrior its possible to survive this even once the disc's drop.  If there are other sufficent damage dealers available to counteract the lifetaps once they start.<br>
<br>
And remember, by damage dealers we essentially mean melee's and pet classes.  Magic of all types is pretty useless on him.  Although I've heard of high level druids landing some spells on him, and occasionally wizard lures will land I think.  Is very iffy though.<br>

I wish I had a good answer.<br>
<br>
My understanding was that was changed.  Something about disc reset or something?  <br>
<br>
All things considered it would seem rather useless to have discs that could only be used when the original timer was reset normally.  Considering the astronomical reset times on some of them.  It would pretty much make ranger discs useless as Trueshot would probably be the only one really used.<br>
<br>
Of course...I admit this is VI we're talking about.  Consistancy and logic doesnt generally apply to the argument.<br>
<br>
Me...I miss The Vision.  I didnt agree with a lot of it...but at least back then you knew that when you took it without vasaline so was everyone else...<br>

After taking a more indepth look at things your right in that you cannot use a second disc till the first one's timer resets.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but disc's and their use is one of the things I'm not all that familier on.  Other than which ones are used for what mob.  Thats what happens when your in a guild that doesnt really have any high level warriors.  (Sorry Knuk, but you need to get on more.  lol)<br>
<br>
Still, I dont think it'll affect anything really.  Although I'm surprised we havent heard from any other tank types on that mistake.  Bleh.  Heh.<br>
<br>
We just send in a 59+ tank with a riposte disc.  It'll last a good 9 seconds or so.  Depending on how many people are present that may actually be enough.  How long does Vox/Naggy last after all?  If not as Rmog stated a 60 warrior probably wont get lifetapped more than once every 6 or so seconds due to their high mitigation values.<br>
<br>
And finally we always set this up with the idea of having 2-3 59+ warrior tanks.  As soon as the disc runs out on the first tank, the second should be able to slot in by moving closer and switching out to some high taunt proc weapons while the original tank tries to drop aggro.  I know, a lot easier said than done.  But even so, there should be several seconds of grace plus Rune time.  I'm sure the specifics can be worked out later.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen most 55+ warriors are perfectly able to coordinate themselves.  Most people 55+ it seems can work together easily enough when its called for.  So on that note I have no real worries.<br>
<br>
If worse comes to worse...anyone know a Manaburn wizard not on the VS rotation?  hehehe.<br>
<br>
Anyway that was my bad on the disc thing.  Still 9 seconds is quite a bit of time for damage to be done these days.<br>

At about 2-3 seconds left on the discipline, use another hotkey to let everyone know your discipline is about up, turn off attack, and back up to max melee range.  Don't go too far, or he'll just summon you or start bombing around the room.  Next tank hugs VS, and triggers their discipline when they have aggro.  Tank with burned out discipline can join in again in a few seconds, but must be sure (s)he doesn't get aggro.

VS is only a 18 k hp mob, but if you take to long to kill him he can be a 60k++ hp mob.  Hes such a pain to learn the first time.  We had a fight go 8 min against him where his life bar was a roller coaster going up and down and up and down.<br>

<br>
MT should be runed, but apparently VS can eat through runes fairly quickly. A good suggestion on the graffe boards was to plan on having a wiz or 2 chaincast Spellshield on MT as well to eat up magic damage. May be a useful idea .... I do not know if Spellshield stacks with rune, however (probably should).<br>

<br>
1) If VS is landing blows on anyone, you will LOSE.<br>
2) Primary tank must keep the aggro and use autoriposte so VS doesnt hit anyone else (thus procing lifetap)<br>
3) If VS is landing blows on ANYONE, you will LOSE.<br>
4) All melee must ONLY hit from behind VS so VS doesnt riposte.  He will proc lifetap on riposte too and guess what?  FAILURE.<br>
5) If VS is landing blows on anyone, you will LOSE.<br>
6) Everyone must be runed just in case they get a accidental riposte/aggro/etc.  Rune will block his shot and therefore no proc the lifetap (so you dont LOSE)<br>
7) If VS is landing blows on anyone, you will LOSE.<br>
<br>
Clerics are nukers.  No healing required.  Everyone should know that if they get hit, they will cause the failure.  If someone gets hit and it doesnt, then they simply got lucky.  This fight is all about aggro managment and damage output.<br>
<br>
We used to chain Rune the tank, but I think they added aggro to that buff or something.  I just remember there is a problem with chain rune now, sorry for lack of details on this one.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
Question:  My guild just joined an alliance that is in rotations, but I don't think they're in VS rotation.  Am I allowed to come help if we arent in VS rotation?<br>

We did do some good damage, i believe even with his lifetapping we got him down a bit.  first off, let me say that root does not work on this guy, he is immune.  2nd, i do not think his lifetap procs once every 2 seconds.  the reason for this is after our failure he began wondering around KC, and ended up in the LCY, who immideately trained him to the entrance.  everyone shouted Venril Sathir is at the entrance, zoned, and then immideatly zoned back in.  Apparently when people heard that, they came rushing from the RCY, captains room, and whatever else was camped, and there were a good deal of people chillin at the entrance.  That said, they were all separate groups, and there was little organization.  We beat the proverbial crap out of him.  im fairly sure that nobody died, actually.  maybe one or two people at most.  now, there werent more than 30 people there at most, and we took him out hard core.  with no organization.  Im not saying we should leave our organization and raid skills (and listening skills) at home on this one, hell no.  but I am saying from my experience, we should be able to take this guy down no prob.  just my 2 cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rinalthelis>Rinalthelis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/17/03 6:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir</span><hr size=1> It is important to point out that there are really TWO Venril Sathirs. The real Venril Sathir (the one on Rotation) is a L55 iksar in black robes with red trim who procs a 1500 HP lifetap every other hit (more or less) and drops some nice loot including a Wizard Epic item. He could very easily and quickly mow through 30 unorganized people in their 50s... I'd bet that he'd do it in about 45 seconds and be at full health when done.<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir Remains is a NON-KOS iksar skeleton, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>however</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> after a Druid or Ranger does their two epic turnins a KOS iksar in black robes with red trim named Venril Sathir spawns. He is only level 51 and his lifetap is much less frequent (he sometimes is killed without tapping once), however he looks identical to the real VS. A balanced group of 6-8 mid 50s people with a high 50s tank could take him. He also only drops two stones (1 is needed for the Ranger/Druid epic quest) and one Blackened Iksar Bones (for the Shammy quest for the Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients). He drops these three items every time.<br>
<br>
This has created much confusion on the various message boards concerning how difficult a battle Venril Sathir is. Many people who have participated in the Druid/Ranger epic fight against the VS spawned from VSR have been under the impression they have actually engaged the real VS. Every discussion of VS tactics I've seen contains a number of posts essentially saying &quot;We took him with 10 people and he's no problem, didn't even tap once!&quot; It is a common misconception, so please don't sweat it, I just wanted to clear up the discussion here. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457258"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rinalthelis Wolfbrother</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org">&lt;Ancient Adventurers&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

VSR, I think lifetapped once the whole fight I think. And health dropped quick on this guy. <br>

VS, however once some one accidentally got agro from Tank or Tank dropped he LTed everyone in the room.<br>

There is no 'trigger' for him.  It's pretty easy to clear all the spawns around him to leave VS alone for the final charge, as long as you hurry.<br>
<br>
As for stuns, I'm pretty sure his MR is insane, and chain stunning will be almost sure to pull aggro off the main tank.  Especially if you're only 52, nothing's gonna land.  You'd be better off pitching in with melee with a nice low aggro 2 hander, assuming there's room.  The room gets pretty cramped, and if there's too many people your tanks can't position properly.  If a tank's discipline wears off but they can't back off because of a bunch of people pressed up behind them, VS will lifetap the tank repeatedly and the whole raid will fail.  Riposters and nukers take priority for space, anything else that fits is just gravy.<br>
<br>
As a side note for anyone that cares about their Venril Sathir faction;  You do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lose Venril Sathir faction from killing Venril Sathir himself.  Just avoid the tall drolvargs inside KC (the short ones are OK), and the hands - they'll both be non-aggro if your faction is high enough, anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sotvfarrnusno>SOTVFarrnusno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Planes Raid Liason</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/21/03 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir</span><hr size=1> ROFL, I truly had not heard that bit about not losing faction for killing him.  That is quite odd, and amusing.<br>
<br>
As far as stuns, that is correct, he is extremely MR, so stuns are not aggro efficient enough to do the job without drawing aggro.  Runing from my understanding (coming from many different sources) helps lower the proc rate, because if he does not actually hit the tank, he will not proc.  Therefore chain runing, and using a wiz or two to spellshield (will reduce the amount of damage for the proc when it does happen) should be sufficient to finish the job if riposte wears off.  <br>
<br>
That said, the key here is going to be DPS without drawing aggro.  If someone draws aggro away from the MT we are all as good as dead. <p>Farrnusno <BR>
