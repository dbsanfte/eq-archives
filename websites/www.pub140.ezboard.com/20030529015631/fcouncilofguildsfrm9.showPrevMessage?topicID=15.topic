BY that time i will have good enough faction to trigger him and hopefully ill get the tear from fear to give to Rak'Ashiir to get the spear (Rak'Ashiir, Tear, Fear, Spear - all rhyming just a coincidance?). Anyways - here is the report i saw from the last Rak raid - <br>
<br>
<br>
2 Jade Reavers and a Wipe =)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Well, we are currently in the middle of rezzing the biggest TRW I've been a part of. The break-in was not bad for a pick-up raid, except for some people getting lost trying to follow the the big building.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once we cleared to the first Black Reaver, we were hitting on all cylinders. He went down fast, Rochelle tanking like a hoss, and everyone assisting. Lo and behold, he had a Jade reaver! This was fortunate because we only got 1 more Black Reaver spawn before Lord Ghiosk popped and ended the fun. Antoli got the Jade Reaver, and it was a nice roll. Gratz!<br>
<br>
Not too long after Ghiosk died, it started to get unorganized. More on that later.<br>
<br>
We went up the big ramps, cleared some mobs and came back down. Not too long afterwards, we started moving people up the elevator. While clearing the room at the top of the elevator, somehow 3 Black Reavers got aggroed and that started the TRW. It was ugly - they wouldn't mez and there was no way we were going to be able to tank all 3 at a time in a small room while they are blinding people and all the tanks weren't there. Especially when there is a huge hole to fall into.<br>
<br>
After recovering from the TRW, some had to log, but the rest of us ( 18 I think ) plugged on. We went back to the single reaver and killed him and the wrong Lord popped again. Our bad luck.<br>
<br>
BUT! We pulled the 3 reavers from above and another Jade Reaver dropped! Gratz Rinalthelis! And... Lord Rak appeared. Unfortunately, Rak wasn't cooperating and when Lumdaorf did his stuff; Rak just sat there.<br>
<br>
GMs were called and we sat on our butts for an hour or so, rotating the room when it was needed. After a while, someone pulled the 2 remaining black reavers in the zone and some idiot Enchanter (*cough - me*) tried to cast a Mez on one and promptly got flattened.<br>
<br>
The raid party diced the last 2 with the room repopping ( good job back-up healers ), and then I got my rez.<br>
<br>
The GM informed Lum that he was going to have to start his epic over, which is a crock of... well, you know. I think if he feedbacks it and causes a stir, they may actually give him his piece back, but who knows. It's been done before.<br>
<br>
We killed at least 2 more Black Reavers and then called it quits.<br>
<br>
All in all, it was a decent raid. I have to admit I was truly shocked at how many times people broke mez. I'm talking about level 45+ people here. There was one instance where 4 mobs were mezzed and one particular person actually ran up to 3 of them and hit them, all in succession. *boggle* If you have one MA then you should never be fighting any other mob than what the MA is fighting, unless there are odd circumstances. When you break mez, you are toying with other characters' lives.<br>
<br>
There was even an instance of Root-DoTting while there were 3 chanters there. Root = Good. DoT = bad on this raid. But, it wasn't discussed at the beginning of the raid, unlike MA assisting which was, so it's understandable that the mistake could be made.<br>
<br>
A few times, there were calls of &quot;Follow &lt;name&gt;&quot; by the leaders. With 30 people there, there were always people that didn't see the call, or didn't know where &lt;name&gt; was, which caused the whole raid to get spread out and people lost. This isn't the raid leaders' faults, but this is something that could be improved upon with directions like &quot;Follow &lt;name&gt;, they will be going through the door, heading to the right, and up the ramps to the big room.&quot; You can't force people to listen, but any chance to lessen possible confusion should be taken.<br>
<br>
A big kudos out to Lumdaorf and the other leaders. You ran a raid with 30 people, most of whom you may not have even known. I know everyone in my guild, whether they were among the 8 ( woot - that's over 25% of the raid! ) that were there or not, thanks you for showing us a part of some epics that we will have to complete ourselves someday. I&quot;m a veteran of the front 2/3 of CoM, but had never been back to where we were.<br>
<br>
It was a pleasure meeting all of you, and I hope your experience was as good as mine was. I met a lot of -quality- people and I'm sure we'll be raiding again in the future.<br>
<br>
Also, thanks for having the raid as early as you did - our guild has several people near GMT who were able to attend because of the time.<br>
<br>
Signing off with a smile!<br>
<br>
ps. Just chatted with some people and they said that if your True Spirit faction isn't high enough, Rak won't work right. But, they also said if you are to that part, it -should- be high enough unless you messed it up.<br>
<br>
Edit: I forgot to mention. That was a GREAT job on the corpse retrieval and rezzes after the wipe. Kudos all around for that and a great big thanks to the cleric that showed up wiht the Click-Stick. Hammersomethingorother. You were very appreciateed. <br>

Ill post the other info on Rak etc and links to maps - mages seem to be needed badly. those on the last one - would you say 3 or 4 mages with fire pets?<br>
<br>
I havent been into CoM any furthur than the stables and the little temple thingy, so if any of those that have done this part of my epic could maybe post some advice about the Do's and Dont's of this place itd really help. Ill lead the raid im just looking for a few peeps willing to help out.<br>

<br>
Anyhoo, I've read up on recent attacks on Rak and this is what seems to be the concensus:<br>
<br>
You can take Rak without the Fire-pet work-around if you have a good group of healers on the MA.<br>
<br>
Or, if you do go the Mage Fire-pet route, have the Mages remove their resist items as the Pets will use the Mage's resists if they are above a certain level ( something like that ).  I would imagine a Mage would know more about this, so if you are a mage and are aware of this &quot;pet's inheriting the Mage's resists&quot; deal, please speak up and let us know how it works. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

Those who have got him before it may help to know what kind of FR you need to resist his 2000 AE DD. Ill be eating one at the start anyways and thats his strength, so if we can maybe get all of our FR's up high then we may be able to take him easier - just a thing to try. THe only downside i can see is that if we are all on Rak if something pops then we would be in trouble. Post and give some info etc or your opinion on what to do. Im also looking at the underwater pasages under CoM to see where they go to find an alternate way in.<br>

Assuming you don't do any of the cheater methods to get get inside the building without a Rogue, it takes no time at all to clear to the BR building.<br>
<br>
After you get there, have the rogue open the door, and then you can either pull the room one at a time and clear it before you take the downstairs BR or you can use Harmony / Pacify and just pull the BR.  Kill that BR and any following BR spawns until Ghiosh spawns.  Kill Ghiosh.<br>
<br>
Clear the mobs in the hallway, then start pulling the top of the elevator using Harmony.  We did this Tuesday with a level 55(?) Ranger doing the pulling.  We single pulled every BR EXCEPT the one that spawns Rak because Rak was already up.  If the BR that spawns Rak is up, then you may get a double-pull.  In that case, off-tank the extra BR.  A good way to do this is to have the chanter(s) charm golems ( grab them from outside the building if need be ) and put them on the extra BR.  I'd off-tank the one that spawns Rak so that it's the last thing to die.<br>
<br>
Obviously, no AOEs when the one that spawns Rak is about to die.  If you need to, just outlaw AOEs on the raid.  After Rak spawns, you med up, do the turn-in ( Shammy probably dies ) and then take him down either using the Fire Pet method ( long and boring, but works ) or have someone with major FR tank him with quite a few healers on him.  Either way, expect a long battle, but it's doable.  Have a high level bard there, out of Rak's AOE range, but within range of the tank to buff his FR if you can. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

<br>
APRIL 12TH<br>
GMT 11pm<br>
EST 6pm<br>
CST 5pm<br>
PST 4pm<br>
<br>
Now is you read these and think 'these are not right' please tell me a little earlier than the end of the raid. If everybody could please print out a map or memorise one the raid would go a lot easier. Jade reavers may drop and if they do those that need them will roll on them first. Seeing as it will be late at night for me and ill be leading the raid i could use some good grp leaders that know the zone well as i have never gone far in (ive tried to get furthur in. I got what was left of me 7 hours later...).<br>
<br>
Please post lvl/class if you would like to help out a poor guildless shammy get his spear. I can change the time to a bit later if it means more people can come. Now im off to find out some more info on Rak'Ashiir and im going to see whether we should take him down with people or with pets.<br>

 <br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
We've had a change up on Test for about a week, and I wanted to share it with you guys and see what you think. Here's the basis of the change -<br>
<br>
When a pet is hit with a spell, it uses the resistances and level of it's owner to see if it resists the spell.<br>
<br>
This means that if you're a level 60 magician for instance and you've got on various buffs and gear that raise your resistances, your pet will save vs. spells as if it was also level 60 with your exact resistance scores.<br>
<br>
Using the owner's level is going to make a huge difference in how well the pet resists harmful spells, and should make a noticeable difference in how well the pets can survive AEs for instance. Allowing the pet to also benefit from your items and buffs means that it will be living a lot longer when fighting casters.<br>
<br>
There is a drawback to this, although I think the good outweighs the bad. If we go with this new scheme, it will mean that the pet always uses the owner's saves. Some types of pets currently are highly resistant to poison or disease for instance. Going with the new scheme would mean they will potentially not resist those types of spells as well, depending on the owner's resistances.<br>
<br>
Overall, this change would mean that pets are much more resistant the vast majority of the time. I think this would be a very positive change for pet classes, but I'd like to see what people think before we go ahead with it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
So basically the mage pet resist = owner resist. So i think we could do it this way :<br>
<br>
As many mages as possible using earth pets (for high HP).<br>
All mages having as much FR on as possible.<br>
All healers on pets except for when there is a pop, when we will have certain healers on pets and certain healers on the other people.<br>
<br>
Stuff that would help : <br>
<br>
KEI, POTG, AEGO and all the obvious super buffs<br>
The more mages, the more pets, the better it goes. I have seen the earth pets tanking in PoN - the owners were about 58 i think - a few 2000 AE's will hurt them but with healing and some good FR on the mages they should be fine. Plus, if a pet goes down it can be resummoned rather fast compared to getting a warriors corpse out of there.<br>
<br>
All help will be greatly appreciated and please try to come. I think a months notice should give me time to spread the word and get more people to help as im not sure many people look at the epic part. They are probably more concerned with when Vox,Naggy,Fear and Hate are ours next.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if the date falls on a Fear Naggy Vox or Hate ill postpone it for a day.<br>
<br>
Send me a tell in-game if you need anything or post here.<br>

<br>
Hi Folks, <br>
<br>
Having gone through this ordeal 26+ for myself, and watching countless other shamans deal with Rak, I thought to write this little ditty up to help other TE shamans with their last and painful battle of killing Lord Rak. <br>
<br>
Know Thy Enemy <br>
The more you know about Rak, the better you can warn your fellow raid members about the dangers of Lord Rak. <br>
<br>
Lord Rak'Ashiir is a Nasty Nasty Mob. He can spawn from from the last corpse of a Black Reaver. He is NOT considered undead. Rak can also seemingly just &quot;spawn&quot; in two places, including the throne roome and up in the to of the tower where the elevator leads. <br>
<br>
Lord Rak is INITIALLY NON-AGGRO except for: <br>
1) when the shaman turns in the Tear <br>
2) someone attacks him <br>
3) someone with Bad True Faction Spirit is around. (I found this out the hard way, when a wizard who had completed her epic got too close to Rak, causing a TPW. From what I also understand, Pallies can also get bad true faction spirit.) <br>
<br>
Once the Tear is turned in, the regular Rak despawns and respawns immediately as the Epic-Mob Rak, and will try to kill the shaman who did the turn-in. (IMPORTANT: The shaman turning in the tear WILL die. So prepare to die!) This particular Rak is KOS to EVERYONE! Once the Tear is turned in, and if all goes wrong, Rak will turn on eveyone. If you do not turn in the Tear to Rak, he will be a &quot;regular&quot; mob, with absolutely no Iksar Scale for turn-in. <br>
<br>
Rak cannot be slowed, maliosed, or crippled. Been there, done that...and none of my spells landed before I died. <br>
<br>
Rak lands has some nasty AE fire DDs (2K+ damage--1K in two ticks), rains, and DOTs. Rak WILL summon. <br>
<br>
RAK GATES! When Rak is down to about 20% of health, he WILL GATE back to his original spawn spot. Be prepared for this event. If he gates, he will call in re-inforcements, so if it occurs, be prepared for multiple adds, from golems, ghosts, and Black Reavers. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Prepare Your Troops <br>
*Let your raiding party know exactly what they are dealing with Lord Rak. The more your group knows, the less chance of someone gaining aggro who shouldn't, someone won't accidently cast on Rak who shouldn't, someone won't attack Rak who shouldn't. I cannot stress this enough. I've seen too many Rak raids go wrong because someone was Hot Button happy. <br>
<br>
*Have several mage fire pets on hand for this fight. I understand that it can be done without mages, but I have not seen or done this, so I will leave it to other shamans to research. <br>
<br>
You can have one high level mage fire pet kill Lord Rak. I've seen it done, with Voodini being the only mage. It was a long fight, and everyone who could heal, was healing the pet. <br>
<br>
* Melees and non-essential casters need to PARK their butts as far away from Rak as possible, trying very hard to not get Rak's attention. <br>
<br>
*Fire pets need to be completely buffed up, and, if possible, given weapons. <br>
<br>
*Clerics, druids, other shamans, and anyone who has a minor heal spell should be continually healing the Fire Pets. Make sure all the healers coordinate on this very effort. <br>
<br>
*Enchanters need to continually chain Rune the Fire Pets. This will greatly lessen the damage on said pets. One enchanter should be in charge of charming any adds and send in against Lord Rak. Make sure the chanters are coordinating on this very effort. Too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to problems. <br>
<br>
*Necros, bards, beastlords should offer secondary support to healers and enchanters to keep mana reserves up. <br>
<br>
*BRING PDOTS for your enchanters and clerics. This is *your* last epic fight, shamans. So spend the money and buy at least 5 stacks of pdots to hand out to your enchanters and clerics for buffs and rune-ing. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
My Own Experiences &amp; Some Strategies <br>
I have seen Rak killed (and tried killing) Rak in several places. There are two bad strategies and two seemingly good/doable strategies: <br>
<br>
1) [BAD IDEA] in the top room, where the elevator is located. This room is too enclosed for mage pets to fight, and healers to be located. Tried this, and some folks got hit by Rak's AE. Also, unless this room is cleared out well, Black Reavers will begin spawning in this room. <br>
<br>
2) [BAD IDEA] on the bridge outside the tower. Several potential things can go wrong here. <br>
<br>
a) Rak can fall into the water. This will make targeting the pets for heals difficult. <br>
b) the fire pets can push Rak through the locked door into the other room. This again makes difficult for targeting, and if the room is popping, well, the fire pets will not last long against all those adds. <br>
<br>
3) [DOABLE] in the u-bend past the Gazebos. While I have heard of, watched on other EQ player screens, and done this particular strategy, I see several potential problems with it. <br>
<br>
a) Rak needs to be successfully pinned against the wall by the fire pets, and no others can cast on him. For my own last battle, someone did something to Rak, which caused him to move towards the group, killing a bunch of people <br>
<br>
b) Rak gates. When Rak was down to 20% health, he gated back to his original spawn spot--the throne room--and called in re-inforcements. The melees had to content with a reaver, golem, and several ghosts, while the enchanters, mages, and healers had to scramble to get into the throne room to finish off Rak. <br>
<br>
In this particular fight, Sinsa ran into the throne room, keeping a charmed pet on Rak. Rak killed Sinsa in the process. Wageit also ran in, melee'ing Rak until his own death, so that the mages could get into the room so that fire pets could once again re-engage Rak. Outside the throne room, everyone else were engaging the added re-inforcements. (Kudos to the team for the organized chaos!) <br>
<br>
We were successful with this strategy, but there was some general chaos to be had. <br>
<br>
4) [DOABLE] fight in the throne room. This is probably by far, the best strategy I have seen and partaken in so far. You have to ensure that the throne room is completely empty before you take on Rak. <br>
<br>
Any pops or adds that occur can be mezzed or charmed by enchanters to send in against Rak. If Rak gates, and this is his bind spot, he isn't going anywhere. <br>
<br>
The fight can take place in one-half of the room, while everyone presses up against the other side of the room. We did this fight with Voodini being the only mage on Bunnion's epic with very little problem. <br>
<br>
The one drawback I have seen with this fight, is that if something goes wrong, all of you are trapped in this locked room. During my 2nd fight with Rak, we had to help the guild ,who were killing Rak at the time before our raid, do a complete CR because Rak was aggro'd, killing 90% of the raiding party. Rak died, but a MASSIVE CR ensued after. <br>
<br>
5) Let the Shaman Pull. The shaman, after turning in the tear, can pull Rak to whatever spot you choose. Make sure that you pull Rak and die where you need him fought. You can try casting on him, but chances are you'll be resisted. Only have a pet in the case of killing him in the Throne Room, because it will be easier to control your pet in that enclosed area. If you try to pull him to the u-bend with a pet, the pet might engage him too soon. Dismiss your pet if you're fighting in the u-bend. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Rak Bugged? <br>
Rak bugged? OF COURSE HE IS! This is the bane of this particular epic. Rak is bugged. Accept it. He will despawn!! I had to go to the GM TWICE to ask refund of the tear. Verant/SoE have *no* clue why this happens. This is why a GM was present at my last Rak fight...to see what happens. <br>
<br>
You will either have to fight Rak only once....or twice...or, in my case, thrice. <br>
<br>
I have spoken with GMs about this, and shamans who have had this problem. Here are some things you should know: <br>
<br>
1) If you TPW, you need to re-engage the epic'd Rak (who is KOS to everyone) almost immediately. You cannot take 20-30 minutes for a CR. Rak will DESPAWN. He seems to have a despawn time after the tear is turned in. <br>
<br>
2) If Rak gates, there is a slight chance, he will respawn as the non-epic'd Rak with no Iksar Scale. This happened to Bunnion's first fight with Rak. Even though, Rak was killed, no Iksar Scale was on the body! <br>
<br>
3) If Rak gets pushed through a wall and/or gates while being pushed through a wall, he might respawn as the non-epic'd Rak. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Some Additional Information <br>
<br>
1) I have heard that once Rak is below 50%, wizards and damage casters can start casting on him. However, I caution all casters here to not gain aggro from Rak. <br>
<br>
2) At 50%, I also heard that chanters can start mana-sieving Rak. Again, having not seen this myself...use at your own risk. <br>
<br>
3) I have read that Rak can be memory-wiped in the case of him aggro'ing on someone who attacked too soon, before the tear turn-in. Again, not sure here since I haven't seen it. <br>
<br>
4) Shamans..turn down your clipping plane, turn off spell effects, and anything that will CUT down on Lag. When I did my turn-in, and running for the u-bend, I hit a lag-spike and the next thing I know...I'm IN the water! ACK! TE is a massive gravity well with all the particles, spells, epics, and general known over-kill numbers! Running on the bridge and falling into the water is not fun! Take it from my own experience! <br>

Thanks for letting me post Wageit, <br>
------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
Some added information, I figure I should repost; <br>
<br>
How the shaman epic works, <br>
The shaman epic is structured around faction rather then the typical progressive hand-ins. At completion of the sub-quest the shaman is awarded faction at increasing amounts. its common practice for a shaman to complete all the sub quests upto the black dire in MM (you get a cool set of boots), then redo the killing of the guys in RM till you get &quot;cant get any better&quot;. <br>
<br>
How Rak and the spectral wolf work, <br>
when the tear is turned into Rak he does a faction check on the giver, if he faction is sufficient then he respawns a version of himself with an &quot;Iksar scale&quot;. once killed anyone can loot Rak and receive the scale. After that the looting shaman then needs to go to a spectral wolf in EJ and turn in the Iksar scale and get the epic. Like Rak the Wolf does a faction check on the giver and a new twist a level check. From what I have gathered SOE put in a twist after a few level 1 shaman, Rangers and druids were walking around with epics. So now key NPC's do a level check on the PC, if the PC is less then 46 it will not perform the actions required. In the case of the Wolf, no epic. <br>
<br>
edited: new section <br>
How do you know something is wrong <br>
If you hand in the tear and nothing happens at all, your faction check failed. If your not the one turning in the tear you will know something is up if Rak attacks the turn in but is indiffrent to you. Warning: There are people who try to sell you the MQ to Rak but are infact scamming you. They will go up to Rak and say they are turning it in then they just taunt him or attack him to get him to agro. SOE support staff will not &quot;respawn&quot; Rak or give you the scale, they will ONLY refund the tear and only if you had it in your inventory. Only pay after you have the scale. <br>
<br>
Now that you got the scale now what? This is the time to check your self. am I 47+ did I get &quot;cant get any better faction&quot;. Warning: some people have been stating that you just need kindly to get your epic. This is not true, I have verified this myself. If you are kindly before you do the hand, once you hit trade your faction will bump up a full lvl (maybe more). If your recieving an MQ you must have max faction the wolf will not give the tear unless you are. I have seen 3 folks will Ally fail but have yet see or heard a max fail. <br>
<br>
<br>
I am currently getting MAX faction no risks and i have the tear on Garrbut now so that is no problem. All i need is raiders so please sign up and a rogue would be extremely helpful so we can get in. I dont know about the resists thing so well try it with fire pets first and if they are dying then get earth pets.<br>
----------------<br>
IMPORTANT - IF YOU ARE KOS TO THE TRUE SPIRIT FACTION YOU M-U-S-T SAY AS IT CAN MAKE A WIPE IF YOU DONT. He WILL AE you and that WILL affect all near you giving ALL the aggro creating a big CR...you wouldnt want it to be all your fault now would you?<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
If a Jade Reaver drops then rangers/druids or whoever needs it for epic will be able to roll on it. If nobody needs then all can roll. If you know the zone well and/or have killed Rak before your knowledge on him would be invaluable - from reading this thingy above i think well try take him in the throne room with tanks/melee taking adds - with druids/shammys healing.<br>
<br>
If you will help can you please get a map of the zone so if you are lost you will know where to go. A good set of group leaders would also be very useful to help keep chaos to a minimum. <br>
<br>
We WILL be using raid feature on this raid to keep an eye on loot and stuff like that. All help is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Ill repeat the start times and date now so you may be able to plan ahead.<br>
