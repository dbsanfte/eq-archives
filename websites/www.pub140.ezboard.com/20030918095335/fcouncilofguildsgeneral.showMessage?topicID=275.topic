<br>
Iv been posting on this board introducing guild trucidation for 2 weeks...<br>
<br>
And like i said AGAIN haemishh deleted them everytime i posted them?<br>
<br>
So because after two weeks of wasting my time and my posts getting deleted me yelling about it ruins my &quot;offer with no strings attached&quot;<br>
<br>
I never had an offer for anything.. <br>
<br>
So please know what your talking about befor you comment on my posts...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Iv beent trying here for weeks and Have gotten my posts deleted and my emails to haemishh non replyed...<br>
<br>
So dont tell me about having ANY offerings because that is just FOR A FACT NOT TRUE nor the way it was..<br>
<br>
You think i just came here on this board and started a rampage?? NO<br>
I came here for weeks not getting any response and getting my posts deleted.. THEN i went on a rampage because of your Hipocryte Haemishh who has &quot;A VISION&quot; of one thing then totaly turns around and acts the opposite...<br>

<br>
I, and most people here, could probably care less how long you've been posting about your guild and that its been getting deleted.  If you had a problem you should have taken it up with him.  Haemish was probably in the wrong for deleting your posts.  However, instead of asking him not to, you simple came out with guns blazing.  Coupled with your reputation as the former guild leader of NTC that pretty much doomed any chance of anyone speaking for you.<br>
<br>
As I said before, you tainted Trucidation more than anything else the guild did.  As far as anyone was concerned Trucidation was simply NTC with a new label.  Thats like Shattering Steel going off and changing their name to Bob's Guild and expecting to be treated as a new guild.  It doesnt work that way.  Reputation matters in this game.  You did nothing to help restore yours before begining a new guild and so your reputation basicly proceeded you.<br>
<br>
I suggest you take a good hard look at yourself.  Even Shattering Steel had a few defenders.  I've yet to see anyone from another guild defend you.  That should say something right there.  You truly dont understand that YOU are the one to blame here.  You lash out in anger, but expect restraint from everyone else.  You have come here as the guild leader of NTC, then disband the guild and create a new one without any real explanation or attempt at making amends and yet you expect us to believe that it is a brand new guild.  Sure, and Shattering Steel had nothing to do with Raving Lunatics.  Ummm, yeah.  I've heard it before.<br>
<br>
NTC did a lot of harm.  Until you are ready to face that and work things out, dont expect a lot of sympathy from anyone here.  We're the victims of your old guild.  Frankly, who is the hypocrite here?<br>

However, these posts of yours, as Kommisar pointed out, are quite amusing.  Mainly because you still, after something around 4 or 5 threads on the same thing, dont get it.  But just because I could care less doesnt mean I'm reply to you.<br>
<br>
So what if Haemish didnt respond to your emails?  He doesnt really respond to mine either.  And so what if he deleted one of your posts.  Post it again.  You could have posted a thread in General here asking for them not to be deleted, before going off on your private rant.  You didnt.  Deal with it.<br>
<br>
You've consistantly come here defending your own personal honor at the stake of your guilds.  They are not one in the same.  By doing so you have tainted your new guild in the eyes of many.  Its time for you to take responsibility for your own actions instead of simply trying to prove you were right.  No one here is defending you.  Doesnt that clue you in somewhat?  There are people here that would defend you just because Haemish isnt.  And yet they are silent.  Why?  Could it be because they feel you are wrong?  Nahhhh...what a silly thought right?<br>

I'm not quick to take Haemish's side.  Anyone here can tell you that.  Not that you'd listen anyway.  Well, I can see this is simply decending into another long one sided flame war.<br>

<br>
I have received one email total from Shadowlands, introducing the guild Trucidation. I did not respond to it, as I have not had much of a chance to do any work concerning Everquest in about a month, other than change the front page of my own guild's web site to refelct our expansion into Dark Ages of Camelot. <br>
<br>
Also for the record, I have only deleted I think 1, at the most 2 posts of Shadowlands, asking to be guild removed. I tend to look at this board 1 time a day at best lately, as again, I neither have had the time nor the inspiration to really get involved in Everquest happenings. <br>
<br>
I'm going to read the other threads on this board, and consider whether or not Shadowlands deserves to be banned from this board. I haven't done so to this point, because I had hoped he would understand why I was not accpeting of his &quot;new&quot; guild, and would offer to help the Council. Instead, he wants to flame. If it has continued much past this post, he will be banned. <br>
