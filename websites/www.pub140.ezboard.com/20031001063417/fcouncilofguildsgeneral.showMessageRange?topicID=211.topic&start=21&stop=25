(yes in the past week I've had numerous tells about how it was bad and why) my only wish is that they had spoken up earlier. <br>
<br>
I agree completely that durring the raid is a baaaaad time to do major changes like that, but after the raid send a tell and say &quot;hey, if you're on tomorrow can we talk? got a few questions and would take too long tonight&quot; I got noo probs with that! *hugs* all the better. I just honestly wish ANYone would have said something sooner.<br>
<br>
I cant really clarify on the black marble thing that dropped. All the gems collected usually go into a fund and when someone has a piece of armor and needs a couple jems they borrow from there. With Valo loot isn't rolled for, its distributed by 1 single, selfless and dedicated person. We all have our equipment listed on the site, she chooses which of us needs it best, though if no one needs it then the guests (from what I've seen) were more than welcome to put their name in for it. It's how I got my Ornate shield before I joined them.<br>
<br>
PS. As to the person that told me to get lost, heh... I politely told em I had just as much right to be there as they did.<br>
Response - &quot;oh and how do you figure that?&quot;<br>
Me - &quot;2 reasons, number one - my guild isn't in the rotation though I see your's is in ******** Alliance and is...<br>
Me - &quot;and second, I dont insult people in tells to get a better chance at winning something =P&quot;<br>
Me - &quot;and since I dont want any of the loot anyway I dont really care if you think I should be here or not&quot;<br>
Response - complete silence<br>

When it really comes down to it Ogun and the others who have come to help us in the past could easily at the same time be in DN or somewhere like that but instead they have given up valuable time for pretty much no reward to help us out. And I was damn impressed by that. They have on most ocasions that I have seen been the some of the earliest to arrive and the last to leave (not counting raid organisers of course) whether we have beaten the dragon or not.<br>
<br>
As you said Lag if people have problems with your strategy (to use 53+ people) they have more than enough time to post here about there missgivings. <p><br><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thackray/Sigfile2.gif WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=100>

I know I talked to you later, but I pretty sure I forgot about that.  Sorry, but my mind wanders a lot and generally I've got several conversations going at once.  Lots of fun when in the middle of a raid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the Val raid thing, well that was the only time I actually went with them on a raid (well except a spur of the moment CT raid and a GD war).  As I said I was asked along to help so I was kind of surprised by that.  Especially since they were rolling on everything else.  Also all the healers except for I think Ogun were non Valoran.  Still, while I was upset with them I will admit that one experience an opinion doth not make.  And I guess I should be giving them more benefit of the doubt.  After all they dont know me from Adam so I wouldnt expect them to look out for me.  Not their job anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if anyone gives you a problem tell them to post up here.  I have to say I havent had roast newbie in a longtime and I'm starting to get hungry.  No one should be questioning your right, or for that matter any past CoG member's right, to be on any raid KGC allows you to be on.  For nothing else the experience is welcome as is the friendship and company.  And yes, to roll if you want.  I may not agree with Ogun rolling or even that we needed him, but the rules were stated and he WAS there so deservered to roll.  No question.  You should be thanked for helping and not rolling.  Just dont let the jerks get ya down. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think allowing anyone under 53 for dragon raids is the right idea.  It's more important to KILL THAT DARN LIZARD (no offense my scaley iksar friends), than it is to exclude uber-guilded or alliance folk from the raid so that non-ubers get a better chance at lewtz.  Was I disappointed that Ogun won the eyepatch instead of a scrub like me? Yeah, a little.  Heck, I was a little disappointed that a guy in Silver Daggers won a Cloak of Flames.  But then I remembered that that bard was feeding me and three others mana in the buff line, and he certainly wasn't just sitting around when we were fighting Big Red.  And Ogun rezzed at least 6 friends of mine, and there weren't any other 56+ clerics there, so those rezzes were invaluable.  The question you have to ask yourself is, would we have won without them?  I don't know.  You don't know.  And it's that uncertainty that gives them the right to join us and to roll for loot.<br>
Look at it this way, there is now one more eyepatch and one more cloak on the server.  The more stuff there is out there, the better chance that someone will sell it to you for a cheap price.  I couldn't have afforded my Dark Ember if there were'nt so many of them around.  Heck, a complete stranger gave me my Jaundiced Helm that i was using to buff people with (never underestimate the power of charisma <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) The economy of EQ is one of deflation, and when you are a scrub like me, that works to your advantage.<br>
Now plane raids are a different story, and KCoG has rules and guidelines specific for those, however, these really aren't written in stone.  Every raid is unique, and the situation can call for a either strict adherance to the rules or bending of them.  If I were running a plane raid, and we had enough people to make it a success, then I would turn away someone from Valoran, even Lagdalen, unless they said they wouldn't roll for anything, in which case, I'd agree to let them join if their added presence wouldn't cause the zone to lag.  If there was nobody of a certain class on the raid, than I would let an uber-guilded person of that class come along, to loot only no-drop class specific stuff.  Heck, why not? <br>
If we were short on people enough to jeopardize the success of the raid, than I would invite pretty much anyone I could get.<br>
So what if Valoran puts restrictions on guest-looting rules?  Hey, if you want to join them on a raid, you should know in advance what they are gonna let you loot.  Then you make the decision whether you want to join them or not.  The odds are they don't need you, and it's not like they announce publicly they are raiding ToV and inviting anyone who wants to come along. <br>
Yeah, there are some people I don't like in Valoran. But there are people I don't like in other guilds too.  No guild is perfect.  And I do like quite a few people in Valoran anyway.  I haven't gotten the impression that any one guild is trying to own the server.  I like the way Karana is set up so that things are shared and everyone pretty much gets along.   I think an anarchist would be pretty disappointed to play on our server, hehe. GOOD!<br>

Anyone can run any CoG raid they want, and set whatever loot rules they wish, as well as attendance rules. I'd love to see more people, especially the complainers who are always so silent except at the worst possible time, run raids so they can test their ideas. We need more leaders. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only stipulation on the CoG raids is that you adhere to the principles of the CoG, i.e. fun for all, no exclusions based on guild or not, unless mandated by another rule set (such as the KGC). Those who complain should try to run one... it will usually shut them up quicker than anything. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
