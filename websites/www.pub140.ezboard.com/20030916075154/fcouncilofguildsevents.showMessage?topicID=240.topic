Pickup groups are non-existant. You must have a rogue who can lockpick, or get a mule from Paineel to buy a key to get in. You CAN get in with Enduring breath and some wiggling, but take someone along who knows how to get in to do this. Once there, mobs hit HARD. Expect to be pouded for 90's and above (doubletapped) rooted, etc. Lots of elementals and golems, magic resists on them are high. The castle it gets even worse, as some mobs CAN'T be mezzed. Period. Bring a porter, because if you don't have a key to the tower, you'll have to get into the castle by hitting the floor area, and there is no way back up without a porter or a run through the castle (which is hard).<br>
<br>
However, the experience here is AMAZING. In 2 nights, hunting with groups as many as 16 strong, at level 45 I got 3 yellow bubbles. In a hell level. But expect to work for it. <br>

<br>
I went once at level 40, got great exp. but saw that as a tank, I was meat at 40. They just hit too hard. At 45 they were still pounding me, but I could handle it better. They have a pretty high magic resist, so at 43, expect to be a healer. Less than 45 gets real dangerous unless you are with a group that is above 45. <br>

Personally I dont think you need EB to get in.  But then I'm a wood elf and it's fairly simple for me to squeeze through the door opening.  I think any medium or small race can do so with a minimum of trouble, tho I suggest having EB up the first time.  Just make sure your swimming skill is maxxed.  Your swimming skill *is* maxxed right?<br>
<br>
XP can be insane here.  Which is generally why some guilds run raids here.  The loot is only average although loam armor does drop here, as does the the Mudman Enforcer.  Withered leather is rumored to drop, but I havent seen any yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Dont forget that with full groups here, you can clean up on xp.  You get the full group XP bonus in addition to the 20% Zone Experience Modifier from hunting in The Hole.  However, as Haemish pointed out you do work for it.  Plus because you generally cant do this zone with just one group you end up sharing the xp and that does dilute things to some degree.<br>
<br>
The only way out without gate or a port is through Master Yael at the end.  Once you go beyond the entrance you need to drop down a pit and you will not be able to get back out.  Which is one reason I think you see few people adventuring here.  If high level players want to hunt in a dungeon they're trapped in, they'll head to Seb where at least the loot is more consistant.  The aggro here is also insane.  I've seen massive trains that go from 1 mob to 10.  Lots of fun tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Now I have soloed the entrance area which just has some elementals but even there it can be hard and the xp is slow due to the few mobs you can actually kill.  They tend to swarm you even there.  So yes, bring your own group/raid.  As for hitting hard, yes I suppose they do, but then again I've gotten rather jaded from Velious.  To me hard starts at about 225.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What I find interesting is part of the Ranger epic is there and apparently there are mobs down there that drop the scales needed for the warrior and bard (I think) Epic quests.  So Vox and Naggy as well as Gore and Tal are not the only places to get them, or so I've heard.  But these mobs are apparently on the VS model with quite a few hps and AE harm touch.  Bring 3 or 4 50+ groups.  But even with this, the zone is generally deserted when I go there.<br>
<br>
All in all The Hole is a wonderful zone and I'd like to see some raids down there.  Hopefully if there's enough interest I'll see about organizing one.  My last raid there was with FA and I think they had about 20 people most of them between 53-58 I think.  Personally while I do consider The Hole to be cool, and it looks cool, and the xp cant be beat, I think I'd still rather go with the Arena in Kael.  If I'm only going to get xp out of something because the loot is poor I'd at least like to also get some faction.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've explored a bit with my Halfling Rogue, and it's a really neat place.  I believe that enchanters and rangers need to come here as well for their epics.  I would love to join you on July 1st.<br>
