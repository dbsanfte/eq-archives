An outstanding job in helping out with paperwork, politics, and battle stragety. Therefore, they will be the primary assistance in the plane raids I schedule and have first priority to being my management body for these. However, sometimes they cannot make it, outside obiligations, or in-game obligations. In the event they cannot show up, I will carefully select another group of people to assist. Therefore I reserve first 12 to 18 people for signup.<br>
<br>
2) Up to 42 people can signup for the event.<br>
<br>
3) Signup is on the first come first serve basis. Signup is on these boards. We will however, bump some people up in the signup list when their class is needed, such as clerics and enchanters especially. Most of these types of raids are impossible without at least those two classes and a few others. <br>
<br>
4) Although I am running the event, I'm more a focal point, or mediator. I usually will select one or more people from my management body to handle the event. One being the Battle Field Commander.<br>
<br>
5) The Battle Field Commander will organize and execute the battle stragety. He will decide who will be main assist, when to camp, evac, etc... <br>
<br>
6) The other leader, will perform other duties, such as organizing groups, managing treasure rules (within the policies specified), and anything else that comes up. Also this person will take over Battle Field Commander in the event of the current one dying.<br>
<br>
- Note: Leadership is not constraint to the above, just the typical way it is done. This is flexible depending on who is running the event with me. We will discuss this amongst ourselves to determine the best course of action -<br>
<br>
4) Any individual may sign themselves up and themselves only. They must list their name, class and level, as well as planes experience and guild in the signup.  You may only sign yourself up, no one else may go on your signup. All individuals must sign themselves up. Scheduling for planes are done about a week in advance.<br>
<br>
5) If a lot of people drop out, I would like to know at least three days in advance, so I can make last minute re-scheduling.<br>
<br>
6) Standby list can be done at your option and risk.<br>
<br>
7) NO one is to refuse a ressurection of any kind. Anyone who is found refusing a ressurection will be skipped over and ressed last. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Any use of /ooc or /shout or /auction to complain of exp. loss, tactics, or complaints, harrassing language, or insults of ANY kind, can and will result in that players dismissal from the raid, at the raid commander's discretion. <br>
<br>
<br>
Treasure rules:<br>
<br>
1) It will be lottoed for the class(es) that can use the item.<br>
<br>
2) Number rolls will be between 1 and 200, ties will reroll.<br>
<br>
3) Upon winning a lottery, you will be out of future lottos, until everyone in your class has obtained an item. Once everyone has obtained an item, everyone will lotto for the next item, and then they are out again upon winning. (repeat). Since there will be some No drop pieces that we might get, each class will lotto for their class-specific bits before the raid (that are no drop). The raid loot person (designated by the organizer or battle commander) will record these rolls. The highest roll gets the first piece dropped (of the NO DROP pieces only), then the next highest, etc. This is only to make sure that these pieces do not disappear before they can be lottoed. If the person whose roll entitles them to get a piece they already have (i.e. I won the roll, but the first piece that drops I am wearing already), the next person in the list will get the item. On the next drop, the person that was just skipped will get that drop. <br>
<br>
4) Members that arrive late, which is after we break the planes, will sit out of the first lotto for their class. This is intented to discourage arrive at anytime. We need the most people for when we are breaking in. Also so we are fair to the members that have been with us the whole time. Afterall, if a paladin comes in 4 hours late, paladin boots drop, and the paladin that just arrives wins them, it's not too fair to the other paladins that have been their all day.<br>
<br>
If you happen to be late, don't let this discourage you from showing up all together. You may say, &quot;Well I have to sit out of the first lotto, so I probably won't get anything anyways.&quot; Well this isn't necessarily true. I been to plane trips and seen 8 things drop for SK one time, then next time nothing drop for SK's. It's completely random. The last event we had one warrior that was late, but he got the item because only one other warrior, and he had the item already.<br>
<br>
5) If you win a lottery, you cannot log on as another character and have the other character obtain the item. Only those characters that are present can win. No lottoing for secondaries OR for other characters. <br>
<br>
6) BP's or unordinary items will be a seperate lotto. Therefore even though you may have won an item, your still in for a BP even though all the others in your class haven't won an item yet.<br>
<br>
Exceptions to the rules:<br>
<br>
If during the event someone leaves, and requires us to try and recruit someone out of necessity. That person will not be considered late because he/she was just invited and will immediately be able to participate in lottos.<br>
<br>
If someone logs on as another character to help out out of necessity) such as last time a druid left to get out a warrior because we had none. That person may choose to participate in Druid lottos instead of warrior lottos. In which case will allow him, if he wins to log out and get the item with his other character.<br>
<br>
I hope I didn't miss anything, I hate to redo this.<br>
