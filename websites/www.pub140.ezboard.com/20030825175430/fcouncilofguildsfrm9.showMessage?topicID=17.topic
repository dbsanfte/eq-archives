From what I have read on this part of the Ranger epic is this turn can be done several times for any Rangers that are ready for this step. <br>
<br>
So it would be great to have people that are familar with hole show up, and maybe an experienced raid leader (Forza ?)<br>
<br>
Tenative plan for raid is to meet in Nexus 8:00 pm est Saturday.  Barring any conflicts with other events, such as Naggy. <br>
<br>
So if your interested Please sign up<br>

<br>
The aggro radius of the mobs in there is large ( and will be larger if you are going with people under level 55 ), and once you hit the &quot;City&quot;, there are tons of mobs around you, even though you can't see them hiding in their little nooks and crannies in the buildings.  What usually wipes people is someone running from a mob and getting too close to a building - where other mobs will assist and come pouring out of the building in a chain-aggro nighmare.  A few mez resists/breaks later and you're all dead.<br>
<br>
Higher numbers doesn't mean success in The Hole.  I'd much rather take 8 people than 18 on a Jaeil / Keeper / Kirn / Kindle raid anyday.  Every undisciplined person you take raises your wipe chances a considerable amount.<br>
<br>
For The Hole, I prefer to fight as few mobs as possible to get through as quickly as I can.  A Paladin / Enchanter / Cleric can use their lull line of spells to achieve this goal.<br>
<br>
Pacify, Discipline, and Patience are normally your friends in The Hole.

It wasn't so much numbers that was the problem as composition.  We had 1 SK and a handful of rangers for tanks, 1 druid and 1 shaman for healing, 1 bard for crowd control (although we started the raid with 3).  Fortunately, we also had a wizzie, so we had an evac in each group.<br>
<br>
I think for future Hole raids, an enchanter and a cleric are a must.  Had we kept more than one bard, we MIGHT have been ok on the crowd-control side, but there's only so much I can do with an 18-sec mez, especially with the problems I was having targetting.  Much better to have an enchanter.    Also, each group should have an evac-capable member.  That saved us from an even worse CR than we ended up having to do.  Fortunately, there was a cleric hunting in the zone, so those who died could get some of their xp back, once we recovered their corpses.  And I learned that shadow knights get corpse summoning spells... I didn't realize that before.  I guess it makes sense, since paladins can res. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
For future raids to this zone, I'd strongly suggest that they be called off if at least one cleric, one enchanter, and a wiz/dru per group don't show up.  If I'm leading the raid, I *will* call it off under those circumstances.  If I'm not leading, I will not attend, as much as I want to support all the folks here on their epic quests. <br>
<br>
Looking at the levels of mobs in the zone (ratman warriors can be as high as 50, rock golems as high as 54), the enchanter probably ought to be at least lvl 45 to minimize resists on mez.  Everyone else should be ok as low as 40 as long as you have at least 10 people, although again, the higher the better.  If you only have one group, I'd set minimum level of at least 45 across the board, maybe higher.  This is assuming you're going for Jaeil -- if you're going for any of the other quest mobs, you probably need either more people or higher levels, possibly both.  Jaeil is only lvl 50, and not many of the mobs you'll see getting to him are higher than that -- most of the other named/quest mobs are higher (Yael is 56 -- one level <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>higher</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than Vox &amp; Nagafen), so will need a stronger force to take down. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

If you guys got further than halfway through the city, you did well, even with a great bard.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't take level 40 people to Jaeil because of level-based aggro.  If you go through the city ( instead of using the Skydive/CoH trick ) those level 40s are going to be aggroing so many mobs you'll get swamped killing things and then caught in repops.<br>
<br>
For a pick-up raid, unless I was highly confident of everyone's abilities, I wouldn't go in w/o 1 enchanter per group and 1 cleric per group because people WILL break mez and your chanter will die if it's the only one there.  85% of the &quot;Raid&quot; will be relatively easy fighting, but you will eventually get an &quot;Oh, Crap!&quot; moment and need all the healing and CC you can get.<br>
<br>
If you make it to Jaeil, you're set for the other epic mobs.  Kill your way to the Undead Tower and then IVU to Kindle's Room.  Send 1 group at a time to Kindle's room and have them turn left and stand in the corner after they get there.  If anyone loses IVU on the way there, they stand and die and the rest of the people leave them.  Drag the corpse(s) up after everyone is there.  Eventually, someone's IVU will wear off in Kindle's room, and they'll have to start the fight unless you can position someone to pacify the mobs and not get aggroed.  One of the mobs in there is usually non-KOS so ignore them.  Mez the other one that isn't Kindle and kill Kindle then take care of the add.  Pull Kirn to Kindle's room after the Shaman does the hand-in and you're done.  If Keeper was up when you got to the Undead Tower, then kill him for a Paladin before you head to Kindle.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know it, CRs in The Hole can be made less painful if several people have a standard &quot;brell-worshipping halfling rogue&quot; on their account.  A character of this type is not KOS to the Fiends, Golems, and Elementals, and can use Sneak/Hide to get past everything else in the zone, therefore making them excellent corpse draggers.<br>
<br>
You can drag several corpses at once, I'm pretty sure.  Try a hotkey like this:<br>
<br>
/target fred<br>
/corpse<br>
/target joe<br>
/corpse<br>
<br>
If &quot;fred&quot; and &quot;joe&quot; are out of range, then it should target the corpse instead of the player and will drag both behind you.  Make a couple of those keys and you can drag more than 2 corpses at once.  If you get 3-4 rogues doing the CR, you can pull the whole raid to the entrance in no time, especially if you SoW the rogues before zoning them in.  You can run all the way down to the first Ratman without being KOS and then kick Sneak/Hide in.  If the targetting doesn't work, then try:<br>
<br>
/target &quot;fred's corpse&quot;<br>
<br>
... maybe that will do it.<br>
<br>
The epic mobs aren't really that hard for a force that can reach them, it's the getting there that is tough.  Yael is pretty fun, but DTs every 30(?) seconds, so have some extra tanks with you.  He's highly contested for his Fusibility quest piece and girdle so you probably won't find him up too often.  <br>
<br>
Scalekeeper is like a mini-Venril Sathir ( procs a lifetap ) and will wipe a raid in no time at all.  He's not KoS to people but will assist anything in the zone.  Make sure you don't aggro anything while you are close to him or you will die.<br>

Jael the Wretched does not despawn when you kill the Insane form, so its very possible to do so, and more productive at that.<br>

<br>
Make sure the raid force knows not to attack wretched.  Have your chanters have Mem blur handy.  Make sure your MA knows the difference between the 2.  As long as the MA has the right guy targeted and everyone is assisting correctly, there shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
Everyone's assisting correctly, right?  *peers at the raid* <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

My dragging rogue has gotten lots of exercise there.<br>
I have seen 2 ways to go, 1. fight through the city, or 2.  DA cleric and DA pally down pit, CoH mage jumps and gets rez and pulls every one down.  May want to send a few pallies to clear bottom.<br>
<br>
If you fight, you will find yourself in a nice groove in the city.  Normally they come 3 at a time.  You will want to stay ahead of the repops.<br>
Safe spot to rest is at the water.<br>
Very important, when you pull the 2 guys in front of the bent bars leading down, you WILL get tons of adds.  My 3 times down there, this is where we wiped everytime.  The FD puller needs to know that at least 3 adds are coming, but you will not see them cuase they need to run around a wall.  I have seen them bring buddies, I think we had 9 in camp.  This is especially bad since you only see 2 for the first 30 sec or so.<br>
The monk will need to FD in camp.  I do not know if they should stay FD or not.<br>
After the bent bars, it should be a cake walk.<br>
<br>
Dropping down and fighting up is much much easier.  Going down through the city is much more fun and scenic.<br>
<br>
I would love to come and help you out.  I have a guild raid earlier in the day, but we should be done by 8pm.  <br>

One or 2 well-placed pacifies in the city area can stop a potential 6-mob train before it starts.<br>
<br>
I took my Enchanter all the way to the city the other day solo, with no fighting.  I want to try to get all the way to Kindle solo.  Unfortunately, the revamp will probably make this goal impossible =(<br>
<br>
Paratrooping in is definitely the way to go if you have the right personnel.  Check if Yael is up first or if Scalekeeper is in the area.<br>
