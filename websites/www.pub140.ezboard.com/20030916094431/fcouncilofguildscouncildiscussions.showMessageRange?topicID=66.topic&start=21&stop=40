In Baldur's Gate, for example, you can do anything you want because your actions affect you alone. In EQ, every action you take can have a positive or negative effect on a community... our server can easily have 10-20,000 people on it, with upwards of 2500 each night. If I bring 300 or so of my closest friends into the East Commons zone, I could crash the zone. Who am I affecting? <br>
<br>
If I run into Blackburrow and kill EVERYTHING in the zone, regardless of whether or not it's camped, who am I affecting? It's my game, it's my right to kill those spawns, as long as they aren't fighting someone else (by Verant rules). <br>
<br>
If a server population of 2000-3000 people or more (the planes capable people) on the server agree to a rotation system that gives them equal shots at the mobs in the planes, and 20 people start taking those spawns, killing them everytime they pop and keeping others from getting to them, who is that affecting? <br>
<br>
You see, if Shattering Steel were actually doing this to HELP the server, i.e. trying to figure out a better system that is even more fair for all, I'd be right there with them. I'd be working with them to do what I can. But they aren't. They've made no attempts to work with the server population. They've been asked politely to work with the rest of the KGC to help the server, and they have rebuffed us, with sarcasm and spite. They have twice messed up respawn times on non-American guilds, and all they have managed is to farm some armour out of the planes, for themselves. They haven't offered to create a better system, they have only said &quot;I'll get what I think is mine and no one can tell me I can't have it.&quot; I have PERSONALLY urged them to seek peace and respect the community on the server, which they laughed at. <br>
<br>
Now I don't condone verbal harrassment per se. But shunning them, you betcha. It's the only method of enforcement we have. I ask that anyone who does follow the ban do so politely and always explain why. Because I do not think all members of SS are bad. I think they are misled, and their guild leader is leading them in selfish attempts to be vindicitive to people on the server who he has it out for. To those members of SS who don't understand the uproar, I'll personally explain it to you, with history about the server and previous attempts to go FFA. <br>
<br>
One last thing... if you've never run a raid that involves and needs more than 2 groups, I urge you to do so. Run that raid, see how much work goes into it, and then stop and think about what would happen if you set a raid to go to the Hole for instance. You plan for a week, you spend hours going over attendance and making groups and moving the groups and keeping 40 people together. And you set up the raid with the understanding that you would be alone in doing it, because the other guilds who could have done it agreed to let you have it that day with no interference as long as you didn't interfere with their raid the next day. And you spend 4 hours getting to your goal, with ports and attendance, etc. and finally you get there.. and it's empty. Because someone who KNOWS about your schedule and KNOWS that you are coming there gets there first and takes it all, and then guess what? You have to wait 12-14 hours for the stuff to respawn. Feel good? Is that helping the server? <br>
<br>
That's what these guys are doing. They are parasites, ticks on the testicles of this server. <br>

I don't know, my thinking is sit back and eat popcorn at this point and wait and see what happens.  I fully understand what you are saying, however, SS does have good points hon.  I have talked to them several times, seems to be alright and generous.  My point is, flaming them was very nasty with you and several of your folks within the guild, also outside of your guild that are associated with KCG.   That kinda left a bad taste within the mouth.  I also know that my child Rezz and I were flamed via your website.  I happened to stumped across that one back in March in do believe.  That was untrue, but none the less you posted it.  So be it.  I never said a thing to that one.  Moving on SS, they have the right.  So let us move on.  You cannot stop them, they are on their game.  I really don't see it as being efficient to try and convert someone to what you think and the rest of the folks to a cycle that was made up.  Now maybe i'm totally wrong.....but camps are camps and that is bottom line.  Im sorry, I have been through many a camps, not talking plains now, if someone where sitting there or there was a camp check I just didn't go there.  I respected that.  I am sorry if I have offended you in way, was not intended to be.

The guilds on the rotation have basically said &quot;I'm camping Fear this night.&quot; The other guilds have respected that. SS has come in and made sure that when the first guild comes in, they will have nothing to camp for the entire time they are there. We aren't talking about orcs that spawn every 10 minutes and that any pickup group of complete strangers can take down in 5 minutes. We are talking about spawns that respawn every 12-15 hours and that require at LEAST 3 groups to coordinate on and attack. You CANNOT do pickup groups in Fear by design. You zone in and take 1 step, just 1 step and suddenly there are 4-12 mobs on you immediately, all of whom are your level or higher, highly magic resistant and in some cases totally resistant to being mezzed. You CANNOT compare the two and actually be logical about this thing. A dragon is not an orc in EC, or even the Frenzy in Lower Guk. A plane is not a raid on Befallen to get the stuff on the 3rd floor, it's like your worst nightmare in dungeons from levels 1-46 combined, and the manpower and organization it takes puts it in a whole other realm from anything else in the game. <br>
<br>
As for getting flamed on this board, I'm not sure what post you mean, but if you can find it and show it to me, I can tell you why it's still here. <br>

Many people think SS is wrong, bad, and so forth. Where I stand on the matter is of no concerns. Personally I think  the KGC rules are fine. If a  guild says something for there members not to help SS, well, i can't say whether it is wrong or right cause its not my  guild. BUT, and I mean  BUT!!!  When other people help SS, they  should not be punished. AND, the  harrassing needs to STOP. No matter what  SS did, the problem can be solved many different ways, but cursing at them, spaming bad language at them, basically  all around  harrassment needs to stop. If your a person who feels SS is evil and you want  to harrass them,  well thats your choice, but look in the mirror, your now worse then them. Many things can help the problem, but HARRASSMENT  hurts  more then just SS, it also hurts the server  as well. 2 wrongs don't  make a right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kellory>Kellory</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Unguilded Sexless Drood</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/13/01 12:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shattering Steel</span><hr size=1> I had this long huge post.  I have since deleted it, and written a whole new long one.  I apologize.<br>
<br>
This comes down to one thing.  Respect.  Shattering Steel does not respect anyone else on the server.  Therefore they have no right at all to expect any back.  They have consistantly shown through their ingame actions that they are only concerned for their own well being, rather than that of their neighbors and the guilds around them.  Perhaps the individual members of Shattering Steel are nice people.  That does not excuse the behavior of their guild.  <br>
<br>
Jezelbelle, you and Filidar both have accused the guilds that make up KGC of harrassment of members of Shattering Steel when it was not the guilds that were at fault but rather the members of the guilds.  Now you both have said that actions taken by a member of a guild reflect either well or bad upon the guild itself.  I agree.  But now lets take it a step further.  Do not the actions of a guild then reflect either well or badly upon the members themselves?  If a guild leader and officer are to be held responsible for the somewhat uncontrollable actions of a member, cannot a member be held responsible for the actions of a guild leader or officer?  A member of Shattering Steel may be nice, but their leadership has proven that they are only interested in hurting others.<br>
<br>
Both Miyabi and OAKS Alliance now have lost hours of their play time due to Shattering Steel.  You simply cannot reasonably camp a Plane unless you have 150+ members who can cycle through their sleep times since the spawns are between 8-24-72 hours.  Thats real time.  How do you think Miyabi or OAKS felt when they spent 2-3kpp buffing themselves, and several hours organizing, creating lists, porting people around, only to port up to Hate and find it empty?  Can they go elsewhere?  I suppose they can, but what about all the time wasted?  Shattering Steel's actions cannot be defended upon the basis of right or wrong.  They are obviously intending to only further themselves.<br>
<br>
The Karana server has long stood united in the idea that if we work together we can all benefit.  This means everyone, not just the uber guilds, but the small guilds, the medium guilds, even the guildless.  With the rotation system we can all have access to the Planes and large targets.  We can setup at our own pace, we can have fun, we can enjoy ourselves instead of just worring about getting to the target in time.  Shattering Steel is trying to destroy the very sense of community and trust that exists on Karana and NO WHERE ELSE on any of the servers.  You will not find a single server out there that is like Karana.  I think this is worth fighting for.  Not just for me, but for you, and the people around me.  Indeed for me its rather irrelevent.  In an FFA situation I'd just petition and join an uber guild.  But neither I nor the uber guilds want to see the smaller guilds hurt.<br>
<br>
If Shattering Steel is so upright and honest, I ask you where are they?  Where are their public reponses to our accusations?  Why have they not refuted our postition with their own?  Why have they not tried to talk to the other guilds?  I submit to you it is because the leadership of Shattering Steel has no intention of doing so.  They have told their members not to post anything because they are afraid of the light.  They are afraid that once their position becomes public they will lose what little support they have.  If they have a defendable platform I would like to hear it.  But my guess is all they can say is We are hardcore, you are losers, deal with it.  Well, we are dealing with it.  If they dont like it I suggest they leave Shattering Steel as soon as possible and join any of the hundreds of other guilds on Karana that would accept them.  All we've ever asked is for people to respect each other and cooperate.  We're here to have fun, not just a few hardcore players, but everyone.<br>
<br>
And Fildiar, how else do you suggest we solve things?  Perhaps if Shattering Steel is willing to talk to other guild leaders in a public forum then yes the boycott should stop.  But until then, what choice do we have?  If you have a solution please post it.  We need ideas here, and specific ones, not just pleas to stop.  We all want to stop, but not at the risk losing the very communities we've built here.<br>

They are all used to a FFA system and have no clue as to it's benefits. We can't help their ignorance at standing up for a guild on just another server (in their eyes) that wants to do the same thing they already do.<br>
<br>
They have peaded for outside support to try and strengthen their position by putting out false (some but not all granted) examples of them being &quot;wronged&quot; and are trying to get other guilds elsewhere to back them up.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of listening to their sap stories about how they &quot;just wanna have fun&quot;. well if they do, then mass move servers. It's only $150 US, trust me there's a few of you I wouldn't miss.<br>
<br>
Jez, to you specifically, until you actually understand what it's like to sit and wait 6 hours for even one mob to spawn that was yours, then maybe just listen and find out more before backing a decision that the masses have deemed is their wrongdoing. Are you even from Karana Server?<br>
<br>
To any outsiders reading this thread since I know this site was posted elsewhere - until you have a planes capable character on this server and actually SEE how our rotation works, I personally, and probably quite a few others, would prefer if you went back to your own server and dealt with your own KS problems before trying to be richeous and claiming ours is wrong and &quot;how can they hurt you? all they're doing is going FFA&quot;<br>
<br>
And for the people that feel they were &quot;forced&quot; off the server at the last split.. DAMN STRAIGHT some of you were! 2 past Ubers tried to go FFA, they failed and with their tail between their legs, they left. You want someone to blame? go speak with your GL and ask why they made a guildwide decision that would inevitably destroy you all.<br>
<br>
If you have the balls you can move back now, personally I'd rather not have you back though.<br>
<br>
Do I sound malicious or annoyed? sure thing. I dont care how nice someone is, if they make life miserable for everyone else, or contribute to that end even by being affiliated with them I have no use for them. NONE. When they leave that guild I would be more than happy to deal with them again, until then, they can rot in hell, ALL of them.<br>

I mean you waited 4 weeks to do this now its gonna be a week before she respawns.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is that the KGC makes it possible for large targets and hard zones to be hunted by smaller guilds or alliances in order for everyone on the server that wants the chance to have it.If SS were to succeed then basically the only guilds that could assemble fast enough and with enough force to do these raids would be the uber guilds.Now if you arent aware of the requirements to be in some of the strongest guilds on Karana maybe you should read the charter basically you must attend the raids if you are online and you have to be present more than absent,now somepeople can do that and enjoy it some dont have the time or desire to raid so often so they choose to join smaller guilds without the requirements,my point is do you want Karana to be a server that you have to join a guild that you dont want  but have to just  to have a shot at the large targets? or would you like it to stay like it is and make your choice as to what guild you are in and know you have the same oppertunities as the large guilds? I vote for choosing my guild because its the guild i like and not the guild I have to in order to take a dragon or plane.<br>

Ummm, question.  On what public board (besides their own) have they posted anything?  I think they had something on the Newbie Zone, but that was it.  Everything else I've seen is from people just posting, nothing offical from any member saying they are one.  I'd be interested in reading some myself.<br>

Let me clarify whose side I am on in this matter, I'm with KGC. What I was trying to say in my last post was for the harrassment to stop, of not just SS  members, but everyone  who in someway  is involved with them. Bocott (spelled  it wrong, I know, but  in a rush, want to ding hehe)  them is your choice, I'm not  saying thats wrong or right. No tp's or rez's is one thing, but when people send tells with threats and bad language, thats something totally different. You have crossed a line then, from Bocott (no rez's, etc) to harrassment (language  and threats). <br>
<br>
Kellory, I did not  mean in my  post earlier  anything about the guilds on karana server, I posted here cause I  know many people will see it and read it. I did not mean in anyway that if a  member of any guild  did this, it reflex his guild. The  post was ment for people to read it, and if they are one of the ones who have crossed the line, they have a chance to rethink what  they  did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukelemevorlyonsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelemevor Lyonsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/15/01 5:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shattering Steel</span><hr size=1> Before i make my statement, i wish to make clear this is how i stand on this issue and i do not represent FoF but myself only.<br>
CoG has been the only chance i have ever had to see any of the SUPER targets, and for many of you out there this will be the same for you.  The disruption of our rotations truly will have major impact on those of us that depend on CoG raids as that sense of fulfillment in completing a major goal.  I, since i know firsthand that the CoG must survive thru this troublesome time, stand beside ye all in the boycott.  I do not do this for myself however, nor do i do it even for CoG itself: but i do it for that level 1 character out there that one day shall be raid ready, and expecting CoG to be their route to seeing those large targets/planes.  It is for those *newbies* of the future that i put my foot down when i state that SS shall recieve not a moment's aid from myself.  I can only hope that we all can be civilized in our interaction with SS so that one day the light of our path might spread their way and they shall walk along with us.<br>

By the way, I am the current co-leader for the &lt;Royalty Of Norrath&gt; (Tornkin is our other co-leader).  I personally think that SS is in the wrong and I don't condone their actions at all.  I personally will be persuing a passive boycot of their guild (no tp's/sow's/buffs...).  I am going to also post this forum to my guilds website and let them make their own decision.  I would not ask any of them to ever shun any person because of the way I feal about an issue, but I will post this and let them decide for themselves if they do or do not want to stand up in this boycott.  So as far as RoN's stand on the issue, there is none....I personally am going to back the KGC and its members as they have done me right in the past, but I can't promise the same from all RoN members <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  May the god's bless us all and I can only hope that the issue is resolved ASAP! <br>
