<br>
We will be operating on the now (hopefully) familair Triage-Healing tactic.  All classes capable of binding in the pre-lair &quot;ready room&quot; MUST BIND there (we'll make it clear during the raid as to exactly where this is).  If you don't bind, you don't roll on loot.  Pretty simple.<br>
<br>
The Triage area where healers set up will be at the corner of the stairs facing into the lair (slightly closer than it has been previously).  Again, we'll make it very clear where this is when we get there.<br>
<br>
There will one or two waves of tanks (depending on classes and levels present).  Tanks will try and fight Nagefen in the MIDDLE of his room, NOT at the very back - we want to keep him out of range of the triage area without making the run back to get healed too extended.  Keeping pressure on the beast is the best way to ensure it's death.  All tanks that have resistant discipline should use it as soon as Nagefen is engaged.  It lasts for 5 minutes, helps ward off both the AoE Fear and AoE Lava spells.  If we can't kill Naggy in 5 minutes, we've probably lost...<br>
<br>
After the first AoE Fear goes off, all pets will be sent in.  Mages should use fire pets for preference, as they will resist Nagefen's AoE fire spells and hopefully live long enough to do some decent melee damage.<br>
<br>
When Nagefen is at or around 50% life casters will go in and nuke for all they're worth.  The exact timing on when casters will be called in depends on how the tanks are doing... if tanks start dying off sooner than expected, casters will need to go in sooner.<br>
<br>
The basic idea here is that the tanks go in and generate as much taunt as possible to allow the casters time to get in and do as much damage as possible - and of course the healers try to keep the tanks alive as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Minimum un-buffed resistances should be 70 for both Magic and Fire resistance.  Healer classes can go lower than this in order to keep their wisdom up for mana, but should still try to remain above 50.  Healers especially need to make sure they have enough Magic resistance to keep from being feared constantly.<br>
<br>
If you do not meet these resistance requirements - do whatever you can to get your MR and FR as high as possible.  Tanks especially need high resistances in order to live long enough to contribute to a successful raid.  If you have sub-standard resistances, you will suck away more healer mana than other tanks (who are fighting longer than you), and in the process of running back for heals you will be fighting the dragon for less time, doing less damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nagafen and Fire Giant loot rules:<br>
<br>
Almost all items are to be rolled on by any class that can use them.  There are, however, some exceptions - I've tried to list them all here.  If I've forgotten something, we'll deal with it when it comes... but all decisions made by raid admin are final.<br>
<br>
Cloak of Flames:  This item is to be rolled on by MELEE classes only.  Quite frankly a caster or priest has no where near the need for haste that a melee class does, and it will make us all stronger if items are used by those that will use them best.<br>
<br>
Polished Mithril Torque:  This item is to be rolled on by HYBRIDS only (Paladin, Ranger, Shadowknight).  There is better AC to be had for the other melee classes (even Fine Plate has better AC), and the +13 Wisdom and Int will be better used by a hybrid class.<br>
<br>
Rokyl's Channeling Crystal: This item is to be rolled on by PURE CASTERS only (Wizard, Necromancer, Enchanter, Magician).  Bards can use it, but, frankly, probably wouldn't even if they had it.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
Polished Mithril Mask: This item is to be rolled on by PRIEST and CASTER classes only.  They can make better use of the Wis/Int bonus, and Tanks can get the same AC out of store-bought steel or even bronze if they want it.<br>
*EDIT*<br>
<br>
Whenever possible we will try to pre-roll on NO DROP items that may drop in upcoming encounters.  This will allow faster ressurection should the winner die during the conflict, and will avoid wasting time trying to get everyone elligable to roll res'd before rolls begin.<br>
<br>
That's it everyone - I hope to see as many of you as possible in the near future, and would like nothing more than tip back a few ale's in good company while looking at the body of a dead Red Dragon! <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

<br>
Just a couple of ideas tho.  <br>
<br>
1) You didnt mention a reagent fee.  Dunno, does that sound better than entrance fee?  heh.  I would suggest going with the numbers I mentioned last night for the reason discussed.  However, it is up to you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) I'm really not sure if this will make any difference, but I would suggest that any caster that dies during the battle and comes back in, mem not only their damage spell, but also RM if they have it and cast it on themselves before entering combat again.  It shouldnt take more than an extra 10-15 seconds to do this and it might keep the caster from being feared once or twice.  With Vox had half the casters been feared just 1 less time, we probably would have taken her down.  Because you lose all buffs and gear when you die, this would be the only resists you're wearing when going in.<br>
<br>
3) I dont really have a point 3, but I thought this would look silly with just 2 things.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would also like to restress Kommisar's point about tanks making sure you have the proper resistances.  Unlike casters you cannot come on back in if you die.  And if the tanks die, then we will lose.  Period.  There is no way that the casters can take down a dragon without tanks to protect them.  You must live for as long as possible.  Please do not skimp on them thinking you'll be the only one to do so.  Low resistances are one of the things that have run many guilds/alliances and even CoG into trouble before with these large target mobs.  Resists are everything, above and beyond even ac and atk and str.  For tanks on these raids, everything else is pretty much secondary.  Remember, what kills you isnt their physical attacks so much as their AoE spells and Fear.  <br>

I guess I did forget to mention the reagent fee.  I guess I figured it was probably covered in the sign-up thread - but uh... repetition isn't always a bad thing, so here it is:<br>
<br>
Everyone showing up at the raid should have 50pp to cover reagents and consumables used during the raid.<br>
<br>
Some people may ask, &quot;Why 50pp?&quot;.  Well, here's a brief answer:<br>
<br>
The 50pp is used to cover the reagents we use during buffing.  Now, while the reagents we use may not total 50pp per person for some raids, this fee is also used to help fund future raids and other events.  Some times we come up a little short, some times we come up ahead... and things generally seem to balance out across all the raids CoG hosts. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

Mind you it wouldn't be a raid without someone complaining.  Thanks for bringing into my attention, and I certainly will ensure we do it differently next time. <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">

The above in response to someone ( seemingly in a tank-class group ) complaining about not getting a Symbol buff during the raid.<br>
<br>
For those of us who weren't there, and didn't hear the explanation, what is the determining factor for who gets a symbol buff in a KCoG-typical dragon raid? Is it reserved for only &quot;tank&quot; classes ( War, SK, Pal ), or Melee ( tank + bard, rogue, monk ), or is there some other method of determining who gets this important buff for damage-takers?<br>
<br>
Our Guild will be joining the KCoG soon, and the more I learn about your processes, then better. <p>-Zymyool, Officer and WebMaster for the <a href="http://members.cox.net/ancient" target="_blank">Ancient Adventurers</b></a> on the Karana Server

I didnt get symbol cast on me, I got cheated of my raid fee. The response from Azure, the raid leader, was basically ( my paraphrase) raid fees pay for lots of things, reagents for buffs on the support groups, for coffins and for a number of things besides bufss on just your group.<br>
<br>
As far as who gts what buffs cast on them , this like everything else is determined by the raid leader or whomever they desigante to decide such things. The raid leaders instructions and decisions are law and should not be disputed at the time of the raid. As far as what classes get symbol cast on them at raids run by Azure, I can't anser that as I am a druid and have nothing to do with it. Perhaps Azure can give some insight on this issue.<br>
<br>
The point is that the raid fee pays for more things than just buffs. What all I couldnt tell you. Im not the raid leader. I would like to point out that Azure has reduced the raid fee from 50pp to 30pp as far less was being spent then that being taken in so the fee was reduced. again, azure would be the best one to ask who gets symbol cast on them . <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

Make sure you read these with the mindset that I am interested in information because I want to learn, not that I am challenging any strategies / decision.  I have never -been- on a dragon / plane raid so I have no ground to challenge anyone on -any- decisions on a raid.<br>
<br>
What is the rationale for doing a tank rush ( in this case, 1 or so groups of tanks rushing in ) -vs- having 1 MA building aggro while chaining CH?  Is the problem with having 1 MA that at our lower levels ( no defensive disc ), the MA has no chance of surviving the full assault of Naggy, even with a CH chain ( at which point the clerics go down in succession after the MA bites it )?  Is it a lack of discipline on a multi-guild raid?  Something else entirely?<br>
<br>
Actually, I'll save my second question for its own thread as it's not specific to Naggy, or even Dragon raids.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your upcoming Naggy Raid!<br>

<br>
Yes generally everyone gets symbol and sometimes we rune our melee. Both take peridots which are paid for by the raid fee. You also may not get as strong a buff or stronger, depending on what levels and classes we have attend. Meaning if the highest cleric is lvl 45, then if would affect the strength of the buff you recieve.<br>
<br>
Why did someone NOT get symbol. I don't know. I was not running the buffline. Also you need to remember that this was NOT a typical raid, due to the type of raiders we had and thier lack of discipline.<br>
<br>
Yes. Sometimes things get overlooked. If you did not get a buff that you think you should have gotten, ASK before you camp to chat. Ask your group leader, raid leader, or buff coordinator. But remember that they are busy (usually 7-10 tells at once) and it may take sometime for a response.<br>
<br>
We had an incident where the buffer was inadvently told to cast the wrong buff. As a result, raiders didnt have Resist Magic. After it was brought to the attention of the raid leadership, it was taken care of in the best way that was possible at that time.<br>
<br>
Raid fees used to be 50pp per person. The fees are used for reagents...i.e. peridots, coffins, etc... Normally this would come from a guild or alliance fund. But the KCoG is neither of those. That is why we have a raid fee. I recently reviewed how many reagents we use vs. how much we have in raid fees. This was the first raid where the lower fee of 30pp was paid.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to break it down... if you get both symbol and rune, thats 2 peridots. But what if we fail and your corpse is under the dragon or in a pit? What if we dont have a rogue that can do CR? What if we dont have a Necro that can summon? So the cost of geting a Necro or Rogue, plus coffin costs adds to way more than 30pp.<br>
<br>
We have had 5 of the last 6 raids be successful. We usually have had the privledge of a rogue who is an expert at corpse retrival (which lessens our need for a Necro). We don't always have a Necro and in the past have had to cast lev instead of DMF. Rezes would take ALOT longer if we didnt have an Epic Cleric with us. Having these people with us is an Honor not an expectation.<br>
<br>
Strategy-<br>
<br>
I am not a tactics expert. I learn from what others have done. In this case, I generally use the same tactics as my predisessor, Kommisar.<br>
<br>
I am a healer. So when I do change tactics a bit, it usually has to do with the role of the healers/casters in the raid.<br>
<br>
With a guild or allaince, it is easier to try or change different tactics. Again, KCoG is not a guild or alliance. When I do make changes I usually introduce them one at a time or based on the given situation. <br>
<br>
One of the significant changes I made was putting the clerics in the lair to heal the tanks, and leaving the rest of the healers as triage. This has been succesful many times. But I dont use it all the time. I didnt use it this last Naggy raid because we had only a few clerics and the behavior of the raiders.<br>
<br>
In closing I want to say, mostly for those who attended this last Naggy raid and who have been reading and posting on this forum:<br>
<br>
This was NOT a typical dragon raid. I have led 6 raids since taking over for Kommisar and the last 5 have been successful. But this last Naggy raid was the worst I have led as far as the discipline and respect of the raiders.<br>
<br>
I know things did not go well. I know mistakes were made by many. It was full of confusion and back talking.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER question someone why they did or did not do something. I will NEVER point fingers or lay blame. I will NOT single one person out to ridicule or interrogate.<br>
<br>
If something needs to be said, it will be done directly to that person. And if they need to be removed from the raid, they will be, as I have had to do on one occasion prior. <br>
<br>
We are all intelligent people who know right from wrong, and know how to learn from our own mistakes and from others. I hope we all learned something from this last raid that will help to improve those that follow.<br>
