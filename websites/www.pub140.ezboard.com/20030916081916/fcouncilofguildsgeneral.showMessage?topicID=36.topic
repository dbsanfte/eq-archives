He was the leader of the guild and now that leaves me and our high ranking officer Raben kinda lost.   <br>
<br>
I dont know if this is even important to any of you,  but i dont feel that the guild leadership should be transferred to Soleeb's new character,  just because it is the same person controlling him.  I think we should treat it as a removal from the guild, and replace himwith someone qualified,  namely me or Raben..<br>
<br>
I don't know how Soleeb,  excuse me,  i mean Citen feels about this,  because i haven't voiced it to him yet.  Haven't had the guts to tell him that i think its wrong.<br>
<br>
just reply here,  in game or email me at<br>
jarrad_morelock@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
im really kinda distraught over this...<br>
<br>
so i guess what im saying is,  im throwing in a vote of no confidence for the entire alliance that the person playing Soleeb is no longer able to carry on duties as our guild leader.  Our support,  our members and our effectiveness and presence have all dwindled,  and are barely hanging on right now.  So there it is,  vote of no confidence.  Suggested Replacements: Keyn Soulfighter,  and Raben Eagleheart<br>
<br>
thank you for your time... <p>Keyn SoulFighter

It's not the first time he has deleted characters as i know him in real life,  and if he does it back then,  and does it now,  what's saying he won't continue to do it.  <br>
<br>
All im saying is,  the guild doesnt need to be moved around the current feelings of a certian person on which class is better.  the entire guild doesnt need to have to change just because he changed.  just do what we would do if he couldn't play way back when his computer quit.  I took over leadership of the guild.  Besides if the leader steps down,  should the next in command step up? <p>Keyn SoulFighter

<br>
If your curious why ive changed from a lvl 20 warrior to a lvl 10 mage, its becuase despite anything else, i want to have fun in Everquest, and I had simply stoped having fun as my warrior. Also, most members of my guild are around the 5-15 range anyway, only about 4-5 range in the upper teens to 20s I beleive, so its not like i cant particiate in guild events. Anyway, just thought youd like to know this. <br>

<br>
Lastnight while playing we were verbally assualted by a horrible twink,  lvl 9 monk in a oracle robe.  He used the 'F' word many many times,  and left saying &quot;F*** YOU CITEN!&quot;  just because he had camly sadi no need for the language,  we're all ok.  So to uphold our honor we challenged him to a duel,  i lost because he kept getting heals,  then citen dueled him because even after he beat me he was still running his mouth (BTW: i was playing as my 10 necro,  Ezzerno)  So Citen dueled him and beat the holy crap outta him.  Then this stupid little twink got on as his lvl 50 druid and came back to assault us verbally again,  challanging us to duels.   yeah,  lvl 50 vs. lvl 10 is a real proving ground, im sure.  Anyways the characters name was Tuko,  a member of wolf pack.  So when we got tired of arguing with his immature tounge,  we left to go do some hunting in NRo,  As soon as I had a Giant Scarab pulled and was attacking it,  he cast some high lvl druid DD spell and wiped it out,   so then i propmtly petetioned him for KS'ing.  (BTW: i had petetioned him earlier when he verbally trashed our group)  and soon after he dissapeared,  and his lvl 9 monk's corpse stayed there until when i left,  i'm not sure if he ever came back for his stuff or not.  I'm sure this incident in NO-Way reflects the actions of the Guild Wolf Pack but i will be sure to let there guild leader know that they have such chilidish players as him. <p>Keyn SoulFighter

If someone is harassing you like that..always do a /report (their name) while the abusive text is in the chat window (You may have to scroll back up to do this). Then /petition a Guide/GM that you reported it.<br>

<br>
DeSani did also mention that a /report will grab the last 25 lines of /Say, /Tell, /Guildsay, /Groupsay, /ooc, /shout for your character.  The conversation with DeSani alluded to it not mattering if you paged up or not and it wouldn't report anything other then &quot;conversational&quot; commands.<br>
<br>
He did warn us that we could not /Auction, /ooc or /shout that this guy was a %^&amp;*( ninja looter as that would be considered harrasement, /say, /Guildsay and /groupsay were ok though they might frown on /say in certain instances.<br>
