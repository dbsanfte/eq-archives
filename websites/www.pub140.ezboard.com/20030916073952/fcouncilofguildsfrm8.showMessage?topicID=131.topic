<br>
I'll leave the specifics for Lagdalen and Flarren, but I will recap what I saw, or at least recall seeing...<br>
<br>
No clue when we got things started, though people started to assemble around 6pm MST.  Not sure on exact numbers, though based on the cash I got to hold on to...there were 44 people on the raid...minus the Valoran group, which was 5...2 in that group may have been included with the raiding group...i know there was a 51 rogue in the CR group.<br>
<br>
Discipline was far better this time.  I didn't see any gates opening or people continuously crossing points that they weren't supposed to.  I corrected one person once...he got confused because the Valoran guys went ahead through the doors...thought we were all supposed to go...gave a polite tell and the problem was solved.  Outside some emote spamming/drinking/mild chat items, discipline couldn't have been much better.<br>
<br>
Execution was probably the reason we lost.  I didn't get to witness all of it...went LD at the 60% mark, but from the reports I heard, the Healers didn't do quite what they were supposed to, nor did the tanks give the healers fair warning.  No one really to blame for this, nor would there be reason to blame anyone for it if there were.  Something to stew over next raid so it doesn't happen again.  Guestimates were we had her down to the L in Lady Vox...that's about 5-10% folks...we almost nailed her.<br>
<br>
Next time be sure to have a hot button /shouting that you need a heal (for the tanks) and that the healers make sure that person gets healed.  For all intents and purposes don't pay attention to the red bars in your group...look for the red text and get that tank back in.<br>
<br>
I honestly think we could have taken her down in a 2nd attempt...we had the man (and woman) power to take her out...just missed the first go.  Had the timing been better (ie not been 1-day notice) we would have won.  Too many people had to go, or we probably would have made a 2nd attempt.<br>
<br>
We improved leaps and bounds since the last raid...some minor flaws in communication were about the only hitches...definately something that won't hold us back long...I have a feeling we'll have a nice streak of dragon victories in the future <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Final notes:  I can't begin to thank Valoran for donating thier time to the raid.  Ashavir, Ogun, and Madori especially for the pulling before and Corpse pulling after...as well as Ogun's rez stick...that saved us god knows how much time.  It was a pleasure working with them.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if you guys know...but during the buffing line I very well could have killed everyone, or at least that's what it felt like distance wise.  While everyone was buffing, I was in Vox's lair pulling the giants out...at one point I got feared down almost to the bottom of the first ramp...had Vox not hit me as hard as she did, I may have pulled her into summoning range and that would not have been good at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  Kudos to whatever god was watching over us.  I don't know if that's a normallity...but it was a pretty sketch moment for me...I was expecting 40 very pissed off people /tell spamming me for ruining the raid about 2 minutes after I popped back in Thurgadin (was bound there)...glad everyone at least got to see her.<br>
<br>
Corpse Recovery went pretty smoothly...wish i would have been rezzed earlier so I could have helped earlier...but that's how it works...no one to blame for it and no reason to do so anyway...I got to play Ollie Ollie Oxen Free with Vox a time or two...ran to the hallway behind her throne and rezzed (poor man's CoH as Ogun put it...hehe)to an intentional corpse in the hallway so the Valoran guys could pull bodies from under her.  Not sure how well the strategy worked...but it sure was a lot of fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Three cheers for Valoran...if Karma does exist, these guys are in for a real treat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>

<br>
One thing I will add is in regards to how we handled buffing.  Don't get me wrong, I think the Valoran folks did an amazing job and getting in there was so much faster and easier than ever before - especially given how late we got started, they were a big part of how smoothly the raid went.  I can't begin to thank them enough.<br>
<br>
When it came time to do buffing, however... I think part of the reason we lost is that there basically weren't enough buffs in front of our CR and MR:  My resistances got dispelled considerably earlier than usual, and the mass-dying of tanks happened noticable earlier than I remember happening on previous successes.  Had there been fewer tanks dead so soon, fewer people feared so early because the MR buff lasted longer... I think we would have popped her easily.  Also, the addition of a rune, as well as DMF (which is very hard to dispell, and really should be in front of the CR buff, not last as usual) would have helped tank survival a little more - probably enough for a win.  We had her down to the beginning of the 'L' in 'Lady Vox' - that's in the 1000hp left range... we were damned close.<br>
<br>
Another factor was basically luck... Vox has a number of healing spells she casts - Greater, Superior, and Complete.  I've gone through entire raids and seen her cast nothing but GH and SH, &quot;Lady Vox feels much better.&quot;   Tonight she went for CH's... but even with that we would have nailed her with just a little bit more damage to push us over the top. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

I've been sent home sick from work today cause of no sleep last night and was so dead I didn't get to start one last night.<br>
<br>
Started out slow, comes with only 1 days warning and for that I'm sorry to those of you that are not used to CoG and its methods of movement.<br>
<br>
Getting in was quick, IG's were dispatched in record time by Valoran and buff line was completed rather quickly. Good job all for keeping eyes up for messages.<br>
<br>
Reason we didn't have DMF last night was cause there were no necro's, and next time we'll be sure to throw on a few crappy personal buffs too. Other than that buff line went very well.<br>
<br>
As to listening. I have never been more impressed. In the chat room everyone sat and listened to the directions and asked questions at the end. Good job! That made my life alot easier and got us back in alot faster.<br>
<br>
Got ready, tanks up to the ramp, clerics to the back of them and called the attack after a confirmation from all groups. No hesitation this time, everyone was ready to kill. Her life began dropping regularily fast as the progressive waves were called in. My first death was at about 30% after unloading into her tummy. I had taken a trip out to the triage line but there seemed to be no healers there (I might be blind) it all looked like a mess of tanks just standing there. Healers where were you? I got kinda confused then. I got a mini heal from a paladin I believe and ran back in to see her at about that 30% which is when she got me. Progressively with my 7 deaths she kept loosing life. Scared she would CH, I ran in to unload as fast as I could along with everyone else. Just before my last death I was standing under her with less than half an L left in her name and the worst thing ever happened. Vox began casting and then her life went up. I was promptly feared and just before being killed by her AE managed to call the Back Off.<br>
<br>
Talk about depressing. She was under 10% for about 5 or 6 of my deaths but just couldn't put the dmg into her fast enough.<br>
We were close though. SO close.<br>
<br>
Big thank you too all those that attended (as you've noticed I have tried to skip the godawful nasty parts of which there weren't any really and stay positive about it) The promptness of the group leaders was great on reports, movements were controlled and Valoran, we owe you again.<br>

C ya all in a few days when Naggy is up.<br>

Many other alliances and guilds would have passed in the same situation.  No matter how Uber you are, if your people are not online, you can do squat.  We were still able to muster 45 people on extremely short notice.  Under 6 hours I believe.  Considering we are sort of limited to people between levels 40 and 52, thats amazing.  Made even more so since many of the CoG guilds and friends were busy with their own alliances that night.  CoK and AoVB were on Hate and Fear respectively.  We were shorter than a gnome thats been cut off at the knees in fact.  But we still managed to muster a raid.<br>
<br>
Our discipline was tight all night.  No other word for it.  There were a few problems with emotes and spamming, but that was quickly cleared up, and not repeated.  That was good.  I have no problems with people making an honest mistake or not understanding something.  Once.  After the rules were explained, it didnt recurr.  That is how its supposed to happen.  Even in the chat room things were very orderly and organized.  No one inturrpted Lag when she was giving instructions.  That was a good thing.<br>
<br>
The buff line went quickly and very orderly.  When it was time to go, people did not wander into the pits and other ramps.  We went in when told and the waves did their job.  Vox did not move till the very end, and that wasnt really anyone's fault.  With the lack of tanks to hold her to the wall, and casters getting feared left and right, there wasnt anything else we could do.<br>
<br>
Healing.  This seems to be a major problem.  On the other hand, we only had, I believe, 1 cleric.  Besides Ogun who cant help during the raid.  And I think 3 shammies.  That was it for the healers, since druids were ordered in to nuke.  Now, I'm not saying that we had any other choice.  We had to go with what we had, which was 1 cleric.  Also a druid sub 51 isnt much good for healing a tank, or even a buffed caster.  Gheal just doesnt cut it on raids like this.  And between 51-52 a druid can land nukes effectively on Vox.  I know I did about 5k or so damage on her, maybe more.  I only got 1 partial resist, no full resists, and emptied my mana bar twice.  So I cant say I would've been more effective healing.  Especially considering how light we were in nukers of the appropriate levels.  But I believe that was why we had such a hard time healing the tanks.  I dont see how we could have done anything differently tho, except maybe find more clerics next time.  We simply had too few of everything and had to make the best with what we had.<br>
<br>
I know the KGC rules can be messed up at times.  But look at it this way.  In spite of the lack of time and forewarning, despite the fact we were unable to trade with another guild, despite the fact we had even fewer than usual numbers to draw on, we still were able to muster and make the attempt.  Call it what you will, I say we succeded.  And Naggy had better look out.  We've got some serious revenge to take out.<br>
<br>
You did a great job with what you had Lagdalen and Flarren.  I wish it could've been more and I wish we could've taken her.  But we had enough to try, and we failed not through lack of effort or leadership, but in the end more to bad luck and some bad resists than anything else.  We gave our best with no holding back and we should all be proud of that.<br>

I thought things were going great as the first wave went in, then as the second wave went in some of the first wave were oming back for heals.<br>
<br>
I went on a complete mana burn at that point.  I could not cast fast enough.  I had particle effects and spell messages turned off, so I can't say what the other healers were doing. Had I not remembered that I had those options off, I would have been screaming my lungs out since I saw no one healing except me.<br>
<br>
I had tanks screaming for heals, and all I could do was &quot;/shout OOM, and heading towards Vox&quot; (or something like that).  Never imagined I would be running like my head was on fire straight into Vox's face!  And to top it off, I got to Vox and hit Attack.  I also managed to squeeze off 2 Cannibalize II's and unload a Shock of the Tainted.... Resist.  But it got her attention as she finally turned to me and said, &quot;Stupid Iksar.  Die.&quot;   And I did... finally.  <br>
<br>
After my 3rd death Vox was still showing only about 5% life left, but I saw no one in the lair. Not a soul.  Every tanks was dead by that point, and the casters were no where to be seen.  Reason?  All the casters had just ran from the lair screaming their heads off like all the demons of hell were chasing them.<br>
<br>
There was speculation that we did not have enough healers without the druids.  I don't know what number of healers we had, but using the druids as nukers was a good idea.  Maybe keeping a couple back as healers could have been the edge we needed.<br>
<br>
All in all, this raid went so well that I am surprised we did not take her down.  I am very happy that Valoran cleared the way to the lair for us, and then continued to help out with buffs and CR.<br>
<br>
Stonescale did not mention it, so I will.  The Peacekeepers had an astonishing 6 people at the raid.  In over 2 years we have not managed that, so this raid was a milestone for us.  Also, Stonescale related to me how honored he felt to be chosen as Loot Master and to be a puller.  I was honored and anxious to be chosen as a group leader (you should have warned me Lagdalen!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
One last item..... Someone related to me that she felt a bit abused last night at the raid.  She did not fit the typical role for her class at a Vox raid, but she put her life on the line just as everyone else did.  She related that several people told her she was useless.  She knew that she did not fit the typical role, but that is beside the point.  If I ever hear someone telling someone else they are usless on a raid while that person is giving it their all, you can bet there will be hell to pay. <p><hr>

Suggestion, next time take more healers. Might of been a good idea to have any 51/52 druids stay out and heal instead of nuke, if we had any with us.<br>
<br>
I don't think it was a problem with shouting, problem was we can only cast so fast. I know I was casting constantly, it's times like that, that I wish I had been a high-elf.<br>
<br>
I think it was my sorry level 50 self and one other 49 cleric covering 3 groups screaming for heals.<br>
<br>
After my first 6 complete heals I died.<br>
Went up did 2 more CHs, died.<br>
1 more CH and a superior heal, OOM I think, had to go kill myself, that took time.<br>
Got back, no one to heal (most dead), ran in cast a couple heals on someone, feared, died. <br>
Ran back, saw Vox at a SLIVER! It wasn't 5-10%, it was .5% MAX. No tanks, just casters trying their darndest to not get feared, so I nuked her, failed, stunned her failed, died. (should of ressed a couple tanks)<br>
Came back and she was CHed, I ducked out and camped to clear agro.<br>
<br>
There's the battle from my POV, honestly I think we did good, we had a ton of help. It was nice to get down to the dragon without having to deal with the giants along the way. Ogun has been to every raid I've been on with this group, an invaluable asset. I only wish our group had someone who could fill his shoes. *cough* epic *cough* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thanks to Kommisar for getting me into his group again. I'm starting to think it's not coincidense. *wink*<br>
<br>
Thanks to that guy with the Ranger Epics, Those things make me wanna start a ranger.<br>

On a more serious note, I do thank the organizational team for giving me a shot at Lewt Holder...I'll try to actually make the chat room next time (was clearing the lair still and getting buffed up...had gotten my last buffs when you guys came back). <br>
<br>
As far as looting goes...we didn't get the pally roll before we went in after her...was kinda disappointed in myself for not getting that done, but I was busy running around, so it's not like I meant to avoid it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

***Edit***<br>
<br>
Last night was a huge night for me personally.  My guild had record attendance online (14ppl...don't laugh too hard), Record attendence to my knowledge at any large scale raid, 6, and doing all the dodge ball stuff with vox before and after.  The latter was icing on the cake, but the first 2 were the cake.  <br>
<br>
I was given the torch of the Karana chapter and had basically a torch and 2 members to work with.  I didn't even have the standard 10 people...as we were already set up on Karana (We split onto TZ, then Karana disbanded 'till i got the GL).  To see it grow and prosper into what it is now gives me a big sense of accomplishement.  All my officers and members are the reason for it and I'm so damn proud of what we've done as a team.  <br>
<br>
One of the guild founders said &quot;Pass him the torch and let him set Kithcor ablaze&quot;...Last night I saw the first bits of that blaze start to catch.  <br>
<br>
I know none of that has anything to do with the dragon raid, but even us failing in taking Vox out wasn't going to bring me off the high I had yesterday.  Big thank you's to everyone in my guild, lvl 50 or lvl 5, and big thank you's to everyone that went on that dragon raid that helped make the day that much sweeter for me...loosing to Vox or not<br>

It worked as well as could be expected.  My post earlier was more to try to explain that the healers were not able to effectively heal everyone because there simply werent enough of them.  On the other hand, the same can be said for all the other classes.  We were simply short due to the timing of the raid.  Nothing we could do about it.  Yes, more clerics would have been better or keeping the druids out to heal, but neither was possible.  We had a couple of 51-52 druids, but all we could have done was drop 5 or 6 Sheals.  I'm not sure, but that probably would not have been enough to offset the direct damage we were able to do.  Remember that druid spells are mainly fire based and their heals much less effective and more mana intensive than cleric ones.  Slower too.  And at those levels we have the best chances of actually landing a nuke.  Especially when you consider the lack of other nuking classes.  This was a situation that everyone did the best they could with what they had.  Any problems that occured were not anyone's fault, but merely the result of having too few people of the appropriate levels and classes.  And even there, as I stated before, we could not do anything about.  Vox spawned very unexpectedly.  We had something like 6 hours to find enough people and prep for the raid.  So its not surprising we came up short.  And we did very good when you take all that into account.<br>
<br>
And I am simply appalled that anyone could tell someone else on the raid that they were useless.  We didnt have enough people at some occasions to attempt to clear the IG's without help.  We had to scrape the bottom to find people, and I for one was very grateful for those who did choose to come along even tho conventional wisdom says they're &quot;useless&quot;.  No one on a CoG raid is useless.  And all joking aside, everyone including myself, do contribute more to a raid than just lag.  If nothing else they may provide suicidal cannon fodder or an extra small heal or a few low nukes that might save the day.  You dont know.  And even if all they can bring is a joke and a good attitude, thats worth it in my book.  I'd rather have a lowbie with crappy equipment who has a good attitude and a few jokes along than a lvl 52 warrior in full cobalt wielding his epics that is condesending.  Not only can we not afford to be picky, last night was a prime example, but CoG really exists for the little guys.  The people who would not normally get into raids or large targets.  All I can say is that whoever made those comments is lucky I didnt find out and unload on them, and they're doubly lucky with sugar on it that Lag didnt find out or I can gaurantee that she would've made them wish they were somewhere safe like a PvP server or something.<br>

That raid was my very first Large target raid of any kind and it was VERY exciting, heheh.  Well actually TSW tried to take down Faydedar for Eldaren's epic a bit back but that kinda ended up more of a slaughter than raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I thought for the time constraints it went quite well even tho we didn't take her.  I don't think i've ever seen i mob with such low health, lol.  That last part was very rough and I know that as an enchanter that if I and my fellow chanters would have gotten off like i swear 2 mana seives she wouldn't have CH'ed that time.  I think we did pretty good and kept her mana very low and she would have CH'ed earlier but she had to wait for her mana to build up again at those insane mana regen levels they have, the kind that makes clarity II look like breeze to a level 100 mob, heh. Anyway I started getting a very bad feeling when at the very end when i would run back in after death and I notice that im the only one standing in the room and then get feared again and i run back thru everyone else who just recovered from fear and then i would run back again thru the wave of the newly feared people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I like that idea of the classes who can cast a MR resist spell(aka me) on themselves again before they run back. I would have tried that myself if i wasn't so frantically excited about the whole thing at the time and it probably would have allowed me about 2 more seives.  Oh well on that, hehe.  I also wanted to say thanks for making the raid extremely fun for a first timer dragon raider.  Even tho we didn't win i didn't care, it was such great fun.  Makes me VERY happy i saw that shout in EC while playing my monk that the Vox raid was open to anyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Also let me have a chance to talk with some friends while i was there( aka Euwyn) and I agree that the cooperation was very good.  You guys do a heck of a dragon raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
