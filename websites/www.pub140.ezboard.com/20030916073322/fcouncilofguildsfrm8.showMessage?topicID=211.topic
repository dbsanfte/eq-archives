Those who thought they knew better.<br>
Those who felt cheated out of raid fees.<br>
Whiners.<br>
Complainers.<br>
Those who took advantage.<br>
Those who only think about themselves.<br>
<br>
I also had...<br>
<br>
Those &quot;die hard&quot; KCoGer's who are patient.<br>
Who give up of themselves for others.<br>
Who know when to lead and when to follow.<br>
Those who can forgive others for being human and making mistakes.<br>
Two wonderful support groups who got nothing but &quot;thanks&quot; for thier time and a chance at a reward.<br>
Those who I trust and respect.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not going to post loot. There was ALOT of greed there tonight and I'm not going to encourage it. These raids are not about loot. If you don't like that fact then don't come.<br>
<br>
Grats goes to Destructress who go the killing blow and G7 of Sumlain, Dawolf, Jarrad, Slypit, Seisekerr, and Kernal for the xp.<br>

Thanks to all those who came in the &quot;true&quot; spirit of what the KCoG is all about. <br>

I believe that makes 4 in a row, or is it 5, without a failure. That is an excellent track record by any means. For those who have never been to a Dragon raid before they take planning, patient and organization. They also take a long time to run. If you can only be there for an hour or 2, don’t come. Dragon raids can take upwards of 6 hours depending on how well people listen. As azure pointed out, the listening and following instructions was not the best on this raid and as such it took longer than it should have. That is not Azure's fault nor does it mean it was poorly run or organized. This is directly attributable to people's un willingness to follow orders. When on a raid there is one raid leader. If you think you can do better I suggest you organize your guild or alliance and do your own dragon raids and then you will see how much fun they can be. I have walked away from several raids that I have been running in the past when people don’t listen and start doing stupid things to get folks killed. I wont put up with that and I know Azure wont either.<br>
<br>
  The above having been said 3 things occurred that disturbed me personally and also a number of people that participated in the raid. I will try to state clearly and calmly what he issues were and want to make it clear this is not intended to be a whine session but rather a carefully thought out discussion of issues and hopefully some answers. I would also like to say that, even though there was loot involved in 2 of these issues the loot itself is not the issue at hand. I know azure has stated and I totally agree, Dragon raids are not about the loot. I personally go on dragon raids to have fun and to take down a big monster that is beyond the capability of doing so by myself or by my guild alone. I find it to be good raiding experience and practice for even bigger and better targets. This is not to say that the loot isn’t important or even desirable but so few items drop that to go on a dragon raid and to expect to get loot is just foolish IMHO. If I am lucky enough to win something or to get xp on a dragon raid, that is just icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
Here then are the issues that were witnessed by me or brought to my attention, some of it after the conclusion of the raid.<br>
<br>
#1<br>
During the lotto of items there was, on one of the items, an early roll. Not only that but the person rerolled at the correct time. KCoG lotto rules clearly state that if people roll early for an item then they are out on the lotto. This was repeated many times before and during the raid as well as being posted to this forum. This rule was not enforced. If there are rules and they are not enforced then they are not rules at all and will lead in the future others to expect the same bending of the rules to be applied to them. I would like to hear why this rule was not enforced and I would hope to also get an assurance that in the future, raid rules will be enforced. If the rules are not enforced it will just lead to chaos.<br>
<br>
#2<br>
<br>
The second issue involves the character Break. This person was not involved in the raid at any point until we were forming the buff line. They were not at the druid ring, they were not in the initial groups, and they were not part of the breaking process. Yet this person was allowed to roll on items. Again the rules clearly state if you do not show up on time then you will not be allowed to participate. Perhaps there is something I am not aware. Maybe this person had an alt at the raid from the beginning and then switched to the Break toon for the final assault on Naggy. Maybe they were personally invited, by Azure or another member of her raid leading team, to join the raid at that late time for some reason. In any case I would like to know, and if one of the above examples or some other good explanation is the reason that’s fine I just want to know, why this individual was allowed to join the raid so late and still roll on items. I have checked my logs so I know for a fact that Break was not present at the raid until just before we went through the buff line at least not as the toon Break.<br>
<br>
<br>
#3 <br>
<br>
During the raid while in the stone spider room (I think) an item dropped called a crystalline orb (? I think that’s what it is called). This is one of 2 items required for a high level SK pet spell. The other item needed is a prickly pear (? Again not certain on the name…. I’m no SK) and drops off the Icy terrors on the way to kill Vox. 2 vox raids ago one of these dropped and was lottoed off among all the present sks. This did not happen with the orb on the Naggy raid. The group that looted it kept it. It is my understanding, though I am not certain, that the group who looted this item and kept it didn’t even have an Sk in their group. So an item that is need only by an SK will end up in the hands of someone who didn’t even participate in the raid while those who did don’t even get a chance to roll on it. If I missed something please correct me but it seems to me that this of all the things that happened on the raid flies directly in the face of what KCoG is all about. KCoG was supposed to be a loose confederation of smaller guilds that, on their own, would not be able to go after big targets. This is something that comes from this type of raid and yet those KCoG members who were present were denied the opportunity to acquire something that they may only be able to obtain through an event like this. Of all the things that happened last night that appeared questionable, this is the worst one and I hope we can all get a clear explanation of why this occurred. If I had known this occurred at the time it would have been brought up before we left naggys lair but as it is I didn’t know at the time.<br>
<br>
#4<br>
<br>
Some of this next issue is second hand information so keep that in mind. After groups were formed we moved to the SS room. In the process, Gandorf, who was apparently trying to get there on their own instead of following directions, got lost and got themselves killed. The group leader was asked to go back to the zone entrance and help get gandorf back together. Somewhere along the line the group healer was there as well. It is my understanding (2nd hand remember) that Pslyth (group leader) and willowood (group healer) were told to wait at the zone line for instructions and they would be got back to the rest of the raid party. Gandorf, apparently, logged off shortly after dieing. These 2 members of the raid party were left sitting at the zone line. They were never brought up to the rest of the raid party. Did these people get forgotten? I find that hard to believe as one of them was supposed to be a group leader.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
Sorry this got so long winded but I wanted to be thorough. I’d like to say that although issues 1 to 3 deal with loot the issue isn’t the loot it self but rather why rules are not being adhered to and in the case of #3 real issues of fairness are raised. Again its not about the loot its about why people are allowed to go outside the rules and no one seems to notice or care.  #1 seems to be the smallest issue. It seemed to me that azure a tsaryn (loot master) were trying to be lenient and not trying to be mean. While I can appreciate that and the lotto rules may seem harsh still the rules are there for a reason of if they are not adhered to then there will be no rules and no order. #’S 2 &amp; 4 are related to me as in one case you had folks show up and time and then, due to the acts of someone else, get left behind while someone who appeared to show up at the last possible minute was allowed to roll on loot that, by and large, they did not help to get to. #3 again to me is the most serious issue. Perhaps, as raid leader and loot leader you were not made aware that the orb dropped in which case this is not really a raid issue at all but rather an issue of who looted and then made off with an item that should have been lottoed. The only 2 people I know of that knew the orb dropped were Kcarcreve and Maed. Kcarcreve knew the orb had dropped and asked Maed if that was so. The reply was yes it had dropped and that was all that was said about it. Beyond that I do not know who else knew the orb dropped or why it was not lottoed but I would like an explanation. I’d like to think that there is a good and viable explanation as to why these things occurred and to have better communication during the raid so issues like this to not crop up again. My purpose here isn’t to be critical of the raid leadership but rather to get an explanation as to why these, at least to me, disturbing events occurred and ho to prevent them in the future.<br>

<br>
If I'd had the same kind of completely un-ruly, obnoxious, un-disciplined pack of savages on the raids I was running... I don't think I would have done it as long as I did.  There's gonna be a lot of venom in the post, and I'm sad to say most of it is well deserved.<br>
<br>
First off, you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, back-talk to or question the raid leader on an open channel.  If you have a problem with something they are doing, or think they have said something incorrect, let your group leader know, and let them pass it along.  If it's particularly urgent, send a tell.  Making comments in /ooc is out of line, and does not do anything at all to help the raid succeed.  If you are not going to be helpful, don't say anything.  It's pretty simple.<br>
<br>
Secondly... if you are spouting crap on an open channel, at least have the decency to have your information be correct.  I've been on a hell of a lot of Vox and Naggy runs, and a lot of what people were saying in objection to commands from Azure was just plain incorrect.  The amount of flak that came back from the order to camp out after pulling the lair spawns was appalling, and, as it happens, completely WRONG.  I've seen support people get kicked out of the zone by the dragon because they cast a buff on someone who still retained agro... someone who wasn't involved in the pull, only the fight in the room outside the lair.  Agro can transfer in really odd and un-predictable ways.  Camping is a safety measure, and a simple one at that.<br>
<br>
I mean come on...  camping and coming back... is that so hard?!  Good grief, on early KCoG raids, we'd camp out 5 or 6 times, and I rarely, if ever, heard anyone complain about it.  But some of you can't do it once without whining up a storm?<br>
<br>
And please, if you are a newbie on the raid, for your own good, shut the hell up.  The leaders and admin staff have been there, done that, and we know what we're doing.  If you think you know so much more, form your own damn alliance and try for yourself... don't come to a KCoG raid and make an ass out of yourself by giving someone as well traveled as Azure a hard time.<br>
<br>
And after all the crap that Azure and the admin had to put up with on that raid, I'm amazed things got handled as well as they did at the end.  You try sitting in a room full of screaming monkeys for 5 hours and see if your nerves aren't a little rattled afterwards.<br>
<br>
Yeah, maybe things could have been handled a little better in some cases, but frankly, I'm amazed Azure and Tsaryn handled them at all.  After a raid like that, I'd have just told everyone to come to West Commons the next day and we'd lotto off the drops then, because I'd have been too tired and pissed off to think clearly.<br>
<br>
All I can say is that if the kind of behavior, lack of discipline, and complete in-ability to listen to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>OR</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> follow directions is going to be common in the future of KCOG, I may just go and join an uber-guild, because there's no way I'd be able to put up with the kind of crap I saw tonight on a regular basis. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

This is what makes these things that occured that much more disturbing to me and would like to hear why they happened. My guess, and its only a guess, is that azure was misinformed about some of these things that went on and as far as I am concerned the issues I raised need to be addressed. I know at CoD tonight we discussed these matters at length since our Guild is leading the KCoG planes raids and are very sensitive to the difficulties of leading such raids as well as the need for fairness. As far as people being Whiney and arguing with the raid leader I agree it shouldn't happen and at the same time I have seen it occur to some degree on every large raid i have been on. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

Let me just say - sorry.  Was my first time calling the loot - and I'm sure I could have done better.  With that said let me clear up 3 items.<br>
<br>
1) Raid loot was declared to start at the FIRE GIANTS.  Any loot dropped prior to King Tranix was not part of the raid.   Please refer to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=139.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...=139.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for any questions on this.  So while the Stone Spider was killed multiple times (I saw 2 at least and pretty sure there were 3 - it didn't count - and I wasn't tracking it nor responsible for it)<br>
<br>
2) About the re-roll.  SORRY.  I felt that my /shouts weren't clear enough about the steps and I felt that it was confusion and NOT someone just rolling early for the hell of it.  Besides both of her rolls where higher then anyone elses.<br>
<br>
3) About the 'Break' incident.  Its VERY hard with 60 or so random people on a raid to be possitive who's there and who's not, who participated, and who didn't.  Add to the fact all the chaos and massive amounts of people just not following directions and well these things happen.<br>
<br>
If you felt cheated by anything on my part - sorry.  But I wasn't in a roll to be liked last night - I was handing out loot.  I had 7 people love me and 60 or more think I was an arse.  Hey, just look at the bright side - one less dragon in the world <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6149">Tsaryn

This has been my 3rd raid with KCoG and after the first 2 this raid was quite a surprise to me the way people acted. I am in a VERY small guild and would not have the chance to fight mobs like this if KCoG did not exist. I really didn't pay much attention to the BS that was going back and forth in /say and /ooc but I saw enough to know that a lot of it was uncalled for.  I come to these and do what I'm told and hope everything turns out all right and to learn from people that have done this before so one day I may be able to conduct raids myself. On the issue of loot I look at it like taking a vacation to Vegas. I go there because of the excitement of gambling. I know I will probably lose but there is a small chance that I may walk away with a few extra bucks in my pocket and if I do thats great but if I don't Oh Well. What I tell people about gambling is that if your not ready to lose money DON'T GAMBLE and if your not ready to walk away from a raid with no loot DON'T COME. I would also like to defend the person that was said to roll early. Mistakes are made! I know this person pretty good and know for a fact that they are not out there to rip anyone off and that they will probably never make that mistake again but to see how they were FLAMED made me sick. Tsaryn was doing the loot and made a command decision to accept the roll (they were chosen to this position for a reason) I do not feel that the alliance was damaged by the decision that was made. I look forward to being part of more KCoG events if they will have me and I hope Azure and Destructress keep up the good work on planning and leading these events. If this made no sense at all give me a break I was up till 2am LOL. <p>Cheynar<BR>

I would raid with you guys anywhere any time. That being said there were a few incidents that occurred which my self and many others felt were out of line and needed to be addressed. That was the point of my post, to raise concerns over a few, a very few, incidents it what was otherwise a great raid. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your clear and concise response Tsaryn. As to your point #2, I consider this answered for and a dead issue. You really did do a great job as loot master and your explanation Hoe the roll in question was handled is pretty much as I thought it would be but enough people said something to me that I felt the issue should be raised.<br>
<br>
As to your point #1 (and my point #3), I have reread the loot rules and understand where the Idea that only loot from Naggy and the fire giants would be considered raid loot and rolled on came from. That having been said I think the problem arose because on the last vox raid I was on with KCoG (raid before last) the prickly pear dropped and was looted among the SKs that were there. In order to be consistent I think in the future either the same should be done with the orb or neither Item should be rolled on. I consider this a dead issue in terms of what happened at the raid. As you state it was not part of the raid loot according to the rules and therefore was not rolled on. Case closed. I do think we should discuss whether or not in the future this or similar types of items should be included and would like to see others constructive thoughts on this. Here is what I have to say. Let me say that I honestly couldn't tell you 10% of what drops of Naggy and vox and the various mobs on the way to their respective lairs. I don’t go on Dragon raids for the loot and if something drops that I can use then I will find out then and there what it is. I’m not going to bother looking for items specifically for me for these types of raids, as I know my chances of winning something are very small. That having been said, in this case it seems to me that this item is the type of thing that should be rolled on. It is for a single class and it is an item needed to complete a quest to get an awesome (I am told) spell that every member of the class in question would want. KCoG was formed to, among other things, give people who belonged to smaller guilds a chance to experience things and complete quests that they would not otherwise be able to do without joining am Uber guild. It seems to me then that this is the type of thing that should be rolled on, current rules not with standing. This is something that should be discussed not just for this item but any other items of a similar nature; quest items for a specific class or class that drop off mobs other than fire giants or the dragons themselves. I’m not the best person to lead this discussion because, as I said, I have no clue as to what other items might be of a similar nature on these raids.<br>
<br>
As to your point #3. I know all to well how difficult it can be to keep track of people on a raid.  I do know that one of the groups were told to invite Break by Azure as we were getting ready to go thru the buff line. Again, I know how easy it is to lose track or not realize whether or not someone had been there the whole time. The perception of many at the raid, not just myself or guild mates, was that Break had shown up literally at the last minute of a 6 hour raid and was allowed to participate and roll on items while others who I know shoed up at the druid ring some 30 to 45 minutes late, maybe a little later, but before we had moved off to the SolB, were turned away. I think Azure is the only one who can answer this question. Did you realize that Break had not been there the whole time? If you had not then that is answer enough for me. If you did know that he had shown up at the last minute, why was he allowed to participate? I believe this needs yet to be answered and I think Azure is the only one who can do it.<br>
<br>
You did not address my point #4 but as loot master not raid leader you weren’t involved and I would not expect an answer from you on this point.<br>
<br>
Again Tsaryn, thanks again for your thoughtful response to these issues being raised. My post was not meant to be an attack on you or Azure but rather was meant to raise some issues with a few isolated incidents in what was otherwise a great raid. Thank you for taking it in the spirit it was meant. I in no way felt cheated by these incidents but they did raise eyebrows among a large number of the raid members present and I felt they should be addressed thank you for taking the time to do so and I look forward to many more raids with Azure leading us and yourself or whomever else she designates as loot master calling the rolls.<br>
<br>
Lastly. I’d like to congratulate Sevlor for being the first one to bring a flame to this thread. I brought up legitimate issues in (hopefully) a non-inflammatory manner so it could be discussed like adults. If you wish to rant and call people names, take it elsewhere please as it has no place on this board. I will address your post more completely in a separate post, as I would not care to further tarnish this post and Tsaryn’s well worded post to which it replies.<br>

<br>
Your concerns:<br>
<br>
#1-I believed Tsaryn answered this for you.<br>
<br>
#2- If our groups are full, I will turn people away. I have had many times in the past had people join the raid late. If there is space and they bring no harm to the raid, I feel that every person is an asset.<br>
<br>
I am a trusting person. I dont judge people. I try to be fair. A monk asks if we have room, says he's lvl 52 (I later found out he was 53). I found him a group. NO ONE said...&quot;hey do you know about this guy...?&quot; I dont hang out in EC's. I dont have a rap sheet of all the dishonorable people on our server. I dont read all the flames on the EQ forums. It wasnt till after he rolled and won loot (which btw I never saw his roll) did all this come out in the open. Once something has been won and awarded, I will NOT take the item back.<br>
<br>
Was this a bad judgement call on my part? Yes, this time it was. I'm human.<br>
<br>
#3-As Tsaryn said loot begins with the FG's and is posted on this forum (not that everyone reads them). I would like to add that we generally respect other people's camps and loot. The Stone Spiders is a recognized camp in SolB. Although it wasnt camped last night, in the past it has been. That is why those drops are not accounted for.<br>
<br>
EDIT- seems I was still writing while Falcone was posting. I will review the loot policy on the prickly pear and the orb. Thanks for your imput. /END EDIT<br>
<br>
#4-Willowood went LD a few times at the druid ring. We waited but I made the call to go ahead and go in. I never recieved another tell about if she had come back online or not.<br>
<br>
I knew we had a GL and a corpse at the entrance. It is not the GL repsonsibilty to go back for a person or corpse. Especially not a healer. Why we have a Support team. Why we have a rogue who can pull corpses safely. I did try on a few occasions to send someone back to get them. When I finally realized they had not been brought back.. it was too late to do it safely. I was also made aware of some &quot;personal&quot; problems in that particular group, after it was too late to re arrange groups.<br>
<br>
Basically it comes down to lack of communication and misinformation. Which there was ALOT of last night.<br>
<br>
I had way more tells than I usually have, too much /ooc complaining, tells from my support team that people are wandering or trying to jump my authority, and plain not listening.<br>
<br>
Last night was not a typical KCoG raid. And I felt bad for those who were first time raiders with us. Not a very good example of what this organization is all about.<br>

I asked for meaningful discussion of issues that were brought to my attention by a large number of the raiding party not just myself and guild mates and you bring flames, insults and swearing.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Is it that hard to feel happy for someone else winning an item? Are you so quick to declare a mis-trial that you don't even realize that we are all on the same side? &gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
It is not hard at all. I congratulated each and every winner. No one, least of all me declared a mistrial. Questions were raised as to how things were handled and a large number of people felt those issues should be addressed. Yes I do realize we are all on the same side. My GL Destructress is now leading planes raids for KCoG and as a member of that guild all of our guild members present felt these were legitimate issues that should be raised so as to avoid similar problems on future KCoG raids. We are trying to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. <br>
<br>
&lt;Someone misrolled, and you bastards took to her like a pack of bloodthirsty wolves. &gt;<br>
<br>
Yes someone did miss roll. As I have rechecked my logs it seems that many people were questioning the loot master as to why this person was not disqualified. This is not how it should have been handled (the questioning as well as the roll) IMHO but if you go back and check your logs you will see that I said nothing at the time. That was not the appropriate place to raise the issue. This message board is. Is it really necessary to call people bastards and bloodthirsty wolves to try and get your point across? <br>
<br>
&lt;And you, as the ultimate authority of what is &quot;bleeding&quot; and what is not, decide to tell someone who bled and died at this raid that they didn't deserve an item that they fairly won? &gt;<br>
<br>
Edit<br>
much of what occurred with the whole pslyth and Willowood situation was presented to me second hand and after the raid had ended. If I have stated something incorrectly, and it appears from Azures post that I have as she has stated she didnt know that Pslyth had benn left behind until it was too late, then I apologize for any misinformation on my part.<br>
/end edit<br>
Break was allowed to join the raid at the last possible minute while 2 other members of the raiding party were left sitting at the zone line as they were instructed to wait there by the raid leader. These 2 people were on time and one was a designated group leader. It has nothing to do with bleeding it has to do with showing up on time and participating in the whole raid. It is generally the rule that people who show up late don’t participate. This rule seems to have been overlooked in this case and many people want to know why. As Azure has not had a chance to respond I reserve judgment. I suggest you do the same.<br>
<br>
&lt;Pathetic, that's what you are. Every one of you that because you felt insecure about you tiny little rolls, had to attack your FELLOW raiders. Every one of you don't deserve the effort that Azure made to make this raid work. You don't fricking deserve it. You don't deserve to have seen a level 55 dragon fall to your feet. I mean why don't you just ninja loot it next time, if that's all you are there for. <br>
<br>
Really Really pathetic. Next time, look at yourselves before you make asses.&gt;<br>
<br>
I don’t feel that raising legitimate issues in a thoughtful (hopefully) non-inflammatory manner to be pathetic. As I stated in my first post this is not about loot it is about rules and consistency of their enforcement. Meaningful discussion has always been a part of KCoG and it is in that spirit that I raised these issues. As a member of the guild that is now leading the KCoG planes raids, we understand all too well the massive amount of effort that goes into the planning and conducting of these raids. We have taken a long look at ourselves and a large portion of why these issues were brought up was so as to avoid these problems in the future as much as is humanly possible.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned this type of flame is not needed here. If you can’t express yourself without resorting to flames, name-calling, and swearing, please don’t do so at all.<br>
<br>
From Cheynar's post<br>
&lt;I would also like to defend the person that was said to roll early. Mistakes are made! I know this person pretty good and know for a fact that they are not out there to rip anyone off and that they will probably never make that mistake again but to see how they were FLAMED made me sick.

<br>
This person needs no defending. Mistakes do get made. Any gripe others or I had was with how it was handled not with the person in question. Maybe others did flame the roller. If they did it was out of line. As I said above, I said nothing at the time. Tsaryn made a command decision and I accepted it. The decision did, in my mind and others, raise issues. That’s why I brought them here where they belong. I agree the alliance was not damaged but at the same time these are real issues that many felt needed to be addressed. As a long time member of the community and as an officer of the guild now leading planes raids, I felt these issues needed to be raised and discussed.

I do my best to follow every instruction of the raid leader so to say your flame was directed at those who cant follow orders misses the mark. There is no need to sweeten up a post. Likewise there is no need for flaming. Your post wasn't agressive, it was rude and full of name calling and swearing. Such is not the stuff of meaningful debate. If you cant make a point without it then please do not post here. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

I clearly stated that raising such issues should not take place in an open channel during the raid, they should, as Kommisar said, be channeled thru the group leaders and then to the raid leader in private. I did not and would not do so. That is why I brought the issues here. I know some people did. Kcarcreve for one did question in ooc how the roll was handled. If you read his post (oneye above) he apologized for doing so as he too realizes that that is not where the issue should be handled and therefore apologized for his actions. And thank you for not flaming. at least now we are having meaningful discussion, which is why I posted here in the first place. The raid leadership should always be respected. If you feel they are handling things wrong then one should give them a tell or bring it to this forum. I know if I feel that a raid is being handled poorly then I will just remove myself from the situation. Arguing or backtalking to the leader ship in public channels is not the way to handle the situation. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

I know that I didn't know it was an SK quest item (whereas I did know the prickly pear was), when I was running dragon raids. It's actually the first time I've heard of this item. It could very well be that most including the loot master just didn't know the item was a quest item. That's happened with other items on raids I've run (amygdylan whips being part of the Bard Epic quest in Plane of Fear is one example). <br>
<br>
Azure, I appreciate the pain and effort it takes to run these, especially when you have a bunch of monkeyspanks disrupting the whole thing.

I would like to thank all the Raiders that didn?t say anything, that didn?t spam OOC or Shouts, I would like to thank the people that didn?t send tons of Tells to the people running this event, I would like to thank the people that following the instructions and that did what they where told with out question for the good of the raid. To the rest of you 50 people &lt;Rude&gt;<br>
<br>
Imagine if you will you are a teacher in a kindergarten with 50 little kids running around, pulling at your pants, shouts, trying to talk to you. 60% is crap but little Timmy needs to go to the wash room. He is being a good little boy and is asking the Teacher but the poor teacher is flooded with problems, Jill and Sam are trying to Eat the gold fish, Chuck is screaming into Anna?s ear, Anna is of course crying like a baby, Jake is pulling at the Teachers pants trying to get you to make Billy give him his fire truck back. Yohos The none English speaking Student just let mister Bun Bun out of his Cage and he is running over the paint that Stu dropped only seconds ago because he wanted to paint when Painting time is not until after nap time. Tom is napping? On Allen?s head, with makes you wonder if he can even breath. <br>
<br>
Now the question is? what does Timmy want?<br>
<br>
The point is. The more Crap fills the lines of communication the more is lost. Having to shout to get people to move their asses and stand in the right place or do the right thing, to tell people not to do something. To get tells with Suggestions and problems, Whining, complaining and so on. Fill the lines of Communication up with non-important stuff and the important stuff is lost. In the case of the people at the zone, Break and so on. <br>
<br>
You think you can do better? Then do it. You run a Raid. People like you are the reason I stopped helping run CoG raids so many moons ago. <br>
<br>
Everyone thinks they know everything so much better, and can do it the ?right? way. But none of you every put your money where your mouth is. It?s always good and honest people that step up and give you all the chance to do something great and everytime you drain the life from them, With your whining and complaining. But then you don?t care as long as someone does it for you and you can get the loot. &lt;Shake head&gt;<br>
