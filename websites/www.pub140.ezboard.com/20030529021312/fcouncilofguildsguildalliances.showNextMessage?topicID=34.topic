<br>
First of all let me introduce myself and my new guild/ Karana Community organization. Myself, and friends of mine have decided to create an institution of Karana in order to preserve the legendary economy which resides on our wonderful server, and fullfill many goals which are dynamic and never before concieved by any guild in the past. <br>
<br>
I would like to announce the creation of the Norrathian Trade Federation. If you would like more information on this organization/ guild you can reference the bottom of this post, where I have added the announcement post that I have spread across other forums on this site. You can also visit the beta site at <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://go.to/tradekarana">go.to/tradekarana</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I would like to call all guilds across Karana to join in a new council, not overbearing or predominant over the wonderous and excellent Karana Council of Guilds, but in a seperate category all toghether. I would like to initiate a council specifically designed to regulate and promote the free trade of the Karana server, in a new council called the &quot;Karana Trade Consortium&quot;. I would ask for the guilds of Karana to begin posting their support underneath this request, and give any suggestions or comments you may have. This is simply an idea, and hopefully it will grow and become popular among the players of Karana. I have already created an online Trading Forum in which I hope all guilds will promote, and players as well. I would like to give reform to this trading medium, and offer for each guild of Karana to have their own section within the forum, in which they can sell items, quest opportunities and or serivces to the Karana Community, or other guilds easily, without having to worry about waiting to contact a leader or officer of another guild in game. Many ideas are brewing in my mind, and the minds of my constituents, and we hope to better the economy of Karana permanently. If you would like to post your support or comments on the actual trading forum, you can do so in the 'Show your Support&quot; section under &quot;General Discussion&quot;. Thank you for your time, and may the gods bestow peace and harmony across all of Karana. <br>

<br>
Greetings Tradesmen of Karana! <br>
<br>
As many of you know, the Karana server is one of the few original servers to open in 1999, and since then the Karana economy has developed and blossomed to the bustling and busy state it is in today. <br>
<br>
My name is Tithonus Arcanus and I am pleased to announce the creation of a new Guild/Community Organization for the Karana server called the Norrathian Trade Federation. Our goal is to preserve and enforce the legendary Karana economy, and in doing so help those new players who cannot afford what they desire to create savings accounts with us that will accumulate interest. We will operate and function like a normal guild, but we will also host a Karana Community trading forum online, similar to the one hosted by KCoG, but more specific to the needs and wants of the tradesmen of Norrath. <br>
<br>
Anybody who plays on Karana can become a local member of the forum simply by posting, no applications are needed for use of the trading categories. On the site the Karana community can trade or sell items, quests or services to each other, or browse items quest opportunities and services that the Trade Federation will be offering players of Karana.<br>
<br>
If you would like to begin posting on the Forum, or just browse! (The more participants the better!) You can check us out at:<br>

<br>
I have seen trade forums come and go, there is only a small number of people that trade all the time (Offline and online). The bulk of the people only trade when they need something at that moment (and they see someone auctioning it) or need to make room, in most cases people just give things away. With that said, I think you have to much work put into your site, more detail isn't going to make it better. Take <br>

It's simple and to the point and it doesn't get used all that much. (And no don't post there)<br>
<br>
Spamming boards isn't going to change how people Trade. Post ones, hope people coming and if they don't, oh well you tried. Spamming is just going to make you look like a Troll (the bad kind) and you loss any Respect you may have had. Unless you are going for that lack of Respect look then by all means spam to your little hearts content. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8779"><IMG SRC="http://www.coastnet.com/~drake/EQ/Sigs/steelsig3.jpg"><br></a>

This is an initial notification of my idea, and I probably will not post it on this site again. You dont have to like it, my cohorts and I are not trying to force this upon anybody, in fact we are searching for help. I do not appreciate being harassed when this is the first time the topic has come up. Frankly, the other trading boards are of no consequence to our cause, and they are not going to offer the kind of programs we are conjuring for the Karana community. <br>
<br>
Please consider more than your own interests when attempting to set someone straight, we do not intend to profit from this act but make a new and interesting medium for exchange for the players of Karana. If you do not want to use it or take part, by all means do what you please, but do not try to squander efforts of those pioneers who wish to create something different and interesting just because you do not think it will work. <br>
<br>
Just a thought. <br>
