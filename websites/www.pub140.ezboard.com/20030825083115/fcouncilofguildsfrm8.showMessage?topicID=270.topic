Most of you that have been on a Vox raid will know all of this, but for those of you just getting in range to come with us this will give you an idea of what is going on.  I am also going to do one for Naggy and one for buffline procedures as I have time and get around to doing it.<br>
<br>
At the start of the raid we meet at the secret entrance to Permafrost.  We do this because there is much distraction at the main entrance (and I don't particularly want to have to dodge kited IG's while making groups).  That is where we assemble, and make groups.<br>
<br>
What I am looking for when assembling the raid force, is to have around 30 people.  We NEED to have at least 4 clerics at a minimum.  We need 2 Enchanters, but at least 3 is considered safe.  One druid 51+ is essential for their circle protection spells.  2 Bards are hard to get by without, and the more bards you have, the merrier it is.  The rest don't matter as far as format, as long as we have a good amount of melee.  Mages and Wizards help a lot for massive damage near the end.  30 People would be the minimum, 40 people is safe zone, 50+ is more than enough.<br>
<br>
At this point I usually send in the support group to start their bloodletting as I am making groups.  When making groups I try to make them as balanced as possible.  The first group is my group.  I usually assign someone I know and trust as the group leader.  Have a healer (druid/shaman is fine for this group), a monk/sk puller, any other enchanters, and fill out the rest of the group with caster types.  G2 will be the MA/MT's group.  He rates the highest bard on the raid and the highest cleric.  Fill out the rest of G2 with melee types.  G3 I usually do as a Paladin group, as their stuns help a lot with eleminating CH's from Vox.  Again, a bard to protect them that far into the fight, and a cleric.  The rest of the Groups I fill as needed.  I try to make melee groups (as many as I can) have a cleric and a bard (as long as I have bards), and then seperate caster groups.  Caster groups can have druid/shaman healers.  This is the personal way that I flesh out groups, and everyone does it a bit differently.<br>
<br>
Once I have groups fleshed out I announce them and have GL's invite their groups.  We form out, stick any extra people that showed up late in other groups and make sure everything is running ok.  By this time the support group will have done everything except for the lair usually.  I have the support group send a few people back to guide people that don't know the way, and we move all groups to the flag/king room.  In the alcove of this room there is a rock, and this rock is where all casters that can should bind first.  At this point support group will be making the last of the pulls including lair.<br>
<br>
*Note about Giants*  Ice giants are heavily magic resistant, and they are completely immune to spells if the caster is not in melee range with giants at the time that the spell goes off.  This makes casters not very effective against the giants.<br>
<br>
Once the last of the pulls have been made we move into the next room, which is the one that has the nifty gate and closet located in it.  At this point I tell people to sit along the sides of the walls.  I also tell people not to wander, or open/close gates/doors, which is usually ignored so we have to end up doing a rezz on the person ignoring me.  There are several giants that pop relatively quick (15/30 minutes).  If you are opening doors and being obnoxious then the giant will usually see you first, ala dead obnoxious person.  The support team during this time will be constantly patrolling to clear the IG pops as they happen.  We leave the center of the room open in case they need to pull several to the room.<br>
<br>
At this point I will be setting up the line, or if I have one helping the buff coordinator do so.  Unfortunately this does take time, as most of these people have not done a buffline before, and so we have to explain exactly what is going on.  Just because there is not a lot going on in channels, does not mean there is not a lot going on.  People that are not involved in the buffline usually don't realize this, and are constantly spamming by this point the equivelent of &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;, despite the fact that the people that know what is going on are repeatedly telling everyone exactly what is going on.  This is the point on the raid when I am most tempted to moderate all chat channels, and filter out shout/ooc/auction.  People also have a tendency to start sending tells to the Raid Leader, which further slows down the raid as he/she has to read these, and sometimes answer in the midst of doing everything else.  I will explain the processes for the buffline in another post.<br>
<br>
Once everyone has been buffed and the buffline has been collapsed, everyone should be in the chatroom.  I either do the general raid briefing and closing notes here, or before the buffline depending on disipline, and how busy I am.  Once that has been done we log back in, and form original groups.  The important thing to remember on the way to the engagement point is to only take the center ramp of the three.  It has a blue tint to it, while the other two ramps have a red tint.  If you go up the wrong ramp, you will fall down a pit and die painfully, and everyone will laugh at you, we will also generally not get corpses from the pits until AFTER Vox is dead.<br>
<br>
The raid is launched in 4 waves:<br>
<br>
Wave 1 Consists of Warriors, Paladins, and Bards.  Bards use their resistance songs to keep the melee's alive, and those two classes can take the first couple of aoe's well, which will bring people back to the triage line scattered, instead of one wave.<br>
<br>
Wave 2 is called about 10-20 seconds later.  It consists of all other melee.  Druids/Shamans will also go into the room for spot heals on melee's as they see them, but will stay back as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Wave 3 is called when Vox is at around 70% health.  These are the Enchanters, and their job is to sieve away Vox's mana so she can't CH herself.  This is the single most important job on the raid, as you cannot succeed in killing her if she is CH'ing herself.<br>
<br>
Wave 4 consists of all nukers.  These are called in sometime between 50-70% health, depending on how well it is going.  Remember that you MUST be in melee range to hit Vox with anything besides unresistable spells (such as Tash and Sieve) or it will resist.  Even in melee range expect heavy resist rates (I usually at 52 hit 1/3rd of the time, though Enchanter nukes are natural resisted heavily).<br>
<br>
The clerics (and if we are short on clerics the Shamans/Druids as well) will stay back at the entrance of the lair.  As melee'ers need heals they will come back and spam that they need a heal.  Healers should /say who they are healing so that there are not overlapping heals.  If you currently have Vox aggro please do not drag her back to the triage line, as that would end up killing us all.<br>
<br>
If you run out of mana (int and wisdom casters both apply), run to Vox and Sit Down, so that you will get aggro and die.  You will repop at the end of the buffline (You did bind yourself right?), mem the appropriate spell and run back up to start working again.  If things go well, it usually isn't necessary for anyone to die, but it has happened.<br>
<br>
The dragon should go down quickly.  Generally if she is not dead within 2 minutes of engagement, then we have lost.  At this point we will try to get everyone rezzed, and corpses pulled from the pit if necessary.  Please be careful where you step because there are traps here.  Once everyone is there and ready we will random away the items.  Note that Paladins will lotto for the book BEFORE we engage, and the Paladin that won should be given priorities in rezzes.  All loot rules will be followed as in the thread <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=262.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...=262.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .<br>

When nukers are called for wave 4, is it assumed at this point that she will be low enough on health to simply blast away as fast as possible, or is it still very possible that after two or three in a row she'll be on top of you? As in is there enough aggro held by frontline at this point so that it doesn't matter if wave 4 just nukes away and doesn't stop till she's dead? Sry if this sounds a bit retarted lol, if anyone could see past my inexperience, especially a fellow wizzy, to shed some light here that'd be awesome. thanks in advance<br>

To be truthful, if you have a chance to throw 4 nukes out, then things are looking ugly.  But yes, when wave 4 (nukers) are called in, you need to get within melee distance and chain nuke.  If you do get aggro don't panic and just eat the death, there is no way for you to get away (she does summon) and if you try you could pull her out of melee distance from other casters thereby rendering their nukes ineffective.  But to answer your question, it generally isn't a problem.  After a few casts she should be dead anyway. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
........ well, then dont allow them to swap out resist gear for wisdom gear. the likelyhood is they will have about half the mana, but you'll have a better chance of them not repeatedly dying on AE's. Of course dont forget to add in that they might get feared every now and then (aka less healers) and because they are so close to the door, they might go in the pits while running... but as long as you dont mind healers that can't sit to med cause of AE's, are close enough to the mob she will turn agro on them and will die repeatedly.... go fer it I guess. Ever seen Vox in the hallway? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It is a very mortifying sight to anyone bound down there. I'll see if I can find someone with a pic of the corpse piles.<br>
<br>
But I'll tell you now, every time someone tried to change the tried and true method of killing her, they failed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  not that it wasn't a good strat, it's just cause of the lvl restrictions and what that physically allows. If your entire raid was lvl 52, it would be worth a good shot, but you know they wont be. below 50 the resistances are all different, the DPS is lower, and the lower you get the less gear usually that people have to be able to handle those AE's and Fears. And we both know thats not how ya win. Easy to tell who doesn't have proper resists or who is lowest. They are useless in the fight, always feared, and always run the furthest (longest to wear off) and they usually die in the pits.. training the raid with bears spiders and tentacle thingys.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to me, that is a recipie to die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  All healers were places outside for a number of reasons, more so then I listed so far. I wish you alot of luck but it'll be in tells from outside the raid. I just couldn't come in, too painful to watch.<br>
<br>
Now of course if you will I'll be damn happy, but I dont see it as likely at all. I know I know, pescimistic, but the reasons for my feelings are valid ones, and it is honest concern. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/Vreesig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sotvfarrnusno>SOTVFarrnusno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Dragon Raid Liason</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#8E9173>(11/28/02 6:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Strategy</span><hr size=1> They will not be in the lair itself, we usually have them at the top of the good ramp, or in the hall at the rock entrance to Vox's lair.

Perhaps that spot may not be the best triage. <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>
