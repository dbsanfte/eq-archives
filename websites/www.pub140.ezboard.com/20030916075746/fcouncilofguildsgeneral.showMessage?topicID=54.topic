We fielded six teams in total for the start of the raid.  Two of these teams were partials (one higher level and one lower level).  While staging started at 1PM, we didn't actually start forming up groups until 2PM.  This was due to people showing up at the last minute to get in a group.  We still had stragglers after this and I tried to accommodate them as I could.  As a result, we did not enter Kedge until 3PM.<br>
<br>
I do not know all the participants of the raid (it's in my logs, but I didn't go out and get all the names).  We had people in the level range of 51 (Warrior) to 33 (Ranger).  Overall, I feel we had a good mix of people, but we were clearly deficient in Clerics (one late comer), Enchanters (one), Mages (one), a Monks (none).  We did have enough healing power for the event (in a general sense) with several Druids and Shamans.<br>
<br>
I formed up two advance teams for the event.  I put myself in the second team.  I went in at the time called for and began to help clear the entrance.  I coordinated with a member of the lowest team to get the remaining teams in.  In my opinion, I should not have assigned myself to a team or engaged in combat.  As a tank, I feel it is my job to jump in there and beat on the mob.  What happens, though, is I lose a perspective of the overall event.  I'm not saying I shouldn't be down there with the rest of the groups, but I definitely felt like I wasn't running the event after a time (more like it was running itself).<br>
<br>
Our first death occurred at the entrance in the lowest level team.  After the four main teams settled into the second level, the entrance started repopping.  The two teams up top were not able to handle all the spawns.  The person who died lost track of where she was and swam in the opposite direction of the entrance.  There may have also been some confusion on the part of some members about how to act in a large raid.  This is understandable and the responsibility of this info not getting out falls on my shoulders.<br>
<br>
She received a res and was ready for some revenge.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     While getting the arrangements done for the res, we had a few members who needed to leave.  One was the primary puller (the 51 War).  It was during this time I realize I should be more focused on the event and not the fighting.  I began to swim back down to the main groups to check on their progress.  Before I could even get back down to the second level, the new puller brought up more than the groups down there could handle and many began the swim back up to the top.  One team was completely wiped out.  Another was nearly wiped out (one made it out).  My team took two casualties.  I made it out with a cauldrenbubble shark eating on my backside.<br>
<br>
So we began the process of corpse recovery and res.  As we only had one Cleric, this took a long time.  At one point, even the Cleric died due to drowning.  I checked back over the logs and did not see a message from him that EB was blinking.  If anyone should have had a FBE, it was the Cleric.  As people were ressed, they began going out and clearing the areas we had previously taken.  We did this until all the resses were done and the raid pretty much broke up after that.  In all, we spent about two and a half to three hours in Kedge.  A bit shorter than I would have liked, but not bad either considering the environment.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Lessons learned:<br>
<br>
As I mentioned previously, I should not have been fighting.  I lost some perspective on the event.  Many people told me I handled the event well, but I know I could have done a lot better.<br>
<br>
Zone wide communication was much better at getting info across than tells.  OOC was best with occasional use of shout to get a message across.<br>
<br>
The raid leader should learn to deal with tell hell.  I'm actually used to this situation (it happens all too often nowadays), but I tried to encourage the open channels for all communication.<br>
<br>
If a team stays to man a particular area (the entrance in this case), they should be appropriately staffed for the task.  They weren't and the blame for it is mine.<br>
<br>
Staging should mean setting up teams, not show up for the raid.  1PM should have been the deadline for people to be there.  Certainly stragglers are to be expected, but groups can be set to accommodate them rather easily.<br>
<br>
There is such a thing as too many people for a raid.  I think 24 would be ideal, but we had at least 30 (I think 32 at one point).  Too many people and it becomes crowded and much harder to manage.<br>
<br>
WE NEED MORE CLERICS!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     More Enchanters and FD pullers would be nice as well.<br>
<br>
As people come and go from a raid, teams need to be rebalanced, particularly if a group loses a healer or a tank.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
We had one item to lotto from the raid: a Gloomwater Harpoon.  I'm told this is primarily a Rogue weapon, but it was listed as usable by any class that can pierce.  As such, I lottoed it appropriately (and as I said I would before the raid started).  Halagar (Warrior) won it.  I did receive some feedback from one member of the raid about the lotto.  He felt I chose poorly in opening it up to those who could actually use the weapon (he was holding the place in the lotto for a Rogue who had to leave a bit early).  I did what I said I would do.  In hindsight, I *might* do differently with this particular item if I'm presented with a similar circumstance.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank each and every member of the raid.  Their presence, help, teamwork, and desire to work in this environment is just what we are looking for.  Despite the setbacks, I do think we achieved progress in learning how to work in such raids.  I'm hoping we can take these lessons and apply them properly to future raids.<br>
<br>
That's it from this end.  I'm sure there is something I'm forgetting.  When I think of it, I'll come back to this entry and add it in.  I encourage any members of the raid to make their own comments.  In particular, I'm looking for other things I could have done differently to help make the raid smoother for all. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#004080">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;The Shrine Knights&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

<br>
I was teleporting and binding people up to 2 pm.  Many people gave no thought to transportation or binding time, something that I would have not expected from people level 35+.   Maybe it was our fault for allowing incomers up to 3 pm, however, perhaps we should state next time that they either get their traveling organized by start time or don't get included.  And if people can't find rides or don't know druids or mages? It's easy enough to post a message on this board requesting transportation.<br>
<br>
As a result of starting so late, it was also hard to find some time for a quick debrief right before the hunt.  Maybe next time we can have a debrief about the specific fighting area and the overall strategy.  This way, we'll minimize wondering where everyone and every team fits in and avoid having to explain during the actual hunt.  <br>
<br>
I was sad to see that our only cleric died due to drowning, but he was extraordinarily casual about it - my utmost respect for Kartain.<br>
<br>
The large pull resulted in about 8-9 deaths overall. I admit, I was the one shouting to people to get to the zone when it looked like most casters were dying or close to death and there were too many mobs to handle for the tanks.  I would have liked to evac, however, I couldn't see anyone with so much fighting around me and people moving everywhere.  That's one strategy I would like to work on.  <br>
<br>
Overall, I think Jzonn did a wonderful job with so many people showing up.  <br>
