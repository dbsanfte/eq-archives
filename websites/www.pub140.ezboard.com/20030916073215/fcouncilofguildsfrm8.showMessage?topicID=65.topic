<br>
Last night, February 2nd, the combined forces of the Karana Council of Guilds under the leadership of Haemish MacClellan invaded Permafrost Keep to slay the fair Lady Vox.  There were a number of interesting things that took place that made this raid so unique.<br>
<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The last server split took most if not all of our talented raid leaders and strategists, so Haemish, a Barbarian Warrior whom at the tender age of 39 Seasons, took up the mantle of leadership by organizing and leading this raid.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The final raiding parties consisted of 8 groups ranging in level from 52 at the high end all the way to our lone bard at 37(who was critical in keeping the forward group alive long enough for the nukers to kill Vox).  All in all, the average level was about 46.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The servers went down halfway through the raid – but we regrouped and cleared the castle again for a second push and then launched our attack.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We did this raid with only 2, yep count em, 2 !!!! clerics (a 51 Vicar and a 40 Cleric) and 1 Bard.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The raiding parties consisted of players from a collection of over 15+ small to medium sized guilds that all belong to the Karana Council of Guilds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lady Vox was very generous on this raid and dropped the following (sadly no FA books for the Paladins):<br>
<br>
(2) McVaxius’ Horns of War – One defaulted to Merithment 37 of Illuminatus, and the other was won by Edina Elvandar of Haven of Light<br>
<br>
Crystalline Spear – Tanniss Riverwinds - 51 Champion of Forever Knights<br>
<br>
Staff of Forbidden Rites – Drusila (DRU) of Kindred of the Moon<br>
<br>
Warhammer of the Divine Grace – Azuriem Angelgrace – 40 Cleric and Leader of guild Illuminatus<br>
<br>
Tobrin’s Mystic Eyepatch – Morgail D’unistar - 51 Wizard of Fell Omen<br>
<br>
King room loot – Vox Bracers to Salani (47 Warrior) and Crystalline Sword to Cretar (51 Ranger).  With all the talk of Magic and Cold resists – you can imagine how hot and heavy the rolling was for the Vox Bracer &lt;chuckle&gt;.<br>
<br>
We also managed to retrieve 2 Prickly Pears for the Shadowknight Lifeleech spell quest won by Silver Daggers and Fell Omen to be passed down to their respective ranking Shadowknights AND, 2 Blocks of Permafrost – marking the beginning of the epic quests for 2 more of Karana’s Warriors.<br>
<br>
<br>
The KCoG would like to publicly thank Jzonn and Halagar on Ayonae Ro, Steelheart of Avenging Crusaders, Solonel, and Jannelle Alcedonia of Ashborne, and Pippi Langstrump of Silver Daggers all of whom provided the new management team with assistance in planning and execution of the raid.  Your advice and guidance in advance of this raid was the lynchpin of our success.<br>
<br>
The Karana Council of Guilds is a loose alliance of dozens of small to medium size guilds.  The KCoG sponsors a variety of player driven events ranging from player run“Battle-Chess” type chess tournaments in Butcher Block, to low level Tournaments all the way on up to Planes and Dragon raids.  For guilds that are not planes or dragon capable, the KCoG provides a fantastic opportunity for players of sufficient levels in those guilds to experience these large target encounters.

<br>
Just wanted to publicly thank everyone for being so patient and understanding during last night's event.  It was a pretty grueling event lasting far longer than anyone originally planned for - but was totally understandable given the servers coming down midway through the raid.<br>
<br>
This was our first attempt at leading such a raid and will be the first of many.  Over the course of time - we'll refine our organizational methods, and speed up the time of organize/stage/break/buff/raid dramatically.<br>
<br>
One point from last night though - I recieved a number of tells complaining about certain player's attitudes during the raid last night, and I want to emphasize that on future raids, WE WILL HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT REMOVING YOU FROM THE RAID if that kind of behavior is exhibited again.  The players involved have been given their warnings and I can't impress upon you enough that derisive influences during these raids WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  Diffuse, don't provoke, Say something constructive or don't say anything at all.  Considering the fact that we all played with people we never met before and were STILL successful - you can't expect a group this size to have the efficiency of uber guilds and planes/dragon capable guilds.<br>
<br>
For the most part everything went well - and considering the fact that the server dumped mid raid - we recovered rather admirably.  I'm sorry the loot at the end of the night took so long - but CR made it tricky - once again - we're refining our organizational methods - so you can expect dramatic decreases in time in the near future.<br>
<br>
With that said - I just wanted to tell everyone what an incredible time I had last night and although long - it was everything I hoped it would be!  My CR and MR resists kept me alive long enough for our incredible Team of Triage Healers to heal me and send me back in.  I only got feared twice, totally resisted about 6 or 7 dragon roars, and after checking logs - noticed that I did at least 'some' damage &lt;chuckle&gt;.<br>
<br>
Malachyte DeLoriel (50 Mage of Guardians of Innoruk) got the kill shot, I think Salani or Manslayer won best Taunt/Battle Cry.  Cassia was awarded to either Nawty or Zeol as grand prize of the night.  Thanks to Lagdalen who's tips throughout the night saved us a lot of headaches.  And MVP of the night without a doubt goes to Verius of Avenging Crusaders whose prescence and contributions as one of 2 clerics was one of the lynchpins of our success last night.<br>
<br>
Attending Guilds were:<br>
Silver Daggers<br>
Storm's Justice<br>
Illuminatus<br>
Seekers of Knowledge<br>
Fell Omen<br>
Dark Radiance<br>

Kindred of the Moon<br>
Avenging Crusaders<br>

Clan of Unity<br>
<br>
(I'm sure I missed a few)...<br>
<br>
all in all thank you again for all your help and patience last night - and pat yourselves on the back - you all did a phenomenal job and are all contributing factors to what makes Karana such an incredible server.<br>

The raid was a blast.<br>
<br>
This was my second raid with the CoG. 1 fear and this 1 and from what I saw...<br>
<br>
People need to understand that NEW people are leading these raids. Mistakes will be made, things might take alittle more time. You need to thank these people for getting these raids together instead of signing up, getting there and spaming everyone with &quot;I'm bored&quot;, &quot;Can we go in yet&quot;, &quot;whats taking so long&quot;. As I said to my group last night. I would rather wait 3 hours to be ready then to go in not ready and have everyone die then have 6 more hours of CR. One in my group left becuase he was bored, not an hour later Vox was killed. People need understand that these targets (dragons, planes) are not easy, you dont just walk in and kill the mob. Haveing 1 person managing 40 people is not easy. That said, if you dont have anything helpful to say then dont say anything. If you dont like the way the raid is going then tell your group leader and leave.<br>
<br>
I have alot more I want to say but I will leave it at this<br>

She's hard even when you have an experienced crew, to win with an assortment of people who've not done large raids together before is even more of an accomplishment.<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind for the next Naggy/Vox run is that people who are over 52nd can contribute in the giant clearing and buffing phases of the fight and also in the post fight recovery if they're available. They're also quite valuable in the case CR is needed as they do not have to fear dying to Naggy or Vox while trying to pull corpses out of the lair. If you have people available, use them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Tunare bless,<br>

<br>
We did it like a newborn calf trying to run across a wet field but we did it. ;-) Patience and sleep depravation were pushed almost to the limit but, complaining aside, you have to give it up for everyone who stayed to the end. <br>
<br>
As the KCoG does this more and more it will be more streamlined I'm sure but that is going to require some of us to speak up and offer suggestions of how.<br>
<br>
So, he's my 2cp from the healers end.<br>
<br>
Everything was smooth up until the healing line. Typical raid style, heal your group, assist heal where possible. We were instructed to come up the ramp and all healers were kind of piled in no particular order.<br>
<br>
I heard a /ooc of &quot;here is where the triage will stand&quot; .. but with PC names off all of you quite frankly looked the same. Every part of the ramp was covered so it was anyones guess if the traige was in the right spot.<br>
<br>
The second the first fear wave went off the healing triage was joined by giants and a spider. Happily (?) they all went after our tanks (and Cassia who was trapped between two and I had to heal like crazy to keep from falling) but in the future we need to tend to that little problem.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to have an appointed Healing Triage Leader. This person will say &quot;stand here, back to the wall, etc.&quot; and basically take some weight off of the raid commander. I felt a great loss of communication on my end and I think this would remedy it rather well. <p>Azuriem Angelgrace<br>

There was what seemed to be a last minute change with respect to loot - specifically with Tobrin's Mystic Eyepatch.<br>
<br>
The eyepatch is an all/all +15wis +15int face piece and after conferring with raid management - we decided that the classes that could extract the most utility from an item like this were pure casters.  This was not stated ahead of time, and at first glance - that seemed like a direct contradiction to what was originally posted.<br>
<br>
What I hope people understand is that we were acting with everyone's best interest in mind and cite this as our reason.  Should a Rune Bolster Belt drop on any successive CoG raids - we would invite only melee types to roll on items like that even though the item is all/all.  Yes there is an intrinsic trade value associated with each of these items, but it is MY OPINION that Dragon items along with God items represent the pinnacle of items in their categories.  <br>
<br>
I'd rather have someone extracting direct use of that item obtained from that event wearing the blood of the 20 or 30 people that died so that player could obtain it.  No you're not restricted from trading it away (not like we could even if we wanted to), but I like to think that these items represent more than just 20k in platinum or an FBSS or whatever, but like I said that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
I'm curious to what other people's opinions are on this - because if sentiment is strong enough - we'll change this pseudo-policy on successive raids.  <br>
<br>
Other than that - I wanted to apologize for not announcing this ahead of time, but &lt;chuckle&gt; this was a first time for A LOT of folks.<br>
<br>
Haemish shouts, &quot;Cassia and Shoji are in charge of the buff lines.&quot;<br>
Cassia tells you, &quot;umm we are?&quot;<br>
You tell Cassia, &quot;ummm &lt;shrug&gt; what are we supposed to do?&quot;<br>
Cassia tells you, &quot;umm I dunno - let's wing it.&quot;<br>
[somewhat edited]<br>
<br>
We like to think we can anticipate everything in advance - but this was a first time for a lot of folks - you can rest assured we won't make the same errors in the future.  If something like this comes up again - we'll do our best to announce ahead of time what our intentions will be.<br>
<br>
Take care friends,<br>

First off I appologize profusely for stepping on feet when it came to buff line, as Cassia can attest to she had a constant stream of appologies being sent her way to be distributed... and as my guild can attest to I was scared we would fail again but was watching things not go over completely well... and well in essence I have a big mouth and I told them a couple times to tell me to &quot;shut up anytime now&quot;. I hope what I was saying helped rather than hindered anyway...<br>
<br>
second part was the loot, ok so as a caster I have a biased opinion on it but I agree about the way the eyepatch was lottoed, we had no other drops there for casters and almost every other race had something, in escense, the onle thing we could use in all fairness should only be lottoed amongst us, ALL/ALL or not. Unless you happen to believe that the next time 5 robes and 1 sword drops we casters should get to roll on it...<br>

<br>
The eyepatch was on my interested from Vox list, yes the RBB was at the top it, followed by this eyepatch then the 10 slot 100% reduction bag.<br>
<br>
<br>
and Does this also apply to stuff from all the Big End Game.<br>
So if an item is useable by all classes only the classes that will actually Use it can roll on it. but with that what do we classify as use. For example i will use a Runebrand Girdle just quickly looking at it you see Haste effect and think melee, but upon closer examination you see plus to mana and what do casters try to find when they get MAX WIS or INT, so would this item be caster, Melee or both just an example. But you see where i am getting at where do we draw the line at who can roll and who cant.  It would be easier to stick to old rules ALL/ALL means ALL/ALL not casters only or Melee only because they would put it to better use.<br>

I think Shoji did an excellent job hitting the high points (except my last name is MacLennan, damn you! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  What can I expect from a thong-dancing paladin though.... ROFL). <br>
<br>
I got on right about the time I said we would start, 7:30 pm Central time, and started organizing groups immediately. Luckily I'd made up groups beforehand, and just had to switch people out, mark off those who signed up but didn't attend. Here's where the first thing we need to improve is. I have 2 threads on this board (CoG and Vox) and one for this specific raid. The CoG and Vox thread is to sign up for the MAILING LIST. When the CoG's turn in the dragon rotation begins to get near, I use this mailing list to keep everyone updated on possible times for the raid, all the way up until the day of the raid. In the last email, I inform everyone that they should sign up under the specific date thread to let me get an idea of who is coming. This is essential, you must sign up on the specific date thread (this one was CoG Vox Raid - 2/2). When you let me know you are coming, first off, I give you priority if there are more people than we need. If you sign up, there are only 2 reasons you won't be put in a group over those who didn't sign up: 1) We need more of a specific class, like clerics, 2) You are late and we've already begun. The only time I'm going to let latecomers in is if we need their class (like clerics) or we're at a point where putting you in doesn't endanger us or create too much of a hassle. If we're staging in the king room, I can put you in.... if we're at the buffing line, forget about it. It is your responsibility to get there on time or shortly thereafter, especially for Vox raids, because of the remote location (nearest port is West Karana, a 10-15 minute run from Permafrost). If you have to camp out there the night before, do so, especially if you know you're going to be late. <br>
<br>
After getting the groups made (and thanks to Shoji for taking attendance and Dogedme for giving directions), I sent them into the zone one at a time, and began staging them to certain points so that everyone was not crowded into one area for long. Using 2-3 groups at a time to clear areas ahead worked well, and we were in the king room by 9 pm Central time (or thereabouts). It was camped, so we didn't have to clear it too much (this would have been amazingly easy with the firepower we had). I had invited 2 people to come on the raid that were not 40th level (besides myself), Merithment at level 38? and Draeven at level 36. Draeven had come to clear the king room with others level 35-40, but since no others were available, I asked if he wanted to come along. Knowing he'd probably die, he jumped at the chance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I may not have this type of thing at the next one, but since we had a group with spaces, and he was there, I figured why not. Casters bound in the king room, and we began to pull ice giants. I made one mistake here, in that after the diplomat was dead, I crowded 2 or 3 groups into his spawn point, as a staging point for taking out the next ice giants. However, that many people meant someone got to close, and we pulled them before we were ready. We managed to get them back into the king room, but we lost 1, Guppin (everyone's favorite halfling rogue). After a quick res, we moved into the second ice giant spawn point (in front of the goblin champion) where we stayed for quite a while. Aere (our only monk at the time, as Tyrin came later) began pulling the ice giants between that spot and Vox's lair. This took a LONG time and cost him a few deaths. This is the part of the night that will take the longest time, as he had to try to pull giants from Vox's lair itself without bringing the big beastie out with him. He aggroed her a few times, had to feign and  camp out. I can just imagine the buckets he was sweating as the great wurm herself stood over him, licking her chops. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Aere did a masterful job, especially on the last ice giant, who had an unhealthy attraction to Vox's tail. This is where we had some grumblers, and some who left from boredom. All I can say to those who left from boredom, you missed a helluva time.... if you wanted to speed it up, you could always try to pull the giant without pulling Vox. You might have had to wait a while for the resses though, as we'd have had to kill Vox before getting your corpse. This part of the raid will get quicker the more practiced we become, and I take my hat off to Aere, he was tireless. As we pulled the last ice giant, we had a big mishap. Chanel pulled the giant, Aere grabbed Vox's aggro to keep her there (sacrficing himself), and the giant was successfully pulled back to us. <br>
<br>
Chanel died, and we had another problem come up. When fighting the giants, you MUST pull them back from the walls. This giant got pushed up against a wall, and through it, disappearing. We looked around, but couldn't see him. At this point, some started suggesting that we camp out, and I applaud those who didn't camp out until I called for it, great discipline. Right after shouting for all to camp out, BLINK, I was summoned by said giant, to a point out of sight of the group. Not knowing where I was and being pounded and summoned by this giant repeatedly, I camped out quickly, and logged on to a secondary. I believe Belce was summoned and killed next, luckily I'd made it out without dying. When I got back in, I was still alive, the giant was dead and I was lost. Luckily I was only a few feet away from the groups and quickly made it back, but the whole time I was frightened that I was in Vox's lair and would soon be summoned by her. After getting back to the group, we reorganized and the second major mishap came up. Verant lost a router somewhere and half of the groups went Linkdead, in a huge Lag wave. This lasted a good 10-15 minutes, many getting back on, then being dropped again. When we finally got this issue taken care of, we reorganized and began the buffing line. Credit goes to Cassia and Shoji for their work with this (obviously they didn't expect it).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They got us organized and started... this took a little longer than it should as I tried to go over the strategy in-game. Better to have done so in the chat room later, as I learned. We buffed, camped and thanks to Zeol for setting up the chat room and keeping it open. <br>
<br>
We sat in the chat room, discussed the strategy and then returned to a hot spot. The giants had spawned on us again, and in Vox's lair. This shouldn't happen next time, as: 1) I took extra time to learn how to get to the lair AND where the pit traps were, 2) Tried to explain the strategy in-game. The next time, we probably won't have this problem, or not as much as we did this time. When we got back in, very good timing on getting back in your groups. We had one person reappear at the gate room, who luckily was a monk, as he FD'ed with 4 ice giants spawned around him. Without the ability to go back and get him (as the buffs would wear off) we had to go in without him. I called the charge and in we went!<br>
<br>
All I can say is that chaos and confusion reigned supreme in Vox's lair, yet somehow, somehow the raiders maintained an incredible amount of discipline. I was feared no less than 4 times, and thanks to my DMF buff, I didn't go off into the pit traps (we lost 5 this way I think). The ice giants were fully spawned, yet we managed to get around them and pound on the great wurm. When I returned for my first heal, I found a full set of ice giants raping our triage line. This is what meant my death, as I was healed, then pounded to paste. After reawakening, I began to run back to find out that we had WON! Thanks to all the casters who handled themselves quite admirably, and all the rest who kept killing her. I managed to get a few hits in myself, and my next goal is to actually see most of the battle at a dragon raid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My magic resist unbuffed was 79, but I think even had it been higher, my level would certainly make me more susceptible. Shoji, 5 levels above me got feared half as much as I, so the lower you are, the higher your resists need to be. <br>
<br>
The ending corpse recovery was complicated by the location, but Aere did a superlative job getting all corpses out of the pits. The loot was incredible, but didn't even hold a candle to the pride I felt at having accomplished the first successful CoG Vox raid. <br>
<br>
My thanks go out to all the raiders, and I want to mention a few in particular. From the management body, I want to thank Cassia and Shoji for the buff lines, loot management, taking attendance, and all the other things they did. Belce for being backup battle commander and showing me the ropes of the dungeon and the Vox raid strategies. Thanks to Eressia, Rbecka, Manslayer, Tanniss, Nawty, Junun, Cassia, Dogedme and Zeol for being excellent group leaders. Thanks to Aronos for keeping me updated on the server status. Thanks to Azuriem, Verius and Iluvatar for being the only clerics on the raid, and quick with resses. Thanks to Talovar (a 56 bard) for trying to get that last ice giant out of Vox's lair and then getting popped to the zone. Thanks to Rbecka who collected and passed out the reagent fund, and to all those who contributed to this fund without complaint. Thanks to Quixler, Cassia and Fazlazen for being our only enchanters on the raid. Thanks again to Aere, Chanel and Shamas for pulling and corpse recovery. And thanks to everyone who stayed for their patience. You all deserve a round of applause and a good 12 hours of sleep... there will be songs sung of your valor. <br>

<br>
As I mentioned to Shoji, the only problem I had about hearing the raid was the fact that a lotto rule was modified after the item had dropped.  I know it was not done purposefully and was a spur of the moment thing, but telling people one thing and then modifying it midway does not tend to sit well with anyone, for whatever reason (it could be the perfect reason and people would still not be happy) and I can fully understand that... either be very detailed about it upfront, or it will always seem like you are trying to have someone specific benefit through this sudden change.   I have seen situations like this occur before, and honestly, you do not want to get into something like that - not sure if anyone remembers the Nagafen and Perciful.  If we learn from this now, we can avoid getting ourselves into future troubles.<br>

My thanks to all the leaders of the raid.  Organization and communication is the key.  Also patience among the raiders.  What we learn on this raid will make the next more more successful.<br>
<br>
I had concerns with the sudden switch in loot rules for the eyepatch and have posted my comments on that under the other topic. Be careful when you start to legislate who gets what.  Suitability can be debated till the cows come home.  But whatever you decide to do, let people know up front.  <br>

<br>
I think everyone did a really great job, but there's one suggestion that I'd like to make.  In future raids, I think the strategy should be gone over clearly during the staging.  Perhaps there should be one person in the management body whose sole job is to explain everything before we even go in.  That way all the participants will know what to expect and things should go a bit smoother.<br>
<br>
I know as one of the group leaders there were some questions from my group that I just didn't know how to answer.  I've read a few different strategies on raiding Vox and I wasn't sure which one we were going with.  I hope I have explained this clearly, and would be happy to discuss it further.<br>
<br>
All in all, a great raid!  And I'm sure this just points to better things in the future! <p>Eressia Kallisti<BR>

I should have gone over it before we zoned into Permafrost, but wanted to make sure we got in the dungeon and got moving quickly enough so that people wouldn't get bored. <br>
<br>
I will try to post my strategy on this forum later in the week for the Nagafen raid coming up. <br>

Second off all i would like too say im SORRY for being so late and holding up the raid because i was late getting on and getting there. I forgot too buy gems for the raid i will not let that happen again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   if i knew cassia wasn't too sure on how to get the line up and buff i could've off sugested a couple off ideas from the other dragon raids i have been on but things went real good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and glad that u guys waited for me too get there.<br>
<br>
<br>
the way i seen buffing lines is spread out little bit more get the people feeding mana and giving out rods stand behind them or on the other side of the wall <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and call out classes to come too the buffing line and the rest stay back until there class is called up too the line. I thought the buffing line was a little bit too close together and some people were getting missed on the buffs but i didn't say nothing which i should off but they raid leader Haemish and all the other people who ran the raid  did a fine job keeping things cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  things under control. And for the people who left because they were bored  well i tell u something from being on failed dragon raids it take alot longer too recover dead bodies from the caves then it does too take the time and too do things right the first time. For raids like these patience is the key too sucess not the run in right away and hack and slash. All that will get u is a living dragon and alot off work too corpses out too rez up. <br>
<br>
But there is my 2 bits on how i thought the raid went <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
FROM the Cleric who wants too kill alot more dragons and take plains trips. THANKS for allowing me to come and also  waiting for me  i will try not too be late again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and have all the gems i need to buff people with.
