Hi Folks, <br>
<br>
Having gone through this ordeal 26+ for myself, and watching countless other shamans deal with Rak, I thought to write this little ditty up to help other TE shamans with their last and painful battle of killing Lord Rak. <br>
<br>
Know Thy Enemy <br>
The more you know about Rak, the better you can warn your fellow raid members about the dangers of Lord Rak. <br>
<br>
Lord Rak'Ashiir is a Nasty Nasty Mob. He can spawn from from the last corpse of a Black Reaver. He is NOT considered undead. Rak can also seemingly just &quot;spawn&quot; in two places, including the throne roome and up in the to of the tower where the elevator leads. <br>
<br>
Lord Rak is INITIALLY NON-AGGRO except for: <br>
1) when the shaman turns in the Tear <br>
2) someone attacks him <br>
3) someone with Bad True Faction Spirit is around. (I found this out the hard way, when a wizard who had completed her epic got too close to Rak, causing a TPW. From what I also understand, Pallies can also get bad true faction spirit.) <br>
<br>
Once the Tear is turned in, the regular Rak despawns and respawns immediately as the Epic-Mob Rak, and will try to kill the shaman who did the turn-in. (IMPORTANT: The shaman turning in the tear WILL die. So prepare to die!) This particular Rak is KOS to EVERYONE! Once the Tear is turned in, and if all goes wrong, Rak will turn on eveyone. If you do not turn in the Tear to Rak, he will be a &quot;regular&quot; mob, with absolutely no Iksar Scale for turn-in. <br>
<br>
Rak cannot be slowed, maliosed, or crippled. Been there, done that...and none of my spells landed before I died. <br>
<br>
Rak lands has some nasty AE fire DDs (2K+ damage--1K in two ticks), rains, and DOTs. Rak WILL summon. <br>
<br>
RAK GATES! When Rak is down to about 20% of health, he WILL GATE back to his original spawn spot. Be prepared for this event. If he gates, he will call in re-inforcements, so if it occurs, be prepared for multiple adds, from golems, ghosts, and Black Reavers. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Prepare Your Troops <br>
*Let your raiding party know exactly what they are dealing with Lord Rak. The more your group knows, the less chance of someone gaining aggro who shouldn't, someone won't accidently cast on Rak who shouldn't, someone won't attack Rak who shouldn't. I cannot stress this enough. I've seen too many Rak raids go wrong because someone was Hot Button happy. <br>
<br>
*Have several mage fire pets on hand for this fight. I understand that it can be done without mages, but I have not seen or done this, so I will leave it to other shamans to research. <br>
<br>
You can have one high level mage fire pet kill Lord Rak. I've seen it done, with Voodini being the only mage. It was a long fight, and everyone who could heal, was healing the pet. <br>
<br>
* Melees and non-essential casters need to PARK their butts as far away from Rak as possible, trying very hard to not get Rak's attention. <br>
<br>
*Fire pets need to be completely buffed up, and, if possible, given weapons. <br>
<br>
*Clerics, druids, other shamans, and anyone who has a minor heal spell should be continually healing the Fire Pets. Make sure all the healers coordinate on this very effort. <br>
<br>
*Enchanters need to continually chain Rune the Fire Pets. This will greatly lessen the damage on said pets. One enchanter should be in charge of charming any adds and send in against Lord Rak. Make sure the chanters are coordinating on this very effort. Too many cooks in the kitchen can lead to problems. <br>
<br>
*Necros, bards, beastlords should offer secondary support to healers and enchanters to keep mana reserves up. <br>
<br>
*BRING PDOTS for your enchanters and clerics. This is *your* last epic fight, shamans. So spend the money and buy at least 5 stacks of pdots to hand out to your enchanters and clerics for buffs and rune-ing. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
My Own Experiences &amp; Some Strategies <br>
I have seen Rak killed (and tried killing) Rak in several places. There are two bad strategies and two seemingly good/doable strategies: <br>
<br>
1) [BAD IDEA] in the top room, where the elevator is located. This room is too enclosed for mage pets to fight, and healers to be located. Tried this, and some folks got hit by Rak's AE. Also, unless this room is cleared out well, Black Reavers will begin spawning in this room. <br>
<br>
2) [BAD IDEA] on the bridge outside the tower. Several potential things can go wrong here. <br>
<br>
a) Rak can fall into the water. This will make targeting the pets for heals difficult. <br>
b) the fire pets can push Rak through the locked door into the other room. This again makes difficult for targeting, and if the room is popping, well, the fire pets will not last long against all those adds. <br>
<br>
3) [DOABLE] in the u-bend past the Gazebos. While I have heard of, watched on other EQ player screens, and done this particular strategy, I see several potential problems with it. <br>
<br>
a) Rak needs to be successfully pinned against the wall by the fire pets, and no others can cast on him. For my own last battle, someone did something to Rak, which caused him to move towards the group, killing a bunch of people <br>
<br>
b) Rak gates. When Rak was down to 20% health, he gated back to his original spawn spot--the throne room--and called in re-inforcements. The melees had to content with a reaver, golem, and several ghosts, while the enchanters, mages, and healers had to scramble to get into the throne room to finish off Rak. <br>
<br>
In this particular fight, Sinsa ran into the throne room, keeping a charmed pet on Rak. Rak killed Sinsa in the process. Wageit also ran in, melee'ing Rak until his own death, so that the mages could get into the room so that fire pets could once again re-engage Rak. Outside the throne room, everyone else were engaging the added re-inforcements. (Kudos to the team for the organized chaos!) <br>
<br>
We were successful with this strategy, but there was some general chaos to be had. <br>
<br>
4) [DOABLE] fight in the throne room. This is probably by far, the best strategy I have seen and partaken in so far. You have to ensure that the throne room is completely empty before you take on Rak. <br>
<br>
Any pops or adds that occur can be mezzed or charmed by enchanters to send in against Rak. If Rak gates, and this is his bind spot, he isn't going anywhere. <br>
<br>
The fight can take place in one-half of the room, while everyone presses up against the other side of the room. We did this fight with Voodini being the only mage on Bunnion's epic with very little problem. <br>
<br>
The one drawback I have seen with this fight, is that if something goes wrong, all of you are trapped in this locked room. During my 2nd fight with Rak, we had to help the guild ,who were killing Rak at the time before our raid, do a complete CR because Rak was aggro'd, killing 90% of the raiding party. Rak died, but a MASSIVE CR ensued after. <br>
<br>
5) Let the Shaman Pull. The shaman, after turning in the tear, can pull Rak to whatever spot you choose. Make sure that you pull Rak and die where you need him fought. You can try casting on him, but chances are you'll be resisted. Only have a pet in the case of killing him in the Throne Room, because it will be easier to control your pet in that enclosed area. If you try to pull him to the u-bend with a pet, the pet might engage him too soon. Dismiss your pet if you're fighting in the u-bend. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Rak Bugged? <br>
Rak bugged? OF COURSE HE IS! This is the bane of this particular epic. Rak is bugged. Accept it. He will despawn!! I had to go to the GM TWICE to ask refund of the tear. Verant/SoE have *no* clue why this happens. This is why a GM was present at my last Rak fight...to see what happens. <br>
<br>
You will either have to fight Rak only once....or twice...or, in my case, thrice. <br>
<br>
I have spoken with GMs about this, and shamans who have had this problem. Here are some things you should know: <br>
<br>
1) If you TPW, you need to re-engage the epic'd Rak (who is KOS to everyone) almost immediately. You cannot take 20-30 minutes for a CR. Rak will DESPAWN. He seems to have a despawn time after the tear is turned in. <br>
<br>
2) If Rak gates, there is a slight chance, he will respawn as the non-epic'd Rak with no Iksar Scale. This happened to Bunnion's first fight with Rak. Even though, Rak was killed, no Iksar Scale was on the body! <br>
<br>
3) If Rak gets pushed through a wall and/or gates while being pushed through a wall, he might respawn as the non-epic'd Rak. <br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
Some Additional Information <br>
<br>
1) I have heard that once Rak is below 50%, wizards and damage casters can start casting on him. However, I caution all casters here to not gain aggro from Rak. <br>
<br>
2) At 50%, I also heard that chanters can start mana-sieving Rak. Again, having not seen this myself...use at your own risk. <br>
<br>
3) I have read that Rak can be memory-wiped in the case of him aggro'ing on someone who attacked too soon, before the tear turn-in. Again, not sure here since I haven't seen it. <br>
<br>
4) Shamans..turn down your clipping plane, turn off spell effects, and anything that will CUT down on Lag. When I did my turn-in, and running for the u-bend, I hit a lag-spike and the next thing I know...I'm IN the water! ACK! TE is a massive gravity well with all the particles, spells, epics, and general known over-kill numbers! Running on the bridge and falling into the water is not fun! Take it from my own experience! <br>
<br>

Thanks for letting me post Wageit, <br>
------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
Some added information, I figure I should repost; <br>
<br>
How the shaman epic works, <br>
The shaman epic is structured around faction rather then the typical progressive hand-ins. At completion of the sub-quest the shaman is awarded faction at increasing amounts. its common practice for a shaman to complete all the sub quests upto the black dire in MM (you get a cool set of boots), then redo the killing of the guys in RM till you get &quot;cant get any better&quot;. <br>
<br>
How Rak and the spectral wolf work, <br>
when the tear is turned into Rak he does a faction check on the giver, if he faction is sufficient then he respawns a version of himself with an &quot;Iksar scale&quot;. once killed anyone can loot Rak and receive the scale. After that the looting shaman then needs to go to a spectral wolf in EJ and turn in the Iksar scale and get the epic. Like Rak the Wolf does a faction check on the giver and a new twist a level check. From what I have gathered SOE put in a twist after a few level 1 shaman, Rangers and druids were walking around with epics. So now key NPC's do a level check on the PC, if the PC is less then 46 it will not perform the actions required. In the case of the Wolf, no epic. <br>
<br>
edited: new section <br>
How do you know something is wrong <br>
If you hand in the tear and nothing happens at all, your faction check failed. If your not the one turning in the tear you will know something is up if Rak attacks the turn in but is indiffrent to you. Warning: There are people who try to sell you the MQ to Rak but are infact scamming you. They will go up to Rak and say they are turning it in then they just taunt him or attack him to get him to agro. SOE support staff will not &quot;respawn&quot; Rak or give you the scale, they will ONLY refund the tear and only if you had it in your inventory. Only pay after you have the scale. <br>
<br>
Now that you got the scale now what? This is the time to check your self. am I 47+ did I get &quot;cant get any better faction&quot;. Warning: some people have been stating that you just need kindly to get your epic. This is not true, I have verified this myself. If you are kindly before you do the hand, once you hit trade your faction will bump up a full lvl (maybe more). If your recieving an MQ you must have max faction the wolf will not give the tear unless you are. I have seen 3 folks will Ally fail but have yet see or heard a max fail. <br>
<br>
<br>
I am currently getting MAX faction no risks and i have the tear on Garrbut now so that is no problem. All i need is raiders so please sign up and a rogue would be extremely helpful so we can get in. I dont know about the resists thing so well try it with fire pets first and if they are dying then get earth pets.<br>
----------------<br>
IMPORTANT - IF YOU ARE KOS TO THE TRUE SPIRIT FACTION YOU M-U-S-T SAY AS IT CAN MAKE A WIPE IF YOU DONT. He WILL AE you and that WILL affect all near you giving ALL the aggro creating a big CR...you wouldnt want it to be all your fault now would you?<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
If a Jade Reaver drops then rangers/druids or whoever needs it for epic will be able to roll on it. If nobody needs then all can roll. If you know the zone well and/or have killed Rak before your knowledge on him would be invaluable - from reading this thingy above i think well try take him in the throne room with tanks/melee taking adds - with druids/shammys healing.<br>
<br>
If you will help can you please get a map of the zone so if you are lost you will know where to go. A good set of group leaders would also be very useful to help keep chaos to a minimum. <br>
<br>
We WILL be using raid feature on this raid to keep an eye on loot and stuff like that. All help is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Ill repeat the start times and date now so you may be able to plan ahead.<br>
