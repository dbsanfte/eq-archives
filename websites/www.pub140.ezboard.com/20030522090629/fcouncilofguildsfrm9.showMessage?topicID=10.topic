Proceed to The Hole near Paineel on Erud. Bring 3 groups of uber pals with you<br>
(level 55+). High Scale Kirn is located in the Tower BEYOND the City in The<br>
Hole.<br>

<br>
Once you get to High Scale Kirn, give him the High Scale Icon:<br>
WARNING: DO NOT use Form of the Great Bear while doing this. Reports<br>
that handing Kirn the Icon in Bear Form will BUG the quest causing him to NOT<br>
agro and NOT drop Neh's Promise Ring!<br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a long moment before speaking. 'Why did<br>
you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles<br>
venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth<br>
to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will<br>
remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!'<br>
Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<br>
You gain party experience!!<br>
<br>
NOTE: Kirn is initially non-agro to all, but will AGRO IMMEDIATELY the<br>
instant you hand him the Icon, so you may not see the above conversation fly by,<br>
or it's possible the conversation has been removed. Just hand him the Icon and<br>
then kill him. No conversation is necessary.<br>
<br>
After Killing High Scale Kirn, he drops:<br>
Engraved Ring<br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>

Hole Strategy # 1<br>
<br>
Just want to make a post for how to do the hole part of the quest, as it is one of the more difficult<br>
feats we have.<br>
<br>
I found out today that the Keeper of the Tomb in the left hand courtyard of the revenant tower will<br>
eat 3 groups alive and laugh if you aggro him. the good news is that Invis to dead works in the<br>
tower.<br>
<br>
Yes i know some of the revs still scowl at you but they will NOT attack. Go through the gate, run<br>
through the middle main doors of the tower and to the back where a single door opens to stairs<br>
leading upward. follow this up a couple flights to Kirn himself, then drop invis to dead in his room<br>
and kill the three revs in his aggro range. Kirn is indifferent, so no AE spells. give kirn the icon as<br>
soon as you have breathing space, kill him and evac out of there or invis to dead again and run out.<br>
My raid failed today because we stopped to pull the courtyards and the keeper caught us. 15 coffins<br>
and four slow bodydrags with my halfling rogue later, i logged. The tower is dangerous, dont let the<br>
relatively easy time you had with the elementals fool you. Get in, get the ring and get out.<br>
It took us about 4 hours to get to the tower. if your pullers have never been to the hole, urge them to<br>
make halfling rogues and get them there, bind them in paineel by the hole entrance, sow them and<br>
show them around. This will save a lot of time.<br>
<br>
Dragging bodies is not easy. 11 mobs after the zone in, there is a dropoff you must jump down to<br>
progress, but you cannot reach coming back. To get back to the zone ye will have to have a high<br>
picklock skill and be able to sneak through the main castle to unlock a door leading back to the zone<br>
via a long bridge above you. Not possible with a 2nd level rogue, as lockpick is too low.<br>
You are able to drag the bodies to just below the dropoff and kill your rogue, giving him a insta<br>
deathgate to paineel where you can return to the area from the top of the dropoff, and from there ye<br>
can summon the corpses of those below with careful manuevering on the lip of the ledge. time<br>
consuming, but it works.<br>
<br>
There is a shortcut at one point that involves leaping down a waterfall just past the city. if you take<br>
this route, make it very clear to everyone that they should not jump off the waterfall's edge or run off<br>
the edge or they will splat like an egg instead of hitting the pool below. I believe that you take<br>
damage from water landings if you are encumbered, so make sure noone is lest they die. It's a<br>
loooong drop.<br>
<br>
If anyone else wants to throw in some tips or accounts of successful or failed raids please do so.<br>

The Hole Strategy # 2 <br>
<br>
Getting in the Tower:<br>
We found this the hardest part - took over 2 hours to get from this area to Kirn. Here's my thoughts if<br>
they are helpful.<br>
<br>
The exit from the city is a long winding tunnel. You find the quest npc for another class sitting near<br>
a pool... keep going... eventually you will come to an open area with the tower off in the distance.<br>
The open area has 2 spawns - a rock golem and elemental. Kill those, move up. You have 6 minutes.<br>
The open area faces the tower... dips down, flattening in the bottom before rising again towards the<br>
tower. In this area before the tower you will come across a few roamers... a rat and several rock<br>
golems and elementals.<br>
<br>
There is a tunnel to the left which leads to, I belive, Master Yael. That's not where you want to go.<br>
The rat and some rock golems and elementals referred to above come from this tunnel and interrupt<br>
your progression.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of revenant and wanderer roamers here too.<br>
In front of the castle are two spawns - revenant/wanderers. 6 min spawn.<br>
The question becomes pull to the first opening from the tunnel, pull to the flat or just keep on<br>
moving forward. We pulled to the flat to prevent continuously fighting the 6 min respawn at the top.<br>
This is tough as you attract all of the roamers from the Master Yael tunnel.<br>
<br>
I suggest that you pull to the flat but do not pull the inside of the tower for one or two rotations... just<br>
bide your time splitting up the spawn from this area. Some rock golems in this area cannot be<br>
mesmerised by a (very talented) L57 enchanter... so you need some tanks to keep an eye on these<br>
specific high level golems when you find them.<br>
<br>
When you get on top of the flat spawn, wait until the two revenants at the doorway spawn and then<br>
kill them. You then have 6 minutes to kill around 3 revenants in the first room of the tower. The trick<br>
here is to move inside... do not get sophisticated trying to pull the tower to outside - the respawn rate<br>
and number of mobs is likely to be too high. Then it's just a gritty room by room assault to keep<br>
ahead of the respawn.<br>
<br>

Back to Kirn <br>
<br>
Thats the info i have so far ill print it etc for when we go as well as memorise it - and it said 3 grps of 55+ meaning he sounds nasty.<br>
<br>
BTW i need a tear out of fear - if there is a fear raid with no shammy going for the tear id appreciate it if i was told )<br>

On top of that, I can't tell you how invaluable it was to have someone create a Brell-worshipping Halfling Rogue to scout for us before we raided the place. That rogue (level 1) was able to accompany us all the way to the undead tower without any problems. Therefore, we had someone who knew the route and could get us there with the least amount of problems. <br>
<br>
So, I had 16 friends of all shapes and sizes. Make sure you have two enchanters for crowd control and at least two tanks who can do a lot of dps. We had a 58 warrior (with epic), a 58 monk, a 58 bard, shaman and necro pets and lots of casters blasting things. <br>
<br>
A good rule of thumb for the Hole is: watch for adds and move quickly. The respawn time is very quick and you can move on safely if you kill quick and then hustle. <br>
<br>
We started at the first golem (note: rock golems in the Hole summon). We pulled and cleared to the next area and so one. Mobs are fast and furious here, so make sure your casters are managing their mana. <br>
<br>
We got to the undead tower and got Invisible To Undead up and started running. You go up the stairs to your left and keep going. Then, instead of going into the room where Kirn is, we parked ourselves in the chamber with the Ghost and got buffed and full mana. <br>
<br>
I turned in the High Scale Icon and immediately got bashed by Kirn for about 400 points. Everyone sent the pets in and the tanks went in. While fighting him, Kirn will move around, so make sure you keep him near the center of the room so you don't pull aggro from other rooms. I was surprised as how easy Kirn was. Within two minutes, he was down for the count. I looted my ring and the druids ported us out. <br>
<br>
We were there for about three hours total and suffered only three deaths total. <br>
<br>
Again, just do your research (thank you, Allakhazam!) and make sure your have a good group and someone to call out orders. <br>
<br>
Now, back to the CoM for the next step. <br>

Im far far away from that part of the pally epic anyway.  hopefully we will move in, take this dude out, get his ring, and then have ourselves a nice little shindig.  someone bring one of those fishing poles that summon ale, hehe.<br>

Requires:<br>
1. 55 mage willing to eat a 90/96 rez depending on the cleric<br>
2. 3-4 DA Paladins/Shadow Knights<br>
<br>
Start by having mage suicide into the hole from paneel. Next have group of Paladin/SKs/at least 1 cleric DA into the hole from Paneel just like the mage did. There are only 2-3 mobs at landing so a group of tanks and Cleric should make quick work of them. Rez the mage and just start CoHing the rest of your party down. From this spot you have VERY few mobs between you and the undead castle. This turns a 3-4 hour crawl into a quick keeper or Kirn raid. <br>
<br>
Also there are rocks to the right of the castle enterance and is out of agro range for all the mobs there and is a good spot to rez in case of TPW it will be tight but we rezed 4 groups of folks on that rock 1 day. We just had a Brell cleric who never hunted the hole IvU down in and wait at the rocks while our lvl 1 halfling rogues dragged corpses there. There are 2 undead inside castle that see IvU so if you try a run to the top and get agro STOP and die and getted dragged to the top of the castle. My party didnt do that the first time and TPW that turned into a 2.5 hour CR.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just some tips on the hole. Hope it may help  <p><img src="http://www.twixmixy.com/images/everquest/signatures/cheynar_2.jpg"><BR><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=67071 ">My profile</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garrbutwindhammer@councilofguilds>Garrbut Windhammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/30/03 11:15:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hole raid late January i hope</span><hr size=1> hmmm ill take that into account.

I have pretty low tolerance for idiots, so if people aren't listening and doing what they are told, I probably won't stay around.  Idiots get raids wiped - repeatedly.  Getting wiped is no fun.  This is a raid, not a picnic.  Listen to and respect the raid leader and the group leaders.  Do not clog the raid channel with drivel.<br>

The more planning you do here and the more information you provide the potential raid force before Saturday morning, the better. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>
