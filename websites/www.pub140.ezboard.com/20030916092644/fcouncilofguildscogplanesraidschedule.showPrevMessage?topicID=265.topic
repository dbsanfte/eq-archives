I have never been to PoA before, but would be interested in trying if I can get some interest from people here.  If I get enough positive reactions I will sign us up.  Any raid to the PoA would have to be 50+ straight, as I am not comfortable taking under 50 into a plane that I am not familiar with.<br>
<br>
Another note, from what I am reading anyone going will have to contribute substancially financially.  It is looking like a trip will cost somewhere between 1-2k per person.  On the other hand many epic pieces drop up here, as well as some fairly nice loot. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
Lev does not work.<br>
Due to the intricate keying system, something like 24 players at a time can go.<br>
Because of the process of obtaining keys, these 24 people are going to have to be VERY organized, with a good dps - killing certain creatures spawns a guy who will trade keys for drops, but he does not stick around for long.<br>
Due to that guy I just mentioned, no one should use &quot;/say&quot; for ANYTHING.  He can and will kick your butt for talking in his presence.<br>
A lot of the monsters do not care for duelers, either, though I have heard of that technique being used to complete the Necro epic, at least.<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, go find yourself a list of &quot;what drops what, and what it is used for&quot;.  You should not have time to ask during the raid.<br>

<br>
You can really take up as many as you want.  But you can only get keys for about 24 people.  Past that people will have to duel and get their corpse summoned to the next island and rez'd.<br>
<br>
Due to the rez timer on duel'd corpses, and the fact that some mobs up there dont like duels, its suggested you attack Sirran and take an xp death.<br>
<br>
Obviously you'll want a level 57+ necro to take advantage of the smaller coffins or you'll be hauling a ton of expensive, non stackable, main inventory only ones.  Although, they do sell them on the first island.<br>
<br>
As stated, lev doesnt work up there in any incarnation.  Nor do ports or evacs or succor.  All buffs are auto-stripped upon zoning, so its pointless and a waste of time and mana to buff before going up.<br>
<br>
Not all the islands drop exactly 24 keys.  Most actually only drop about 22.<br>
<br>
Aggro is a bitch.  FD is required.<br>
<br>
Keys will disappear if you leave the zone, although they will stay with you through a camp if you camp in the zone.<br>
<br>
You'll need at least 1 58+ enchanter.<br>
<br>
You'll want at least 1 necro capable of doing rez's using EE's just in case, or a Vox rez stick in the hands of an FD class.<br>
<br>
First island is pretty much non-KoS.  Just kill the faeries to get the boss mob to spawn.<br>
<br>
Second Island is KoS.  You must go up invis.  It is suggested that anyone over the 24 key'd members buy a key for this island since it's almost impossible to summon a corpse and rez them untill you've cleared the island making it pointless.   Keys to this island cost about 150pp.  Be prepared for several mobs.<br>
<br>
The third island is non-KoS if I recall.  At least at the fight spot.  You port into a Taj Mahal looking structure invis, and run outside to the port spot for the next island.  You cant miss it as it looks like all the others.  Fight here.  Use an FD puller to pull.  Do not attack the wisp looking meteor thingies on top of the structure.  These things are hard to split and cast knockback which can knock you off the island.<br>
<br>
The 4th Island is the Pegasus island.  There are 6 mobs here.  3 Pegasus and 3 Griffons.  I believe you pull the griffons first.  Or at least leave 1 Pegasus up to the end.  You pull a griffon.  You kill it.  It then splits into 2 harder griffons.  You kill them, and each one spawns a second one.  So you'll end up with 5 mobs total from each one.  Normal tactics, unless your good, is to mez one of the splits while you kill the second one and its split, then go back.  I'm not sure if a 58 enchanter is enough...might need to be 60.  If you dont have an enchanter that high...pray, and perhaps camp a cleric first.  With PoP and new druid heals, its possible you might be able to take both at once.<br>
<br>
After that is the Spiroc Island.  You need to kill the vanquishers before his guards, or they'll just respawn.  So take the Vanquisher out first, then the 2 guards.  Leave the Guardian Spiroc up and I believe you can farm the Lord.  You kill him and Sirran spawns.  Leave Sirran (you can turn in the keys) and as long as the Guardian Spiroc is still up the Lord will respawn in about 20 minutes or so I believe.  You'll want to train Sirran to the opposite side of the island OR wait for him to de-spawn otherwise Sirran will aggro on you when you attack the Lord again and he will own you.<br>
<br>
Next Island is the bee island.  Dont bother.  You arent going to do this.<br>
<br>
From this island on you can check out other guides.  Believe me, its very difficult to do.  You probably wont have time to go here or higher given the time frame you have.<br>
<br>
If you dont have a 57+ necro, everyone must bring 3-4 large coffins.  If you dont have a necro or SK who can use em, then about 22 people is the max you can bring past the second island.<br>
<br>
The first Faerie island actually drops 2 keys.  One is for the Azzarak Island (they look like imps and are detailed above) the second is to the Noble's island.  Unless your doing Gwan for the monk epic or decide to do the Noble, there's little point in going here.  There's not much there, and I dont think epic pieces really drop there either.<br>
<br>
All I can say is that to do this you need to stick together.  Its absolutely necessary that everyone listens to /assist calls.  If anyone breaks a mez or attacks the wrong mob there's an excellent chance you'll wipe the raid.  If you wipe the entire raid past the first island, you'll have a hell of a CR to do.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is that the Raid Leader implement severe conditions here.  Any sort of misbehaving or failure to listen and they should be kicked out of the raid immediately.  Failure to leave the zone should result in KCoG sanctions against the entire guild.  I'm not kidding here, its very harsh, but the consequences are even worse.  One wrong move could easily wipe a 45+ person raid in seconds and you'll have to plan accordingly.  In fact, we almost always camp a cleric on the island we're on BEFORE begining to engage just in case.  You simply cannot give second chances here.<br>
<br>
Also, bear in mind PoA IS a plane.  Do not expect ANY help from a GM or Guide here.  For anything.  This includes bugs, corpses suddenly going to the first island, corpses and mobs dropping under the world, etc.  There are some limited things a Guide or GM can do, but they're never in the players interest.  Under certain situations (with a GM approval) for example they could summon your corpse if it got stuck.  You'll always be summoned to the first island and probably have to get your own rez and summons.<br>
<br>
It can be a very fun and rewarding zone.  Its got cool graphics, and its very scenic.  But keep in mind, it remains possibily one of the worst zones you can fairly easily enter in the game.  I'd rather assault Ssra or NToV any day than PoA.<br>
