Now is the time to comment and bring anything forward that needs to be debated.  Like I said, these events I will schedule is for all small guilds.  I do not wish to run them, without your &quot;input.&quot;  I don't think that is very fair.  And most importantly I want people to know what my policies are prior to stepping into the planes.  I don't want to hear when Im up there, &quot;That's not fair,&quot; or &quot;I don't approve.&quot;  This is your chance to disapprove or claim something is unfair.<br>
<br>
I do believe I have covered all the basis, and believe it is fair.  In which case, if everyone else agrees, I will turn it into the policy in which I will use to schedule and run all future plane events.<br>
<br>
Also, keep in mind, that's where I will conduct most of my business.  It's too time consuming to go to every small guilds website.  Also, that's the area I will use to schedule people into the events.  As soon as the above mentioned becomes policy, and I get confirmation about scheduling the next event I will start getting the list of names (depending on policy) from there.  Don't list down names yet, I will most likely open a thread stating the date of the next raid, then it will be on a First come first serve basis.  Once the list is full the left-overs may at their option choose to have first option on next event (again depending on policy).<br>
<br>
Wednesday is the deadline for comments.<br>

I did want to ask for clarification on point #3 of the treasure rules, however. My understanding from reading it is that once a player has won any item, they are out for all other items until everyone in their class has any item. What I'm asking is, if ItemA drops and is won by a player, and then ItemB drops, is the player that won ItemA in or out of the lotto for ItemB? I think it means the player is out, regardless of what the next item is, but I just want to be sure I understand.<br>

<br>
I think the rules and structure you have set up for the hunt is fair and equitable for all, and will probably lead to some smooth planes raids. Any help you need from me, in the form of web work, or press releases sent to the EQ sites out there, I'm more than happy to provide. As a matter of fact, once you set the schedule for your next run, I'd like to announce the signup for said run in the usual manner of Council events, with a press release. What do you say? <br>

<br>
Just a few things I didn't see.  <br>
<br>
It is customary to make BPs and Robes separate lottos, meaning that even if you have won an item you are still in on the lotto for them.  This goes the same for weapons/shields.  In fact, I feel so strongly about this rule that if this is not the case, I will not attend.  This very thing happened on a PoH raid we had with Sky Raiders last week and I did not agree.  A cleric had won a shield (which is not that great of an item, +10 to all resists or something) and they told him he couldn't be in on BP lottos.  I did not feel this was fair at all to him, but there was nothing I could do since I wasn't leading the raid.<br>
<br>
Also, anyone leaving the raid and taking a break for more than 2 hours gets latecomer status when they return, meaning they are out of the first lotto, including BPs/weapons.<br>
<br>
All trinkets in PoF should go to clerics firstly and then enchanters for reagents. <p><p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="background-color: #FFCC66"><font color="#660066">~

<br>
Second the cleric never said a word about the BP the only one to ask about it was you no one else. He was happy to win a shield and didn't even ask to be in the BP lotto till ya send him a tell telling him that he should have been in lotto. <br>
<br>
During that raid Sky Raiders members got 2 items and those who came with us (Harbingers 5 players and Wolf Pack 2 players) got 4 item. Seems more then fair to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I was pointing out to Zellex a rule I feel strongly about, that BPs/Robes should be separate lottos.  Sorry if my mentioning Sky Raiders upset you, but I do feel strongly about that loot rule so I used that as an example.  <br>
<br>
I know what it feels like to have more guests win loot than your guildmates, but when you invite people to ensure success on a raid it's really a different story imo.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, see you soon.

<br>
Such a GM was watching the superior leadership qualities of myself  (*cough*  *sneeze*) and was impressed and sent us a Brother Nashdal an evil monk which we killed (*ya right this is fiction but addressing it anyways*) and it had Dal's Dragon Robe (AC 18, str 10, dex 10, agi 10, sv fire 12, Effect Flameshield, monk only), even though another monk may have gotten two Shiverback pieces (because I already had those pieces) he would still be in the lottery.<br>
<br>
So now, once I get off my lazy butt, I'll retype everything with the modifications.<br>
