My two main toons on Karana are Zymyool, a level 37 Chanter and Draglorvin, a level 45 Warrior.  I am an officer and the webmaster for The Ancient Adventurers, a guild that was formed for older players ( RL age ) on Karana.  Grams, a soon-to-be-level 47 Cleric, is our Guild Leader - you can most likely find her in DL handing out cookies.<br>
<br>
Our Guild will most likely be joining the KCoG very soon, and because of this, I am interested in learning as much as I can about the Council.  I've read a lot of posts here that have given me some insights, and I know some of the members from in-game experiences, and if most of the KCoG are like the ones I know, it will be an honor to associate with all of you.<br>
<br>
Now, for my questions.<br>
<br>
I have followed a few of your raids from afar by keeping in constant touch with some of the raid members.  I've read tons and tons of information about raids, from the &quot;easy&quot; dragons ( Vox / Naggy ) up to the end-game mobs, soaking up a vast amount of information such as pulling / clearing strategies, boss-mob encounter strategies, and even TRW ( total raid wipe ) recovery strategies.  Most of the information I have gleaned is from serious guilds that are serious about there raids - everyone has a job and they execute that job, almost like a military unit.<br>
<br>
I've wondered how a KCoG raid could survive POH / POF / Naggy / Vox, etc. with some of the people I see in EQ these days - the ones that I have no problems with labeling &quot;Idiots&quot;.  I'm sure you know the type that I am referring to.<br>
<br>
What does the KCoG do to the people who disrupt raids by challenging raid leadership, who get others killed with their childish antics, who spout garbage in open channels, who whine because not everything is exactly the way that want it, etc?  Do they get one warning and then forever banned from KCoG events?  Does the Guild Leader get a transcript of the problem from someone's log so they can deal with the problem?  Does it just annoy everyone, ranted about in the forums, and not get dealt with?<br>
<br>
I am -very- interested in attending KCoG raids in the future, but if these types of people are allowed to disrupt the raids, I may have to reconsider.  I've read about a recent Naggy raid that seemed to have some problems along these lines, even though the raid was in very capable hands.  Do the people that cause the problems get dealt with, or do they just get griped about in the forums until people forget about the incident(s)?<br>
<br>
I am very excited about meeting all of you in the upcoming months, and wish you well on your next couple of raids, which I won't be able to attend for various reasons.  Good luck on them, and be safe!<br>

Back when I was leading the dragon raids, I would make a note of people who were particularly obnoxious, and simply not allow them on future raids.  On occasion, when someone was being extremely disruptive, I would either not allow them to roll on items, or ask them to leave the raid in progress... but that was pretty rare for me.<br>
<br>
Other leaders have taken a &quot;Three-strikes&quot; approach (sometimes &quot;Two-strikes&quot;) - meaning you get a warning or two, and then you are gone.<br>
<br>
On dragon raids, the actions of a single person rarely result in mass deaths (well... I'm sure some people remember a case where a certain Paladin caused quite a number of deaths... but we don't talk about that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  On plane raids, however, a single person doing something as simple as sitting down at the wrong time can result in EVERYONE dying... so it doesn't even take a person <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>actively</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> trying to cause problems, only someone not paying enough attention.  I'd probably be a lot more likely to boot people immediatly on a plane raid... but it really does depend on the leader.<br>
<br>
In general, at least from my experience, people that come to KCoG raids tend to be pretty decent folks.  Sure, you'll get trouble makers from time to time, but ultimately they tend to do themselves more harm than anyone else.  It can get awefully hard to play the game when you get a bad reputation with a large number of guilds... <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

<br>
My name is Destructress Fyrestarter, and i am currently leading KCoG Planes raids...   <br>
<br>
 so far i have not had a problem with Discipline... having to be a higher level to enter the planes,  the people tend to be more mature as a player, and know what they are getting into requires alot of effort.<br>
<br>
Also, most of the KCoG members know that we are not loot based.  90% of the people come expecting to die, and expecting NOT to get anything, expecting the raid to go a little slower then the big uber guilds....<br>
........ and when you come with these expectations, you can just hang out, have a good time, kill some baddies, and, if everything goes well,  live and get a little something, maybe just a gem, or something to sell for a little pp, and sometimes good loot.<br>
<br>
the most importaint thing i have gotton out of KCoG, is screenshots and memories....  fun times...learning... the experance in eq where your level doesnt go up, but your satisfaction.... getting to know poeple, getting to know who are the good people, and learning who needs a hard kick in the arse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
as far as who leads raids?   i dont know... Kellory was the KCoG planes raid leader for a while.... he did a great job, and i learned alot from him...<br>
<br>
but he had not  lead them for a while.. and i looked into how to do it, asked questions, and blindly jumped into the drivers seat....<br>
<br>
luckly for me i have had some very wonderful people help me in the background.. they know who they are, and the people that go onthe raids know who they are...  they support KCoG , not me personally ( allthough i have made some great friends). <br>
<br>
I enjoy leading Planes raids, but im limited to sundays and some weekdays...  fridays and saturdays are pretty much out of the question...   I like to do a raid every two weeks.. but sometimes will have to skip a week....<br>
<br>
KCoG is a 'open' allience .. meaning, we are allied with every guild on the server...  but the purpose of KCoG is to help the small guild, to help them grow, to learn, to give them a stepping stone, so to speak....<br>
<br>
...i know someday Children of Disorder (my guild *hugs*) will be large enuf to do our own planes dragons and other large target raids.. at which point i will step down as raid leader... but i will ALLWAYS be here to support KCoG, just as my predecessors have ....<br>
<br>
Even Haemish, god bless his soul, who play DAoC exclusivly, comes and checks on us and keeps this web site alive for everyone who wants to use it ... *cheers*<br>
<br>
all in all, and not to sound korny, KCoG is Karana Servers best hope to keep the game fun and  to help us all remember,,,, everyone starts at level 1.<br>

I found a young lady who needed Heady Kiolas for Wu's and brewed her 20 stacks ( click click click ) for 2k ( she offered, who am I to turn it down? ) so now I can afford some resist gear for some raids!  I bought a RBF, some diamonds, and am looking for a Froggy crown, at which time I'll be ready.<br>
<br>
Then again, I'm -sure- Destructress will let me slip in if I'm a few points short - after all, my group ( Ughhies, Nightingael, your Guildie Rhapper, Zibz, Jstinssiskar, Draglorvin ) did Rez ya in Kaesora that day...  =)  Okay, maybe not.  *sigh*  I'll get them up to the minimums.<br>
<br>
My normal group ( see members above ) won't be meeting for the next two weeks, so if you see me on and need a soon-to-be 46 WAR or a 37 ENC, give me a shout.<br>
