<br>
A little late getting going as we had to wait for some extra people to show up as we didn't have quite enough that I felt comforatable to engage with. Once I saw several people zone in I started making groups and sent support in.<br>
<br>
Only one death on the way to the Spiders room and rarely anyone got lost which was awesome! By the time we got to the spider room and rezzed the one death, support was already ready for us to move to the throne room. We were only there about 5 minutes and the lair was pulled and buffline was ready to be setup.<br>
<br>
I have to say Support and Buffline were Awesome!! A big thanks to Gialla (Buffline) and Kumaelyon (Support leader). Superb job! Thanks to Garrbut as being our only Shaman once again and I know it's very late for you and we can't thank you enough.<br>
<br>
Engagement was a little hairy - by the time I got in, Nagafen was in the lava next to the bridge (a very bad thing!) The MA's cleric went LD and the MA dropped very quickly. Well this ranger was soon on Nagafen's lunch list. I couldn't get rid of his agro and he summoned me into the lava and started chomping on me. Well just before I died, I called out for Nukers to engage. The rest I have no idea as I was playing cards with Soulbinder Nera. Nagafen did go down and the melee did manage to get him out of the lava.<br>
<br>
Just to note - on wave one all Paladins, Warriors, and Bards engage and Pull Nagafen to his lair. He may run at you but you need to keep going  all the way into his lair - do not fight on the bridge!<br>
<br>
Other than that, was a fantastic raid. I am simply impressed lately at raid discipline and I thank everyone who helped very much!<br>

Only shammy. Again. I have never been on a Naggy raid with another shammy ever. Not that im complaning...if i am the only shaman and a shaman only item drops then im happy ) - like it did hehehe. T'was a great raid took less than half as much time as the previous one. Probably due to the fact that this time i actually managed to slow alot of the FG's. Naggy took some time i think - the initial wave went in but i had visioned Qamgine who was in wave 2 so i didnt see how Naggy got onto the bridge but when i saw him i visioned him hehe. When he was on bridge i know alot of people died - including Glenfenin. i think Naggy followed a feared person into the lava which is how he got there but he was got out and seemed to hop about the lair a bit before dying at the door. He died almost exactly 3 hours after the scheduled start time and we started late so was very good. Some notes to umm...note are than the shammy HoS doesnt stack with druid str. You must be in melee range to hit Naggy with a nuke - some people didnt seem to know this. Thanks for my new hammer : Blight, Hammer of the Scourge. Ill enjoy it. <br>

There were two keys to this: First, the support didn't bother to go back to escort the raiders in Sol B. Instead we just kept chewing through the giants. Kuma did a fantastic job splitting all the giants (on the previous raid we had to rely on more CC from bards/chanters which required borrowing a few raiders). Unfortunately, Kuma will likely be 53+ on the next dragon -- we will miss his lair pulling skill.<br>
<br>
The buffline went reasonably well as we had lots of bards for mana regen (although I missed one of the bards in the raid -- sorry). We could have used another high level chanter and cleric.  We also had an issue with buffers going LD but I'll be more ready for this next time (I'll hopefully have an extra druid from the support team that I can drop in to fill in for an LD buffer).<br>
<br>
We got unlucky with Naggy coming down to the bridge but I've seen it happen a few times now. I think it's partly due to lack of experienced people charging the lair -- I remember the first time I charged the lair I paused on the bridge when I saw the big red dragon come forward at me. If you are in the first wave in it's imperative to get to that room where Naggy normally waits.<br>
<br>
Only annoyance of the night were the spam rolls during the loot distribution. But that always seems to happen...  <p>[58 Troubador] Gialla (Unknown) &lt;Souls of the Valiant&gt;<br>
