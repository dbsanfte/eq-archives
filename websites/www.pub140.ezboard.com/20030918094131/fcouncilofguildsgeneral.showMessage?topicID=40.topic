I would love to see a continuing thread here where everyone can share their experiences and advice on how certain classes should play in a certain group constellation at a certain zone.  <br>

As an example, going into Kedge Keep, 2nd floor (or any underwater dungeon) what type of group with what strategies could pull it off?  <br>

Keep talking, always tell your group what you are doing if they can't see you. If you are pulling or exploring, let them know, if you are medding, make sure they know. Keeps the likelihood of someone being caught unawares down, either from getting hit with an errant pull, or no mana, etc. It also helps to keep the chatter up to keep the group friendly. I've been in many groups that just don't talk, even when I throw some one-liners in there as well. Get to know your hunting companions (if they aren't friends or guild members) and you can find out if they will cover your back or head for the zone at first sign of trouble. <br>
<br>
As for warriors/tanks, cover the retreat in a running evac situation. You have the hit points, and if you are down low enough that you can't cover the retreat, you should already be zoning, because once you are gone, your casters will die soon after. Casters run when the puller or group leader realizes it's a bad situation (or teleport the group out if you have that capability). Don't hang around to get stunned, hoof it with the rest of the group, maybe tossing a spell or two to allow the person covering the retreat the breathing room to get out as well. <br>
<br>
And if you are in Kedge Keep, make sure the person who cast enduring breath is still there to cast it again when needed. <br>

This is my perspective from the here and now:<br>
<br>
When you join a group, *ask* who is the Primary healer, the secondary healer, the puller and the primary tank. If the people in the group don't know the answers to those questions, leave the group. I am not joking. Turn and go. If you really really want to stay, then take control and organize the group. I am warning you tho, they probably won't listen and you probably will die.<br>
<br>
<br>
The primary healer: Heals .. that is all. He does not melee, swinging his or her feeble mace like a flea itching an elephant, he does not cast DD or DOT; the primary healer sits down during the fight and stands up only to heal. Anticipate the 3rd bubble of life and heal as the level crosses over it. Don't wait until your tanks are down to 2 bubbs, heal as they enter 3 bubbs. If something unforseen happens, and your tank is at two <br>
<br>
bubbs you will never heal in time and a Paladin will have to blow LoH to save someone you should have been healing. When you have TWO G Heals left in you, call LOM (low on mana) to let your secondary healer know it's time for them to take over. Sit down and med. Do not run up to the mob and start flailing away in a pitiful, ineffective fashion. You MIGHT do 100pts of dmg over the course of a whole fight, your tank is doing <br>
that amount per ROUND. Sit down and do your own job. An excellent secondary task for the Prime Healer is <br>
watching for wandering mobs coming in to spoil your day. If you see one, yell it a LOT; tell the tanks to pull the mob out of the path of the wanderer. Lastly, heal from a distance. Hate List is distance-dependent. the farther you are from the mob, the less impact your actions have. If you stand next to a mob and heal the <br>
tanks, you go right to the top of the hate list. Stand back near max heal range and heal and I can assure you that very seldom will a mob agro on you unless you are healing way too fast.<br>
<br>
<br>
The secondary healer: Works their defensive and offensive magic until they have two bubbs of mana left, and then RESERVES those two bubbs for healing. Also, if the primary healer is not careful, their heals will pull a mob off of the tanks and onto themselves. It is the secondary healer's job to KEEP the primary healer alive while he or she is being pummelled, until the tanks can regain control of the mob. Damage shield the tanks, <br>
do your DOT or DD but reserve the proper mana for heals, and watch for the LOM signal from the primary. Also watch for the ON ME call from the primary, which is yelled when a mob is on them, and they can not heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
The puller: can make or break a party. If your puller is an overanxious nitwit with the attention span of a 10 year old after a case of Pixie Sticks who is hell bent on killing you all by ignoring the pleas of the casters that they are LOM or OOM then tell him point blank to sit down, or he is leaving the group. The puller in a group is NOT the person who is tired of sitting around and wants some exp NOW, this person is very <br>
dangerous and in their blind haste will kill you all and then blame you for not keeping him healed. You have <br>
all been there, and I hope you have the will to not go there again by telling this person to stop. A good puller is a highly skilled individual, who can gauge the strength of the party and that of the mobs and pull the appropriate mob for the situation; harder mobs for a party which is FM and rested, and easier mobs for parties which are combat ready but not at their full power. Primary healer will have the puller targetted as <br>
they return IN CASE they seriously need a heal. Dont' heal if it's not serious, since a heal this early will pull <br>
the mob to the healer in a heartbeat. As a puller, wait for the right moment to pull. If your party can not handle two mobs then WAIT until there is only one mob which can agro on you. This is not a race to see who can pull (read 'die') the fastest; your party is counting on you to safely pull for them at a decent rate. <br>
When the puller arrives back at the group, run behind the tanks and stand there. DO NOT squeeal and run in <br>
circles like a little greased piggy. Stand there and take the beating until the tanks gain control over the mob. The healers will keep you alive if you have allowed them to have mana by pulling at a proper rate. btw, this is why healers DONT PULL. It helps if the person pulling can track ... and a puller really should not be <br>
running right up to a mob and cracking him in the shin to get his attention. Bow pull or stun pull .. snare pull .. shuriken, whatever .. get the mob's attention from a distance. Let the party know you have incoming. CASTERS do not stand up on Incoming unless you are FM. Sit there and med until the mob actually arrives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Main Tank: is the person which does the most damage a round and is hopefully prepared to take the most damage. If you are swinging dual Ykeshas and your taunt skill is 200 you have to know that a mob is going to want YOU dead dead dead. You are his personal demon and he will do his damndest to kill you. It helps a party greatly if one person is taking most of the damage. The healers can concentrate on this one person <br>
and easily keep that person alive if their AC is high enough for the job. If you have a caster in your party who likes to stand up close and DD and melee then that person is WASTING your heal power because he or she does not have the armor class rating to be up there and will take astounding damage and effort to keep him alive. The main tank will stop taunting and kicking if they reach two bubbs of life. This will hopefully <br>
allow another tank who is healthier to take over as the main target. This is referred to as &quot;bouncing&quot; a mob. When you are low on hitpoints, back off a little and let another tank take control of the mob as the healers take care of you. If you are a healing-class tank like a Paladin, then learn to heal yourself or others while  in combat. Bounce the mob to another tank, step back a little and cast heal then rejoin combat. Do this only in emergencies. If the tanks have to take time to heal, the situation is very grim. Its very important to assist the main tank. If possible everyone should be working on the SAME mob at once. Use the /assist command, targetted on your main tank. <br>
<br>
<br>
Casters: stand back and cast at an appropriate rate. Do not cast too fast, or you will be agro'd on. Do not stand close to the mob and cast while poking it with your stupid little dagger, then when you agro the mob run away off into the distance and die. How many casters have I seen do this. How many stars are in the sky. If you want to be a tank, then start a warrior.<br>
<br>
you are a bomber airplane high in the sky dropping devastating blows onto your target, but if you take a few hits then down you go in flames. Stay at max casting range to minimize your affect on the hate list. Do not run out of healing range, do not train the healer with the mob when it comes after you. bring it TO the tanks then stand there. Let the tanks get the mob back. The healers will keep you alive. Dangerous situation? YES so DONT GET INTO IT. Stand back, meter your casting at an appropriate pace. <br>
<br>
&quot;Caster says, 'HEY I died again! Why didnt you heal me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Healer says, &quot;Hmm .. after you cast on the mob like a monkey with a machine gun, you ran out of healing range. I would say you died because you are an ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Enchanter stuff: Enchanters can save you. If the puller brings too many or a wandering mob jumps your party during combat the enchanter can remove these mobs from the picture by mezmerizing them. Do not attack mezmerized mobs or agro them with AOE spells or DOTs. When the main tank turns to the mezmerized mobs, again, assist him or her. Before attacking a Mez'd mob, taunt it a lot. Because the mob is mezed he is very very angry at the Enchanter. if you DO NOT taunt first, the mob will instanly jump all over the enchanter instead of the tanks.<br>

In general, the guide looks ok, but here's my take on it:<br>
<br>
- Dots:  Don't bother using this on a blue mobs if you have 2+ tanks in your group. Simply not efficient.  <br>
<br>
- Pack Regen: If you have 2 or less tanks in your group, I would rather use normal regen since it lasts double the time.  Only use Pack Regen if you see more than the tanks hurt on a regular basis<br>
<br>
- SLD for all: I am really curious if the person who wrote the guide is constantly below 50 mana...I for one find it more resourceful to keep it only on the tanks if you are the only healer.  Better yet, get a cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Other casters should be smart enough to not to get hit too much, and to use 200 mana on all members to account for one possible situation does not seem a good use of mana (better to keep enough mana to snare / root and maybe even blast the mob away from the fragile caster.<br>

And they can ONLY be pulled if communication is working...<br>
<br>
Pulling:  It's not always the best idea to let the tank pull.  Seen a couple of situations in Rathe where it is definitely better to have a tracker &amp; snarer pull, and if there is no ranger, what's left? Right, a druid or bard.  I've seen tanks with minimal Rathe experience get beaten badly, even with SOW.  Same thing with Oggok, if the tank does not know the spawn pattern at all but you do, make sure to explain &amp; show it and pull a couple first to demonstrate.  Letting any zone newbie loose in a area where spawns wander around freely is a surefire way to get your group more than just one or two mobs.  Also, if your shaman is level 50 and your tank is level 40, you may want to reconsider your standard pulling strategy, especially if the shaman is an iksar or troll. (ok, this one's a &quot;Doh&quot;, sorry ))<br>
<br>
Taunting: This might be another &quot;Doh&quot;, but I just had the chance to try it out recently and am still quite astonished at how well &quot;Blinding Flash&quot; works as a taunting tool for Paladins.  So no more excuses like &quot;I couldn't taunt him off!&quot; .. )<br>
<br>
Roles:  Yup, know your role, but be also aware that you may have to exhibit some instant flexibility.  It's sometimes those flashes of creativity that saves the group's life.  A druid friend of mine had to evac once out of a kunark dungeon and landed in the Emerald Jungle with the Kunark-dungeon only evac.  Lo and behold, a big mob jumped on then at their arrival...what would you do?  Ok, the best thing would have been to mem only the evac you know best (I heard the first one, Succor: BB, has always the highest success rate, but it's not confirmed), but also be prepared to either yell at someone else to evacc or sit down and memm another one.  <br>

<br>
I don't know if there are just to few Bards or whether people just don't group with them as much at the lower levels. At my current 18th level I hear alot of 'I didn't know you could do that'.<br>
<br>
Bards are utility players, they can do a little of everything, just not as good or as fast.<br>
<br>
Here are my suggestions:<br>
<br>
1) No Enchanter in group - Bard can handle crowd control. He has a mezz song, same rules apply no DOT or DD. All melee types /assist puller. Healer watch the Bards health because as the MOB's break/resist the song they will pummel and stun the Bard till he can start the song again.<br>
<br>
2) Downtime Healing - Healers save your mana for the fight. Bards can handle downtime healing. At my current level of 18 I can heal everybody in the group 10 hp per flash. That is if they are close enough, sitting down and I have my mandolin equipped.<br>
<br>
3) Tank Buffs - Tanks coordinate with the Bard. The Bard has a strength buff + Haste song or an all around strength + dex + agility buff song. If you have weapons that proc you may want the dex + agility buff. I always ask the tanks their preference.<br>
<br>
4) Melee Bard - Bards can tank, sort of. I don't have taunt or the HP to do it for long but, in a pinch I can. Bards get dual wield and can wear plate armor.<br>
<br>
5) Twisting - When grouping with a Bard ask him how many songs he can keep going at once. Good Bards can keep 3 going at once. Thats a heal, strength buff and AC buff. A really good Bard can do that and equip the instrument for that song to give it a bonus. Some can even do 4 songs at once.<br>
<br>
Overall the message I have seen in this thread is to communicate. Let your group mates know what your doing and let them know what you can do too. If you know what you all are capable of, then you can use it to the best benefit.<br>

The subject of pulling is very much neglected. I am a 37 ranger and pull for 90% of the groups I've been with. Yes, communication is very important. I have found that it's a good idea to get a feel for the people that make up the group especially at the beginning of a hunt. I want to know the experience everyone has with the subject we're hunting. I want to know other things too such as: have you been here before, do you know how to get to the zone, don't run when attacked unless you're heading to the zone, one puller at a time, let me know if you're gonna log so I can find a replacement, if we keep cool heads under pressure we stand a good chance of living through a bad situation, etc., are just a few of the things a good puller wants to find out or discuss with group members. Communicating after a pull is important also, let your group know that they have 3 drolvarangs coming when they normally expect 1 and in the same way the group should let the puller know there's a pop or a critter that is in the return path of the puller.<br>
   Pulling is a major responsibility insofar as stupid pulls get people killed, while on the otherhand a good puller can make a great night for a group. Trust me, people remember you when they have gotten more exp from your pulls in one night than they have from the last 3 pullers put together.<br>
   An excellent puller knows his or her groups strengths and weaknesses. You must be able to the read the people behind the character also, not just the characters abilities but the way the characters are being played is vital in understanding how the group can handle various situations that arise. Rarely, are groups made up of the correct or best classes for the critter being hunted. There several reasons for this but most of the time its too few people available to group with at a particular time and therefore you have to do the best you can with what's at hand. The makeup of the group changes constantly when people need to log and you get new people this means that the puller must re-determine what the group is capable of and as a puller needs to make accurate decisions of group strength based on class, lvl, exp.<br>
   In closing: the best pullers are those that have an innate understanding of the capabilities of a group and an understanding of the needs and wants of a group.<br>

I have found that to be quite helpful because it gives me an idea what role to play for this particular pull and how many mana to preserve over the fight.  Simple, but very useful.<br>

If I'm doing my job properly as a puller, I should only bring one back with me.  In those cases where I know multiples are coming back (and I usually do), I let the group know before I make the pull.  This leaves me with a couple remaining situations:<br>
<br>
1) I have to pull back in such a way I cannot avoid a newly spawned mob in the return path.  Pulling in Oggok, this often happens.  By this time, I've already told the group 'inc'.  My concern (since saying multiple 'inc's is not standard) would be the group would think I'm confused.  Thus, I say 'Two' or 'Add'.<br>
<br>
2) I do not know I've picked up a second.  It doesn't happen often because I frequently turn around and fire an arrow at my target, but sometimes a second (or more) is added and I don't know.  Obviously, I can't let the group know there is another inc.<br>
<br>
It really boils down to communication.  If I am talking to my group, then I can minimize the shock of a bad pull on my part.  I've had many nights where it took me a bit to work out a good pulling strategy for the environment.  By keeping up with their status (mana, health, buffs, etc.) and letting them know what I'm planning to do, we can work out a solution to just about any type of pull aberation.<br>

<br>
Ideally, the puller will indicate the number of pulls or the any other information by typing, but I've seen also pullers that don't seem to be able to type well enough while running, so the multiple &quot;inc&quot; hot button would be better than no communication at all...provided someone in the group makes sure to communicate the meaning of multiple incs.  Overall,  I prefer as much communication and common agreements before the hunting starts.  It's often harder to communicate once the hunting starts.<br>
<br>
Oh yea, Jzonn, I've witnessed your pulling - you and Jann are just excellent, both in your planning and execution of your pulls.  But I wouldn't expect to find that level of quality in the average puller <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I still find that often the average tank still has to be reminded to say anything when they pull a mob.

I learned a lot of my techniques by reading the premier Ranger site, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/">The Ranger's Glade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Most of it came from OJT and watching other Rangers pull (sometimes I learned what not to do  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I also look at some of the other class sites and boards and get a feel for what they expect from a puller.  It's on an Enchanter board I first heard of multiple &quot;inc&quot;s.<br>
<br>
I'm still not what I would consider an expert puller.  I need to learn a lot about indoor pulling.  I'd rather let a FD class pull indoors, but I think I need to at least get a good knowledge of it.  Perhaps when I get a bit more experience, I can start learning in SolB or Karnor's (I don't care to do Guk). <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#004080">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;The Shrine Knights&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

Some say its boring but I LOVE being the primary healer...always.  As someone stated earlier, getting up to heal and thats it, no DD's or anything.  I agree that communication is VITAL to the success of any group and have seen too many times what happens when someone does not listen or does their job wrong.  I have never played a &quot;mage&quot; type before and had some questions.  It really bugs me when they say OOM and proceed to whip out the dagger and dive in....Why?  I don't even pretend to be a fighter, if your life depends on my melee skills, start running now because as soon as you do I will be right behind ya hehe<br>
Anyway, I have been in groups with VERY good leaders that put it in point blank terms...sit down and med, back off, you are making the Cleric waste mana on you, Aid the Cleric, etc etc.  This IMHO is fantastic and should be the norm rather than the exception. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=belcegaegwynsd>Belce Gaegwyn SD</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br>   <font color=#8E9173>(6/11/00 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pulling 101</span><hr size=1> Intially I thought that being a warrior would make me a great pull&gt; bow, hp's, ac, and magic resist.  What else is needed?  Well feign death really helps and so does tracking.  Enough to make me a secondary puller in most groups.  <br>
<br>
I have rethought my approach to being in a group and have concluded that warriors are the only class able to have more thann 1 pet, in fact we can have 5.  <br>
<br>
We sit at camp keeping the fragile soft pets safe while our other pet with the right skill set hunts.  They beat the woods or go down the burrows to find something for us all to kill.  <br>
<br>
It is important for a warrior to try and attract the right pets for the task at hand and in the right number.  Some types are good regardless of situation and some better for specific situations.  <br>
<br>
Enchanters and clerics are good for any situation really.  The enchanter can keep your caster pets drugged happily and the cleric is great for keeping you and your other pets alive, not to mention res for unwanted accidents when your pull pet does better than hoped.  Did I mention that warriors can have their pets come back?<br>
<br>
In outdoors nothing is better than a ranger pet or a druid pet.  Their track ability and spells are perfect for this.  Indoors a monk is truely outstanding, failing that a shadow knight can fill in with their feign death.  <br>
<br>
I think its a good idea to try to attract a pet that can help mix it up as well, a melee type of some sort is great to have.  One way to approach this is to join up with an other warrior, that way you only have to attract 2 pets and let the other bring theirs.  <br>
<br>
Any other class of pet that you add of this will greatly enhance your party.  Just keep in mind the different abilities and work with them and as a warrior you should do fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
[It should be noted that this is intended as humour.  I would nver actually consider other players in this way.]<br>

The area lull can not be twisted and after lvl 30 is less than reliable on green mobs even so its pretty useless in most scenarios.<br>
Most important thing though is commo who has what job.

That being said, here's a few cents extra.<br>
<br>
If you have rangers and druids in your group but aren't snaring, get one that does <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
If you do pull multiple mobs and have an enchanter, it helps to STOP a short distance away and let the enchanter mez the extra 1 or 2 at a distance because when mobs are all stacked they tend to be mis-targeted or make the targeting job for the primary tank more difficult.<br>
<br>
Rogues hate bards. The song will disable the rogue's forte, the hide/sneak combo...mostly the hide part. Keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
Tank hybrids really need to use their spells as part of the package. Obviously sk/pallys dont have the same melee arsenal as other fighter classes and need to use their spells as taunts. DOTS, debuffs, stun all make handy accessories to the pally/sk line while snare does a decent taunt effect as well.<br>
<br>
Communication is a must.<br>
<br>
Another problem I see here is pacing. It goes hand in hand with nuking like a machine gun toting monkey...which is to view a mob as a PIECE of a chain of mobs instead of a FM to OOM mob. I've seen some casters treat each mob as if that mob needs to suck up about 50% of everyone's mana. Well, that means everyone gets to sit on their butts doing nothing. If you are a caster type and see that the group is relatively healthy to full health, but your blue is lacking, it means you are boring the hell out of the fighters who's job is to dish out the damage relatively cheap. I guess the simplest way of saying this is that you need to keep in mind and conserve enough mana for the occasion a new mob shows up and needs to be taken down. Evaccing/zoning is costly on time and morale, so keep enough to defeat multiple enemies instead of draining all effort on a single mob pull. <p>Deo<br>

<br>
Blind (Flash of Light) does come at a cost.  Blinding a mob that is not with in agro range of someone has a good chance of it running &quot;blindly&quot; away and training.  Also if a caster nukes right after you blind AND the mobs agro/runs after the caster it will run away rather then at the caster.
