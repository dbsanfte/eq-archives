<br>
You've seen them before; you know what they are.  They are the backbone of a successful raid - the Raid Channel.<br>
<br>
The Raid Channel is there to get information quickly where it needs to go.  Usually, it is instructions from the raid leader(s).  A lot of the time it is the MA telling the other melees when to attack.  Other times, it is the Crowd Control team telling the rabid melees who to stop attacking while they mez them ( if you're assisting correctly, you don't really need to pay attention to these ).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Raid Channel is also where people ask redundant questions.  Repetatively.  Over and over.  Ad Naseum.  It's also where people debate things.  Idle chatter also seeps into the Raid Channel.  These things do not belong in the raid channel.  They belong in the &quot;kcog&quot; channel.  Well, except the griping, finger pointing, etc.  That doesn't belong anywhere during the raid.<br>
<br>
Group leaders.  group Leaders.  group LEADERS.  Notice the second word -&gt; Leaders.  These are the people who the Raid Leader trusts, the people that have BeenThereDoneThat(tm), and the people that know the answers to almost all of your questions.  If you have a question, ask it in your group.  There's a very good chance you will get your answer that way.  If your group doesn't know the answer, guess what?  It's the group leader's responsibility to get the answer for you.  They know how to get your answer the correct way.  Trust them.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
&quot;Who is the MA?&quot;  This question should NEVER be heard in the Raid Channel.  One of the following things are going on:<br>
<br>
1) The Raid Leader hasn't selected one yet, so you CAN'T know<br>
2) The Raid Leader has announced one, and you missed it<br>
3) The Raid Leader has forgotten to announce it<br>
<br>
If it's (1), then the question is moot.  If it's (2), then your Group Leader or other group members will answer it for you.  If it's (3), your group leader will remind the Raid Leader to select one after you ask the question in group.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that most of the people that read these boards already know and typically abide by these things.  The biggest problem is random_warrior_01 or guild_cleric_03 that gets casually invited to the raid who doesn't know these things.  Guess what?  It's YOUR job to let them know these things if you invite them to the raid.  They won't know, otherwise, and do the most basic things wrong because you didn't school them on raid ettiquette / procedure / strategy.  There are writeups on these boards on each of the big raids I have attended.  If you are going, you need to read them and pass that info on to the people you invite.  Post a link to them in your guild's forums.<br>
<br>
The /assist [ma] thing has been beaten into the ground.  Unfortunately, for good reason.  We're dealing with characters whose average level exceeds 50 on these raids, typically.  There are still people who don't know how to assist.  It's mind-boggling to some, but it's true and has to be accepted as a fact.  Here's a way to make sure that everyone knows how to do it:<br>
<br>
If you are a group leader ( a position of leadership and knowledge bestowal ), after your group is announced, get your members in your group ASAP.  Have all your members make their assist keys right then, except substitute YOU ( the group leader ) for the MA in the hotkey.  Then, pick random targets and ask your group members individually to assist you and then tell you what you are targeting.  After you are confident their assist key works, have them change it to the MA ( if announced ).  If the MA isn't announced, as soon as they are, have them change it to the MA.  Then, have them test it ( send a tell to the MA to target something if you need to ).  Some of the names I see on the raids are not the easiest things to spell.  Test your assist key.  Test your secondary assist key the same way.  If every group leader forces their gorup to test their assist key, then at least everyone on the raid will have an assist key.  The only thing left is getting them to use it.<br>
<br>
Except for a few choice people ( like the crowd control team, MA, etc ), you should never use anything but your assist key to target the mob you are going to kill.  When do you hit it?  AFTER the MA calls for everyone to attack.  Don't hit it when the pull comes in.  Don't hit is right after random_mob_01 dies.  If the MA hasn't called for everyone to assist, then they still have the right to change targets.  If you are using F8, or your mouse, or any other way to target the mob you are going to attack, you are DOING IT WRONG.  You are JEAPORDIZING THE RAID.  That's not why you are there, and you don't want to be wrong or jeapordize the raid.  You want a successful raid, right?  Don't be a goat, Charlie Brown.<br>
<br>
On a raid like Hate, there will be unmezzable ( or mostly unmezzable ) mobs.  If one of these adds, the MA will switch to it.  There will usually be a call to switch targets.  If there isn't a call, it's up to you to know what mobs can't be mezzed so keep a lookout for any of these adding.  When they switch to it, your job is to:<br>
<br>
1) Turn off Autoattack<br>
2) Wait until the MA calls for the assist<br>
3) Hit your assist key<br>
4) Attack the mob<br>
<br>
If you don't wait for the MA to call for the assist, you have a chance of getting aggro.  What does that mean?  It means that mana is going to be wasted healing you.  When mana is wasted, that's that much less mana available when that &quot;OH HOLY CRAP!&quot; pull comes in.  It means you are not doing your job.  There's nothing special about getting aggro - anyone can do it.  It's nothing to be proud of, and possibly something to be ashamed of.<br>
<br>
There are times that you will get aggro from a multi-pull because the mob that hasn't been attacked runs into the camp and you are the closest Lunch-in-a-Shell the mob sees.  You will get attacked.  What do you do?  Well, you sure don't attack it back.  You let your healer heal you, you let your CC Team control the mob, and you wait for the MA to call for the assist, at which time you hit your assist key and start wailing away with the rest of the melees.  If the mob that is on you isn't controlled when the assist is called, and you know it backstabs, you may want to not turn your back to it.<br>
<br>
KCoG raids get more and more impressive as they go.  The way to keep raising the bar is to keep them organized.  The path to organization is knowledge.  When you have a raid of knowledgable, organized people, you have a POWERFUL force.  You have a force that will soon be able to join the channel &quot;kcogvs&quot; and =know= that the night is going to end well. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  on the Karana Server<br>

I guess the only thing I want to point out is the fact that due to a large number of people, the zone lag is pretty bad. I had to hit my assist key about 5 times before the target would popup in my assist window. Sometimes after mob would die, I would still be swinging and watching my hits finally scroll by. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Saw others standing there swinging with no mob either. In those times, people might be tempted to F8 or clicky target. That is bad. Just keep smashing your assist key, it will eventually pop up.<br>
<br>
One of the cool things I saw Farrn do last night was to make group leaders (ones who know what they are doing), then leave it up to the group leaders to find a balanced group. Not only did it take some stress off Farrn, but it helped things move a bit faster. I was able to find members and make my group in under 30 seconds. (Even if Yowl the Bard yelled for me to invite him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>

<br>
As an extention to what Qamgine brings up, its important to simply ride that assist key and not to do anything till you get the mob.<br>
<br>
Watch for commands.  I always use a seperate chat channel for raid commands so there's no excuse for not seeing them.  Change that chat channel to bright red if you must or pink or purple or whatever.  But I usually have a chat channel dedicated to commands.<br>
<br>
So that when an MA calls for a switch the result is immediate.  Its also why I try to put the MA along with the enchatner, so they can communicate within the group.<br>
<br>
If the lag is bad for you (as it is for most on these 70+ person raids) ride that assist key.  Keep hitting it till you get something.  Then check its health bar.  If its full do NOT attack till you start seeing it go down.<br>
<br>
Also dont attack till you see the MA call for the assists.  Never, ever, ever attack till then.  If the MA doesnt call it, you dont attack.  Ever.  If the MA dies because he forgot and ended up tanking the Dracoliche alone, then so be it.  The SA probably wont make the same mistake.<br>
<br>
Once the MA calls for the assist, double check what you see in your target box against what mob the MA called.  Lag as well as the MA having to cycle through mobs depending on what the enchanter tells him, can cause /assist to lie to you at first.  Try smacking it a few times even after you get the target up to make sure, and make sure the health on the target is dropping before engaging.<br>
<br>
Especially if you are using /raid there is no reason not to wait.  There's no xp to KS and no loot to ninja.  You get no points or bragging rights for getting the kill shot or most damage.  Especially if you have 70 people, the mob is going down.  And it will go down a lot faster if you are positive you are on the right target than if you screw up and break a mez or start too early and gain aggro and need heals which also cost mana that could have been used in a nuke.  Judgement and Wildfire do good damage.<br>
<br>
Personally I find it easier to simply make groups rather than let group leaders do it themselves.  I inevitably find the clerics distributed incorrectly and end up having to remake things anyway.  But then again, I have a fair bit of experience in making groups and it generally takes me less time to actually make them than to wait for people to make their own and then contact me with who is in them.<br>
<br>
It also allows for customization for efficency.<br>
<br>
Example, for me only the first 4 groups matter.  All the others consist of 1 tank, 1 healer (preferably a druid so they can port if necessary) and everyone else ad hoc and usually by level.  So group 14 tends to be the lowest levels and are often just a makeshift group till openings happen elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Within the first 4 groups, the first one is what I call my Command Group.  This consists of a tank as group leader (usually a decent ranger or paladin) and the puller as well as a cleric if possible and another druid if not.  The other 2 slots (since I place myself in this group as well) are random people.<br>
<br>
This allows for close communication between myself and the puller.  We need to be on the same page as the Raid Leader generally has a better idea of the status of the raid than the puller.  Or should.<br>
<br>
The second group is my Main Assist group which consists of the MA, and best cleric in the raid, and the enchanter.  I usually put a second cleric (usually possible only on Hate raids) or a druid.  The rest of it consists of at least 1 other tank (preferably a paladin for additional spot heals) and the SECONDARY shaman if I'm blesssed to have more than 1.  If there is no druid the last slot is always a wizard for evacs.  If I am blessed to have a bard he always takes the place of the second tank in this group.  Also, a high level necro goes here in place of the wizard if I have both one and a druid to secondary heal.<br>
<br>
The third group is my SA group.  Please note, its an odd number, this is important for later.  It consists of the SA, my second best cleric, and my main shaman.  Assuming I even have one.  I also try to keep a second cleric or druid here.  The other slots are random except again I have a wizard here if no druid for evacs.<br>
<br>
The 4th group consists of my 4th best tank and a 3rd cleric if possible.  Otherwise a druid/shaman or druid/druid combo will suffice.  The rest of the slots are random.  <br>
<br>
Note, while ideally I'd have at least 4 clerics so I can slip one in each of the 4 main groups, only the second and third groups really need them.  And even the third doesnt necessarily need them if your good.<br>
<br>
Also note, you only evac in Fear for breaks if something goes wrong.  Once the break is accomplished you can redistribute the wizards wherever.<br>
<br>
The rest of the groups are pretty much random.  Except that I try to put my 3th best tank in group 5.  And I try to keep a healer of some sort in each of them.<br>
<br>
The reason my 3rd best tank doesnt go into group 4 is double.<br>
<br>
First off, I usually only break Fear and Hate with a max of 4 groups.  This gives me an experienced and good tank who remains safe and intact to lead a second wave if necessary.<br>
<br>
Also, sometimes it becomes necessary on trains to have both the MA and SA choose and fight different targets.  When this happens I have even groups assist the MA (since he is group 2 they assist themselves) and odd groups assisting the SA.  Thus group 4 with the 4th best tank will assist the MA whereas the 5th group with the 3rd best tank will assist the MA.  This gives a good balance of tankage in case the MA or SA goes down.<br>
<br>
The ability to customize based upon experiance to me outweights the hassles of actually having to make groups.  Note, this remains a good tactic for alliances and guilds that work well together and communicate well.  But I find KCoG is simply to random for this to work out well.<br>
<br>
Often my MA is based upon ability and my confidence on them rather than level and class.  I've related a level 60 warrior with his epics to leading group 4 and had a level 60 Ranger as MA.  Dont attempt this tactic against VS though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The second and third groups are fairly complex to make and actual makeup does sort of depend on who is there.  But its vital that some classes like bards and necro's end up in the groups that will make the most use of them for mana and hps regen.<br>
<br>
Now you could make the argument that with 70+ people it doesnt really make a difference.  And thats true.<br>
<br>
But doing it yourself and putting things together carefullly can be the difference between doing the plane in 4 hours and walking out and taking 8 hours and porting out.<br>
<br>
Now I grant you that each raid leader does things their own way and its important that they do what works for them as opposed to what someone else tells them is the &quot;right&quot; way.  But I havent seen much in the way of taling about group makeup and I've found that to be one of the most important duties of a Raid Leader.  However you do it, how your groups are made up and how they function togehter is generally the difference between taking the 4 hours or 8.<br>
<br>
The one thing I have to emphasize is that the Raid Leader must lead.  They cannot be doing anything else.  They cannot be a healer or mez'er or main tank.  They must stand back and simply watch and keep an eye on things.  Its hard to juggle groups, mana status, hit point status, mob status, as well as tells and commands, if you are also fighting.<br>
<br>
It is so easy to lose track of things when you are fighting that you miss an add that takes down a cleric or enchanter and by the time the group reports this its too late and your facing a wipeout when you could have orded a target switch or evac if necessary and saved most people.<br>
<br>
Believe me, this is one of the hardest things any Raid Leader can do.  I think to a large extent all of us who do this are control freaks.  But especially on plane raids there's simply too much going on.  You need to step back and be a General instead of a captain or colonel.  It sort of sucks to stand back while others are killing and doing &quot;important&quot; stuff.  But you do owe it to the raid and their time and xp to be above that and actually lead.<br>
<br>
With raids lasting 4-8 hours of constant combat, you need to stay as fresh and undistracted as possible.<br>
<br>
Also for us caster raid leaders, casting means using mana which means sitting which means increased aggro which means the potential for a mob homing in on you and killing you.  And a dead Raid leader can all to easily mean a dead raid.<br>
<br>
Raid discipline isnt just making sure people are doing their jobs and assisting.  It also means making sure your raid leader is doing their job and enforcing the raid rules and keeping an eye on everything.<br>
<br>
Things are a bit easier today with increased armor and equipment.  But even so, the difference between a salvagable situation and a camp out or evac situation is often measured in seconds.  And its up to the raid leader to identify and make use of those seconds.  Even with DA there must remain sufficent tanks available to keep the mobs off the camping clerics, which is sometimes harder than it sounds.  And you've got seconds to decide if you should camp the cleric because your screwed (what do you mean Inny came with the Deathrot Knight!?) and whether you can make it if barely if you hang onto the cleric (Cool, Inny was just a ghost...too bad the Maestro wasnt).<br>
<br>
With all the things to keep in mind, its amazing how anyone has any fun at all.  But I've found that obeying the rules and working together often results in MORE fun than just doing your own thing.  Success has a sweet scent all its own. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
PS.  I'm not saying any KCoG raid leader doesnt lead.  Just that a) I've seen many that take on too many things or are watching the wrong things and b) its a good thing to keep in mind.  I've been warned by my own guild leader with guild suspension for not following my own advice on more than 1 occasion.<br>
<br>
Although its funniest when you get warned and then the next week your guild leader does the exact same thing.  I really live for moments like that.  I swear, I can see &quot;Doh!&quot; pop on top of his head...<br>

I generally have both the MT/MA and the puller, as well as my best cleric in the first group.  That way I can coordinate both pulls and also switches and things like that with him.  I just find it invaluable to have those two in MY group, as it eliminates a lot of the talking I have to do over raid channel which helps me a lot.  Second Group is generally my ST/SA group, and he will have a cleric in it as well.  I also try to have the slower in this group, and I like having paladins in both of my first groups as a lot of the time they can make last minute saves you weren't expecting.   &quot;MT GOING DOWN!  Oh wait, LoH!&quot;  I try to make groups 3 and 4 as balanced as possible, and after that I go in the same order of Tank, Healer, 4 others for the rest of the groups.  <br>
<br>
Last night was just overwhelming in the pure number of people that we had, and making balanced groups for all of them would have taken FAR TOO LONG.  So I went through my lists and picked people that I knew were good players and could make balanced groups and told them to do it.  It worked well, and while it may not have been ultra efficient neither would have been waiting for another 30-45 minutes for me to map out groups.  Also, in KCoG we tend to lose people steadily, so when consolidating efficiency of grouping really becomes moot quickly.<br>
<br>
But for the most part, I agree with about 90% of what you said Kellory, and the other 10% is just interpretation stuff.  Good writeup to both you and Zymyool.  I stickied it so hopefully more people will read it.  <br>
<br>
And one other very important thing as well.  No one should be sending me tells unless you are a group leader or I have given you specific permission to.  At one point I was recieving close to 15 tells/minute.  It was ridiculous.  Until I have assigned group leaders, no one should really be sending me tells, just ask in channel.  During the raid, only those group leaders should be sending me tells, and only then over important matters.  If you have a question ask your group leader, and if he can't answer it for whatever reason then HE will ask me.  Extra tells, even when I ignore them, are extra spam that I have to scroll through in order to get to the information that I need to have to prevent the raid from wiping.<br>
<br>
Another idea I have been playing with is to moderate the main raid channel so that only people given positions (MT, ST, Puller, Group Leaders, Loot Coordinator) in the raid can speak up in the channel.  I will probably be doing this my next planes raid just to see how it works. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

I moderated the channel to stop the spam. Unfortunately that is what you need to do. Moderate it and give voice only to those who need to speak there. All other chat should be directed to group or the chat channel.<br>
<br>
A note on sending tells. Don't! Yes, he knows you are there. How you ask? Well did you turn anon and role off? Did you turn LFG on? That's how the RL makes groups.<br>
<br>
Also, just to tie in a few points. There is usually a designated spammer. They are usually spamming the same thing over and over. In both channels. (When I spam I throw a /ooc to tell people to join the raid channel.) If you don't know what you are supposed to do (it's okay not to know) send them a tell. They are more than happy to help. Their job is to relay information to you.<br>
<br>
Ignorance is okay, at times. We know that not everyone trolls these boards like a certain ranger (/me wonders who I am talking about) and some have actual lives. But! If you don't be quite and listen, you will miss some information that you need! Have a question? Ask. But, also pay attention, because that question may have been answered in the chat channel five times already.<br>
<br>
Zym is correct, your group leader will most likely have some foreknowledge of what is going on. (Zym was in my group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I reiterated everything that was said and answered any questions I could. It's okay to not know what spells to have up. Ask. It's okay to not know when you should cast. Ask. If the GL doesn't know, they will find out.<br>
<br>
So to recap<br>
1) Listen - Very Important Rule.<br>
2) Ask Questions of your group leader, chat channel, or Spammers<br>
3) Don't send RL tells, it only makes the long wait longer.<br>
4) Turn LFG on and Anon and Role off. Otherwise you wont get a group. <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>
