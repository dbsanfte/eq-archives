There's been some questions asked about who can attend a CoG plane raid and all that.  Well, the answer is kind of difficult and probably will change if someone else is running these things later, so bear in mind that this is my personal policy only.<br>
<br>
Everyone who wants to go can.<br>
<br>
Okay, that was kinda simple.  But there are a few exceptions to this.  Offically the KGC, which is the Karana Guild Central board does not really care if people from planes capable guilds attend someone else's raid or not.  The reasoning is that when you sign up for a plane day, it is your day to do with as you wish.  You can choose to kill everything in the plane, or you can choose not to even go and take a fail.  Its totally up to the guild going, and as such if that guild wants to give out loot to people from other guilds so be it.  However, the exception to this rule is that the original guild/alliance which signed up for the raid must be able to show that they alone, without guests, can break and hold the plane on their own.<br>
<br>
Now how does KCoG fit in.  Frankly I dont see these raids about loot.  If you want to have a chance at good planes loot, join a guild that has a table loot system or only takes a limited number of people up.  A KCoG plane raid, or any raid for that matter that I run, is about having fun and the experience of doing something new.  Loot should be a secondary consideration.  As a result I will try to take the maximum number of people up that I can without risking the raid or risking a zone crash.  Hence if you are from a planes capable guild or alliance your more than welcome to come along.<br>
<br>
However, in the case of us getting simply too many people, then some cuts might have to be made.  My criteria would be that the people who are from planes capable guilds that walk in would be the first to be cut.  Next would be players from planes capable guilds that signed up.  Within those 2 catagories I would probably weed out the officers first.  While I would agree that the officers of these guilds are argurably the most experienced people, I would suggest that with the rank of officer comes the responsibility of stepping down in favor of a regular member.  If you are wondering if you are part of a guild/alliance that would be cut, my criteria there would be as follows.  If your guild/alliance is part of the CT rotation, you'll be the first to go.  Next would be those part of the Trak rotation followed by those on the Kunark outdoor dragon rotation in order of difficulty.  This would be followed by those guilds/alliances on the VS rotation and finally those on the Vox/Naggy rotation.  I will be using the highest rotation your guild/alliance is on to determine the triage.  So just because your guild does planes raids will not disqualify you.  Nor are numbers necessarily a factor.  I will take up simply as many as I can.  We are going for the fun and the experience, not just for the loot.  Now before anyone gets to rampaging on this, I would remind everyone that any cuts made to the raid are very rare.  Very few people, if any, are ever asked to voluntarily leave a CoG plane raid.  So dont let this deter you from signing up.<br>
<br>
Now then.  One thing I would ask for those who may be part of guilds/alliances that do the Planes on a regular basis.  If you do not really need a piece of armor please consider not rolling for it.  Many people who go will not have another chance later next week at these pieces.  So please think of them before rolling.  I would further mention that abuse of this by double dipping will result in me changing this policy.  This is an idealized policy that I hope will work.  But that will depend on everyone working together.   <br>
<br>
Epic Drops.  Well, this isnt much of a consideration since its pretty rare that KCoG gets one.  But, lets open this can of worms now eh?  My first impulse would be to restrict rolling for these items, either to get them or the chance to turn in an item to trigger a spawn.  And restrict them to those people going who are from guilds/alliances that are not planes capable.  This would be a restriction to the you bled you roll rule.  Which is why I'm not making it offical yet, just soliciting opinions.  My reasoning for this is that those people from non planes capable guilds and alliances probably will never have a chance to get these items outside of a KCoG plane raid without changing guilds.  Guild switching for material gain is something that I would like to frown on and this is one way, from my thinking, to help prevent that.  Please note, this policy in no way helps me personally since none of my epic items come from the Planes.   Anyway, I can see how players from Planes capable guilds might feel left out about this.  But I do think its pretty fair.  Anyway, feel free to submit your thoughts on this below.  This is not going to be in effect for this first Hate raid since it would require a change to the loot policy that is already posted.  Any changes would affect future raids.<br>

The only caveat is that I'd deem having a successful raid as more important than excluding guilds/alliances already doing planes... but the fact that we don't take a limited number in (short of zone crashing kinds of numbers) would suggest that, in the event we're actually forced to turn people away, we have plenty of people to ensure success.<br>
<br>
As for epic drops... I'm kind of torn.  The part of me that would some day really like to wield my very own Fiery Defender says that restricting epic drops to people who don't do planes outside of CoG raids sounds downright seductive. However, I don't know if I really like the idea of opening the door on guild-restricted rolls on CoG raids for any kind of drop, much less the really rare ones.  Let me rattle off a couple thoughts about that:<br>
<br>
If you are in a guild that does not do planes other than CoG raids, honestly, what are the chances of your being able to gather the forces required to complete an epic weapon?  Very small, I would say.  I can't think of a single epic quest that can be completed without killing mobs that CoG does not currently engage on any of our &quot;normal&quot; raids.  Every epic quest I've looked into requires killing at least one or more mobs that would need to be a specifically targeted raid.  My own requires killing the Keeper of Tombs in the Hole, and some 60+ Dark elf in Kithicor.  I'm not likely to do either of those by random chance.<br>
<br>
Now, if CoG starts doing targeted epic-raids (ie, raids who's goal is to get a specific person an epic weapon or part of their quest), I'd definitely be all for restricting epic drops to &quot;CoG-only&quot; members... but that would mean CoG is moving closer to being a more formal kind of alliance...  I can't say it isn't something I'd like to see in some ways... but let's just say I'm not holding my breath.  The idea of being able to gather enough people to, say, kill Queen Velazul Di'zok (and most likely kill her multiple times) just to help one specific (pre-detirmined) person get one piece of their warrior epic... maybe I'm being overly pessimistic, but I can't see that happening very often. I'd probably jump at the chance to go on a raid like that the first few times... just to see stuff I hadn't seen before... but how many of us would be willing to bleed and die over and over again, for people we don't know personally, when we know there's nothing in it for us?<br>
<br>
So, I guess my thoughts are sort of based on this idea:  if you really want your epic weapon, you should probably join a guild or alliance capable of getting it... the best CoG will tend to offer is a chance to get some of the smaller, and quite frankly, easier to get bits.  And, ultimately, Kellory is right: CoG raids shouldn't be about loot.  They should be about going places and seeing things you wouldn't otherwise get a chance to.  If you are just here for the ph@t l3wts, do yourself (and us) a favor and go join an uber-guild. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

<br>
Restrict the epic drops to non planes capable guilds. Lemme explain why.<br>
<br>
Now this varies from guild to guild based on their loot rules BUT every member of an uber guild or large alliance will and can have a chance at their epic at some point. There's no use getting anyone 2 so eventually everyone gets a chance if they exert themselves to try.<br>
<br>
 The people who have a much lessened chance are the people that go with CoG. Not only do they roll against eachother but against us, who already have the chance to win anyway. There are alot of scrubbers that would go with CoG only if they believed they would get a shot at that ultra rare uber piece. So eliminate them. Besides, just because a person's personal guild isn't big enough to help them with all the targets they need to kill doesn't mean they dont have friends that can.<br>
<br>
Kommi, you know better than most I'm at your beck and call for any help with your epic you need. Same with you Kell, so at the same time I would rather give you guys the chance to actually TRY for that epic than have someone snatch it out from under your nose.<br>
<br>
I'd strongly urge you against letting planes lvl people roll on it. I dont know if it goes against CoG's &quot;prime directive&quot; but CoG's point is to help eachother, not help everyone else (anyone mark the distinction here?) And yes, I am a member of an uber saying no, dont let us roll. I know how I felt about it before, I still feel the same if not stronger in that thought.<br>

<br>
The Sacred Band alliance often invites guests to our planes raids, friends of ours that we like having with us. However, we have recently enacted a policy whereby our guests do not roll on epic loot, only people in the alliance. The reason is that the epic quests require SO much effort, and a lot of that effort has to be directed by the guild/alliance, so in a sense, each epic is a guild quest. Sure, the epics can be done by anyone, but you better have a LOT of friends. I'd wager to say that most guilds/alliance that do the planes that allow guests on their raids, either won't let guests roll, or will only let them roll when none in the guild/alliance need that epic piece. <br>
<br>
The people in planes capable guilds will have their chances, they won't need the chances of people who are not in planes capable guilds. Lag is correct... remove the scrubbers who are just there to get their uber loot. Were I to go on one of these raids, I'd gladly give up any chance at epic loot. <br>
