We are now 5 for 5 and 5 in a row at killing dragons, and 3 for 3 on Vox. <br>
<br>
This raid did not begin well, nor did it end well. I got on at the appointed time and began getting the attendance numbers from my attendance officers, Mirithal of Illuminatus and Dogedme of Silver Daggers. Then about 15 minutes into it, I went Linkdead. Lo and behold, my ISP was being a female dog, and it took me almost an hour to return. When I had, luckily Dogedme, Mirithal and Cassia had decided that Dog should make the groups, which were ready to be announced when I got back on. This did however, have a negative effect, in that we had too many people. Without me there to stop the name taking and turn people away, we ended up with 11 full groups and a 12th group made up of stragglers. Not being in-game, I can't tell how many latecomers we did have, but it was too many. Only one person let me know that they would be late, Benolyen and I thank him for making sure we knew that he would be there a wee bit late. <br>
<br>
With groups made, we started zoning in and quickly took the king room. We made short work of the giants outside the lair and settled in at the gate. We pulled the last remaining hallway giants, and a group of pullers and myself ran up to the lair to outline our strategy for removing the giants from the lair itself without disturbing Vox. I made a mistake at this point, turning a corner and finding an icy terror right in front of me. Instead of pulling it back, I tried to fight it there, until Rbecka (our main assist) got force blasted into the pit. We had a few anxious moments which required us to duel and kill Belce so he could retrieve some coffins from the bank. Thanks to Fellea for summoning Rbekca's corpse. With her back, we began again. <br>
<br>
Our monk, Sylssyth ran in and pulled all the giants (took 2 pulls) and we cleared the lair without any further deaths. Sylssyth however had dropped in the pit and was not able to return until the fight with Vox. We then began the buffing line, which moved very fast for having 69 or so people. We did lose Bragnar into the pits at this time, and were not able to recover him until after the fight with Vox. With buffing done, the strategy outlined in the chat room, we logged back in and got ready for the charge. With a 3 2 1 GO GO GO, I led the mad rush into the lair. <br>
<br>
The fight was going well at first, as the tanks did their job, our magic and cold resists kept us alive and the casters came in at the right time. But somewhere along the way, Vox got REALLY pissed off at someone in the triage line. Vox continued to edge her way to the door, and finally she crawled up the wall and through it. Now most guilds who have failed her lately have done so because she gets stuck in the door and cannot be hit or cast upon. Knowing this, I and a few of the tanks rand outside and fought her in the triage hall. This dragon began slaying player after player, killing our healers 2 and 3 at a time. Then she began to run. I personally chased her as far as halfway to the gate room before she disappeared, with a few other players in tow. Luckily there were still raiders in the lair, and they quickly finished her off before she could complete heal. The death toll was somewhere around 30 players, but we had won!<br>
<br>
We had a LOT of corpses in the pit and a lot of impatient raiders. It took us awhile to get all the corpses out and I must thank Dogedme (who died 3 times recovering pit corpses), Cassia (1 death) and Darude (tped to Neriak for coffins) for recovering those bodies. I cannot stress how much patience is needed on this part of the raid, and many of us just didn't have that patience. When we finally got to lottos we had:<br>
<br>
2 Warhammers of Divine Grace - Shagth and Myette<br>
2 Dragon Bone Bracelets - Clephan and Nordicer?<br>
White Dragon Scale - Brisos<br>
<br>
Block of Permafrost - Haemish (and given to Belce)<br>
3 Cyrstalline Blades - Benolyen, Briyn and ? <br>
2 Symbols of Loyalty to Vox - Mirithal and ?<br>
<br>
I want to thank my management body: Dogedme, Cassia (buff line), Kaltor (loot man - first raid), Belce and Rbecka (assists), Mirithal, Zeol, Luolana, Baptismo, Lawman and a host of others I'll remember later. <br>

This was truly a great raid.  The compliments and comments I received about how well organized the raid was just go to show what an amazing leadership team you have assembled.  Congratulations to you all.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately it is the whiners and complainers that make the most noise, but believe me when I say that everybody there was impressed by the way that you lead an unbelievable number of players on that Vox raid.  Discipline was great although there seems to be problems that may never be solved: pushing giants through walls (didn't happen this time), and keeping Vox in her lair.  <br>
<br>
There were MANY people on that raid who had never been on a dragon raid, or never been on a Vox raid.  4 out of 6 people in my group were first-timers.  Your patience and ability to deal with all the problems this creates for raid leadership is simply amazing.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for another great SB/CoG victory.<br>

In the case of Vox over 66 individuals went.  Really you could do this with probablely 30 to 40 people.  We take so many people because the raid is supposed to provide an oppurtunity for those that can't do these events otherwise, we realize that lower numbers need people used to working with each other to be successful and to a certain extent we can't say no.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately people can slip through and not be included properly or at all.  This has never been done intentionally to anyone, ever. I understand your being upset when this happens and your disappointment, you want to go, you signed up and you made the time.<br>
<br>
It would seem to be necessary to point out some of the obstacles to doing these sorts of events.  They are as follows:<br>
Most people have not grouped with each other before<br>
Many have never done this particuliar event as yet<br>
We don't have an universial method of commnication that works well, just shout, ooc and say.<br>
The people do the organizing have only the little chat window to collect the information they need<br>
Everyone likes to, understandablely, do something while they wait.<br>
<br>
We can't respond to each person to acknowledge their presence and it is very possible that someone may be missed.  Recording people means fighting with a constantly scrolling chat window while recording peoples' names, after doing so the names are once more well up in your chat history.  <br>
<br>
I know when I have missed someone, the next time I remember and make an effort to insure they are not again overlooked.  So please, if you get missed on these remember its not your last chance ever and we do try our best.  Its another human behind that toon and is just as disappointed to have missed you as you were to be missed.  <br>

<br>
It was great, but it wasn't difficult to see that things didn't go as planned. I think we were a bit to many players, maybe 20 or so to many. Lottoing was a pain in the end, after the insane long time of corpse recovering! I mean, the chance of winning in that lotto was like 1 to 1.000.000. Btw, Slickone won one of the Dragon Bone Bracelets.<br>
<br>
It was a great raid for me indeed. However, I will appoint that the buffing line can be improved. Im not saying it was bad, but it can be improved. First, you should cast DMF as the first buff in line, preventing the death of some of players who don't know their way around the pits. This would have prevented the loss of Bragnar, and if the IG pullers had DMF, maybe they would have lived to. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't know if it was the chanter thinking I was a tank instead of a Shaman (In full totemic =), but I got augmention as a buff, where I really could have used a clarity! If you know what I mean =) I could have given out 3 more heals with clarity. But I don't know, just wanted to point it out.<br>
<br>
Great work all and thanks again for a first time raid!<br>
Cant wait till next time!<br>

The only thing that matters out of your buffs are Magic, Fire/Cold, and DMF, all the rest are buffers to protect these 3 from getting dispelled. The AE dispell can Remove up to 4 bufs at a time, since this was a very long Fight with Vox most people were completey debuffed by the End. Also when feared if you are Lev/dmfed you will run out of the lair, if you are not you will run deeper into the lair therefore falling into a pit, if you fall into a pit to make things faster dont try and run just stand get loc and die where you got that loc.<br>

I've actually been working really hard to improve it, as I think it's the one part of the dragon raid that really sucks.  I mean, who wants to kill the giants in 10 minutes, then spend two hours buffing?  From previous suggestions, we halved the buffing time last raid, which was awesome.<br>
<br>
Flarren is absolutely correct, and admist the fray last time, I was watching my buffs be dispelled.  They are still dispelled from the top down...so if DMF was the first buff cast, it would be gone before we even got into the lair.  As it is, since it's considered the most important of buffs, it is always cast last.<br>
