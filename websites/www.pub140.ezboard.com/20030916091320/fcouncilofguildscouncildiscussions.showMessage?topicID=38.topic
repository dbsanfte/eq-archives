<br>
Neither class gets a new healing spell at 44, so in both cases, a level 40 player is essentially the same as a level 45 player for the purpose of a dragon raid.  Given that, it seems silly to me to exclude level 40 druids or cleric from raiding dragons.<br>

As For healing, yes your right....except Greater heal from a druid just doesnt cut it. With large targets like Nagafen the Tank is going to take more damage than you can heal in the time it takes to cast Greater heal. (in my experience as a 51 Druid..partly the reason I quit).<br>
As long as a dragon is debuffed as much as can be for spells to hold. But take into account, Shamans DD's are primarily Cold based, and Druids Fire based...which means Shamans arent going to do much to Vox and druids arnt going to do much against nagafen (At level 40 druid some several months ago, I participated as a druid on a nagafen raid. During that raid I think I did about 360 damage in the whole raid - being hit three times before dieing while nagafen took 36 damage from Shield of Thorns because I died 10 times) Participation is great, But Ive never got over that feeling of helplessness as a druid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalendin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balendin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#8E9173>(11/28/00 9:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/wildelf1/bal2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid and Clerics on Dragon raids.</span><hr size=1> Druids are considered to be casters in dragon raids since their heal is partly useless.

Clerics have both Superior (463-583HP heal) and Complete heal by lvl 40 so I agree that they should stay out of the rule for +45 casters.<br>

+45 Tanks<br>

I remember the last raid we did. I was in a group with a number of level 40 people. The healer didn't even have a chance to heal the meleers before they died. The amount of damage the Breath weapon did and how little hps and Resistance the level 40 group memberst had they didn't last 15 seconds. It's one of the reasons that some people that run Dragon raids have boosted the min level for dragon raids to 45 for meleers and I think 48 for casters. The other thing to take into account is the Fear AoE that Dragons have, The lower level you are the less likely you are to Resist. Having the Enchanter run into the Pits or lava all the time because they got feared isn't a good thing. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.coastnet.com/~drake/sig.gif"><BR>

I do, however, think that part of the problem is the resist gear.  It sounds to me like the lower levels on your raid weren't well enough equiped to be on the raid.  I would hazard that more important than level is the resistance to magic and fire or cold of each person.  Yes, a 34 level enchanter can mana sieve Vox.  And who's more likely to take damage and get feared?  A level 40 enchanter who has resist gear upwards of 100 or a level 45 warrior whos resists are all below 50?<br>
<br>
My point is simply that it's silly, in my opinion, to allow level 40 tanks, and prevent level 40 casters who can be an effective part of the raid.  I agree that 45+ melees and 48+ casters is ideal..I would never argue that, but I do feel that if you're going to allow level 40 warriors to pound on Vox or Naggy, you should allow level 40 clerics/druids to heal, and level 40 enchanters to Mana Sieve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usteelheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steelheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8E9173>(12/22/00 1:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid and Clerics on Dragon raids.</span><hr size=1> (Hope this isn't a double post)<br>
<br>
In the case of the raid I was talking about yeah their Resistance gear was low. &lt;LOL&gt; Well in that raid my cleric I think was level 40. (Sucks being the only person in you your group standing in the first 20 seconds. &lt;Grin&gt;) I think in your Question on who would take less and more damage (or fear) between a level 40 enchanter and level 45 warrior the Warrior would take much less. I can't remember were I read it so I sadly can't find the URL but a group of players did some test and found that Resistance Gear does little compared to the amount of Resistances you get for being higher level. It's like when you fight something it's harder to get things to hold on higher level NPCs, and the effect does less or more depending on the level. I'm not a casters so I have no idea if debuffers like Tash really make that much of a difference.<br>
<br>
I think the main reason why the casters are higher level is because they are so important to the Success of the raid.  Take support Classes (Enchanter and Clerics) I think in average there is 2 clerics and 1 enchanter. One dieing could and would take down the whole raid. I think the Reason that Casters need to be higher level is because most raids don't have those classes to just throw head long into the Dragon. Like Rangers and warriors. &lt;Grin&gt; <br>
<br>
I think it's also up to the Raid leader to decide if he wants a level 40 enchanter. Personally if a level 40 enchanter is all I could get I would take it. Better then nothing. But if you have a good turn out with 4 enchanters I could see not taking the level 40. But then it brings up the question on why they post here on the Forums that the levels are 40 meleers and casters 45? Well that's up to them to do that, so I can't really tell you why. But it's most likely &quot;better to be safe&quot; thinking.<br>

Vox has smeared me a couple times and my pet was the only usefull part of me as a mage. I never hit either of them with even 1 spell and trust me I was dumping when told to. Even my Maliement spell was resisted repeatedly and of the 40 or so times I've cast it, was resisted each time. With casters we have crappy life. Having 740 life right now to me is cool so a lvl 34 with 580 or so isn't that much of a difference especially after buff up. Thats like the difference in life between a lvl 45 warrior and a lvl 52 warrior but we never get into melee. Besides, if a dragon has it in for you, you're dead, so it would be in our best interests to take the lvl 34 enches. Who knows, they might survive a LOT longer than we think.<br>

Dragon raids I think are only fun because you feel like your part of something big and epic, you may out number the beast 100 to 1 but your still just ants hacking at an elephant. The chance of dieing is always great and everyone that comes out knows that. But to run into a room, see the dragon for a spilt second before he or she fears you and then burns your arse off with his or her breath weapon sucks. Then you get to sit at your bind point and get rough information about how it's going. The only people that can talk are the ones that have been killed. So all you can do is sit there for a couple of hours hoping to the gods that the people that haven't died kill the SoB in question and/or they can get your corpse to the cleric. So the question is, so you sacrifice spots in your raid with people that may die in the first 5 seconds of the raid, where they most likely will not have fun and think it was the worst raid ever or do you try to fill your groups with as many high level people that have a better chance of taking the target down. <br>
<br>
Not sure if you were in the last dragon raid but I can tell you what want wrong. Half the people on the raid where spending their time running in fear and then running back. There was so many of them that naggy had time to regen the HP he had lost and then some from the last wave of feared players that just ran. How do I know this?? Because I wasn't running. (It's also the reason I died. &lt;LOL&gt; hard to evade when you're the only one still in the room. No joke.) And each time the huge group of people ran a couple would sadly not get feared and get eaten, until everyone died. Otherwise he would have gone down. We where soooooooo close. &lt;Holds his fingers really close together&gt; would have got the exp to. &lt;Snicker&gt;<br>

PS You do know you have to be in melee range to get spells off on Dragons right?? That means you are standing in the AoE Fear and AoE damage radius and that's not even counting the Breath weapon attack if you're in front of the Dragon. The little bugger also loves to Summon. <br>

<br>
About what Cassia said, enchanters need to be +45 for a succesful raid vs Vox. If you don't have 3 +46 enchanters in a Vox raid better get ready for a 3 hour CR. You also need a high level enchanter to charm Fire Giants, I doubt if a lvl 40 enchanter can charm a lvl 50 Fire Giant.<br>
<br>
IMHO, the higher lvl players you have in a dragon raid the more chances you have for a succesfull dragon raid. On the last one against Naggy we had 40 people with the 95% above 45, as a result we killed Naggy. One more thing is that most of them had high Fire/Magic resistances.<br>
<br>
For dragon raids I would suggest everyone to be +45 if this cannot happen then +40 for clerics, bards, warriors, monk and +45 for everyone else. It's quite simple since clerics have superior healing, bards can boost fire/magic resists +200 and monks/warrior get the fearless discipline.<br>

All I know is most of them where running around like headless chickens. I would guess it's a combination of Level and Save Versus Magic. I have a base of 60 (which out buffs) and seem to far pretty good again the dragons fear. To my knowledge from the almost 15 dragon raids I have been on I have only been feared ones. (First vox raid. First one in, first one hit Vox, first one hit by vox, first one feared, first one to die. &lt;LOL&gt; was a learning experience I can tell you.)   <br>
<br>
Balendin as long as no one falls in the pits Vox is pretty easy with a rogue. She stands looking to the back of the Lair a rogue can sneak in and stand as close to being under her and behind her head. (I know I've done it.) Naggy is much harder, he looks at the door into his lair. Even a rogue sneaking and hiding will aggro him when they step through the doorway. The only way to do it safely is to send the monks in. FD as close as they can and start pulling the corpses back. Not an easy feat I can tell you. For what I heard the AoE Fear breaks the FD. I'm guessing you would have to do the same in Vox's lair in the pits. It's a bit heard because of the number of monsters down there. They can easily kill a monk that fails his FD.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic. &lt;Grin&gt; I think if a level 40 enchanter did show up for a dragon raid I wouldn't be surprised if they would be let into the raid. &lt;Shrug&gt;<br>

Level 50s need to ensure that their fire or cold resist is high enough 70-75 before buffs.  Comments?<br>
<br>
Also, here is a good map from AoVB on the Vox lair (as you can tell, I have absolutely no scruples about sharing ideas other people have come up with, even if I don't necessarily agree with everything they say *grin)<br>

Hell 35 is currently slowing me down though.  Hopefully this weekend will see 36 and 37.<br>
<br>
What kind of cold/fire resistances are we shooting for on these raids?  Someone mentioned a minimum of 70 or so unbuffed.<br>
I'm not too worried about magic resist, its over 100 with self buffs and I have more gear to up it.  But my other resists are about 40 unbuffed...sadly, Chanters don't get these resist buffs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
How much damage do these dragons do?  I have about 700hp and 600ac.<br>
<br>
To land spells you have to be up close and personal?<br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks for the info.  Hope to see you soon.<br>

Enchanters, warriors, shadowknights, paladins, rangers, clerics, bards, and shaman minimum level of 40.<br>
