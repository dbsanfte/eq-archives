<br>
I know that this is a VERY heated topic and I will continue to support KCoG.  I understand the threat from SS and what it can mean to us smaller guilds, and how it will disrupt the rotations that have been followed peacefully.<br>
<br>
It has been almost a month since the first post about SS.  And what I am wondering is :<br>
<br>
During that month, how many times has Shattering Steel stolen a plane or a dragon (or any other large target)?  <br>
<br>
I have been trying to keep on top of this issue and I am unclear as to how many times, it has happened or attempted to happen.<br>
<br>
I just want to be informed and as I am sure all of you want to be too.<br>
<br>
*edited* <br>
<br>
I did miss page 2 and reread it, but my questions still stands.<br>
<br>
This is getting to be a quite heated topic.  And I guess what sparks my question is : Is it really fair to punish the members of this guild for the leaderships decisions.  I mean I have no idea how this guild is ran or (and I am sad to say) I do not know what actions by SS have done.  I guess before I turn down to aide another player I want to make sure that SS totally in the wrong.  I mean I have met a very nice person that is a members of SS, and is being a member enough malice?  <br>
<br>
Now, I understand that the idea behind the boycott is to send a message to the members that they need to speak up to there leadership. And before I started seeing the members as actual people, I totally agreed.  But, Now I am wondering if this is the best course of actions and I feel that I do not have enough information to make a good decision on this issue.<br>
<br>
Now, again I want to restate that I fully support the KGC rotations, respecting those is the only way that smaller guilds and guildless players will be able to do the large targets. However, I have elected to allow my guild members to decide for themselves.<br>
<br>
I fully understand how terrible it would be to put time and effort into a raid that wasn't possible because it was stolen.  <br>
<br>
I want us all to be informed and to act appropriately.<br>
<br>
Ok thank you all for taking the time to read this, I am sorry that is so long.  I do want to add however that I am very proud to be involved with KCoG.    <p><BR><BR>Desirrae Emeraldrain<BR>

<br>
3 times SS has willfully infringed upon KGC guilds and the rotation. The First was against an alliance called the Natural Order (which I believe has the Silent Watch and Sign of One but correct me if I'm wrong). They tried to take Fear spawns away from TNO. The next time was in Hate. They went into a plane that had been cleared earlier in the day by Miyabi and started pharming repops. There was no guild in that night (it was a Thursday night) but the OAKS alliance (an alliance of mostly French guilds) would have had it that Friday afterwards. Because of SS, OAKS respawn was completely screwed, leaving OAKS without a full plane. Then a week from this past Saturday, they charged into Fear again. That morning (American time) OAKS had cleared Fear and that evening SS burst in. The next guild in the planes was Union Eternelle, another Europeon guild who had the plane on Sunday. SS tried killing respawns, and on discovering this, Shadowed Fates, UE, Harbingers, the Silver Daggers and a few others as well (mostly SF folks) left what they were doing and went into Fear. Without ksing or insults, the combined KGC guilds killed every spawn that was up (as we could do it faster and better than SS) before SS could get to them. They left quietly and went to the plane of Growth. <br>
<br>
On multiple occasions, myself and Kellory and I'm sure others, have attempted to talk to members and officers about what they are doing. On the last night in question, I directly asked the guild leader if it bothered him that he was messing up someone else's event that had been planned for a week. He responded with &quot;I don't care, you shouldn't schedule it, don't cry like a baby to me.&quot; Their members have all been told repeatedly by folks like me and Kellory what they are doing, and what their guild leaders are using them to do. They either don't care or like Exsodus in this thread, just don't get it and don't want to try to understand. Any member who is still in SS now KNOWS exactly what he is doing. Either they don't care or they have chosen to put their trust in leaders who do not care. They have made the decision to stay, and I don't think any of SS can claim innocence now. <br>
<br>
As I've always said, it's up to each individual to decide where they stand on this issue. Forcing someone to follow the boycott does no good. Explaining the importance of the boycott does. Keep in mind that I have never advocated harrassment or ksing or training the SS members. Explaining politely why you are withholding services is the only way to show them what they are doing wrong. <br>

I feel now that I am able to continue to fully support the boycott, knowing that SS, its members as well as its guild leader have acted against the KGC and willingly ruined raids for others that have planned on them.  This thoughtlessness is disturbing and the guild leaders comments to you were just plain wrong.  Knowing of there actions and there willingness to disrespect not only the KGC, but other players in general, justifies this boycott (sorry to doubt anyone, but I feel that out of fairness that I had to be informed before in good conscious I could continue.) <br>
<br>
Even though, I do have a couple members that is opposed to this boycott.  I am confident to say that you have the support of Destiny's Phoenix and if there is anything that we can do to assist, please let me know.<br>

Many of the supporters of SS that are not in the guild do not understand the rotation system or that its really just a player run extention of the PNP policy.  Which is exactly what Verant prefers.  They would rather have players deal with these problems instead of getting a GM involved.  However, at the same time it seems that many people who are involved with boycotting SS do not understand what they are doing either.  I've seen people going around in zones actively trashing SS in a public channel.  This really is not accomplishing anything.  Especially when its done in lower level zones like Lake of ill Omen.  These zones are filled with people who dont understand even what is going on.  For them FFA still seems like a viable option since thats what they're accustomed to at their level.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that many of the members of SS come accross to strangers as nice people.  They are when they have something to gain.  Dolus and Kausak come across as very intelligent and verbose individuals with their few posts on EQVault.  Yet, in person if they know where you stand they can be quite rude.  Still in my opinion you should follow your own conscience on this.  For myself I'm done with it.  I'm tired of it.  I'm not a fan of karma or fate, but you do reap what you sow.  I dont, and have never, advocated more than a silent boycott of SS.  Anything more is counter productive.  Just ignore them and eventually they're get tired of the lack of attention and move to Sullon Zek where they can get more attention by camping people's bind spots.<br>

<br>
Shattering Steel went into Fear last night, very late, and killed the Shissar spirit, which is a significant chokepoint piece for the Enchanter epic quest. Cassia, who would have looked for this mob tonight (i.e. on the Sacred Band Fear raid) is very very disappointed, in the fact that a bunch of yahoos who won't even cooperate with anyone else on the server has now set her back even farther on the epic quest she's been working so hard on. I personally would like to thank Shattering Steel for shitting on the entire server, and my alliance in particular by this action. <br>
<br>
Anyone who knows Cassia, or who were on the SB-led Council of Guilds planes raids months ago, know of Cassia. She gave a lot of herself to run the CoG planes raids, and gives of herself everyday, without asking for anything in return. She is the one who has been hurt by this FFA bullshit that SS has started. If you need a face to put to their actions, look at Cassia. <br>

<br>
Stormii, Ryvers' guild leader, is a lot like Cassia. She gives of herself totally to her guild and alliance as does Ryvers. SS's actions hurt TNO, and members of my alt's guild and alliance, therefore they hurt Ryvers herself. They also hurt Cassia, a dear friend of Judimar's, thereby hurting Judimar. I know this probably does not make any sense to most of you, but I, in RL and in game, am an intensely loyal person. Also I do not care what you do to me, but hurt someone I love and I become VERY VERY angry. SS has hurt 2 people, possibly more, who are  very dear to me. I can not forgive them this. I have and will do nothing to be rude to them or to violate PnP, but I will not aid them as either my main or ANY of my alts.<br>

<br>
I have been hunting in DL for a good while now, and I have become familiar with their guild's members names..  It seems to me that they will disband their guild in order to find groups, then rejoin when they're done.. Many times I have seen them quit the guild, rejoin, etc. MULTIPLE times per day.. <br>
<br>
for all who dont know, the zone-only /who command will &quot;see through&quot; anonymous.. <br>
<br>
Be aware and keep in mind the names of SS members.. if they're unguilded, they most likely will be SS once again very soon... <p>Colalorna Silverlight<br>

Course, they're pretty much twinked to hell and gone so I guess that might be a give away as well...  Actually I'm more afraid these days to group with low level guilded people I dont know.  Many just dont seem to understand how that class is played.  You know them.  Like that level 10 ranger telling me he doesnt need to use taunt because a ranger generates enough aggro just by standing around.  Even though he doesnt get dual wield or double attack for another 10 levels.  heh.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats off the subject.  Personally I dont care.  My main thing is they need to be out of Shattering Steel.  If they are fine I'll group with them.  If they then re-guild, oh well.  If they think they are fooling anyone, thats their problem.  To me, forcing them through those extra steps is just as worthwhile.  Now if they continue to do this, perhaps I will change, but for now they're leaving is enough for me.  Plus it makes things a lot easier.  I have enough other pieces of paper on my desk ranging from quest gem charts, maps, barbie dolls, and empty picture frames that I dont need a list of people I dont really care about.<br>
<br>
Call me crazy, I'm just hanging around waiting for SS to realize no one cares about them.  Generally ignoring them is, I think, the best way to go.  Course, if they try plane jumping, thats a whole different story.  But ignore them up there too, just grab all the spawns <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
I will admit I was previously a member of SS, but for real life reasons (don't have as much time to play right now) among others, I have left them (quite some time ago now) and am currently non guilded, which is the way its gonna stay for a while. So are you telling me that just because I *used* to be a member of SS, I am now on your shit list forever?<br>
<br>
So what happened to all the peeps saying if you leave SS then all is forgiven?  Doesn't really sound that way to me. Sounds to me that just because I used to be a Shattering Steel member that you are gonna hold it against me forever. Well, whatever. With an attitude like that I really don't want to know you anyway. <br>
<br>
And NO, I don't deguild and then retag just for grouping purposes. Right now, I'm not really looking to group anyway....I get on and maybe get to play for 1 hour at a time. Thats not really group friendly, I'd say. Good thing I play a class that can easily solo. <p>Mairi<BR>

However, the reason why people believe this is because when anon there name appears blue with no guild tag. When you try to do a /who whatever, there guild won't show up along with level. The only way to check is to do a /guildstatus. Another rumor they have announed is they disband before they go on a raid. This is false. Think about how long reguilding would take before a raid? They merely go anon and have the wizard/druids teleport. People who see them see no guild tag and jump to conclusions. I figure i should clear this up so that former guild members won't be recognize with the guild and they shouldn't be known as &quot;part of the problem&quot; as you could say. Just remember /who &quot;DOES NOT&quot; always work but /guildstatus does. Just for your FYI. :-)<br>

This makes SS members lives alot easier because if they are looking for pick-up groups they will be way more likely to get one.<br>
