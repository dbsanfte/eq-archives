Out of the six raids I've done in Hate it was by far the smoothest running, even if it did take us a while to get up there.  Great pulls by Zellex and Liza (sp?), and on the whole great organization even if it seemed people liked breaking mezz early on in the raid..<br>
<br>
Congrats to those who got some nice loot, and extra thanks to Zellex for arranging that me and Onix be rezzed asap to loot the Apothic robe and sleeves that had dropped in that wipe-out train near the end of the raid.  I lost the roll on the robe (grats Onix!), and the sleeves poofed before I could get to them--but it's the thought that counts<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh well, maybe my 7th raid will yield my first piece of apothic..  Dang male revenants...<br>
<br>
In any case, if any of the organizers need help for organizing future raids--whether list making or otherwise, don't hesitate to call upon me.<br>
<br>
P.S:  Also wanted to thank Nightmare Clan for being incredibly honorable with announcing the loot drops, and generally being very helpful from beginning to end.  I almost went nuts after being rezzed up for the roll on the robe, waiting for Onix to be raised-- whilst at least 8 members were shouting &quot;loot it quick--it's gonna rot&quot;, &quot;dude its gonna poof&quot;, &quot;quickly&quot;. etc hehe.  Talk about an internal mental struggle going on at 5am est in a state of overcaffeination and panic lol.<br>

All of the issues that made it no fun for me are irrelevant at this point, but I would like to make a few points about Mez.<br>
<br>
I personally feel it was broken WAY too much.  I was having to re-mez things 3 and 4 times.  This is not a problem if it is a refresh mez, but it was because of breaks.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my guild in that we work very well together and premature breaks are very few and far between (not that it never happens).<br>
<br>
I wasn't able to tell if it was any one person repeatedly or not since I was too busy trying (unsuccesfully) not to get ripped to shreads (thanks Kartain for all the rezzes).<br>
<br>
A few pointers:<br>
1. NEVER EVER use AoE spells or songs. (Enchanters worst nightmare)<br>
2. Dont use any DoT's untill primary target is well established.<br>
3. ASSIST ASSIST ASSIST this is the most important issue for all melee, and an /assist &lt;name&gt; hotkey is extreemly important.<br>
4. When engaging a new target designated by the Main Assist, Taunt at least 2 times before breaking Mez to keep your Enchanter happy, =)<br>
<br>
I know that for some all this is probably common knowledge but it is best not to assume that everyone knows. =)<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all on another raid, =)<br>

<br>
I would have to say the loot was nice.  Although the number of drops was low, we had lots of BPs and robes drop.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact we had a slightly higher number of unorganization (wrong targets) this raid, we did clear out alot more then usual.  We missed about two golems in the corner and two abhorents with maybe a couple more creatures.<br>
<br>
(keep in mind it seems like more, but those are wanderers, they keep respawning)<br>
<br>
Also CoG had extraordinary luck as NC killed Inny, and a shaman ogre hammer which was given to Mortwuk because they didn't have any Ogre Shamans.<br>

It was my first raid.  I have to say I thought Zellex did a masterful job, as did those who helped lead it, do the pulling, etc.<br>
<br>
I will be leveling like mad in the next few days.  I want to make 50 by my next Hate raid.  I could be a *lot* more helpful in Crowd Control then.  At 47 it was all I could do to land anything at all on some of the mobs.  I was resisted at least half the time with every spell I tried on some of the mobs, and with some of them I was resisted 100% of the time.  I didn't even attempt to mez something.  I probably should have at least tried, seeing as we had plenty of clerics available for rez support.  Thankfully Qiladin and Solonel did a pretty good job at CC, but in the future I really want to pull my weight in that area, and I know leveling is the way I can accomplish that.  I wasn't really prepared to contribute to the Crowd Control, and that is a feeling I don't like having.<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed the raid though.  It was pretty cool.<br>
<br>
I promise to level up in the meantime, and be able to contribute a lot more in the Crowd Control area, and not just be a buff whore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=crescendo>Crescendo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8E9173>(11/2/00 5:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: POH Recap and Thoughts Oct 27th</span><hr size=1> i just want to say, YOU GUYS ROCK! while there was some minor problems with mezz and what not, i think all and all the raid was pretty good. of course my opinion may be a bit biased because i was the only bard present for the 3 bard drops. but i thank everyone for the fun and thank Zellex for letting me come up late.<br>
