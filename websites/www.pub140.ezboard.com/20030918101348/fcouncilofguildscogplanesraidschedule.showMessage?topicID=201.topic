<br>
Good lord, where to begin.  Well I woke up this morning with some nameless fear in my stomach.  At first I thought it was just gas, but then I logged onto the KGC board and saw there had been an emergency patch last night.  Fear was fully spawned, all the mini's and wanderers were around, and so was CT.  After panicing for a few minutes I managed to get in touch with the guild thats taking on CT.  They made arrangements with OAKS to take him out the next day so we had Fear to ourselves.  Woohoo!  One hurdle over.  This is the third time in a row CT has spawned on a CoG Fear day, I would've hated to have to trade days again.  But we lucked out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Moving along to 5pm PST I began signups.  Inital numbers looked good, and then stopped.  At 5:30pm PST I realized we had 1 monk, 3 clerics, 1 shaman, and 4 druids.  Needless to say I was shocked.  The call went out for volunteers and our numbers moved up a bit.  Unfortunatly this all took time.  So we didnt actually begin our assault into Fear until about 6:30pm PST.<br>
<br>
Things could have gone better to start.  Our lone monk Seedor tried to go in and provide us with needed intelligence on the wanderers movements.  Important since everything was up.  Unforuntatly he somehow aggro'd Fright and won a free trip back to Freeport.  But we had Odini so we were not downtrodden.  We proceeded to rush Fear.  This is what I liked.  Almost everyone I saw followed instructions and went left.  We had a few scarelings in camp, but people followed directions and assisted the Main Assist.  We killed several mobs, but then...we got trained.  I know who trained us, but it seems to have been an honest mistake so I wont belabor it here.  Especially since I had failed to give me standard stand and die speech.  Of course, said person who trained us was not on my list so why he was there I dont know.  But thats something thats already been taken care of.<br>
<br>
But!  Seeing the train coming I called for an evac.  Over half the groups managed to evac in time, several groups losing no one at all!  we only took 7 groups on in and over half managed to get out.  Considering how things have gone in the past on these evac's I was very impressed.  We then took a couple of full groups back in there and finished clearing the wanderers.  Within 30 minutes we were finished rez'ing and good to go.  By 8pm PST we were killing TT's.<br>
<br>
The amazing thing is, we didnt have any real experienced Fear pullers on this raid.  Unfortunatly Zellex was unable to make this raid as he was very busy and needed to get ready for his own raid today.  He did offer, but I told him no.  He's given a lot for us and I didnt want to take advantage of him.  But that still left us without a puller.  But Seedor and Goreytor were worthy of the challenge.  They both proceeded to pull the TT's and fiends.  We had several nice trains of 3 or 4 or 5 mobs that our 2 enchanters kept mez'd while we slaughtered their bretheren!  Unfortuantly somewhere around here Seedor had another close encounter with Fright.  that being the case I decided to give pulling to Goreytor since at 60 I thought it might be easier for him.  While I'm sure his experience is valuable to him, we had level 56 rez's available and Seedor simply didnt have Goreytor's ac or hps.  But I applaud Seedor's willingness to do whatever was asked.  Whether it be to zone into Fear alone or pull corpses or mobs, he did it all without complaining.  I'd take you back along on any raid Seedor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
And so the pulling kept going.  We pulled most of the TT's and boy the loot was rolling.  Rangers take note, they cleaned up like the Bards on the last Hate raid.  Unfortunatly at this point Goreytor moved a bit too close to the Dracoliche.  Remember I said all the mini's were up?  Their spacing along with CT made pulling mobs at least twice or three times as hard as normal.  And Goreytor's number was up and he accidently ended pulling the Dracoliche.  <br>
<br>
Now for those that dont know, Draco is a very high level, very MR, very high HPS mob.  He was changed along with the other mini's to close to the old CT range.  Neededless to say we simpyl did not have the firepower to cope with him.  When I saw him run down the hill at us, I immediatly had the clerics camp, once they were gone, the other healrs and casters and melee's as they could camped.  Amazingly enough, even tho this whole thing was adhoc over half the raid again managed to camp out including our clerics.<br>
<br>
Within 15 minutes we were all back on our feet and ready to kill again.  We paused a bit to refresh our buffs and continuted to pull.  We continued this happy trend till we finished the raid about about 11:30pm PST.  <br>
<br>
All I can say is, damn we kicked ass.  No, we didnt get the mini's and we didnt clear the zone.  However, considering we had less than 50 people and were generally low on healing power we cleared at least half the zone and picked up quite a bit of loot.  I'll be posting that later.  Everyone did a wonderful job and once we broke in, things went as smoothly as I could have wanted.<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to everyone of course.  But especially our Rez Stick equiped cleric.  I'm not going to name her here and I ask that no one else does unless she or her friends do so.  She came to help us at the request of some of her friends even though her guild was doing something else and I dont want to risk getting her into trouble.  However, her contribution was very welcome and made the raid a whole lot easier.  Rez's went by a lot faster and we didnt have to worry about triage.  All I can say is thank you again.  Also, I'd like to thank Odini and Allianah, our two enchanters for keeping us in haste and clarity all night.  Having a level 60 and 56 enchanter made things much easier as well.  Their ability to mez multiple mobs made our job doable and kept us all alive.<br>
<br>
There were many more who made a lot of sacrafices and helped a lot and I wish I could name them here.  But I'd just be renaming everyone who showed up.  So let me just say thank you to all that came.  The raid succeded because you all worked hard at making it so.  A leader is only as good as those who follow and tonight you showed you could take anything.  Indeed people were talking about taking the mini's even with our firepower being limited.  And damn if I dont know if we couldnt've with more time.<br>
<br>
I'm proud of all of you, and you should be proud with yourselves.  And congrats to all those who won something.  I'll be posting a list in the morning once I recover.  heh.<br>
<br>
Till then, Have fun, be safe, and dont get lost.<br>

Well, it was a ranger night out.  Perhaps next time it will be a druid night or an SK night.  Pullng with the mini's up was very difficult.  With any luck our next Fear day in a week or two wont have any of the mini's up and we'll clean up.  And not bad for having only about 45 people and no experienced puller.  Everyone did wonderful and I never heard any complaints.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
