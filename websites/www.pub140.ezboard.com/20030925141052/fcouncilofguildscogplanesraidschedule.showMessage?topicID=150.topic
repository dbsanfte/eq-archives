Duration ?<br>
<br>
Try to be in Sirens by 5:30pm PST.  So get your keys to CS now.  I don't have any intentions of providing escorts through Skyshrine if you don't.<br>
<br>
This raid is for 45+, with 70% of the individuals 50+.  Creatures in here are 55ish.  Unfortunately I may have to bump some people if we get too many that are between 45 and 50.  I have to think of the overall success of the raid.<br>
<br>
For this raid, everyone bring 5 jaspers and 5 fish scales.  Don't forget these items <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Treasure will be rolled for in 5 tiers.  Quest items one tier, Spells one tier, nice item, excellent items, and god like items.  Those that can use the item will roll.  I'm not even going to bother trying to figure out which class it's best for.  This brings up too many arguments.  So, if you can use, you can roll.  I will leave it up to you to bow out of the roll if you think it's more suited for a class.  The only thing I ask, you only roll if your going to use it.  I don't want to hear my friends telling me your selling the item the next day in EC.  Obviously at some point it would become obsolete, and you would sell it or something.  But I don't think it would be the next day.  You can win one gem item for a quest, and if any armor piece quest items drop you can win one of those.<br>
<br>
If the item is droppable, and you already won a nice item or an excellent then win an item of a higher tier such as god like your previous item gets rerolled.  If the item you got was no drop, this doesn't mean you can't roll for something in a seperate tier.  And if you win again, just means your really lucky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Anyway I should be free on Friday to attend.  Hopefully I'll be able to scrape up enough cash for those 5 jaspers.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And bring food!  Food and water!  And I'm not talking 5 of each.  Bring at least a full stack of each please!  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, if anyone needs to get their Cobalt Scar's tooth.  Once again I will be available tomorrow (Thursday) to help people get their teeth if they still need to get them.  I *might* be on tonight (Wednesday) but I kinda doubt it.  Star Trek reruns at a friends house tonight.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I will NOT be running people in on Friday without Zellex's express approval.  So dont ask at the last minute.  It takes about fifteen minutes to half an hour to run people on through from Iceclad and its kinda nerve racking for the whoever is running everyone in since we need to keep track of invis and everything else.  Not a lot of fun so to speak.  I urge people to get their teeth early.  The CS tooth is very useful since it allows for ports to all the Dragon Rings in Velious, not just the CS ring.  If you intend to raid beyond Kael, the CS tooth is kinda a must.  So please for my sake and the sake of the other's who'll have to spend a lot of time running people in, get your CS tooth early.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I would like to attend.  I will also try and stop to pick up extra jaspers and fish scales just in case some forget.  In addition, I have a level 49 cleric (Gamlaen) sitting at the GD ring if we need rezzes if a cleric doesn't show.  Nothing like a new zone to bring a breath of fresh air.<br>
<br>
Also, Zellex...do you have SG experience? I am just curious as to if this is more of an exploratory raid or an xp raid.  Either is fine with me, but just want to know what we might be up against from our raids stand point. (as he feverishly reads every single shred of info on the web about the grotto.).<br>

Since I've been there a couple of times he's run raids there.  As I recall it was on a Kael/SG/DN weekend that I first met him...  Ah the memories...<br>
<br>
Anyway, the things about SG.  The walrus things are heavily MR.  And I mean heavily.  Forget tash, malo, and the like.  You might get them to score if youre above 55.  Maybe.   Also, forget root and snare, the walrus things are immune to movement reducing spells now.  I believe this goes for the darkness line now.  The seahorses I think can still be snared, havent tried in the last 2 patches tho.  Levitation/DMF dont work here much like Velks.  The seahorses see invis, but the walrus men dont.  Make sure you're invis before you zone in, while the entrance is safe, the safe part is pretty small, and there are 3 walrus men right at the entrance.  They hit hard.  Clerics are a must, this zone is heavily melee oriented due to the high MR of the mobs.  I'm not sure but I think enchanters can mez the seahorses and sirens as well.  Haste and clarity are musts as well.  Fire based spells do work fairly well if I remember right.  But Ice and Magic based ones have pretty high resists.<br>
<br>
These are some of the bad points.  Now, the good ones.  Drops.  Gem drops here are pretty common.  Last raid was about 1 in 4 mobs and that was after a nerf.  Netted armor also drops fairly commonly for the caster types.  For you melee types that dont want to shell out for a fishbone earrings, the ancient fishing rod also drops, unlimited enduring breath.  Spells?  Good question I didnt track them, but I think a few dropped.  XP, with good groups and coordination it can be good.  There are a lot of mobs and they spawn pretty quickly.  The hard part is clearing them fast enough.<br>
<br>
Overall SG is a very cool zone.  Zellex may even be able to show us the way through it to WW.  Its also a place that not all that many people see.  For most people SG seems to be a zone to go through to the more interesting places like DN and ToV.  For my money, however, SG is very fun.  Its not often you get to fight in more than one type of terrain, land AND water, consistantly.  Very challenging all in all.<br>
<br>
Maps.  The one I use, and I like it a lot, I got from eqmaps.com.  It was a 4 page one as a zip file.<br>
<br>
Zellex probably has more information.  Come on down, explore a new zone, take lots of screenshots for bragging rights at the next drunken guild meeting.  <br>

<br>
PS.  Fish scales.  You can buy these at many vendors.  There is also one in a hut by the inn in EC, its the first one you hit when you zone in from WC.  Stock up.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxiledpendragoran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xiled Pendragoran</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/13/01 2:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sirens raid friday, 6pm PST/9pm EST</span><hr size=1> I would love to try this zone out.count me in<br>

CoG is for everyone.  Just when it gets to planes and big targets the politics gets a little crazy.  Of course this also doesn't mean I am extending an invation to all Valoran either.  If they come to the boards and sign up, sure.  But if all of a sudden we have 40 people here plus 40 Valoran going to get a little difficult to manage a raid of this size. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/14/01 8:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sirens raid friday, 6pm PST/9pm EST</span><hr size=1> Signing up Eleysian 45 druid and Nerwin 55 Rogue. <br>
