And well.. most have herd things about me.. or about NTC. and frankly... 80% of its not true.. Im here to clear up any doubts or questions you have about me or the former guild NTC, I disbanded the guild.. i had a general idea about having people all around the same age in aguild.. Ntc, was a guild full of teen to young adults.. the reason being i figured if a guild had all the same ages. then things would run smother and people would get along better.. well.. it dident turn out that way.. And some people such as Hirosaki just turned out to act like 5yearolds... Ofcourse im going to defend my guild.. seeing as it was my guild.. But... Enough was enough.. I was tried of being responsible for the actions of children in that guild.. SO.... thats pretty much it.. and NTC is dead for all who care.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/8/01 4:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.godwinclients.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Time to clear somthing up...</span><hr size=1> If you are the guild leader, you ARE responsible for all the actions of your guild members. As are your other members, by the simple fact that they have your guildtag over their head. Disbanding the guild does no good. It only makes it look as if you are trying to avoid the heat your guild members' actions have caused. It would have been better if you'd actually tried to remove the guild members whose actions were so stupid and reprehensible, and recruit people who cared about what their guild represented. <br>

HOWEVER when damge is done it is done , And Even removing the members did not change the fact that NTC was branded...   People here are quick to judge, So even if my guild turned around and was nicer then nice and gave away 1000pp to everyone that had ever had a run in with them , NTC was still going to be labled a bad guild.. I may have been the leader, But i was NOT a baby sitter and I WAS NOT A Parent.. People on everquest are all responsible for there own actions , AND once they do somthing of there own actions that effect my guild.. thats when I would step in.. People used to demand for me to get there stolen item back or what not , being that removed the player from the guild wasent enough , And sense i could not get there item back, I was told that i would be labled a thief and such.. Its this kind of childness crap that destorys the game of everquest.. WAKE UP , this is everquest its not a Soap Opra, And that is exactly what you guys are making it out to be...<br>

Its funny how I've never talked to any of you and we come on here and find out that we've already been talked about and judged.  That is quite unfair.  What if I ran around saying that I had five legs.. does that automatically make it true?  C'mon guys.. use some common sense here... I'd really like you to re-evalute you judgement.<br>

Usually it takes quite a lot (certainly more than one or two isolated incidents) to make us consider a whole guild &quot;tainted&quot;.  So uh... I can only assume that Haemish' statements about NTC aren't based on one bad person who happened to be in the guild that one time kinda thing... <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

And on the fact that at least one of those people was threatened by Shaddowlands when he was informed that one of his guild members had cheated someone out of an item, an FBSS no less. If that's the kind of action a guild leader takes when his guild members act so shabbily, I don't have much use for said guild leader or his guild, and neither does the Council of Guilds. <br>
