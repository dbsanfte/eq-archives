I was glad to go, not because I had the chance for a white scale, but for the chance to take down an enemy that I have a vendetta against. The raid went well, however I feel a little cheated.<br>
<br>
I may be posting this in the wrong area, but since this is my first time here, please bear with me.<br>
<br>
Long story short, a Torbrin's Mystical Eyepatch dropped last night. All Wis/Int casters were asked to roll, but when I asked if bards were allowed to, I was vehemently told no. Why? Because &quot;no bard would ever wear this.&quot; (Avante)<br>
<br>
I begged to disagree, but, rather than cause a hold-up and end up ruining others raid experiences, I conceded very quickly. Now, the question remains... why was I not allowed to roll?<br>
<br>
Reasons given:<br>
&quot;No bard would ever wear this.&quot;<br>
Not true. Yes there are better pieces, but if I actually owned this item I would wear it not only for the stat boosts, but the permanent see invisible is very nice as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bards don't use mana.&quot;<br>
Not true. Especially now. Our 39 charm can last up to a minute and costs 60 mana to cast. When I am in a group, I often use charm to clear up adds. More mana means more charm ability. <br>
<br>
&quot;Casters deserve this more than a hybrid.&quot;<br>
I know a few Shadowknights, Paladins, Rangers and (for all practical intents and purposes) Beastlords who would disagree with this as well. If this is the reason that is given, I shouldn't play any of these classes at all. And neither should anyone else.<br>
<br>
Look, I'm not trying to cause trouble, and I'm not trying to take the item from someone else. They won the roll and I am VERY happy for them. But to be told that I can't even roll, despite the fact I was tripping over Vox's feet and bleeding for some of the fight, because of all things I'm a bard... well, it makes me not want to even try to help on these occasions. On the whole, the raid was run fairly well for a situation where most of the people didn't know each other at all. We were a team, despite our differences, and we vanquished a mighty foe. It was fun.<br>
<br>
But please... next time... if you bleed, you should be able to roll.<br>

On this issue though, I thought the rule was You Bleed...You Roll. It would have made me sad to know that there was an item I could use, even though there may be a 'better' item I could attain, and not be able to roll for it.<br>
<br>
Is there an addition to the YBYR rule that I don't know about? Not trying to cause a confliction, just want to know so that way I can let my guild members know what the ruling is so they don't feel bad when they can't roll. <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>

Technically it is an all/all item, so if you wanted to make an arguement Warriors could make use of the item when they were doing tradeskills.  <br>
<br>
IMHO there are two reasons why this rule has been here.<br>
<br>
1) Quality of use.  While bards, hybrids, tanks, etc. CAN use the item, 98% of the time they wouldn't and they would just sell the item or give it to a guildmate.  On the other hand this is an awesome item for an Intelligence or Wisdom caster, in fact one of the best items you are going to see outside of UBER zones which most of our guilds will never see.  And frankly, as Avante put it, a mask like this without ac is only going to be used by a bard except in very specific circumstances, whereas any caster that wins that item is going to be wearing it permanently, except in very specific circumstances (need for resists or something is all I would be able to think of).<br>
<br>
2) This is one of three items (White Dragon Hide for cloak, and Polished Mithril Mask off of one of the FG's at Nagafen) that are really useful for both Int Casters and Wis Casters.  There are a few other trinkets (cleric hammer, etc) that they can use, but most would be a downgrade in equipment for most people nowadays.  On the other hand bards have 2 epic drops between the dragons, A Horn (Instrument), 2 Haste items, Gauntlets, and various odds and ends that would be upgrades for almost any bard that drop between the two dragons.  Albiet not much dropped last night that bards would be excited about, but there is a lot of stuff that bards would love there.  Now you really need to have your clerics, druids, shamans, enchanters, wizards, necros, and mages there, and without several of those classes being there there is no way you can possibly succeed.  So in this case I think limiting the casters very limited already selection of items that draw them here is bad, especially when there is so much there that is available (and frankly meant for) bards, including 2 items that are completely bard exclusive (the horn and the white scale).  <br>
<br>
Since there has been some confusion about loot rules (even though I have not changed anything except epic availability rules), I will work up a chart of items that can drop and lay down the rules about who can roll for them.  There are only a few where there are limits within the classes/races that can use them, and this just happens to be one of them.  If you read back you can probably find the thread where Haemish was talking about this item (I believe) way back when he was leading the raids. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
On a Vox raid, you can roll on the scale, the horn and I think a weapon as well?...<br>
<br>
casters get.... the eyepatch. <br>
<br>
Like it or not they can put it to alot better use then a hybrid and it can be worn by them well into endgame whereas hybrids (assuming you dont stay in a small guild for the most part that does nothing) can get much better. Besides that most bards wear their illusion masks purely for the CHA bonuses (which by the way the CHA off those masks gives you more mana then the eyepatch does) so I dont really see an issue here, unless you just didn't go get your illusion masks yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you have an issue with loot, speak to the raid commander and tell them why and let them either tell you why it is done as it is, or come on here and suggest a possible change. But at the very least, read the loot rules before you post up on a public board about something you should already know about if you attend CoG events. Coming here with an informed question looks better then someone being able to link one thread you shoulda read anyway to respond to you.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, when I made my break with the Daggers months ago, there isn't a lot said about me and the ideas I put forth in the SD ranks. I'd imagine an astonishing number of the new SD don't even know who I am. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  sadf<br>
<br>
However, as both Farnnusno and Lagdalen said, this is something I instituted in the loot rules a long time ago. Casters get, quite frankly, hosed in terms of the loot off of dragons. Nagafen has I think one item that's worthwhile for casters, 2 if you count Magus Roykl's mask. Vox has a little more for casters, what with the cleric hammer (not a great weapon for clerics), the Rez staff, and the weight reducing packs. And, of course, the eyepatch. Bards get an instrument off of each dragon. Melees in the 40-52 range (and some beyond that) get significant upgrade weapons and armor. Casters are especially necessary on dragon raids, and are often asked to die more than once... on both failed and successful dragon raids, I've known casters who have died in excess of 6 times. And that's without click stick resses. That gets ugly real quick. <br>
<br>
So to give them some incentive, I restricted the rolls on some items. The raid leaders who followed me have kept these traditions up, with some changes that fit with the changes to the game. <br>
<br>
The you bleed you roll principle does apply, but it isn't a unilateral &quot;You're there, you roll.&quot; The raid leader has the option of restricting items as he sees fit, so long as it is announced before hand. I'd imagine most have read the post, so it probably wasn't repeated in a pre-raid briefing. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I don't have the option to sticky posts, or I'd sticky the loot rules for specific raids that we have. <br>
<br>
If possible, Farrnusno, could you write up a list of your Dragon raid loot rules? We'll bump it each time a raid comes around.   <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
But why &quot;punish&quot; me just because the things that I am used to rolling on don't drop?<br>
<br>
As far as the idea goes that a bard wouldn't wear this, well, it's just absurd. I mean, come on? &quot;Monk-item&quot; is the cry of the equipment message boards. And ideas such as &quot;a bard would never wear this&quot; only spreads the lie. This is a character that I have put alot of time and effort into, and have plans for. My enchanter-suit that I am working on will have some value in the future as it has been stated that when bards are &quot;re-balanced&quot; they are looking at bards as a caster class. Absor even said he always felt that bards were casters. Would I not get to roll on a Flowing Though item, even though those are the only pieces in the game that can help my mana regen besides Alt Advancement? Mark my words, things are going to change for bards and we have to be adaptable.<br>
<br>
I am in a good guild, and, Haemish, I have heard of you. I thank you for starting a guild that is well organized, just and fun. I've been in and out of guilds for quite some time and have never had this much fun. I hope that everyone has a chance to be in a guild like Silver Daggers. <br>
<br>
Again, I am not trying to stir controversy. I'm simply a little miffed that I didn't even get a chance to roll. And was VERY embarrased when I was basically shut down in front of a large group before I even had a chance to state a case. But if I had, it only would have made people angry and made me look like a loot hog. So, my pride is a little hurt, but I'll get over it. I only did this post as food-for-thought. You never know when something like this will happen to you.<br>

How are you being punished? From the sound of it there are several items that could have dropped that you could have rolled on. Be happy for the Int/Wis casters that they got a drop that they can use. Next time perhaps you'll get something.<br>

Out of all the things that the Lady will drop a Bard can get (and USE), Crystalline Spear, Dragon Bone Bracelet, McVaxius' Horn of War [Bard ONLY], Runed Bolster Belt, and White Dragon Scales which is for your epic. Casters only get a chance at the Eyepatch, a very rare Kayruuls Mystic Pouch, and there is a Wiz Spell: Ice Comet that drops. There's a staff but its not for Pure Casters. If you ask me, by letting everyone roll on one of the only items that would be worth to an Int/Wis caster, you would be 'punishing' the casters.<br>
<br>
Even if the rules weren't reviewed before the raid, if they say only casters roll there shouldn't be an issue. It's their ball game. They are the Leader. It's their raid.<br>
<br>
Obviously there has been a LOT of discussion on this issue, as has been pointed out, and those who have been playing the game for a LONG time have come up with a solution that most seem to like. Why throw a wrench into it? Without casters you couldn't kill Vox to even get the eyepatch. <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>

&quot;Loot will be handled by rolling on a NBG status. If you can actively use it (as determined by me), then you can use it. I don't want any arguements about loot on the raid, if you are upset about the way something is handled, bring it up on the boards AFTER the raid. I am willing to talk through things of this nature to make people as happy as possible, but I will not do it on the fly in the middle of a raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
You did right to let it slide then, and bring it up on the boards.  This is exactly how I want things like this to proceed.  This way it is out in the open, and I can see what everyone thinks.  If there is an overwhelming response to change something, then I will very well consider the change.  So don't get after him for posting in this way, as that is exactly what I want.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
<br>
&quot;Again, I am not trying to stir controversy. I'm simply a little miffed that I didn't even get a chance to roll. And was VERY embarrased when I was basically shut down in front of a large group before I even had a chance to state a case. But if I had, it only would have made people angry and made me look like a loot hog. So, my pride is a little hurt, but I'll get over it. I only did this post as food-for-thought. You never know when something like this will happen to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I want controversy, that is not a problem.  If I know there is an issue I can handle it, and the boards are the best way to do so.  Raids are not the right place to do them, so I thank you for letting it slide and bringing it to the boards like this.<br>

&quot;As far as the idea goes that a bard wouldn't wear this, well, it's just absurd. I mean, come on? &quot;Monk-item&quot; is the cry of the equipment message boards. And ideas such as &quot;a bard would never wear this&quot; only spreads the lie. This is a character that I have put alot of time and effort into, and have plans for. My enchanter-suit that I am working on will have some value in the future as it has been stated that when bards are &quot;re-balanced&quot; they are looking at bards as a caster class. Absor even said he always felt that bards were casters. Would I not get to roll on a Flowing Though item, even though those are the only pieces in the game that can help my mana regen besides Alt Advancement? Mark my words, things are going to change for bards and we have to be adaptable.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are a lot of thoughts in this, so I will answer them as best as I can.  First of all, my quote was that except in specific circumstances bards will not wear this.  What you are describing here is a &quot;enchanter-suit&quot;, which is alternate equipment that you will wear in specific circumstances.  From my understanding of the way you have phrased this that means that this will be alternate equipment for you, whereas any int/wis caster will have this up except in specific circumstances.  What this means is that they are going to get more value out of it that a bard most likely will.  <br>
<br>
Let me put it to you a different way, except with an item that you are elligeable to roll on.  Lets say that for whatever reason, the discussion came up about clerics changes technically make them a melee class now.  So should they (and possibly other casters by association) be allowed to roll on an RBB?  After all it is a haste item and if clerics are going to melee more shouldn't they get it?  To an effect you can defend that position, but in most cases a cleric is not going to wear the belt, and will waste it in bank/backpack slots or sell it (my opinions here).  So would you think that it was fair to take an item that if you won you would wear all of the time, and give someone that might use it every once in a while (if they don't sell it) a chance to win it?  I think this is a pretty fair analogy.<br>
<br>
Combine that with the amount of stuff that bards can win (they have the highest percentage of dropped items that they can roll for, of any class), with the few things that casters can win.  Then you take in that casters are often asked to die repeatedly in a dragon raid, to regen to full mana quickly so that the raid can continue.  My personal highest death count on a dragon raid (not kcog mind you) was 7 deaths, and I got 90% rezzes for all 7 of those deaths (lost over a yellow of xp).  On that particular raid I was not allowed to roll on anything that dropped, because none of the very rare casters items (and every item that a caster can use is among the rarest tier of items) dropped.  Now would it be fair to take a bard, who at worst dies once, has 4 bard rollable items drop, and then takes a roll on the 1 item that drops that a caster can use?  After an experience like that would you come back to a dragon raid?  If we don't get casters to come back to dragon raids can we continue to host them?<br>
<br>
When looking at these types of issues you have to look at the big picture sometimes.  It may not be the best personal shortterm picture for your class, but it is what is best for the organization.  That is why that rule is in place.  To be blunt we have few enough casters that come on the raids anyway because hardly any items drop.  On a Naggy raid there is exactly one item that I would bother to roll on as an Int Caster with decent but not great items, and that would be off of the Fire Giants.  Sure, there are a few odds and ends (an orb of Tishan with 7 str/sta anyone) that casters can roll on, but it would be a steep downgrade for anyone that even had bad equipment for the level.  So if you take one of the few items left to them, and let others roll on them where does that leave you next time when no clerics, or no enchanters show up?  It is nice to say that these raids are not about loots (and personally to me they aren't, I don't really care about winning myself, but wouldn't mind), but to a high percentage of the people you are depending on it is about the chance for loot.<br>

<br>
Nagafen sometimes drops the Cloak of Flames. There aren't many items, even in Velious or Luclin, that are as wanted by a melee class as a cloak of flames. Excellent haste, good AC, and, if I recall correctly, some pretty good stat boosts. The item is an All/All item, though. I started the restriction (and the other raid leaders have followed suit on this) that only melee classes (which included bards) could roll on it. Sure, an int/wis caster can use it, but will they get the benefit from it that a melee would? Would many of them even wear it on a daily basis? It's one of those items that is really meant for a specific set of classes, so I restricted it to those classes. Yes, there are situations that a caster might use a COF, but chances are the melee will use that every day, as a bread and butter item. <br>
<br>
To get absolutely technical, any item that isn't NO DROP can be used by anyone to improve their gear. They could sell or trade an item they won't use for something they will use. My thoughts were that I'd rather people are rewarded with gear they'll use as opposed to sell. While being a merchant is part of the game (as was long before the Bazaar), the reason for killing a dragon is fun, glory and equipment. I understand you'd want the gear for an &quot;enchanter-suit&quot; situation, as I've seen a great bard who could do what an enchanter did just as well any day of the week. But he'd be the first to admit he wouldn't play that role every day. Bards are one of those classes that have never been handled right by Verant.... they are so versatile that no one knows how to &quot;classify&quot; them. I've usually put them in the hybrid category... the fact that they use less mana on a daily basis than most hybrids, as well as having less mana-required spells, puts them even more away from a caster class in my book.<br>
<br>
In the next few days, we'll be seeing some specific loot rules for our raids stickied to the top of the forums where they are relevant. Hopefully this will clear up any misconceptions before the raids begin about SOP.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

Can win... if they drop. If they don't, and an ALL/ALL item drops you should have the right to roll. +Anyone+ should.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you take in that casters are often asked to die repeatedly in a dragon raid, to regen to full mana quickly so that the raid can continue.

I feel sorry for you, my man. You got hosed, in my humble opinion. And so did everyone else who was not allowed to roll an ALL/ALL items. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now would it be fair to take a bard, who at worst dies once, has 4 bard rollable items drop, and then takes a roll on the 1 item that drops that a caster can use?

<br>
If items are the only reason one comes to a raid, then they probably don't need to come back if it upsets them that much. If class specific items drop, those specific classes should roll. If an ALL/ALL item drops (regardless of whether it's considered a &quot;caster&quot; item, etc.) the ALL/ALL should be able to roll. You can abstain if you wish, but you should at least be allowed to roll. That's been my whole point on this entire post. I can't state it any more plain. I know I have the tide against me, but if there's no difference there is no growth. I'm not saying make the changes overnight. I'm simply saying try and look at a bigger picture. Why not even try it once? If anyone has anything to add to this please do. I'm very far from a perfect person and I look for help every chance I get. But all I see here is &quot;casters get shafted, so let's have a set of rules that allows them first rights.&quot; It's not about casters, melee or hybrids... it's about people. Personally I think a Wizard with a Cloak of Flames would be a pleasant change. But then again, what do I know.<br>

I'm just a bard.<br>

I think this is just going to have to be one of those agree to disagree things.  I can to a certain extent see where you are coming from, but from a leadership position I cannot agree with it.

I doubt you'll find any raiding guilds and alliances on our server that allows everyone to roll on every all/all item.  So it's not just CoG.<br>

As a matter of fact, the Sacred Band, an alliance I helped found, and of which Lautrec is a part, does (or did before I left) have the same exact rule in place for the COF and the Eyepatch in question. And though there have been some who have disagreed with this ruling in the past (I remember a very pissed off ranger in the SB alliance on our very first Vox raid), the majority have agreed with this. Nothing is stopping the caster from selling the item as well, nor is anything stopping you from asking the caster who wins it to sell it to you. <br>
<br>
A future dragon raid leader might change the ruling, and allow an all/all roll. Right now, it's up to Farrnusno to do so, if he feels, as the raid leader, it is the thing to do. <br>
<br>
Again, once I have the loot rules posted and stickied, it will be something you will know ahead of time, and so can make the concious decision not to come if it bothers you. Or to disagree on the forum. As Farrnusno said, you did the right thing bringing it up here, instead of the raid.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

One can't make a different set of loot rules every raid depending on what drops.  We have to make if fair in the long run for the people who attend regularly to encourage regular attendance.  If a bard attended all 5 of these raids they would have had the chance to roll on the following<br>
6 RBB<br>
2 Scale (now bard only rolls)<br>
1 horn (bard only)<br>
2 bracer<br>
2 pouch<br>
1 Crystalline Spear<br>
<br>
The eyepatch is UBER for int/wiz casters who would almost certainly keep it.  Allakazam has a pricecheck (not so accurate of course) of 24kpp for this!  IF a bard did win it, wouldn't most of them sell this and buy something that would help them a LOT more for their 24kpp?  According to KCoG Definitions, this falls into the greed side of things rather than the need side.<br>
<br>
I agree wholeheartedly that there is a big difference between &quot;Use it every day&quot; and &quot;My special XXX suit&quot;.  I see the &quot;special suit&quot; as about half way between &quot;everyday equipment&quot; and &quot;sell to buy something else&quot;.<br>
<br>
I see two defining and complementary themes for loot at KCoG plus an all important rule 3:<br>
<br>
1) Need before greed (NBG) = Use it all the time &gt; Use it sometimes but mostly not &gt; sell for plat<br>
<br>
2) Fairness = Try to have at least SOMETHING for everyone<br>
<br>
3) The raid leader sets loot rules.  To make a moderatly absurd example, If the raid leader wants to distribute the loot in alpahbetical order and this is stated in the raid signup and raid rules...  That's the way it's gonna be.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me?<br>

There are alot of &quot;if's&quot; in the previous posts... &quot;if a bard had gone on all of these raids&quot; &quot;if the bards had a chance to roll&quot;, etc... but I'm talkng about the raid I went on. Not the others. I wasn't aware of these loot rules, as I haven't been on a KCoG raid before and happened to be in Everfrost when there was a call for a Vox raid. But now I see. From now on, unless it has bard listed as a class on the item, I will not roll. ALL/ALL items are obviously not intended for my class, so I'll leave them alone unless I pick them up myself while soloing or adventuring with my group of real life friends. No hard feelings, folks... I'm just a little dissappointed. I figured there would be a little more understanding in the Council. But enough politics. I'm out.<br>

And, by the way... bard mana is not Charisma based; it's Intelligence. If you don't believe me, please refer to Everquest.com, Allahkazam, EQCasters realm or (if these don't convince you) sign on your bard alternate and have an enchanter cast KEI on you. There's no charisma buff, but the 25 points of Intelligence will definitely knock your mana bar down a little. <br>

<br>
As someone who leads sometimes as many as 60 people over 6 or 7 raids, the greater &quot;good&quot; has to win out over individual desires sometimes. <br>
<br>
No one said you couldn't roll on any all/all items. You're perfectly welcome to roll on a Cloak of Flames, and that is an All/All item. Same for the weight-reducing pouch. If I'm not mistaken, bards are even allowed to roll on an orb of tishan from Nagafen (little fuzzy on that one, it didn't drop often). You're in the same boat as a lot of rangers and SK's I know, who also wanted to roll on the Eyepatch. <br>
<br>
Now that I have sticky powers (like Spiderman, yo!), I've stickied the loot rules to the top of the Dragon raid forum. In your situation (just being in Everfrost when the call was put out), you'd still have probably been surprised by the loot roll. <br>

<br>
Loot rules are something that you will encounter where ever you raid, and for the chance to go on those raids you will have to accept those rules. Your alliance does Vox/Naggy and last I heard they had the same rules for the drops off these dragons, so when you do these mobs with your alliance you accept these rules.<br>
<br>
As has been stated before casters get the short end of the stick when it comes to these raids and the rarety of the drops only makes it worse. So give them a break <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bthesilentwatchmb ><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thackray/warder.jpg border=0></a>

All of these could be obtained with a little patience and one or two groups. Now yeah, I would be complaining if I didn't get to roll on one of these. But just See Invisible with Wis/Int modifiers. As a Ranger I need my Str/AC/Agil/Dex/Sta before I need Wis/Int modifier. Yes a Bards mana comes from his Int but again there are better items out there that you could get.<br>

So to make a short post LONG. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Give the casters the Eyepatch.
