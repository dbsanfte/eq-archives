<br>
I am not the greatest player in this game but nor am I the worst.  This mess about Trucidation is nonsense.  <br>
<br>
We all exist in EverQuest to play and have fun.  It has become evident that the Council of Guilds is a group to conduct a way of cycling all of the guilds to be able to fight the best of spawns and group guilds together to take out a spawn.<br>
<br>
With that said,  I am a member of Trucidation and was a member of Norrath Terror Corps.  I have never witnessed any of the ill-mannered things that all of these posts have referred to but I have heard the rumors.  I try to help people and not cause much trouble.  We all have caused trouble at one time or another.  I am not saying what past occurences of Shadowland were right nor am I condemning them.  I do not know much of him except when I need help he is there to help.  I am short tempered too and Storm's Justice can vouch for that.  I caused trouble in Storm's Justice as the Officers saw it and I saw it as the guild's co leader giving one of my friends a hard time and me defending her.  I did not think before I acted and met the consquinces for it.  I may have been wrong and I know I was wrong in my actions.<br>
<br>
Now Shadowland may have caused trouble in the past and may be short tempered.  But you are not seeing what he has done.  I know he will not admit it but he knows that he has created a bad rep with most of the guilds.  I do not think that gives this governing body a reason to deny a guild a chance to participate in these raids.  I am sure he wants to step up to the plate and start over but not by asking him to do newbie stuff.  By giving him specific tasks that he must do in order to get into KCoG you are acting as a governing body.<br>
<br>
I did say governing body which your vision says is not true but as I have come to know it the CoG is in fact a governing body.  You may not mean to be but the moment you introduced a schedule into camping monsters you took control.  Basicly what I am saying is that if Trucidation decieded to go and fight a certain mob that is in your schedule they would never get a chance because of your body.<br>
<br>
The new members of Trucidation want to have the same chance as everyone else and as of right now it seems that we are already being judged and sentenced because of Shadowland and NTC.<br>
<br>
I ask of you, NO, I beg of you to let the guild Trucidation join the Karana Council of Guilds and take Shadowland into some of your raids and demonstrate to him what a leader should be.  Please do not bring up the past and start over.<br>
<br>
I expect to get responses contridicting this.  If I am wrong please correct me.<br>
<br>
Thankyou for your time.<br>

The Karana Guild Central(KGC) does that. These are two entirely different organizations.<br>
<br>
And the only thing KCoG does by that schedule is run raids when the turn(as set by KGC) comes up. At that time, it's just a matter of if you are in the scheduled place at the scheduled time with your entry fee. All of these turns are announced ahead of time on this board, with a sign-up thread. Which, according to what I have read and seen, is just a guide and NOT written in stone.<br>
<br>
Just keep in mind that NTC earned a bad reputation due to the actions of some of its members, and sadly because of that, when most of those former NTC members show up in a new guild, said guild is going to be under the same bad rep as the previous guild with those same members. That's a shame, but thats the way things are. As I tell my children all the time, &quot;No one ever said life was supposed to be fair.&quot; <p>Mairi<BR>

<br>
Second, Shadowlands is apparently your co-guild leaders.  As such we must assume he can and does speak for your guild.  Read his posts.  They may start out fine, but they always degenerate into profanity and insults and personal attacks.  There's no excuse for that.  Even if someone offered the same.  You dont see me going off on him just because he calls me an idiot and fool.  <br>
<br>
You cant force anyone to see anything.  These threads have shown that.  I dont think you can sit there and say that most of us dont have cause to dislike Shadowlands, and by extent Trucidation.  I dont care who started this, it isnt relevant.  Shadowlands took it a level beyond what it was by insulting, in the name of Trucidation, all of KCoG.  Is that the sort of leader you want?  Well, it is your choice.<br>
<br>
This isnt a question of bringing up the past.  Its a question of him making things right.  If he cannot bend to do so, then frankly I dont want him standing next to me.  I dont need someone who will FD to avoid death when the going is rough and we need every person on the raid.  He has shown he is more concerned with his own person honor than that of his guild.  That is not what KCoG is about.  When he can understand that, and apologize for his behavior, then I'm sure we'll be here to listen.  Until then thats how it is.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for the regular members who may or may not know whats going on.  But as long as at least one of your guild leaders insists on going about his personal vendetta thats how it is.<br>

We look to the KCoG to help us acheive that.  <br>
<br>
I understand that posts were deleted from the register board.  Were the original post at all offensive?  I have not seen it.  <br>
<br>
Please take a moment to consider the what we ask.  I have forged friendships with members of Trucidation and do not wish to leave them to be able to go on a raid.  We all know that an individule that does not have any association with anyone else can not organize a raid.<br>

Shadowland's posts DID start out fine until he started to get attacked and yes some of us do have a temper problem as Renandarr stated.  You people (the ones who have replied) seem to disregard all of the decent things he has said and turned everything around which has made this quite hard and frustrating for all of us here.<br>
<br>
NO there are not a ton of NTC members in Trucidation.  Only people that I trust and know for a fact are responsible and not bad people (real life friends).  There is no need to start a new guild in order to do the same things in a previous guild.  If we enjoyed that than I would have NEVER started Trucidation.  Yes maybe Shadowland has made us look bad but, haven't I and Renandarr at least tried to fix things?  I think so and I think we should be given a second chance.  If you do not want to invite Shadowland along that is just fine, I don't think it would bother him all that much but, for the rest of us we would like to be invited.<br>
<br>
Once again I MUST bring this up ... the members of KCoG *ARE* judging us by one person in which case they are judging an invdivual.  I would like you to re-read your vision maybe make some adjustments to that or at least follow it.  I read this vision thinking that you would not judge my guild or myself or anyone but, I suppose I was wrong.<br>

<br>
However, that does not excuse his recent behavior.  He had a problem with a SINGLE person here, and he ended taking it out on everyone.  Thats not how things work here.  Its not that we're disregarding anything, but it does not excuse his rude behavior.  Period.  You dont build up a credit account of good behavior that you can then use to justify rude behavior later.  Either you have it always, or not.<br>
<br>
KCoG is not judging anyone here.  The people that make up KCoG, however, can and do have their own opinions.  And thats what we're expressing here.  I have seen nothing saying KCoG rejects you.  I have seen nothing saying KCoG will have nothing to do with you.  I have only seen individuals stepping forward and saying your behavior is not acceptable to them.<br>
<br>
Neither of you have done anything to repair the damage done to your guilds name by its leader.  Or co-leader.  When a guild leader goes off like that, it damages their entire guild.  I dont know what others would ask of you, but I for one would like to see actual change in your guild.  I'd like to see do things for the server that you dont benefit from.  Take time to run events.  Until you can demonstrate that you understand you were wrong and why, I dont see how you could ever fit in here.<br>
<br>
Your guild reputation wasnt damaged by just anyone.  It was damaged by someone who claimed to be your guild leader, then your co-leader.  And he has yet to apologize for his behavior here to everyone.  What started out as a simple matter between Shadowlands and Haemish has turned into a smat between Trucidation and KCoG.  And we werent the ones to start it.  I dont care how many times you want to say Haemish started it.  Haemish in no way speaks for all of KCoG and yet Shadowlands took his anger out on everyone.<br>
<br>
Its not a question of starting over.  Its a question of you showing that you have changed.  Until you can do that, this isnt the place for you.<br>

<br>
Also, I was not even necessarily agreeing with Staar, but conceding that while Staar might have had a few points, they did not justify any behavior or actions taken here.<br>
<br>
Unlike you I am not afraid to give some grounds in the hope of reaching some compromise.  You, obviously, are unable to grasp the concept.<br>
<br>
As for profanity, its the recourse of the small mind and weak argument.  Its used by those who cannot express themselves in any other way.  In the same way children have temper tantrums when they cant get their way, its a verbal tantrum.  Sure the meaning is the same, but the delivery is far different.<br>
<br>
So whats the real matter here Shadowlands?  Are you afraid to say you were wrong?  No one here is defending you.  Doesnt that tell you anything?  No one else here on this thread or any of the other ones you've posted has decended to your level of name calling.  Is that all you have left?<br>

As for Staar, I'm sorry.  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that your not Shadowlands, however, letting him post something like that simply erodes any sort trust you might have been building.<br>

Appologies ahead of time for using possibly atrocious words in their proper context.<br>
<br>
Moron - old term used for describing metally retarded people, no mean conotation attached.<br>
Jackass - crossbreed between a donkey and a mule<br>
----also seen as Ass - short form of Jackass or a descriptive word for a person's buttocks<br>
Retard - old term used to descride low mental capability, no mean conotations involved<br>
Homo - Homogenized milk<br>
Bitch - female dog<br>
@#%$ - fabricated word describing fecese<br>
@#%$ - most versatile fabricated word in the english language. only recently accepted in the dictionary.<br>
Hell - (concidered a swear by some) word describing a biblical place ruled by the devil, becefilis, diablo.. whatever you want to call him.<br>
@#%$ (you) - a type of curse (eg. witches curse)<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe I have written out enough. The only reason someone swears is because they are not lingual enough to find a better discriptive word.<br>

From the beginning when Shadowland denounced NTC because as guild leader he did not want to put up with childish behavior.  Nor, did he make any amends for the inexcusable behavior that his former guild members did.<br>
<br>
The response to those post we from members of the council that felt do to NTC getting a bad reputation and Shadowlands not wanting to deal with it, changed the name of the guild.   Shadowland said something to the effect that one person can give a guild a bad reputation that he feels is unfixable, hence the end of NTC.   <br>
<br>
Shadowland has done nothing but insulted and acted with the highest level of immaturity.  He has attack everyone, because he was unable to see one very important point.  <br>
<br>
As guild leader, you take responsibility for the guild and for your members.  That is what being a guild leader is all about.  IF you are not able to handle the heat for something that you guild members did that negatively affected others and in turn negatively affected you guild, then you have no business being a guild leader. <br>
<br>
KCoG is not a governing body, that is why it relies on the guild leaders to step in when members of a guild are causing harm or problems, in turn you fail this council once, by not doing this with NTC.  You basically washed your hands of the situation and started another guild.  <br>
<br>
Now, the reason that you where not given any chance by the council members is because what are we to except?  You as guild leader of NTC refused to take responsibility for members, and basically said that you where ending NTC because of the now bad rep that your guild has gotten.  Of course most people are going to think that you are going to just slap another guild name on and try to start over.  Shadowlands did nothing to disprove the impression that he left us all with.  <br>
<br>
INSTEAD, he starts a post attacking Haemish and the council as a whole.  This was handled as poorly as it could have been handled.  He attacked the councils &quot;vision&quot; twisting every point to be in his favor.  But, there is one point that you can not twist here Shadowlands, you behavior is unacceptable.  You are guild leader of Trucidation and representive of your guild and because of your insults and childish behavior you have people that are not in favor of you joining this council and that is something that you did yourself.  <br>
<br>
Why would we want to give your new guild a chance now? You may have very fine people in your guild, however because of your behavior they will pay the price of a bad reputation, this time because of you.  The way you have gone on and on, each post making people dislike you more and more.  <br>
<br>
The thing is and there is no way around it, is that you are a guild leader, you are suppose to lead your members and yet, you have let your own pride and temper dictate your behaviors on this board.  Not, only have you been disrespectful to the other guilds that make up this council, but you have made it very hard for your guild to be a member here.  Furthermore, each post that you keep doing trying to justify your actions is just making everything all that more worst for you and Trucidation.<br>
<br>
A guild leader is suppose to represent his/her guild, a guild leaders actions are to reflect the guild itself.  The impression that you have left with this council is a very poor one. <br>
<br>
I do feel for your members, I know for one if I acted so poorly and gotten my guild disallowed from KCoG events because of my poor behavior that I would be either replaced or my members would leave the guild.  And unfortunately your members will pay the price for your behaviors because they have chosen to follow you.<br>
<br>
You reap what you sow Shadowland.  You got treated like crap because you disrespected this council with your posts. Respect is a two way street, you don't get respect by disrespecting others, no matter what you think. <br>
<br>
Although you are asking to be apart of this council, I really can not think of anything that you could do now to repair all the damage that you have done and I do not see that you want the damage to be repaired either, you continue with your post, each one a little more immature as the ones before.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that your guild is a victim here, and that is correct, they are a victim because of you.  You are the one that has damned your own cause.  As much as you want to shake off that responsibility, you are the one that has started this.  If you had made any efforts to make a fresh start, then I would have backed you and I think others would have been willing to give you a shot, but you didn't.  You threw tantrum and now you have alot of people against you because of it.<br>
<br>
And please do not tell me to &quot;shut up&quot; like you did after my other post.  I am a proud member of this council and so is my guild. And your attacks against this council include us bacuse we are members.  I am a guild leader and I take responsibility for my members and their actions as every guild leader does.  Why do you think that you are above that?   <br>
<br>
Its called responsibility here Shadowland.  Own up to it.  You are responsible for your members and your actions.  And you could change your guild name a thousand times and yet if you don't correct your behavior this will be the result every time. <p>As Always,<br><br><A href=" http://www.geocities.com/karanadp/Enter.html"><img src="http://desirrae.homestead.com/files/Desirraechievous1.gif"></a><br><br><i>Of the 44th Circle.</i><br><br><b><i>"The mold of your life is in your hands to break" --The Hobbit</b></i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udesirrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Desirrae</A> at: 10/14/01 2:07:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadowlandtrucidation.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadowlandTrucidation</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/15/01 10:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Desirrae</span><hr size=1> Desirrae !!! give it up chick, go cook and clean or somthing and stop worry about my posts since they are SOOOO CHILDISH, why not ignore them? thats what ADULTS do to children that annoy them right???<br>

He reminds me of all those wondeful public school kids who used to walk around talking trash about how cool they were and how I sucked going to a private high school.  Of course, most of them now are in prison or asking me if I want fries with my drink.  I'd gloat if I didnt find it all so pathetic.  Its not like they didnt have promise at one time either.<br>
<br>
There are doers and there are losers.  We've been there and done that here.  The posts are in the Plane Raid and Dragon Raid forums to prove that.  We've worked together here.  Then there are losers.  Who simply want to force everyone down to their level because that is all they understand.  Sure, anyone can make a computer.  I taught my friends 6 year old how to screw in a mother board.  She still has problems pushing ram chips in tho.  Knowing D00d speak and being able to build a computer is no standard of intelligence.  Try coming back when you have something intelligent to say.  Besides how the world is unfair and you are owed something.<br>
<br>
Still, in the interests of compromise, let me say this.<br>
<br>
Welcome to KCoG Shadowlands, Staar, and Trucidation.  Yup, here you are.  Your in.<br>
<br>
Of course, your guild is pretty much banned from participating in plane or dragon raids.  But hey, your in.  Have fun, and remember, when you come back here to complain, you had only yourselves to blame.  When you can learn and prove here that you are responsible adults that understand that they are not the center of the world, then perhaps we can see about letting you and your members back in.  Till then, your nothing more than NTC with a new wrapper and jinggle.<br>
