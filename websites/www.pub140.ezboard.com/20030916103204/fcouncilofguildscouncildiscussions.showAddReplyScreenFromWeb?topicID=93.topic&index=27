<br>
First of all Lautrec, no one should be sending you ugly tells.  That is wrong on a lot of levels, and if it continues let ME know about it and I will resolve it for you.  People may not agree with you, but that is no reason for harrassment.<br>
<br>
Second of all Lautrec, you are not making friends here.  You have managed to insult virtually all of KCoG's past and current leadership.  That requires some effort, and is a dubiously impressive mark.  Unfortunately it is not the way to proceed if you want to actually change things.  A lot of people's statements you have maybe read wrong or are deliberately twisting.  For instance peoples numerous attempts to explain to you that bards are charisma based.  Yes, they actually get their mana pool from int, but virtually all the songs they use are given a resist rate off of your charisma, so that having a high charisma will help you much more than having a high int.  That is what they meant when they said that bards are charisma based rather than int based.  That is like a Paladin saying that since he gets his mana from Wisdom that wisdom is the only stat he should work on, when really it is a secondary important stat because he really needs the melee based stats more.  Also you should not ignore those that have more experience than you.  For instance Lagdalen who you have insulted several times in this thread, is not only a previous dragon leader, but also has a (I believe) 53 Bard named Vree.  Among numerous other alts in the 50's.  I would really really be surprised if you knew game dynamics better than her, because she has been playing for a long time.<br>
<br>
Frankly, telling you which all/all items you are allowed to roll for is our job.  You can wear whatever you want, but when it comes down to it, we have to make this as fair to as many people so we WILL restrict rolls to make it fair as such.  I have trouble believing that you cannot understand this concept after being in an alliance like SB.  SB restricts the items the same way, so why are you not blasting people there with this stuff?  I am sure Rbecka (a leader I have a lot of respect for) would be interested in hearing your arguments and dismissing them much more abrubtly than we have here.  Throwing in the &quot;it's people like you who ruin the experience for myself and others&quot; is not only a low blow, but it is inaccurate and can be twisted around other ways.  For instance I might say the same thing about you, because you are not willing to step back and look at it from a leadership standpoint, you are only willing to look at it from what you could possibly gain from it.  So what gives you the right to ruin my experience?  Obviously I have to deal with things like that, so it gets much more complicated, but when you deal with just the base reality you are being just as unfair to me as I am to you.<br>
<br>
I do not hold any grudge, or anything like that. Nor should anyone else (/em looks around the room daring a response).  You are welcome to come on further raids with us, and there will be no hard feelings.  Just remember, that other people want to be able to win stuff besides bards, and sometimes you just have to look at the whole picture.  Incidentally if you do not want to be insulted, you might want to look at holding your tongue sometimes, and not insulting others, especially those like Lagdalen, Kommisar, Haemish, and others who have earned our respect many times over.  I have a feeling that is the reason behind whoever it was that sent you that tell, and despite the fact that it was inappropriate for that person to do so, you might want to look at why they felt the need.<br>
<br>
As a side point, according to current rules (which I need to get around to rewriting), with Naggy and Vox anyone from an alliance is welcome to come.  Those that are in a guild that is in the rotation by itself are the only ones restricted, but Silver Daggers is only in the rotation via the Sacred Band alliance, which means they are welcome to come.  The only restriction I place there is that no one that is in a guild that is in the rotations in any other way may roll on epic items (scales and books). <p>Farrnusno <BR>

You are an exception to that. <br>
<br>
However, the loot rules were written to be as fair as possible for the most people at once. As all of the loot rules I've ever written have said, NO LOOT POLICY is 100% fair 100% of the time. There will be situations where one individual isn't given what he considers as his fair share. So long as you only have yourself to consider, you can make anything fair. When you put more than 1 person into a situation where not everyone is going to be rewarded, you will never be completely and totally 100% fair. That's life. Dragon raids often have up to 60 people in attendance, and usually not more than 4-6 items will drop from the beastie. Hard to divy those up completely fairly. The loot rules as I wrote them &quot;back in the day&quot; and as they've been modified to this date, are as fair as they are probably every going to get for the largest numbers of people possible. Sometimes, the needs of the few must be sacrificed for the needs of the many to be met.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
It's every raider's responsibility to familiarize themselves with the loot rules of a raid prior to joining and by joining the raid - there's a tacit implication that by joining you accept those rules.  You should know that by now.  The loot rules for Vox/Naggy fights have been posted for over 3 years now, so for you to bring this up now confuses me.  These rules were posted to head off issues like these because they came up time and time again at every raid until Haemish and the KCoG council put their collective foot down and said from here on in - this is the way it's going to be, if you agree to it, Great, then raid with us - if not - then be on your way.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, maybe you're trying to spark some interesting debates, or just vent your frustrations.  Whichever it is you're doing, please keep in mind one thing - you bear the Silver Dagger name wherever you go - and people's impressions of you will be their impression of our guild.  That's not something the SD officers take lightly either.  <br>
<br>
I'd suggest you get these issues straightened out - because like the posters above said, we have the exact same loot rules, plus a hundred other class restricted loot rules.<br>
<br>
As far as Dagger participation in this KCoG raid, I'm not sure if this raid was one of them, but from time to time, a raid leader will announce a &quot;Call to Arms&quot; and invite members from the Silver Daggers to participate.  Though this is discouraged by the KCoG - it's the raid leader's responsibility to assemble an effective fighting force, and hence at their discretion.  Additionally there was a vote held over 2 years ago that agreed to allowing up to 6 additional members from other planar/dragon capable guilds to participate on KCoG raids.  I don't know if that was ever made official, but I do know that it was allowed.  This can arguably be construed as double dipping, but again - a raider's participation at a KCoG raid is also at the discretion of the raid leader. <p>Ephemeral Bliss<BR>

<br>
Case is closed. Please... let's just leave this alone.<br>
<br>
I apologise to Ephemeral, the entire Silver Daggers officers corps, the Sacred Band Alliance, Farsunmo, Haemish, and pretty much everyone who has posted here since I started this thread. Now I feel lower than dirt. I appreciate that. <br>
<br>
I wasn't even going to come back here and look at this stuff, but someone named Kabrak sent me a tell saying that Ephemeral had posted here. Wouldn't give any other information about the person. Was a level 1 wood elf.<br>
<br>
Again, I had heard of the KCoG but HAD NOT read any of the rules. It was a spur-of-the moment decision to go as I was already in Everfrost just hanging around with my real life fiancee's character and thoguht I'd tag along. I won't bother any of you again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions>Council Discussions</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
