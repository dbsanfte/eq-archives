<br>
<br>
Well, I am back now and spent quite a while re-reading these boards and the various threads that were on it over the past couple of days.<br>
To me, there is only one real, viable response (at this time). It is the same one that was used when EW, SS, RLs etc decide to try FFA on Karana:<br>
<br>
1) The existing rotations shall remain in place.<br>
<br>
2) Guilds are allowed to get outside help from *any* guild on Karana to kill their target mob in a timely manner. No sanctions shall be applied to a guild seeking outside help. Edit: This is only for the duration of the current situation.<br>
<br>
3) All Guilds taking part in the KGC are strongly encouraged to help other guilds in taking down a large mob when they are asked to help. They should turn all loot over to the guild that is currently up for the large mob, and the rotation will move along. <br>
<br>
4) It is the responsibility of the guild that is up for the MOB to watch for it. Durn it, if you are up - get support there ASAP or you will be part of the problem.<br>
<br>
5) I would recommend forming a KGC chat channel. No need to password protect it, since any password would most likely be given to those we do not want to have it. Willing guild leaders should join and watch. Check who is on there before communicating and use it to muster forces quickly if needed.<br>
<br>
6) Do not count on the &quot;uber&quot; guilds for help. Some of them may well be willing to help, but some will not. It is going to be up to the mid and smaller guilds on Karana to drive this forward. It is really up to you to preserve the KGC rotations through your actions. <br>
<br>
7) At this time, no sanctions shall be taken against Nightbane, and their guild officers shall retain access to these boards. If their guild members continue to kill KGC targets in early January - then sanctions may be considered and implemented quickly. They are strongly encouraged to clean up the mess being caused by some of their guild members.<br>
<br>
(Note: I will lock this thread if it turns into a Nightbane discussion at this time.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If the KGC reacts strongly to this, then Dazzadi, etc., will quickly realize they will not be able to compete against 50+ guilds with a strong presence every time zone. Or of they do, will be spending all of their game time trying to find one mob that is up (which to me would not be that much fun). If the KGC does not react strongly to this, then the guilds involved with the KGC need to really look at their commitment to the policies established here.<br>
<br>
9) Under *no* circumstances should guilds of the KGC engage in activity that could get them warned, banner or suspended and should avoid the use of foul or improper language.<br>
<br>
If it looks like those not recognizing the KGC rotation are going to engage a target before forces are ready. It is strongly encouraged to aggro and kite those targets which can be kited. <br>

Why do you think the targets got missing so quickly with out anyone noticing ? No one's gonna notice a group of 65's heading down toward juggs in seb, no one will pay attention to 6 65 level peeps in DL, and EJ stays so desolate except for the drop off to zone to tt no one will ever notice. What are you going to do question every level 65 in the zone ? And if they are going to kill the dragon, exactly how will you stop them ? Sanctions ? dont make me laugh this game can be soloed through what sanctions would actually hurt a person ? The only form or retaliation you have would be to train them, and then you would get in real trouble well if a guide or GM saw you do it you would......... I rest my case<br>

<br>
Shattering Steel was never a serious threat.  They were a joke and an annoyance.  But never a threat.  Its hard to call a guild a threat to the rotations that has a hard time breaking into PoF.<br>
<br>
Remember what happened to them?  After about 3 weeks where was SS?  Ummm...hmmmm...oh yeah...They were restricted to PoG.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because everytime they went anywhere else the rest of the server pop'd in and wiped the zone for them and kept it wiped except for the 1 spawn they were able to claim.<br>
<br>
Obviously you'd have to treat Nightbane differently.  The result, however, would be the same.  You think a raiding guild has nothing else better to do than send a couple of groups around trying to kill mobs and fighting others for them?  Why do you think the KGC was formed in the first place.  And by whom again?  You think it was the small guilds that formed the KGC?  You think it was the small guilds that keep adding new rotations in?  You think its the small guilds that push for change?<br>
<br>
I think not.<br>
<br>
The KGC works for one reason and one reason only.  Both the large and small guilds are willing to work together because frankly we ALL have better things to do than to sit around a zone training Sev over everyone.  If you think FFA would be such a great idea, fork over the 50 bucks and move over to Mith Marr and play with the big boys.<br>
<br>
Nightbane?  Nightbane is not an uber guild.  Karana has no uber guild in the Fires of Heaven or Afterlife sense of the word.  Just because they can field 1 or 2 groups to keep 10 or so rotations down doesnt mean they're uber.  A true uber guild can keep every named mob from Kunark on through Luclin perma killed, while still blowing through the Tier 2 and 3 and 4 planes in PoP.  At the same time.<br>
<br>
Thats an uber guild.<br>
<br>
Nightbane is simply the largest of the large guilds on Karana.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because with the KGC there's simply no need to a single uber guild to form.  We can act civil to each other, and work together here.  You know, in a mature adult fashion.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are downsides.  In this case you cannot simply take a target whenever you want to, and you do sacrafice a lot of time between hits.  Although that is getting addressed.<br>
<br>
I would point out, many of the largers guilds have been the reason the KGC hasnt changed.  They simply like things the way they are.  Keeping the status quo benefits only the larger guilds for the most part.  And they know it.<br>
<br>
You can call it whatever you want.  Karana is the one server in the game where you can say that if you wait long enough, you'll eventually get what you want.  On any other server you have 1 choice.  Join an uber guild.  Its that simple.  You think you could compete with one of them in an FFA situation?<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
Anyway, go to Mith Mar and start a nice little friendly guild.  Full of friends who simply want to log in for a few hours a day and play and have fun.<br>
<br>
See how long it lasts.<br>
<br>
If you want power, go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If you want to have friends and play and not worry about where the next train is coming from because 2 guilds are attempting to KS Klandicar all over the zone, there is only 1 server.<br>
<br>
Having the right to kill any mob at any time is meaningless when none of the mobs are ever up.<br>

People who want something will not respect other people's rights or feelings at all in-game. They will take what they want unless there are more people who say &quot;You can't have it now&quot; than there are who will take it without permission. When Karana players and guilds alike can reach a consensus over mobs the minute they get there, without being concerned over getting their epic first, or completing their set of uber armor, THEN the KGC will no longer be needed. <br>
<br>
In other words, never. <br>
<br>
The leaders of guilds on Karana have decided that they wish to sacrifice their time to tracking rotations as opposed to fighting tooth and nail every minute something pops. It is a tradeoff. Every once in a while, some dickhead with an agenda like Zfalcon or Dazzadi comes along and tries to mess with the KGC, for no other reason than to stir shit up because he likes it when people get mad. Unfortunately, he dupes a number of people into following him, people who eventually figure out that they've made pariahs of themselves with most of the guilds on the server and gotten nothing good for it.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

What will happen when you can only kill that dragon once a year ? Some people arent going to wait (do you really want to) it doesnt have to be a guild that takes out rotation mobs either PoP has trivalized every encounter post luclin and made luclin encounters much easier, Dragons are like fire bettles to some people something to merly be crushed on a whim (even enchanters can solo whoshi now :P). I'm not some blind fool who doesnt know what goes on here and what goes on at other servers, I know what goes on behind the walls of the KGC I had access for over a year before I got tired of reading the board that closely resembled some newbs arguing in EC. The KGC was great in the beginning and for a while, but all good things come to an end. I hope they can work out a new system but I can't see what could possibly be done with in their power, we need a split but we aren't gonig to get it. I would happliy move to a FFA server just to see what it's like if I would'nt lose my equipment (don't even mention stormhammer) I like new experiances and a challange, trying to be guild X to the target would most definatly be a rush and exciting. When we come up for a target I am like &quot;Oh that guy agian yeah yeah ill be right there&quot; and find it rather boring being handed things is fun for a while but gets old after the first few times its just going thru the motions. And I dont care how uber a guild is they can't kill everything that is unless the guild contians half the server population, and well perma raiding is no fun either...<br>
<br>
On a side note I have always respected the KCoG and helped lead many dragon and plane raids in my earlier days but it's not my nature to powder coat things I say it like is. The plain and simple truth........ <p>Yizelar Kontrol&lt;br&gt;<br>

<br>
It also depends on the type of spin you put on it.<br>
<br>
Frankly if these rotations are trivial (and they are to people like Dazz) then why does he bother doing them?  If he, and others like him, are simply out for adventure and the thrill of taking a target down fast, then why does he go after trivial targets?<br>
<br>
Because he is a bully.<br>
<br>
No matter how you spin it, thats the bottom line.  There are dozens of targets he could go after.  He could race others for the Queen in Chardok, or THO, or IV, or Terris Thule, or any of a dozen different named across the lands.  But they dont.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Again, because those ARE challenges.  Plus, the Kunark Dragons and mobs like Zlandicar drop loot he can sell for 150kpp+.  Because he, and others like him, are only out for themselves.  They could care less who they hurt because they think they are strong and others are weak.  Sound familier.  It sure does to me.  It reminds me of that guy who always beat up the members of the chess team because he could.  He sounds like that guy who thought of himself as the ruler of the school because he was the biggest guy out there.<br>
<br>
Well, it wasnt right in school, and it sure as hell isnt right here in EQ.<br>
<br>
There are dozens of mobs that are challenges.  There are dozens of mobs that drop items better than these rotational mobs.  There are dozens of places anyone can go to for a challenge.<br>
<br>
The only reason to grab rotation targets out of order is to be a bully and because you cant handle a real challenge.<br>
<br>
No matter how its prettied up, its all the same.  You want a challenge, take out Vindi with 1 group.  It can and has been done.  You want a challenge, do the same to Dain 425 or AoW.  You want a challenge, do Rhag 1-IV.  You want a challenge head on down and do the Burrower cycle with a single group or two.  But dont tell me taking out any of the non-Velious+ mobs is a challenge and therefor thats why your doing it.<br>
<br>
As for any other arguments, go to another server.  If FFA is all its cracked up to be and you are that good, then re-equiping yourself shouldnt be a problem should it?  I mean, it should be easy to make a few friends and go out and kill a few dozen mobs and get your stuff back right?<br>
<br>
Oh wait.  You cant do that because the real uber guilds on all the other servers keep all the good mobs perma killed from Fear mini's on up.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, and guilds like Fires of Heaven or Unity or Afterlife do contain half the server.  Every server with the exception of Karana has a guild that can field upwards of 500 people.  There is only 1 server where small guilds do more than simply serve as farm guilds for the uber guilds.  Only 1 server where you can see your epic mob even once a year.  The grass always seems greener next door, but I can assure you its painted.<br>
<br>
Frankly though, it all comes down to respect.  Do you respect others regardless of whether they are worthy of it or reciprocate it?<br>
<br>
Let me explain something quickly.<br>
<br>
No one remembers who founded The Haven or Ash or Grey Hawke or Valoran or Fama Volat or Blue Ribbon other than its members.  No one remembers The Combine other than a few old timers.  No one knows many of the guild leaders of most guilds.  Hell, most dont even know many of the guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
Close to half or more of the server knows who Haemish was.<br>
<br>
Even though he hasnt played the game in well over a year.  They remember.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because both the Silver Daggers and KCoG were his legacy.  It was founded upon respect of others and fairness always.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you could say it doesnt really matter as its just a game and who cares what others think of you in 10 years.  And to an extent thats true.  But then, who cares about honor and integrity and sense of duty?  Those things too only really mean anything to you.  And yet they too are important because they are what define you.  When you are true to yourself others recognize that and respect it.<br>
<br>
And in the end thats what people like Dazz and Zfalcon simply cant stand.  They cannot stand, as the bully in school couldnt, seeing others being better than themselves simply by helping others.  They understood at a deeper level that strength of character was something they couldnt beat and they resented that in those that had it.<br>
<br>
Call it whatever you like, but I ask this of everyone here.<br>
<br>
What will your legacy be? Will it be one of tolerance and respect to others?  Or will it simply be one of selfishness and greed.<br>
<br>
The choice is yours and yours alone.  No one can make it for you or force it upon you.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I admit I feel jealous and even hate it when people start linking items I dont have and want and will never see because I choose my path.  I hate it when I see a druid walking around offering to sell a Cowl of Mortality.  I hate knowing I've never had more than 3kpp in the bank because I dont farm and pass on rolls in favor of others who might use it.<br>
<br>
But.<br>
<br>
Then I walk into a strange zone with my friends and my guild.  And we are greeted by those we dont even know or remember fondly.  People are willing to share their camp spots with us and invite us into their groups.  We dont know them, but they remember us.  We go where we will and people know that we stand for something greater than ourselves.  And in the end, thats what matters to me.<br>
<br>
One day when I leave EQ people will remember me.  People who I never met, people who didnt know me really.  People will remember my guild and KCoG and smile.  When I leave EQ I will leave knowing I made the EQ experience better for many people and never by stepping on someone else.  There are many other people, on the other side of these monitors, who will remember.  And I will have made a difference.<br>
<br>
Now what does all this have to do with the KGC?  Pretty much nothing, except that it all starts with you.  Dont worry what others think.  Dont worry about what others do.  Worry only about what you are doing.  Everything else will take care of itself.<br>
<br>
Be fair, respect others, and do the right thing even if its not the right thing for you, and even the KGC will begin to make sense.<br>
<br>
Dont, and you simply become part of the problem instead of the solution.<br>
<br>
The choice is yours.  What will you stand for?<br>

Maybe people real dont realize why so many want the KGC around.  It not just small guilds, guilds that are considered to be the big boys on this server are for it.   I know some of nightbane and the one's I know dont like rotations but the do understand why they are here and why its important to keep them around.<br>
<br>
The one thing that has made the KGC work is all pretty much want to keep our server nice and civil.  If guilds are allowed to run havok on all mobs that are rotation, people like me who cant join the big boys cause the time it takes is to much, the KGC has helped me see my goals in this game, it also as allowed me to meet so many different people and make friends.  You see its not just the rotations KGC is trying to protect its the realtionships and friends that are forged out of this.  Everyday I can log on and see somone I met on a KGoC raid or someone I used to be in a guild with that is hanging around to help, KGC helps us remain civil and not get to power hungry.<br>
<br>
Nightbane has a few peeps that can only see quickly gained power, but like anything else if it is gained to quickly you will miss out on the little things that makes it so great.  Wanting to help give everyone a chance to have the fun and get to see those wonderous mobs that kick our arse at times is just a small part of why I think KGC is here and why guilds that could easily grab most mobs, not all mind you but a good few, simply dont.<br>
<br>
As to the comment that this server is getting so large since transfers and PoP, well ask some of the people why they switched servers I think you will find that a good majority will say that they are tired of trying to compete with uber guilds for loot and they refuse to sacarfice there enjoyment for uber stuff and the recognition of it.<br>
<br>
I might not be the most experienced person on karana and I am no diplomat.  I am a good person and I like to have fun and the actions taken on this sitution will in the end make this game a waste of my time and effort if I can get no where to show for it. <p>Lorik Tremere<br>

I do somewhat enjoy playing devil's advocate just to see how people react (suppose i should have taken psycholgy), but I will never fault a person for not waiting years to get their epic and going out and killing a dragon out of rotation if the oppurtunity arose for me do such a thing and I needed said item for epic yes i probably would go along with it although it woudlnt be a repeated thing just to piss people off. Fires of heaven may have 500 people I don't know but thats still less than half the server. Do you actually play on one of those servers Kellroy ? And the reason I dont want to lose my items with a move is because I can still remember where th at dusty old robe came from and remember the people that helped me get it just like that head of the serphant I got 2 weeks ago. I never forget who helped me get my items and I never turn them down help when they ask. EQ is getting so big that im willing to bet FoH doesnt even frequent old targets very much why would they much better stuff to get and planes to open. I'm willing to bet Trac has been killed just as many times by guild x y and z as it has by FoH, Guilds like FoH demand respect and deserve it they worked hard to get what they have and continue to push forward. I can't see faulting someone on karana for trying to do the same thing. There have always been  entitys that try to dictate the rules and in that time they were believed to be right, but time passed and now they are forgotten. And your right it is in the eye of the beholder you see it as greed, that person may see it as an adventure ..... I dont think Z and Daz are bullies I think they are feed up with a broken system what was done wasnt for profit in the bazaar, sure with any kill their will be something you can sell they were killing epic mobs more than likely for epic quests trac for vp keys maybe and some armor I won't say none of it was put on the market because some probably was. Remember just because a group of people says it's right or wrong doesnt mean it is, history has broken that theroy time and time agian.<br>

<br>
It's not finalized but the rotations are taking a huge twist very soon. Each guild being allowed to be in 5 rotations. no more (planes not included). Any small details are being finalized (tiers etc)<br>
<br>
And 1 guild on this server can easily keep everything perma killed. For example, our active roster is close to 100 people. Get all together somewhere, buff up. Send one group to sev (10 mins), one to gore (10 mins), one to here one to there, 2 groups over to trakanon (20 mins cause of fighting in) etc, combine a couple groups for a few other things... oh yeah 1 uber guild alone can finish off every major target from kunark to PoP in just a couple hours, given the motivation and opportunity.<br>
<br>
It doesn't happen cause we respect other people on Karana and adhere to KGC.<br>
<br>
Note to Kellory - GH is infinitely larger then Nightbanned *cough* err nightbane. NB attempted to selectively create a balanced guild by recruiting people from within other ubers that fit their standards. GH is not as selective and does take open apps as of a certain lvl from what I understand. Hell even Valo is bigger then NB heh, and we're more selective then both of em, we only take nice people with good reps.<br>
<br>
**also - something I miss about not playing Lagdalen anymore is those people that send you a tell out of the blue saying hi heh. Like you mentioned, people remember you, even if they only met you once or twice.<br>
<br>
Forrestgump and all the other guilds that went FFA are nothing but schoolyard bullies trying to widen their bank accounts with other people's lunch money. Like every other bullie, they find that when all the kids band together against them, they get pretty small pretty fast.<br>
<br>
Shattering Steel was nothing but a joke. If you want to quote real attempts at FFA, try Eternal Wrath or Nightmare Clan, not the puny lords of gimpdom. They fell apart cause the members were getting shunned and psychologically it was freaking them out. When you loose member base, you loose the guild.<br>
<br>
A serverwide shun is not a small thing to be trifled with. You mentioned in taking the Devil's Advocate position on most arguments, that you enjoy the topic of Psychology. Well, what is the psychological reaction on a person being shunned? How is it effective? Why? And if it doesn't work, then why have we already forced a couple major guilds off the server with it? Shunning is our only way of enforcing KGC. Anything else and we'd all get banned for doing it. It is effective and gets the message across very fast.<br>
<br>
Either way though - the sanctions that KGC has put in place for the moment are basically a general Call to Arms. If your target is up, get to it *NOW* and kill it, dont dick around and get a couple hours of exp in first. If the target happens to pop off of your peak time and you need some help, then ask away for now. Thats all it is, to make less targets available. And everyone knows that running around looking for mobs that aren't up is boring as hell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/Vreesig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
While Grey Hawke and Valoran may have more members, NB is certainly more capable.  At least as far as raiding goes.  Thats not to say the other large guilds cant compete with NB, they just seem to have choosen not to.  I dont like using terms like &quot;uber&quot; and &quot;best&quot; in situations like that.  So I admit I was rather imprecise.<br>
<br>
The main difference that you seem unable to grasp is that the KGC is NOT a small group of people.  The KGC IS the server.  Almost every guild with members above level 45 have reps there.  All have a say.  It is not just a half dozen people making up rules for the server.  It is there to help everyone as equally as possible while preventing the sort of attitude thats common on other servers.<br>
<br>
If Daz and the rest were fed up with a broken system they could have left the server.  They havent.  From the earliest days they simply keep causing trouble for everyone.  Why?  Because in their minds they are more important than anyone else.<br>
<br>
You say you wont fault someone who wanted their epic and took a mob out of rotation because they didnt want to wait?  Well, what about that poor guy who did follow the rules?  Now they're SoL.  Its that sort of attitude that the Karana players, as a whole, have rejected as right.<br>
<br>
If you dont want to leave for whatever reason, thats fine.  But dont then try to explain how great a system that the server has rejected is great because you dont totally agree with them.<br>
<br>
And its not like I dont have my own issues with how the KGC is run.  I do.  As does everyone else here.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and us is that we are willing to work with the system to effect change, whereas you are simply out for yourself.<br>
<br>
It is commendable you remember your friends Yiz.  But in my book the true measure of a person is not in how they treat their equals or superiors, but in how they treat their inferiors.<br>

I think the &quot;uber&quot; or larger and stronger guilds have a bit of an weighted vote on the KGC due to the fact that if these guilds don't support the KGC, the KGC will die. It seems to me that there are two completely opposite schools of thought on whether the KGC benefits large guilds such as GreyHawke or Valoran at all. Some people say KGC is totally for the benefit of the large guilds, others say it is totally for the benefit of the small guilds. I frankly think it benefits smaller guilds a great deal more than it does larger ones who could compete more easily in a ffa environment than smaller guilds. I can't really see much benefit to large guilds in the rotations other than convenience for them to know when their turn at something is - if it was ffa they'd have to move faster, but they could do it. Smaller guilds on the other hand probably could not. <br>
<br>
Why do people see this issue so differently? Who DOES the KGC benefit more? <br>
<br>
What sort of time frame do you estimate for a &quot;new and improved&quot; set of KGC rules?<br>

It takes away the need to have to rush to a mob and alleviates tensions between guilds. Basically a &quot;Play Nice&quot; world. With the KGC it doesn't matter how big you are, it just matters if you can take the mob. If you can, great! The larger guilds have agreed to step aside and let you take a whack at it. Why? Because this benefits everyone, not just the larger guilds. The larger guilds may have more of a say on there, but I've yet to see a good post from a smaller guild get quashed. <br>
<br>
Everyone may not agree on everything, but that's why we have long discussions. It's like the Int's from LoTR (love that book/movie). It takes a long time to discuss things. Everyone add's their two cents, then someone add's their reply, etc. We eventually get to a conclusion, but it does take a while.<br>
<br>
I can't give you a good estimate. The problem currently is, instead of spending our time trying to fix the system, we are spending it dealing with the rogue group, or warding off flames. It may take weeks or months to get the new system going. But, things are being discussed. <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>
