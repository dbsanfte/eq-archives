success.<br>
<br>
There were around 70 people there, which is a very scary thing when you are trying to squish all those people into 1 small room and have them not get near walls, etc.<br>
<br>
The groups got ported up and somehow ( whether it be lev if it works there, or people stacking at the zone in, or people sitting, or people near the walls, or... ) mobs from the other side of the zone and I think even the 2nd floor got aggroed.  Visions of Fear were running through our heads.<br>
<br>
At least 1 CLC got camped out, and several people were FD, so after the mobs picked out bones clean and walked off, the rezzing commenced and I think most if not all of the raid was rezzed in before the second wipe occured.  My claim to fame - I almost survived the second wipe!  I stood there waiting to be killed ( it was that or gate out, which I was -not- doing ) and finally the mobs killed the last person and all started to walk off, and then a Golem turned around,ran back and squished me into jelly.<br>
<br>
They got everyone rezzed in for the 2nd time and things started to look good.  Well, except for me.  I got a resist on a mob pretty early on and went down hard under it's fists, making me the first to die on this go-around.  From last to first, lucky me!<br>
<br>
We proceeded to clear all the mobs we needed to clear, with only a few scares.  There was one pull with 2 of the bone-dragon guys, along with a support mob that I don't remember.  Good assisting took them down.<br>
<br>
Half the raid then walked to the wall camp spot, but got attacked partway there, and I think lost at least half of the force.  It was controlled, and the bodies were dragged to camp 2 and rezzed while Farr came back and picked up the rest of us.  The second group got to the camp with little trouble and we all set up and prepared for more fun and mayhem.<br>
<br>
Camp 2 was pretty straightforward - pulls of 1 to 2 mobs, usually.  Assist, slay, assist slay, roll for loot, loot.  There was one pull of 5 ( right after I told my guild it was about time for a train - we chanters have a feeling for these things... ) which ended up wiping me again, as we had no healer in our group.  Maybe next time I'll leave the level 51-52 mobs for the 60+ chanter to Mez.<br>
<br>
I had to log to run to work right before the move to the Maestro.  I missed out on a lot of fun, it seems.  From what I gathered, the raid had Maestro and about 5 friends all at once.  AND, they handled it.  Great job.  After the rezzes, the raid decided to take down the 2 hands ( see the first sentence of my post ) for the War epic piece.  The hands went palm-up and there's one more happy Warrior on the Karana server.<br>
<br>
The loot was terrific - especially for the clerics who got multiple items.  There were some War, Pally, and Shammy items ( Gratz Aerann ), 1 Enchanter item, and a few other assorted items, not to mention the cash / gem drops.<br>
<br>
There were some assist problems that I noticed at first, but they didn't seem nearly as bad near the end of the raid.  Unfortunately, the beginning of the raid is when Assist is the most important with the number of mobs that can aggro the group.<br>
<br>
The further the raid went along, the more people were just jumping on the mobs as they were pulled to the camp instead of waiting for a call from the MA to join.  I'd even swear that the support melees even jumped on a mob or 2 before the MA attacked.  By then, it was getting a little lax because of the way we were slicing and dicing the opposition, but like anything - if you let yourself get sloppy in practice, you're going to be sloppy when you need to be sharp.<br>
<br>
Great job to everyone - leaders, puller, crowd controllers, healer, support melee, nukers, etc..  EVERYONE.  There were mistakes, but with 70 people, you're going to get what seem like a lot of mistakes.<br>
<br>
It was a pleasure to be a part of this KoCG raid, even though I had to miss the final Mini-boss battle and subsequent cash rolls because of what turned out to be a 5-minute job at work.  Grrr...<br>
<br>
Take care, all.  Get some sleep.  You deserve it. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  on the Karana Server<br>

First, I want to say Thank You to Farr and the other organizers. It actually went amazingly smoothly and I was quite impressed at your organization over all. This was an awsome opportunity, Thanks. Some of the things I learned:<br>
<br>
- Levitate/SoE/DMF is a serious no no in Plane of Hate. My entire group had SoE on when we ported up and I'm pretty sure I got some hate from second floor because I got killed within 30 seconds of arriving. This fact was not in any of the four or five PoH guides I studied, nor did anyone I chatted with before the raid mention it. Well, now I know. Lev does work BTW, our SoE was not canceled on zone like in The Hole or Velks.<br>
<br>
- I never did get a straight answer regarding the use of SoW. Hate is an outdoor zone (SoW worked), but some people said &quot;Don't SoW&quot; so I didn't argue of course, but I didn't see any reason that it would be bad. There were a few times where I fell a bit behind when we were moving (because I had to invis a party member or something) and SoW would have been nice. Can anyone answer this question? Clearly SoW is useless when at camps, but may we SoW in Hate for when we move to new camps and such?<br>
<br>
- The Spite Golems will run at 5% health and they run rather fast and can't be chased because it will agro other stuff. They are also nearly 100% MR. I spoke to a few people and between us we had dozens of resisted Snares (maybe more than 100), and not a single successful Snare to my knowledge. When they run they will summon people across the zone. When they come back they will bring at least two friends, probably more. I have read unconfirmed reports that Wizard Lures land on them for resonable damage, and that they are SoWed and should be dispelled. Does anyone know if MR Debuffs land on them? We should test all resonable theories on the next Raid. We should also try to come up with a plan to deal with them when they get low on health.... Suggestions?<br>
<br>
- An idea I came up with half way through the raid based on my serious commitment to my usual role as Secondary Healer (I'm a Druid) - I made a macro button to target each enchanter by name and when I saw their message &quot;%T is Mezzed&quot; I would target them and throw heals if necessary. I propose we organize a few healer types in this manner, to keep the chanters alive. My heal spell will heal 2-3 bubs of life on most enchanters, so a Druid/Shammy is nearly as good as a Cleric in this role. I'd also throw a Regrowth on them and all the Necros/SKs every now and then when I was at full mana.<br>
<br>
- Farnn's idea of organizing the main four groups and then designating GLs for the rest of the groups and having the GL's organize their groups was nothing short of ingenious. That worked amazingly well, and would likely work equilly well in any situation! Talk about delegating nicely....<br>
<br>
- It seems that our numbers were to our disadvantage on the break in. I'd think that the breakin groups should pull the nearby houses a little more extensively before everyone goes up, but remember that this was my first Hate Raid. Then again, maybe it was the Levitate thing that got us all that hate on the big port up and that wipe was due to second floor agro.... <br>
<br>
Please post agreement, disagreement and discussions(remember that this was my first PoH Raid!!) Anyone else have observations and/or advice? Thanks all in advance. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457258"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rinalthelis Wolfbrother</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org">&lt;Ancient Adventurers&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
As this was my first Hate raid as well, I would venture to say that while moving to the next camp spot quickly is nice, I would not have had sow up while walking on the slanted wall. I was walking and there were several times that I slipped down the side of the wall...almost to my doom. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I even thought about snaring myself to slow me even more. I am sure that If I had a sow on I would have either gone way to high on the wall too quickly, or would have fallen further when I slipped.<br>
<br>
I guess, IMHO, it is more important to get to the camp alive, then to move quickly and risk dieing. <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>

<br>
Aside from the obvious difficulty in movement caused by 70 people in a 10x10 area most things went pretty good, I think.  However, in my opinion, more things need to be ironed out prior to porting everyone up.<br>
<br>
I would say there are at least 5 brand new people each raid; with that in mind, the importance of assist needs to be stressed each raid as well.  <br>
<br>
Fighting on the wall needs some serious work.  Too many people are just fighting from below, causing the mob to be pushed up the wall quickly.  If a mob must be fought on the wall, it's usually best to encircle it instead of bombarding it only from the front.  The Maestro almost brought an army from the 2nd floor and that would have been disasterous.<br>
<br>
The raid channel is also very cluttered with non-raid chat and often questions about things that have already been repeated 4 or 5 times.  It would be most valuable if the channel only consisted of orders and updates about the raid.<br>
<br>
Overall, I had a very good time though and will do it again if possible.  Happy hunting in the meantime. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sotvfarrnusno>SOTVFarrnusno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Planes Raid Liason</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#8E9173>(12/31/02 2:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoH Mini Recap - 12/30/2002</span><hr size=1> Last night was a good night.  We had a rocky start, but we recovered and made it a good night.  I am proud of the way that we came together, there were a few places (like the Maestro mispull with Second Floor Aggro) that I don't see how we pulled off a victory.  A lot of the problems we had were leadership problems, because the first few times are going to be learning experiences for me, and to do so well the first time here (particularly after the PoF fiasco) was definitely  a good thing<br>
<br>
When we started off we had 67 people that came.  Wow.  When I saw the number we had I immediately called for no more walkins, but we ended up with more than was an organized group.  I quickly saw that making groups would take FAR too long for me to do, so I made up a new method on the spot.  I created the breakin groups like normal, and then just designated many people to be group leaders and they picked their own groups.  It was a process that worked quite well, and I might do this in the future as well.<br>
<br>
The breakin was where we had a rough time unfortunately.  When we first got up there we fought off the first crowd with only about 30% losses (Many times you wipe the breaking group or evac a few times to finally get past that first fight).  Unfortunately here is where I made my first bad decision of the night.  I immediately called for wizards to bring up the rest of the people, rather than clearing the immediate area first.  Some people had SoE on, and aggroed stuff from across the zone or second floor.  We actually didn't have too many mobs, only about 6-7 but people weren't assisting so enchanters started going down, and after that everyone died except for Q-Man, who managed to get out.  When he got back in, he rezzed our resident clickstick, and we got about half the people up before somehow we got aggro from a golem.  I don't know how we got aggro there because I didn't see anyone doing anything wrong, so it just may have been a wanderer and happened to come in aggro radius.  So we started fighting and at about 25% health it started running.  Now the golems are 100% magic resistant (not all types of magic, just magic itself) so when it started running at that high of a health bad things were going to happen.  It summoned a few people as we had clerics camp, and then came back with another golem and a cleric, and we just didn't have the firepower rezzed yet to do anything about it.  <br>
<br>
After this, things started going more smoothly.  We got that series of rezzes done without incident, and started buffing up and regening mana as best we could without sitting.  After we are ready we have our monk start pulling and he starts doing his thing.  We were able to pull consistently 1 or 2 at a time until we felt the area was clean.  The only incident during this was when another golem got away at 4% health, and summoned three people to the second floor ramp before one of them was able to finish the golem off.<br>
<br>
At this point we started to move.  I took the first 5 groups and starting going the long route over the wall to the SW camp.  Unfortunately someone was sitting too low on the wall and aggroed one of the houses on us (and over enough of a bulk of us that we had to stand and fight).  We lost about half of the people that came with that group on that fight, but we did manage to win it.  After that we were able to drag corpses to camp and start rezzing while I grabbed the others.  The other half of the raid went to camp with no incidents, which is always a good thing.  Finally at camp our monk puller went LD, never to be seen again.  So we had our Shadow Knight start pulling for us.  I want to make a note about our Shadow Knight, he had never been to this zone before, and did one of the best jobs of pulling up here that I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
We managed to clear a good portion of the zone, but it was starting to get late, and I decided to go after Maestro for an ending to the night.  Unfortunately having only been in that building twice before, and neither of those times leading a bunch of people, I made a wrong turn to end all wrong turns.  We turned one turn too late and ended up aggroing a house by itself in the NW corner on us, around 8 mobs.  Tough don't you think?  Well so did we until we found out that we had also aggroed Maestro and some of his buddies too.  All in all at one point we had Maestro and 12 mobs in camp, with no preperation whatsoever.  You say wipe right?  Somehow (I am still trying to figure out how) we managed to kill all of those mobs, and also a second floor aggro Thought Defiler without wipe.  Albiet about 3/4 of our raid force went down, but the fact that we pulled it off is nothing short of amazing.  Awesome Job guys!  Then once rezzes and buffing had been redone we went the right way to get into Maestro's house, and we killed a few annoyances that were left around that area.  We then pulled Maestro's hand, and proceeded to definger it nicely.  <br>
<br>
All in all, a great raid.  If we hadn't slowed down at the beginning with the couple of wipes (that basically pushed the time that we started to around 11) then we probably would have been doing the second floor.  Again, I can't say enough, Awesome job to everyone. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

My entire group had SoE on when we ported up and I'm pretty sure I got some hate from second floor because I got killed within 30 seconds of arriving. This fact was not in any of the four or five PoH guides I studied, nor did anyone I chatted with before the raid mention it. Well, now I know. Lev does work BTW, our SoE was not canceled on zone like in The Hole or Velks.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it is one of those rules of thumb that everyone knows but no one thinks about.  That is why you were not warned, everyone assumed you already knew.  As someone on the raid put it, &quot;I guarantee that no one that was on this raid will ever make that mistake again, and will jump all over anyone else who is about to&quot;.  It does work, but it is a death sentence to be using it.<br>
<br>
- I never did get a straight answer regarding the use of SoW. Hate is an outdoor zone (SoW worked), but some people said &quot;Don't SoW&quot; so I didn't argue of course, but I didn't see any reason that it would be bad. There were a few times where I fell a bit behind when we were moving (because I had to invis a party member or something) and SoW would have been nice. Can anyone answer this question? Clearly SoW is useless when at camps, but may we SoW in Hate for when we move to new camps and such?<br>
<br>
SoW is a no no in any plane.  In camp, no one should have it because it encourages people to wander a little bit, which can cause big problems.  When moving from camp to camp, we want people moving with the group, so we don't want people running at various degrees of speed.  Also, those with sow just tend to be the ones to bring several dozen mobs on the camp when they get there.  Just personal experience there, but on my raids the only one that should have sow on at any time should be the puller(s).<br>
<br>
- The Spite Golems will run at 5% health and they run rather fast and can't be chased because it will agro other stuff. They are also nearly 100% MR. I spoke to a few people and between us we had dozens of resisted Snares (maybe more than 100), and not a single successful Snare to my knowledge. When they run they will summon people across the zone. When they come back they will bring at least two friends, probably more. I have read unconfirmed reports that Wizard Lures land on them for resonable damage, and that they are SoWed and should be dispelled. Does anyone know if MR Debuffs land on them? We should test all resonable theories on the next Raid. We should also try to come up with a plan to deal with them when they get low on health.... Suggestions?<br>
<br>
They are completely immune to anything that resists based on magic.  They are tough to hit with any other form of spell also, but not immune from my understanding (all of my spells are 100% based off of magic resist).  Before tonight I had honestly not ever seen one of these golems run, and we saw two both when we were in the port in house.  One ran at 25% as well, which is well above what any mob should start running at.  I don't know what exactly was going on, but when we made the transition to the other camp it stopped happening.  /shrug.  The only thing that we can really do is make sure that we have enough firepower on them to take them down before they can run very far.<br>
<br>
- An idea I came up with half way through the raid based on my serious commitment to my usual role as Secondary Healer (I'm a Druid) - I made a macro button to target each enchanter by name and when I saw their message &quot;%T is Mezzed&quot; I would target them and throw heals if necessary. I propose we organize a few healer types in this manner, to keep the chanters alive. My heal spell will heal 2-3 bubs of life on most enchanters, so a Druid/Shammy is nearly as good as a Cleric in this role. I'd also throw a Regrowth on them and all the Necros/SKs every now and then when I was at full mana.<br>
<br>
That is a good idea, and something I might put into official use next time.  Chanters going down is usually one of the warning signs of a wipe, and if you can give them that extra 30 seconds to get everything under control it can make a huge difference in fatalities.<br>
<br>
- Farnn's idea of organizing the main four groups and then designating GLs for the rest of the groups and having the GL's organize their groups was nothing short of ingenious. That worked amazingly well, and would likely work equilly well in any situation! Talk about delegating nicely....<br>
<br>
To be honest it was a desparate idea when I saw how many people were there.  It is something that I wouldn't normally do, but in situations like that were we have too many people really I might put it into practice again.<br>
<br>
- It seems that our numbers were to our disadvantage on the break in. I'd think that the breakin groups should pull the nearby houses a little more extensively before everyone goes up, but remember that this was my first Hate Raid. Then again, maybe it was the Levitate thing that got us all that hate on the big port up and that wipe was due to second floor agro.... <br>
<br>
Yes, we should.  Was one of the mistakes I made in not clearing the immediate area before I had everyone port up.  Remember, I am in a process of learning as well.  It is not so much of increased aggro that I say this, but just simply because of the lack of disipline that you have at first and for those first few fights everyone needs to be clicking just right.<br>
<br>
As far as the thought destroyer, I have never seen them before, and my paladin friend said that they are only on the second floor.  Not 100% sure, but I will look into it for sure before the next time we go. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

If your below that its possible you'll pick up second floor aggro.  Note, you wont pull those mobs on top of you.  But its possible they will hit you with spells and even a melee and kill you.  They wont move down though since aggro is distance based on the second floor.  And its a pretty short distance.<br>
<br>
On our last second floor hate raid (this last Friday) our puller at 61 had a hard time getting the mob to retain aggro and follow with just run3 on.  In fact half the mobs we had to charge as he simply couldnt get them to follow.<br>
<br>
But yes, below around 55 your aggro radius is large enough its possible if there is a mob directly above you.  This is of most concern when running to the west camp as halfway up the wall means your bouncing and that again can aggro the floor.  This is also a question of experience too though.  Our guild often runs with SoE up there because we all know where we're going and are careful to check.  I wouldnt suggest that with KCoG though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sow is often a bad idea if your running to west camp from the portal in an unbroken plane.  The simple reason is that you will outrun the mobs, but on the first floor aggro is simple SCREWED and you can easily chain aggro the entire floor to west camp since you might not even know a mob is aggro'd on you.  Suggestion is to remove sow and soe and stop at regular intervals to check for aggro.  I usually do so at the corners.<br>
<br>
Sprite Golems are no longer 100% MR.  With the resist changes, they are about 99% MR.  I've landed 1 snare since the changes.  Frankly, its not worth it.  That snare only landed with a combo of Malo and Tash and I had 7 resisted snares prior to that.  I believe you need Tash to have landed in order for snare to have a chance at sticking.  As the enchanter is generally busy at this point, its rarely happens.  And I believe you need to use the highest level tash, I dont believe the mage version debuffs enough MR.  I'm not sure what our enchanter used, but it might have been the level 60 Winds of Tashanian.  In which case, KCoG might be screwed there.<br>
<br>
But if you have 50+ people there, a running mob usually wont get very far anyway.  Just make sure he's pulled back all the way to camp and not being fought way outside.<br>
<br>
I find it very useful for druids and unengaged shamans to constantly have the enchanter targeted.  Losing your enchanter is usually the kiss of death if you have more than 4 mobs in camp.  In general during the furball while the MA is intially grabbing aggro and the enchanter is still attempting to mez I'll keep the enchanter targeted.  Once it calms down and all mobs are mez'd I'll switch out to nuking.  Then when I see the mob die and the MA begin to target a new mob, I'll again switch out to targeting the enchanter in case the MA fails to gain enough aggro quick enough.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what you hear, there's no such thing as wasted mana when it comes to healing your enchanter or even spot healing the MA.  Especially if there is an abundance of healers in the raid.  Keep your enchanter up at all costs.  Doesnt matter if you are in the group with the enchanter or not.<br>
<br>
What probably got you massive aggro was a few people sitting before the break was complete.  That aggro then chained elsewhere and brought a train.  The worst mob for chain aggro appears to be the Deathrot Knight.  I've literally seen him pull half the zone even though he was standing alone.<br>
<br>
Second floor aggro issues are generally only a problem if you have lev on and are running a bit too high on the wall, or get grav fluxed (with or without lev on).  But due to how aggro works on the second floor, its not that big an issue at the entrance.<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind when doing a portal break, is that you dont usually run from the portal to West Camp.  Either you do that initally, or you break at the portal and pull to there to clear the immediate area.  Then the puller works north and pulls till he gets most of that side.  Then the raid runs to the wall and moves up to the house about 2 houses down from the north wall.  Hard to explain without a map.  Then you pull the area surrounding the Maestro's house and any mobs nearby.  Then you move to west camp and finish pulling the mobs around there and to the south west.  Then move over and slap the Maestro.<br>
<br>
Attempting to run to west camp immediately after breaking the portal tends to land you in the worst of both worlds.  As you have to deal with the inital break and clear, and still have to worry about losing people on the run over.<br>
<br>
However, if you are running to west camp and you gain aggro, you need to drop off the wall and move down in the space between the wall and the houses.  This does 3 things.  1) It allows a chance that anyone else running by wont get the aggro.  2) There's less of a risk of your corpse getting trapped in the wall which will require a necro or SK to summon the corpse as that is not something a guide will do if they are following the rules.  Corpses in terrain is valid for all zones other than the planes and VP.  You remain pretty much on your own in those places, although not as much as in VP.  3) It allows the corpse puller to quickly see and identify your corpse, rather than force them to look for an arm or a leg sticking out.<br>
<br>
Having 70+ people at the entrance is one reason I didnt do portal breaks with KCoG.  Its simply too much lag.  I always sent groups to the west camp by the Maestro's house where are least you could spread out some.  It wasnt ideal as you could lost some or many people, but it was a decent compromise.  And camping out to clear any possible aggro usually occupied people's time while the others were running in.<br>
<br>
That second floor ramp is one of the worst spots in the entire zone.  Not only is it fairly heavily patrolled and ringed by static mobs, but that's one of the few places you can gain and hold second floor aggro.  Depending on where you aggro'd it and the pathing you can pull a number of second floor mobs onto you if you ended up by the ramp.  Zellex demonstrated this excellently on one memoriable Hate raid.  Although, that was before we fully understood how chain aggro worked up on the first floor and how second floor aggro could be contained.<br>
<br>
As I think I pointed out elsewhere, you cannot sit at the portal.  Ever, till the wanderers are cleared.  And even then, till you clear the adjacent houses, the only relatively safe sit spot is the left hand corner on the side of the portal house on the opposite side that you came in on.  I think its the SW corner of the house.  You have to stay in that corner, and its best never to sit while in the portal house.  The problem is that you can easily chain aggro.  You sit and accidently aggro a mob next door or perhaps a wanderer.  He comes on in and smacks you down in the best case scenario.  Worst case is he tries to run back, but because of how crappy Hate mob pathing he, he gets lost.  He then transfer aggro to other mobs.  Then your puller pulls one of them and gets the entire deal.  You really have to be careful about sitting on breaks both in Fear and Hate.<br>
<br>
And again, level makes all the difference.  A well equiped level 60 or 61 can get away with sitting in places a similarly equiped level 55 cant.<br>
<br>
Also you puller can retain aggro even after they FD.  Depending on how bad it is on that night, your puller may need to FD after each pull for the first few hours till you clear enough mobs.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it sounds like you have a very good raid overall.  I'm sorry I missed it, but I doubt you would've needed me with that many people.  And being able to take out th Maestro plus friends is no small feat. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just to give you an idea, i believe you can mez jade reavers with this spell without too much hassle.  Tash is unresistable, so with that you should have a better time with snare/mez.  Malo line also has a MR debuff that stacks with tash i believe, so between the two of them a select few high lvl people might be able to land a snare once in a while.<br>
<br>
Hmm, how do i describe the Maestro fight? Well, it was all the enchanters, i gotta say.  From where I was I saw at least ten mobs not including mini bosses throughout the fight.  I ran past 3 or so around a house to get to the raid force, and pulled one or two behind me.  At the raid force, the Maestro and several others were there, beating on melees.  Javonthalas, on horseback, helped me more than anyone ever could, by clarity2'ing me mid-fight (mine got dispelled by a haunted chest), which kept me going throughout the fight.  sumr and Farrn were holding the alley between houses down very well with mezzes, I was extremely impressed.  By far, the only reason we lived through that was Javonthalas, who was landing mezzes left and right at critical moments.  The Thought Terror was a pain, I didn't even try to mez it as it was a yellow con to me and i could barely mez blue cons with my low resist mez.  Javonthalas steps up and freezes it for the fight.  I get too much agro on resisted mezzes, and Javon saves my @$$ again.  Next time you see him, give him kudos for his spectacular efforts up there!  That fight was one of the best fights I have ever been on in my EQ career, in that we as a raid fought as hard as we could and scraped through, despite being far overpowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zymyool>zymyool</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/2/03 11:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kudos to Rangers, too, at the end.</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hmm, how do i describe the Maestro fight?

<br>
Unfortunately, I had to head to work right before the Maestro Fiasco.  I'm quite sad that I missed it.  Javon was a great CC-Team leader throughout the night and it sounds like he did a great job continuing that leadership to the end.<br>
<br>
As for it being all enchanters - if I read correctly on our Guild message boards, at least two of the Rangers in my guild ( Frebxb and Shadowpath ) were able to help out by &quot;peeling and parking.&quot;  We stress and discuss tactics and strategies in our guild, and one that has been talked about on our boards by our proficient Rangers is the &quot;P&amp;P&quot;.  Below is the first post in the &quot;P&amp;P&quot; discussion, written by Shadowpath, a guild ranger who totally amazed me when I saw him in action for the first time.  I hope you don't mind me posting this here, Shadow.  If so, you can flog me later.<br>
<br>
From Shadowpath:<br>
Peeling is a term used originally ( in my experience ) to describe the Rangers role as protector of the enchanter in group situations. When the enchanter ( for whatever reason ) gains the interest of a mob ( ie. aggroes it ), the Ranger quickly moves on over, assists the enchanter to target his or her mob, and WITHOUT ATTACKING ( you must tap the auto attack key off ) taunts and snares the mob in order to &quot; peel &quot; it off and move it away. <br>
<br>
A very important aspect of peeling is to make sure you are not attacking the mob, as the enchanter will not be able to mezz it if you are. Just get its attention long enough for the enchanter to survive and get a mezz off. One good turn deserves another. <br>
<br>
Another method of Ranger peeling I have begun to use more and more often involves providing crowd control when a enchanter is not available. Rangers are EXCELLENT at providing crowd control given a well rounded group. Peeling in this situation goes something like this: Puller brings back multiples. Everyone assists puller to target main mob. Ranger then switches targets and ATTACKS ( as opposed to the above method of peeling ), taunts, and snares the mob, drawing it to a spot away from the group, and root parks it. Attacking the mob to be peeled helps get its attention so that it can be managed more easily. Repeat as necessary.<br>
 <br>
In a great ( mostly guild ) group at the LCY camp in Karnors just last night I was able to peel and root park 5 mobs while the group dealt with the puller's ( who happened to be the main tank as well ) main mob. One celestial remedy from our cleric was needed after engaging these mobs. <br>
<br>
Now, in order to execute good peeling you must know the camp you are in, including the pathing, spawn points, and times of said camps mobs. Arm yourself with this knowledge, and you will know where to safely manuever a mob and park it without adding more critters to the situation. <br>
<br>
Another important aspect of peeling is to be certain other members of your group do not attack anything but the Main Tanks mob. If they do, your job gets more difficult, as they earn a place on the added mobs hate list, thus making it potentially more difficult to get those mobs attention and peel them. <br>
<br>
Whew. Ok. In guild groups, I can see peeling becoming commonplace, especially since we dont have many chanters. So, all of you Rangers out there, practice your Peeling. Note that 2 methods of peeling are mentioned here, and the tactical differences between are simple but extremely important. In one you do not attack, in the other you do. <br>
One more thing. I have a Macro button that says &quot; I am PEELING %T &quot; on the first line, and that casts Ensnare on the second line. I am considering adding a Taunt function to it above the Ensnare line so that taunt is performed and then snare is cast. <br>

<br>
Just a note, a DoT and a Root Can break a mezz. Snare does not. Once mezzed, if you haven't snared it's not a bad idea to land one if mana permits. Not only will it get the mob to hate you more, if the mezz breaks it gives the enchanter that much more time to re-mezz if he/she is still the special of the day. <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>
