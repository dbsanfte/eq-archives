Most of you that have been on a Naggy raid will know all of this, but for those of you just getting in range to come with us this will give you an idea of what is going on. I am also going to do one for Vox and one for buffline procedures as I have time and get around to doing it.<br>
<br>
At the start of the raid we meet at the secret Druid Ring in Lavastorm. We do this because it is the simplest place to meet up with few distractions. That is where we assemble, and make groups.<br>
<br>
What I am looking for when assembling the raid force, is to have around 30 people. We NEED to have at least 4 clerics at a minimum. One druid 51+ is essential for their circle protection spells. 2 Bards are hard to get by without, and the more bards you have, the merrier it is. The rest don't matter as far as format, as long as we have a good amount of melee. Wizards help a lot for massive damage near the end. 30 People would be the minimum, 40 people is safe zone, 50+ is more than enough.<br>
<br>
At this point I usually send in the support group to start their bloodletting as I am making groups. When making groups I try to make them as balanced as possible. The first group is my group. I usually assign someone I know and trust as the group leader. Have a healer (druid/shaman is fine for this group), a monk/sk puller, any other enchanters, and fill out the rest of the group with caster types. G2 will be the MA/MT's group. He rates the highest bard on the raid and the highest cleric. Fill out the rest of G2 with melee types. The rest of the Groups I fill as needed. I try to make melee groups (as many as I can) have a cleric and a bard (as long as I have bards), and then seperate caster groups. Caster groups can have druid/shaman healers. This is the personal way that I flesh out groups, though everyone does it a bit differently.<br>
<br>
Once I have groups fleshed out I announce them and have GL's invite their groups. We form out, stick any extra people that showed up late in other groups and make sure everything is running ok. By this time the support group will have gotten the path to the SS room clear and is starting on giants. I usually have them clear giants up to the throne room, which is where I try to bring up the main force to meet the support group.  Support group will pull from that point and supervise the killings.<br>
<br>
*Note about Giants* Fire Giants are very magic resistant, though you can cast from a distance with them unlike Ice Giants in Permafrost.  The most important thing here is to remember not to let them fall into lava as lava heals them.  Giants falling into lava will mean a lot of deaths.  The repop time on all of the Fire Giants is 8 hours, which means that after we kill them we will not have to worry about them.<br>
<br>
Once we move to the Throne room we will stay there while support pulls giants from the buffing room.  There are a couple of traps to look at around here.  First of all don't sit on the throne.  Many thrones in the game are bugged.  When you sit on the throne there is a good chance you will become stuck, and the only way to get out will be to get ported out of it.  Everyone will laugh at you if you get stuck, and if you have to get ported out most likely you will not be able to make rejoin us because of repops on the way back to giants.  After that we will be moving over a bridge to the hallway right before the buffroom.  There is a switch on the bridge, and if you click it people WILL fall into the lava and die.  DO NOT CLICK THE SWITCH.  After everyone is in the hallway, we will pull through the lair giants.<br>
<br>
At this point I will be setting up the line, or if I have one helping the buff coordinator do so. Unfortunately this does take time, as most of these people have not done a buffline before, and so we have to explain exactly what is going on. Just because there is not a lot going on in channels, does not mean there is not a lot going on. People that are not involved in the buffline usually don't realize this, and are constantly spamming by this point the equivelent of &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;, despite the fact that the people that know what is going on are repeatedly telling everyone exactly what is going on. This is the point on the raid when I am most tempted to moderate all chat channels, and filter out shout/ooc/auction. People also have a tendency to start sending tells to the Raid Leader, which further slows down the raid as he/she has to read these, and sometimes answer in the midst of doing everything else. I will explain the processes for the buffline in another post.<br>
<br>
Once everyone has been buffed and the buffline has been collapsed, everyone should be in the chatroom. I either do the general raid briefing and closing notes here, or before the buffline depending on disipline, and how busy I am. Once that has been done we log back in, and form original groups. The way up to Naggy is pretty evident, and unless you manage to fall into the lava it is not very dangerous.<br>
<br>
<br>
The raid is launched in 3 waves:<br>
<br>
Wave 1 Consists of Warriors, Paladins, and Bards. Bards use their resistance songs to keep the melee's alive, and those two classes can take the first couple of aoe's well, which will bring people back to the triage line scattered, instead of one wave.<br>
<br>
Wave 2 is called about 10-20 seconds later. It consists of all other melee. Druids/Shamans will also go into the room for spot heals on melee's as they see them, but will stay back as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Wave 4 consists of all nukers. These are called in sometime between 50-70% health, depending on how well it is going. Remember that you MUST be in melee range to hit Naggy with anything besides unresistable spells (such as Tash and Sieve) or it will resist. Even in melee range expect heavy resist rates (I usually at 52 hit 1/3rd of the time, though Enchanter nukes are natural resisted heavily).<br>
<br>
The clerics (and if we are short on clerics the Shamans/Druids as well) will stay back at the entrance of the lair. As melee'ers need heals they will come back and spam that they need a heal. Healers should /say who they are healing so that there are not overlapping heals. If you currently have Dragon aggro please do not drag her back to the triage line, as that would end up killing us all.<br>
<br>
If you run out of mana (int and wisdom casters both apply), run to Naggy and Sit Down, so that you will get aggro and die. You will repop at the end of the buffline (You did bind yourself right?), mem the appropriate spell and run back up to start working again. If things go well, it usually isn't necessary for anyone to die, but it has happened.<br>
<br>
The dragon should go down quickly. Generally if he is not dead within 2 minutes of engagement, then we have lost. Once everyone is there and ready we will random away the items. Note that Paladins will lotto for the book BEFORE we engage, and the Paladin that won should be given priorities in rezzes. All loot rules will be followed as in the thread pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...=262.topic .<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in this thread, and I and other people will do our best to answer them. Thanks and Good Luck to you! <p>Farrnusno <BR>
