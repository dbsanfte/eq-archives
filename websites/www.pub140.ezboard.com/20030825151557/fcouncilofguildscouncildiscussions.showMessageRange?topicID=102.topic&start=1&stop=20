Only members from guilds that are not on that particular rotation may come.  When you consider level limits (for most of them 50+), most people in that range are in a guild in those rotations.  We have attempted to see if we could assemble a good team for targets like VS before, but response was underwhelming.  I for one would love to put VS on our list of rotations, and would be willing to lead it.  But we would have to have the commitment of a balanced group of 30+ lvl 50+ characters that are not in the rotation.  Dragons are much tougher, and we should really see if we can take VS before even trying those rotations.  But until we get those commitments it will be difficult to do.  I won't add us to the VS rotation until I am sure that we could put a force together to take him out. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
Any other guilds have solid 50+ chars that would be willing to try this? I think the benefits of taking down VS for both loot and tactics would benefit KCoG immensily.<br>
<br>
Sheesh, if RKoL can join in, I know others can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would just really like to see KCoG get on at least one more rotation for more experience. Plus, it would help keep our guilds intact so we don't have to go to a new one to take down VS, etc.<br>
<br>
Appreciate your comments about your guild and what you think your guild can do. Vox/Naggy great rotations, but I know some of my members are going past 52 which means no dragons. I can only assume that other guilds out there have some solid 50's that we could try this with.<br>

<br>
However, that being said there's no reason why we cant try again.  Times change, new people and new ideas come up.  Its one reason why I like to see us cycle through raid leaders about every 6 months.  It helps keep things fresh and Raid Leaders more in touch with the current group of raiders.<br>
<br>
MY suggestion is to look at the requirements for a successful raid from other boards and sites.  Then draw up a proposal listing why we (KCoG) failed to be able to do VS and Sev in the past and show a propsal listing how you'll change them to be successful.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This isnt a requirement.  If you want to do VS and/or Sev then you can simply sign KCoG up with the KGC if you are a guild leader or officer.  If not, you'll have to talk with one of the current Liasons and have them vouch for you, but that usually isnt a big deal.  I would also suggest talking with Haemish as a courtesy.<br>
<br>
However, intent and will and desire isnt enough.  The adage that if you build it they will come is not necessarily true.  Otherwise the Dot.Bomb crash never would have happened.  I suggest putting together a proposal simply to help you see what our limits are and whether we actually do have the force levels needed.  Taking into account the rotations themselves and the lead time involved.<br>
<br>
Its doesnt have to be done, but it would probably help anyone in planning a more successful attempt.  Believe me, there are few faster ways to annoy the leadership of most guilds on the server than to have a guild or alliance that is not ready for a target to simply sign up then fail.  It can hurt the guild going next a lot.<br>

------------------------------------------<br>
Venril Sathir is one of the most feared mobs in Everquest. To date, only 6 guilds (including The Syndicate) have killed him on Tarew Marr. He is feared not because he has alot of HP (only 10-12K) or because he has some nasty AE weapon or hits hard (he doesnt). He is feared because every single hit he takes 1500hp from you and adds it back to his own thus effectively healing himself faster than you can damage him. That is, unless you use strategy. Therefore, killing Venril Sathir is a &quot;right of passage&quot; for many guilds. The Syndicate completed that task with little effort and only a fraction of its total high level forces at the combat. It went something like this: <br>
<br>
While forming up to raid the Juggernauts to get the wizzie piece from Jumpsalot (Tolaspmuj the Froglock) we heard VS was up. Quickly we reformed and heading to Karnors. Sending down the lead group to the staging room, we COTHd the others down and formed groups. All told we had about 25 people there. 2 were level 60 and some were even in the high 40s. 2 were enchanters but due to the level differences only 1 could rune since the other couldnt overwrite theirs. Conventional wisdom is that VS would not be killable. But the Syndicate is anything but conventional. <br>
<br>
We began by clearing his room with harmony pulls and then we prepared for him. Main Assist Lekne charged his room with the 2 enchanters in tow. However we didnt realize there would be the rune overwrite problem so when Dragons (the Syndicate GM and the cleric who was healing Lekne arrived) he was already taking damage. The other tanks joined in while VS stayed focused on Lekne but unfortunately Lekne died. NUKE!! was called and the wizards opened fire and within seconds VS was at a sliver of health and running for his life. However the Wizards were out of mana!! And then the worst thing happened. A nearby mob in another room HEALED VS. Upon seeing that CAMP was called since VS would soon start LTing everyone. Most everyone camped out except for an unfortunate 8 or so people. <br>
<br>
Quickly we logged back in, ressed the dead and revised our strategy. This time one enchanter would rune as fast as she could (Baile) while the other chanter (Motley) tossed in a 200 point damage shield and kept some mana in case Baile ran out before the fight was over. We added in 3 pets and runed them and had taunt off. And one more tank joined us as well. Again we cleared his room and this time we also cleared the mobs in nearby rooms that healed him, just in case he ran again. <br>
<br>
Lekne charged back in and this time things went much better. Soon the tanks were with him and the nukers standing by. Suddenly a rune missed and Lekne went from full health to dead in about 1 second. VS turned to attack the rogue Nyka and runes switched to him (all tanks were runed before the fight just in case this happened). Vs bounced between Nyka and Udyo (the Secondary Assist) for a few seconds as the enchanters key runes up absorbing his LifeTap. Within seconds VS was near 50 percent health and Ranco yelled NUKE!!! The wizzies opened fire and as suddenly as the combat started, it was over. Down went VS! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The loot from VS included the Wizzie Epic staff, Cobalt Leggings for a warrior and some very nice Paladin leggings. It was The Syndicates first try at VS. It was done with what is considered an underpowered group, on the spur of the moment having never done him before. The result was spectacular and down went VS! Next time we face him im sure it will be even easier! <br>
<br>
To date The Syndicate has taken down Innoruk, Cazic Thule, all the demigods in Fear and Hate, several dragons and VS. We've raided almost every major high level zone and done very well in them all. We've completed a great many epics and will soon complete many more. There are very few things in EQ we havent done yet and those will soon be completed. <br>
<br>
Long Live The Syndicate!  <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>

Venril Sathir, Scalekeeper and other lifetap proccing mobs<br>
By Neferti - Tallon Zek<br>
For mobs it is very important to keep aggro on one person the entire time. Get a small group of people who can do damage fast, a few lure capable wizards and a few rogues are always nice. You need a high level (55+) warrior with good AC and fast proccing weapons to taunt. First off dont give anyone but the main tanks any HP buffs, certainly not the casters. If casters get aggroed there is no time to outtaunt in the time it takes VS to kill them, so its best they only feed him once before they die. Cast rune 3 on a few high aggro tanks (monks for example) before the fight. The only buffs you need are haste and clarity. You dont need groups.<br>
<br>
Send your main tank in first, and let him taunt and solo the mob for 10 seconds. Two enchanters (preferably of the same level) stagger casts of rune 3 on him, a little more then 2 seconds apart (half the casting time). I also did this a few times as the only enchanter, but I used rune 5 in that case. The MA never even lost any hitpoints.<br>
<br>
Make sure the main tank is the closest player to Venril at all times, as aggro is partly proximity based, all others stand behind him and as far as possible while still able to hit him. If you play on a PvP server, kill anyone who is in front of VS (taking riposte life taps). Extra enchanters can check with an /assist on Venril Sathir who is the current highest on the aggro list (this should be the MA). In case the MA dies they can make the switch in time. Dont heal anyone who gets hit besides the MA (you may rune them however). They did something wrong by over-aggroing so let them die and learn the hard way, don't make them feed VS even more. Wizards will wait till he is quite hurt until nuking (some say 70 health some say 50). Do not chain nuke in the beginning, if you get aggroed you just undid all your damage. Hopefully it will be a quick fight, before your enchanters mana runs out, if it takes too long and he lifetaps a few times just port to DL and try again. Reportedly the way that damage absorbers like bedlam and rune blocked procs got changed. If a tap would do 1500 damage, and rune 5 + bedlam (1050 damage absorber) was on the MA, then 450 of the damage will still be tapped now. <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>

If a bit dated.  Although not much has changed really, other than resists and I dont think that will affect VS much.<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind is that the rune5 trick doesnt work anymore.  Lifetapping mobs will simply eat the rune and absorb it.  The tank literally needs to avoid damage now.  This pretty much means a Ripost discipline equiped tank.<br>
<br>
This is a level 56 discipline.  Called Furious I think.  Unfortunatly it only lasts about 9 seconds.  I think Fortitude also works, but its a level 59 discipline and it too only lasts about 8 seconds.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have a level 59 tank this gives you approximatly 17 seconds to dish out about 16k damage to kill VS.  Which is doable for many guilds...I'm not sure about KCoG as its almost impossible to gauge with any certainty who will be there.  But...in theory we should be able to...<br>
<br>
Note this also means a minimum of 1 level 59+ warrior, probably 2.  But if you use multiple tanks they need to know how to work together and the other meleers need to know how to work with the tanks to ensure one holds aggro first, then the other automatically takes over.  This requires careful coordination between everyone.  Its easy to say in a guide to keep everyone at max melee, its another to actually enforce it.<br>
<br>
But, other than that yes.  Those are pretty good guides and a good place to start.<br>

We were once placed on the Sev rotation, but from my understanding (details weren't posted too well) there were not enough people that could show up because of most people being in guilds already on rotation.  This is why I am uncomfortable signing KCoG up for a VS rotation UNLESS I can be certain that we will be able to get enough firepower on short notice.  Really we will need at least 2 59+ tanks, at least 4 50+ clerics, and tons of damage.  We would need many wizards, a few enchanters, and lots and lots of melee damage (monks, rogues, etc).  If we could get enough people together to do it I am confident in my ability to lead us to victory, but I can't do it by myself, I need an army to come with me.  If we can take down VS we can then talk about Kunark Dragon rotations.  But we really need to be confident in taking out VS before screwing with any other stuff. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

Heh, oh well I guess I need to stick with it now.  I do sort of miss my little title and post count...  But anyway.<br>
<br>
I think Desty talked about adding us to the VS rotation, but in the end I think her guild or alliance decided to do it on their own due to other issues.  Talovar from Fellowship of Faydark did have us on the Sev rotation for a bit, but we were never able to muster the strength for it on such short notice.  That was about a year ago though.  But yeah, thats pretty much it.<br>
<br>
Personally I too am not convinced a loose knit group like KCoG can actually do something like VS+.  Not with the restrictions put on by the KGC at least.  That really limits us to a large degree.<br>
<br>
Still, I dont recall off hand the last time people failed to do something they really wanted to do.  I know 3 years ago the very idea of a group like KCoG being able to mobilize to do just the planes or even dragons was insane for many of the same reasons.  But through a lot of hard work, we made it work.  So who knows...<br>

There are 3 more, I just can't remember them off my head. <br>

<br>
Lol, are RKoL, SotV, and AoF the only guilds in KCoG with 50+ players NOT on VS rotation? I would really like to hear from other guilds out there.<br>
<br>
Look, nothing is impossible. Things can be very much improbable, or may look unacheivable. BUT, if you put your mind to something, and you work as a team, anything is possible. Commitment is not that hard of a word. With a 4-5 month rotation it's not that hard to let your guild know, with a good degree of certainty, when you will take on VS. We've got Farrn up to take the reins as leader, we just need some solid support, and RKoL doesn't have it all. I totally believe that we as KCoG can acheive this. It would be with seasoned players, ones who have experienced raids before and with an experienced Raid Leader.<br>
<br>
Am I confused in thinking that we are the only 3 guilds in KCoG with the firepower not in VS rot? Heh, it wouldn't be the first time I was confused. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

One suggestion I might make is perhaps those who are interested in this get together and talk about it.  Mostly I think with the officers and guild leaders of those guilds not on the rotation.  With perhaps a few others who are and have done him for input and futher suggestions.<br>
<br>
Now you all can start a thread here.<br>
<br>
Or you can do an email thing.<br>
<br>
OR You can organize another KCoG meeting.<br>
<br>
Its been well over a year and a half since KCoG last held a formal meeting between reps.  I think it might be useful to try to hold another one for the purpose of determining interest in VS and possibly Sev.<br>
<br>
Of course I'm not sure how many people would show up for that.  The last time we tried a meeting we didnt get anyone if I recall right.  But then again, that would also probably help to gauge relative interest.<br>
<br>
Using the KCoG chat channel would also work.  But I've always prefered a face to face meeting rather than using a teleconferance.  But that preference would probably be up to whoever is thinking about running these.  From this thread I'm guessing it would probably be Farn or Qamgine.<br>

The last two tries to make a meeting go were interrupted by dragon raids (either for my own alliance of KCOG). Having such a meeting would be a REALLY good idea, and if anyone wants to try to put one together, give me an email and I'll tell you how I used to do it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
VS and any of the other &quot;higher level&quot; stuff is going to be hard to pull off by the KCoG. VS would be easier than the 3 Kunark dragons because his spawn time is predictable almost to the minute. 3-day spawn or up on server downage. You can sometimes calculate up to 2 weeks in advance when you'll be up for VS. <br>
<br>
But the big bugaboo is the discipline and coordination required to do it. You have to fire on all cylinders or you die. I never was able to lead a successful VS raid. The 4 times I tried, we got slaughtered. Part of it was our levels (at the time the SB's were a high-40's/low-50's guild). The second time we went, we had 1 56th tank; she accidentally blew her riposte discipline on the fight before we hit VS, and didn't tell anyone. Without it, we died quickly. I've seen her go down in less time than it took me to hit the hotkey for CHARGE! when she was level 54. Not one person can be off or you die. With Vox or Naggy you have some swing room, and some time to remedy problems. VS you have none. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying COG can't do it. But you will need a dedicated group who is willing to be there come hell or high water.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
And thats why I think a meeting with interested officers, guild leaders, and reps and members is vital.<br>
<br>
Communications on a board or through email is essential yes, but it doesnt forge a bond between people really.  And thats what those early KCoG meetings served to do.  It really got guilds interested in the concept and made it work.<br>
<br>
Of course, today you'll probably have to do things the old fashioned way as well.  Just posting that the meeting is happening on the board probably isnt enough.  You'll have to take a look at the KCoG rosters and figure out which guilds can participate fully in a VS raid and contact them individually as well.  Many dont frequent here on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
So a meeting will take quite a bit of work on the part of the organizer.  But I think it would be worth it if you can pull it off.<br>
