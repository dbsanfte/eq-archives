<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I. Pre-Raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
--a. Have at least two stacks of food and water.<br>
 <br>
--b. leave extra equipment in the bank- dont be encumbered<br>
 <br>
--c. have some free slots in inventory for loot<br>
 <br>
--d. have your resistance gear on you.<br>
 <br>
--e. have your raid admision fee ( usually 75pp )<br>
 <br>
--f. have cigarettes/smoke, beer/pop, etc readily accessable, these raids are long.<br>
 <br>
--g. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> plan on at least 6-8 hours!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
--h. be camped out at the raid site the night before, or be there atleast 15 minutes early that day.... NOTHING delays a raid like people not showing up on time.<br>
 <br>
--i. be patient... if your under level 54, you prob wont be in the break-in groups, and might have to wait up to an hour or more.  its sad but its true that FEAR is hard to break, expecially w/ KCoG were we dont usually have many people above 56th level.<br>
<br>
--j. educate yourself.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.everlore.com"> www.everlore.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has some good information about mobs, loot, maps, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> II. That Day</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
--a. get there 15 minutes early<br>
<br>
--b.  /lfg ON     /role and /anon OFF<br>
<br>
--c. reduce lag   turn off all luclin charicter models, turn off spell partice effects, turn off PC names, lower clipping plane.<br>
<br>
--d.  /join kcogfear  for instructions/commands   DO NOT SPAMM this channel<br>
<br>
--e.  /join kcogchat    for chit chat, but dont spamm this channell either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
--f. if groups are pre-made, form groups asap.. if group leader isnt on line yet, someone just start inviting group mates, then when leader shows up, invite them, then make them leader with this command /makeleader &lt;name&gt;<br>
<br>
--g.  dont spamm raid leader w/ tells or questions, listen, and be pateint.<br>
<br>
--h.  if you go afk, make sure to put up the /afk on  tag..<br>
<br>
--i.  if you dont have a group, make sure your /lfg tag is ON.<br>
<br>
--j.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BE ON TIME!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  III.  Break-In </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
--a. if your under level 54, you prob wont be in break-in groups, but be patient.<br>
<br>
--b.  we send in 3 monks, one at the portal, one just north of camp, one just south of camp... they are our eyes. they FD and report mob activity<br>
<br>
--c.  three break in groups, all with atleast one druid each, zone in  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> invisible</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and boogie to camp.<br>
<br>
--d. camp is about 100 feet from zone in, directly west from the zone in portal, down a hill and to the west zone wall.<br>
<br>
--e.  we need enchanters, shaman, tanks, clerics, and druids for each break-in group.<br>
<br>
--f. these three groups kill mobs as fast as possible, and when any enchanter or cleric is OoM, the druids evak to ferrot and the groups med up and try again.   each attempt should have atleast three mobs killed.<br>
<br>
--g. evaking the groups before anyone dies is cruicial.  enchanters will be mezzing adds as they wander or agro into camp. if there are 5 or more mobs in camp, all groups need to evak, even if all mobs are mez'd, they wont be for long.<br>
<br>
--h.  evak will be called out by the raid leader only.<br>
<br>
--i.  if your group is evaked,  run back to the fear portal asap and med to full while people not in the break in groups rebuff you.<br>
<br>
--j.  after four or less attempts the camp area should be broken, and all other groups should be able to zone in safely.<br>
<br>
--k.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  getting to camp </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 YOU WILL NOT HAVE SoW ON<br>
 YOU WILL NOT HAVE SoE ON<br>
 YOU WILL BE W_A_L_K_I_N_G!<br>
<br>
you will walk to camp, if you get attacked, you will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STOP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and  fight where you are and die with honor<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> YOU WILL NOT TRAIN MOBS TO THE CAMP! </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
when you zone into FEAR, you will be on the top of a hill looking NORTH with the portal behind you...   YOU WILL NOT MOVE... you will turn left 90 degrees (facing directly WEST) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  THEN</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WALK</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> down the hill to camp.   so from the portal, camp is about 100' down the hill directly west.<br>
<br>
did i mention not to traqin mobs to camp? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
--l.  once everyone is at camp, any needed rez's well be done, and we all med to full and take a short break <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  IV. HUNTING </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
--a. our puller, usually a high level monk or SK, will get mobs and bring to camp, splitting mobs on the way.<br>
<br>
--b.  when the monk/SK gets into camp, he/she will FD and let the main tank gain agro.<br>
<br>
--c.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> assisting the main tank:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  you will make a hotkey to assist the main tank.. it will look like this<br>
<br>
 macro line one:    /assist &lt;main tank's name&gt;<br>
<br>
macro line 2-5  NOTHING!<br>
<br>
you DONT Need to add text saying &quot;i am assiting &lt;name&gt;&quot;  that isnt neccessary and just adds lag and battle spamm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>you will NOT assist the main tank UNTIL he/she has called out thier taret <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> AND ASKED FOR THE ASSIST!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
the main tank will have a /shout assist me on %t !!! ATTACK NOW!<br>
<br>
thats your que<br>
<br>
INT casters <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> WILL</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wait until the mob is at 50% health before nuking!! if casters are ping-ponging mobs, there is no way were gunna kill them fast enough to get to the mini'bosses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
the INC call is NOT the same as asking for assist.<br>
<br>
you will NOT target mobs w/ F8 or mouse clicking<br>
<br>
the only way you should target mobs is your assist hot-key.<br>

--d.  you do NOT attack anything until the main tank has called for the assit!!<br>
<br>
--e.  while the raid is fighting this mob, the puller(s) go out and get another mob.<br>
<br>
--f.  a mage w/ CoH will be assigned to the pullers group.<br>
<br>
--g.  after mobs have been pulled and killed all around the west camp, we will move to the south camp and wash/rinse/repeat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
--h.  loot .. all no drop loot will be immediatly lotto'd by useable class/race.  there are two tiers.. regular and BP's.  you may win a regualr, and still lotto on BP's, or vica versa, but once you win something on a tier , you are out all other no drop lottos on that tier until all people that cause use those items have won something.  all droppable loot will be lottoed at the end of the raid.<br>
<br>
--i.  we will attempt mini bosses depending on average raid level, and discipline of the raid members.<br>
<br>
--j.  CT is on rotation, and if he is up, we will contact the guild up for him, and work things out on a per situation basis.<br>
<br>
--k.  only group leaders will loot mobs, and immediatly report all no drop items to raid loot person, and immediatly loot and turn over all droppable items to the raid loot person.<br>

<br>
Do not demand that the puller pull specific mobs. They will eventually be gotten to when it is time. The mobs will be pulled in an order that makes it more likely that you will live to tell about it. <br>
<br>
Any questions you have, ask your group leader. They will relay them when appropriate. <br>
<br>
Do not break mez unless you are the MA. <br>
<br>
Come to the raid expecting to die. It happens to everyone, you can be rezzed. <br>
<br>
Do not come to the raid expecting XP... a raid is about taking down some hard mobs and possibly getting some cool items or armor. <br>
<br>
If you dont get something you wanted, dont whine about it. There will be other mobs and other raids. <br>
<br>
Write down on your handy paper who is in your group,That way if something happens and the group has to re-form, you know who was in it. <br>
<br>
 and if you want, who has won what lotto(s). <br>
<br>
If you are a designated buffer, unless the tells for buffs are coming slowly enough that you can keep track of them, its a good idea to keep a list on the paper of who needs what buffs and cross them off when given. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> General fighting rules </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Watch the raid channels. The puller will let everyone know what s/he is pulling and the MA will let everyone know which mob they are attacking first. If the MA needs to switch targets, this will be announced in raid channels as well. <br>
<br>
Do not attack the mob until the MA says to attack in raid channels<br>
<br>
on an INC, for gods sake.. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STAND-UP!!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Casters, do not cast on a mob till it is about 50% dead. Allow the melees some time to build agro<br>
<br>
Do not let the mobs run. If you have been assigned to be the designated snarrer, snare the mob when it is at half health. <br>
<br>
If you are attacked while in the camp, do not run around like a chicken with its' head cut off. stand where you are and stay by the melees. <br>
<br>
Always, always protect your clerics. They are crucial to the raid. If all the clerics die, CR will be difficult if not impossible without a Necro to summon. its one of the most important things that clerics are able to /camp out<br>
<br>
If the call has been given for the clerics to camp, watch until they are out. Once they are out, you keep assitin the main tank, and hopelly kill an extra mob or two before dying.  monks and SK's hsould be FD's and them camp to loose aggro, we need eyes in there to let the clerics know when to camp  back in.    you only camp AFTER the clerics have gotton out.<br>
<br>
If someone has handed their mod rod to a cleric, they should ask a mage for another. Its generally a good idea to have a hotkey made for this to ask in /tell <br>
<br>
If there has been a wipeout, upon respawning at the bind point, mages should start making mod rods and handing them to the others that have died. This way, there are some already made before rezzes since a rez drains all mana. After being rezzed, the mod rod should be handed to the cleric to regain some of the mana spent on the rez. After looting the body, the rezee should ask the cleric if they need the other rod that had been on the corpse. <br>
<br>
General looting rules <br>
<br>
Each group should have a master looter. When looting mobs, the looter should announce in the proper raid channel what it dropped. Example: %t dropped coin, gems, and no drop &lt;class and race&gt;armor <br>
If it drops no-drop stuff, during the next lull, it will be looted following guild looting rules. <br>
<br>
If it drops something that is not no-drop, it should be looted and immediatly turned over to the main loot coordinator.<br>
<br>
If you havent noticed, the keys here are being prepared, keeping your clerics safe and supplied with mana, and keeping screen-clogging chat to a minimum.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udestructressfyrestarter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Destructress Fyrestarter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Planes Raid Liason</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/10/02 9:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a note on protecting clerics</span><hr size=1> only agro mobs attacking clerics if clerics have been told to camp...<br>

under normal fighting circumstances. if a cleric gets attacked,  there is a good chance a mez is inc on that mob...  so just keep assisting the main tank!<br>

if the raid leader has called for clerics to camp, then by all means, stand near clerics and attack/kick/taunt/nuke mobs so the clerics can camp out...<br>
