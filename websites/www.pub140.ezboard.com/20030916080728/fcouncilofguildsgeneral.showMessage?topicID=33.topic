policy</span><hr size=1> Forgive me, but this is quite long as the incident folds out....<br>
<br>
The day started off in Kerra Isle finding out the new paw quest. I never started it until this day and set out to do the quest and only the quest. I went through the whole process of Qeynos Aqueducts, Kerra Isle- then headed to Upper Guk as this is now where the first 3 rings components are dropped. I was in Upper Guk at least a good 12 hours (verifiable by Ssussun) to get the Degenerated Guk Weed. Once I got this I headed to get my first 3 rings, then to Befallen to get the 4th. (of course this has nothing to do with the incident so far, just adding to show how much I went through BEFORE it all happened.)<br>
 <br>
I gathered 2 other guild members for the quest into Befallen- Palanthas &amp; Titanyia. Doing my research of the quest prior to starting all this, I discovered via various EQ websites that you must kill Gynok Moltar in Befallen in the attempt to get the platinum ring. Once we arrived, a high level druid was there camping the spot already, Vilox, and we kindly asked if we could have the next after he departed. He stated he had been there over 5 hours and was about to take his leave. So now, of course, we assumed the camping. (this is a big part here-&gt;) It is said, and well known by most, that Gynok has many, many Place Holders that spawn in his spot. His spawn spot is located at the entrance to Befallen, but it is said they will wonder all the way down to the 3rd floor. Hence, our group commenced to killing all possible place holders for this Gynok to spawn. (we do this for all other named spawns so why not this one also?) At this time, I went Link Dead and had to reboot. Just before I got back into the game, Palanthas had told me a 32 level monk stepped in and asked if anybody was camping Gynok. (me and Pal are close friends and are on the phone at same time) Pal responded /ooc Yes there is. Liza then started shouts that she now has the camp due to nobody standing exactly on the spawn location. (the entrance hallway) A verbal shouting match continued between Palanthas, Titanyia and Liza as to who was there first. By this time, I arrived back in the game. I sent a /tell to Liza simply stating that we came here for the camp, someone was here, we waited our turn and could she please wait hers now.  This not only started increasing shouts by Liza, but direct tells telling me to leave the zone as it was HER camp now. Regardless of what I say she said or didn't, she came in stating she was there first and it was her camp. I have witnesses and can prove we were there quite awhile before her- Vilox and a bard named Vwen.<br>
 <br>
Upon our &quot;shouting match&quot; we all went back to the spawn location and Liza was standing right where Gynok spawns. Never doing this quest before, we were uncertain where he spawned and us 3 took up positions in the hallway. She then started threats against us stating she was logging all that is said, (we replied please do), and will be calling a GM. We, thinking of course were in the right, stated we would welcome a GM to come to settle this. Following this, Liza did not say or shout one more thing. Low and behold, Gynok spawned with us all sitting there, and as Liza was standing on top of his spawn spot, of course he aggrod on her first. I began my casting, as I always do, and she took up melee attack. (druid vs. monk...) Of course she hit him first also. Upon my casting, Lycium began to /say &quot;Cyan backoff. Cyan backoff!&quot;  We all know of course, that 2 druids and a ranger will out damage a monk any time on a situation like this. However, once I saw that it was Lycium telling us to back off, I stated to our group to back off.  Lycium then summoned me away from Gynok into the &quot;courtyard&quot; of Befallen. Gynok was killed very fast, so I assume our spells got off enough to take the kill, but I cant confirm this due to not gaining any experience off of him, nor being able to loot him. Somehow Liza looted Gynok and zoned IMMEDIATELY before anything was said. I assume she looted the ring because she not only zoned, but she camped right away. <br>
 <br>
We then began to speak with Lycium about the incident. He stated that Liza had called him and said she was there first and we came in telling her we were going to KS. Myself and noone else in our guild are KSers, and we do not accept this style of gameplay. However, I'm sure we did tell Liza we would easily take the kill if she tried to engage it. (druid vs. monk thing again). Lycium told us the new &quot;play nice policy&quot; states that all those there at a given camp spot must come to a compromise or a guide/gm will set a rotation between them that they must follow. Lycium stated Liza had told him she was there first (he implied initially that the first there was who got it), and we would not accept any compromise. I very much wish I had started to /log this, as she did not even mention a compromise once. She only shouted and yelled that she was there first and it is her camp site. (I would like to see if she's willing to pass her log along... I seriously doubt it). Anyhow, she did not offer any kind of compromise but yet told Lycium she did. I honestly dont think Lycium was part of this ploy by Liza, as I assume he came to Befallen right before Gynok spawned, seeing us 3 and her 1 at the site. Since all he spoke to prior to the incident was Liza, I can see how, if he didn't show until just before the spawn, that it looked as we were easily going to take the kill. But again, we have witnesses to prove otherwise. Lycium advised me that its now Verants policy that whoever the mob aggros first and who is first to attack it (not engage as in casting time...) has the right to the kill. How else would we have gotten the first aggro/attack if she knew where and was standing upon his spawn spot? Upon talking to Lycium, it did appear as he began to see our side of it, as we had our witnesses (of which he knew Vilox already), but he stated there was nothing he could do now. I informed him that I understood his position but not the situation. Lycium only told me that with him seeing no attempt at a compromise after his arrival, he must give the kill to her. After some further &quot;chit-chat&quot;, he bid us farewell and went off the lands of GMs. <br>
 <br>
This to me, is simply abuse of this new &quot;play nice policy&quot;. Liza knew what she was planning prior to stepping into Befallen. There are to many factors stating otherwise:  Why would she ask /ooc if there was someone here camping him if she saw noone and assumed she had the spot?  Why did she attempt no compromise with us but informed Lycium that she had?   Why did she step in and stand just about on the exact spot that Gynok would spawn?  Why did she immediately loot and run to zone and not stay to speak her side?  Why did she immediately camp?   And I still wonder how she had impeccable timing of when Gynok would be spawning...<br>
 <br>
After Lycium left, I sat in that hallway for another 9 hours without seeing Gynok spawn once. Not once! I guess I'll be sitting there in Befallen forever now... (or have to buy the ring from another PC, imagine how much Liza would be charging me since she's a monk &amp; cant use it anyways!)<br>
 <br>
FYI: <br>
&quot;/who all Lycium&quot; in another zone states he is a guide, but when he was in Befallen, it stated GM- I know not the difference<br>
Those in my group:  Palanthas and Titanyia, both members of the Sign of One<br>
Those who were there and would hold witness to us:  Vilox (human druid)  and Vwen (wood elf bard)<br>

If you had done a /who all Lycium while he was in the same zone...You would have seen that he is (as am I) a Guide.<br>
<br>
I believe it is just a bug that it doesnt show up Guide on the normal listing...a low priority bug.<br>
<br>
ps: whaa? think we dont keep our eyes on you guys? I read these boards more often than I do Alakazam's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I like to know what bugs you guys...it helps with my duties as a Guide.<br>
<br>
Sorry tho, if a mob agro's on someone..it is attempted killstealing to pull it off of them. If we know that the mob spawns there, we usually ask the Customers to move away from the spawn area some. But, we cant allow anyone to say they 'own' or are 'camping' a mob. It's FFA (to a point).<br>
