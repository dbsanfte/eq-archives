<br>
&lt;Crack knuckles&gt;<br>
<br>
Where to begin.<br>
First it's great and wonderful that you have so many high level friends that will drop everything (or 30 minutes max) to come to your aid and help. Or even more sit and wait for 60 people to buff, kill giants and attack Vox with takes about 3 to 4 hours. That's very good of you. Buuuttt most of the members of the CoG raids, aren't members of large guilds, don't have high level friends, don't have experience in raids or even dragon raids. To assume everyone has a cleric in their back pocket to call on with a snap of a finger to help with a Vox raid is narrow minded.  Now that's not to say that there will not be any high levels, In fact there was 3 in the last Vox raid. A level 55 paladin, level 55 druid and myself level 56 Rogue. The reasons for those people being there are their own. For me I was there to support my Online Sweetheart and her guild.<br>
<br>
High level giant team. There was a Team. Not a large one but we had no problems taking one or two giants. In fact we killed I think it was 6 giants. Every 30 minutes. We kept the buff line safe.<br>
<br>
The CR person was me. There was one. Lets count that again.. One person pulling over 100 corpses. I can only do it so fast and I can only pull the corpses I have consent to. And in most cases I had to ask.. including yours. I pulled every corpse I could but 5 out of the lair and pits. And yes there was a screw up, totally out of anyone's control. I asked Kommisar to aggro Vox so I could sneak by to get the corpse I couldn't get. We (Including you) had no way to know that Vox would wander out and kill everyone, Including the high level Giant group. We couldn't keep the giants clear because we died.<br>
<br>
I paid for the coffins out of my own pocket, I called my own guild out of Exp Groups to come and help, I tired to get a Cleric with a epic and I pulled all the corpses out of the lair and pits and I got Lets count them kids, 4 thanks yous. I don't expect money, I don't expect thank yous, I came and I spent my time I could be getting level 57 or money or loot to give back something to the people of Karana because of the<br>
goodness of my heart. I really don't need to come here and hear some one whine and rant about half the stuff he has no idea what he is talking about. I'm not saying the raid want prefect, and I'm not saying the CR want well. It was mess to say the least.<br>
<br>
Now lets clear up some more misinformation will we are at it. First the Raid leader. Normally there are two, from what I gather one of them couldn't make it. The meleer one could. Kommisar. Poor Kommisar died in the first 5 seconds of the fight and couldn't relay any information right to the raid. We tried to rez him as quickly as we could.<br>
<br>
In you're 2 years of playing how many times have you gone into a death loop? And how did you learn about unplugging your computer to stop it? As I stated before.. most of the people on these raids are newbies when  it comes to large group raids. They have never been in a death loop or even heard of it before. I'm sure they all know what it is now. Saying they are stupid for not unplugging isn't the right way to tell people.<br>
You explain it. You tell them how to stop it.<br>
<br>
I will have to agree with you about one thing. Communication. It sucks. My Suggestion is try running a raid with 60 people from 30 different guild. Each of them been playing for 12 day to 2 years with high level friends that know better, that run around sending people tells asking when their corpse is going to get rezed, try to get groups together to get corpses even though the corpses are coming down. People that think they need more people in the zone to help. Or some druid sees a giant runs pass the hidden rogue to snare it with out even looking and scouting. Ends out pulling 3 giants into the rezing area, and when he is being attacked and the poor rogue is trying to peal them off he backs up right into another room with 3 more giants. Now the rogue is Tanking 6 giants (Druid died), will he could have easily pulled one and killed it and then pulled another. Having to send a tell to each and every person to ask for consent. And you know what?? That's the way CoG raids work. You can never understand the stress the raid leaders go through for you guys. And the worst are the ungrateful ones that whine and bitch because they know it all better.<br>
That's not to say you can't suggest things or come up with ideas. That's what the CoG is about. Helping people experience new things and grow and learn.  But that's not what your doing. Your pointing fingers, whining, complaining and ranting. There are better ways to get your point across then Ranting. You will only get people to rant back and to prove your wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh I will not be able to make it to the Raids. &lt;Sad&gt; My guild is in ToV tonight. Wish you all the best of luck. If I can I'll try to make it when the Harbingers' raid is over. You guys can do it. &lt;Cheer&gt;<br>
