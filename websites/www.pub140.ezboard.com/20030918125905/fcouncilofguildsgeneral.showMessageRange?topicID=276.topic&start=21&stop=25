I never did.  Yes, our guild being accepted was important and I tried a many times for you guys to listen to me but, you never once did.  You were too busy fighting with Shadowland to listen.  Quite frankly I got tired of trying to win you guys over because it wasn't working.  You guys are a losing battle for me obviously.  Even members from our guild posted on here BEGGING for you guys to accept them, maybe not Shadowland but, them and you couldn't see past ONE person.  What does that say about the KCOG?<br>

We arent seeing past one person.  We're not seeing past your guild leader.  Big difference.<br>

<br>
Shadowlands has pissed off pretty much everyone and has yet to apologize for anything.  Since you have yet to publicly denounce what he has said, apparently he was speaking on behalf of your guild.  You have defended him on numerous occasions, and ultimately declined responsibility for his actions of a member of your guild.<br>
<br>
Add to that the continued confusion when he posts from your account and the sig mis-haps that have happened... which has lead to a mild debate as to whether or not the two of you aren't actually the same person trying to play two sides of the coin.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, none of this has helped your position, and at this time, Trucidation is pretty much in a hole yer not gonna be able to get out of for a while... tempers are still too hot... memories of past grievences still too fresh.<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is waiting a little while for things to cool off.  Perhaps follow my suggestion on a different thread about running some CoG events yourself to try and prove that you want to be an active guild in the KCoG community... and not just come along to gank the &quot;ph@t l3wts&quot; from our raids.<br>
<br>
Having Shadowlands apologize for his extremely immature behavior is of questionable value at this point.  I doubt anyone would believe the sincerity, and I think as long as he is part of Trucidation his stigma from NTC is going to cause you problems.  His lack of principle has obviously not changed since he does not understand that cheating people out of items, regardless of how stupid the victim may have been, is still WRONG.  Trying to hide behind the concept of role-playing and the &quot;I didn't break Sony's rules&quot; defense just don't cut mustard here.<br>
<br>
Honestly I'm not sure what you can do to repair your guilds reputation at this time... maybe in a few weeks people will be more willing to give you a shot.  I don't know how many, at this point... but sure as hell more than would want to consider it at this moment.  Certianly taking responsibility for the actions of your guilds members would be a start.  Without that, no one will trust you as a leader.<br>
<br>
In the mean time... yeah... maybe you should break Shadow's hands so he can't type, because he's apparently incapable of reasonable dialogue, and pretty much anything he says right now is gonna get you deeper in the hole.  His posts have already degraded to the point that CoG members find them amusing rather than argumentative... when people stop taking you seriously, you have no hope of a meaningful discussion.  His flames, stupid quips, and insults can only further degrade your position.  If you cannot stop them, your cause is lost. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

Because on more than one occasion I have apologized and said that his posts were wrong.  Yes, Shadow and I are two serpate people.  Does that need to be proven also?  Need a picture of some sort?  And as long as he is apart of Trucidation?  That sounds like you're telling me how to run my guild in my opinion.  Yes I have backed him up on numerous occasions because this whole thing started out nicely, yes nicely and turned into some big war.  If you read his first post, and I 'd say his first post introducing our guild they were quite nice but, someone deleted his posts.. Ok so I'll take a break.  I won't post on here for a week.. when I come back I'll &quot;Start Over.&quot;<br>
