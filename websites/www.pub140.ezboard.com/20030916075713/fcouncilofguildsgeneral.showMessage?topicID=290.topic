PS. my interpretation is that half the guild moved somewhere and now believe that since they have the majority they still have their Gore slot, just a diff guild name? Think we need clarification...<br>

CoLS as of today still remains as a guild.  However, most of the high level characters moved to a new guild named Restitution.<br>
<br>
There is currently a small debate on the KGC website as to whether or not Resitution can keep the slot for CoLS even though they are a new guild.<br>
<br>
In any event Robin is correct in that this is the KCoG board and not the KGC board and therefore has nothing to do with rotations or this debate.<br>

Please feel free to use the link to the KGC board in the FAQ here and post your objections in their public access section.  I dont believe you will get much of a response however.<br>
<br>
This is not the place to discuss whether or not this is fair or anything else.  Its how it is.<br>
<br>
The CoLS question has pretty much been settled.  If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact one of officers about it.<br>
<br>
Also, please dont use all caps in the future.  Beyond courtesy and etiquite and all that, the usage of all caps makes it hard to read.<br>

And I've heard many different reasons.  Everything from &quot;Well, duh&quot; to &quot;Because thats the way it is&quot;.<br>
<br>
As I see it, however, the KGC board is for scheduling the rotations.  Just purely that.  There is no reason for more than a few people to have access to it from each guild.  Of course, various discussions to appear on it from time to time, but they generally only serve to illustrate why even limiting to only guild leaders and officers may be to many.  Often you'll see in a debate officers and guild leaders giving different points of view and different comments and votes.  That does nothing other than to muddy already turbulent waters.<br>
<br>
In the end, the KGC is about scheduling rotations.  And I fail to see why anyone would even be interested in what goes on there.  Should you have any questions you can simply ask your guild leader or an officer that has access.  But if you want to post your own comments and ideas, well thats what EQVault is for.<br>
<br>
I dont see it as being a conspiracy or some sort of elite organization that excludes people.  Merely that too many cooks spoil the dish.  But thats just my view.  Others have different ones.   Which is fine.  Too much of the same gets boring after awhile.<br>

ok but maybe there should have a board ppl can state there opions on. for  it will help  kgc to be more fair to all. Not just  to guild leader and officers. Maybe have one  others can see and speak freely upon also. For those that has no guild. Means there opions are not being heard. They need a forum where  they can speak also. Keep the ones u have but open a board to all  non guildies and  ones that are in a guild that thinks of something they can do. Just because you in a guild your leader might not have your  veiw point anyways.

As for those without a guild, well, this board is really about the only place you have any representation or swing. The KGC wasn't meant for those without guilds, it was meant to keep those in guilds from fighting with each other over spawns. It doesn't and can't represent you, because the spawns that it deals with can't be taken out by single individuals. Single individuals are not part of the KGC equation, and would honestly through roadblocks into the whole process. It is there as a schedule, as a record keeping device, and the only discussions it gets into revolve around spawn times of large targets, and how best to utilize the rotation to make sure every guild in it gets its fair chance at those spawns. Any other discussion just isn't in it's purview. <br>
