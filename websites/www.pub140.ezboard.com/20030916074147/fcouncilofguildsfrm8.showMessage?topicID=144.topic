I thought you did a wonderful job with this very important raid.  Especially important as failure would have been the removal of CoG from the naggy cycle for probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 - 4 months.  Very good raid.<br>

And one final &quot;thank you&quot; to paralax for the help in buffing. I wish you very well with ragefire. <br>

Great raid everyone!</span><hr size=1> Well, rather than edit my old post, I'll just make a new one with my re-cap... heh.<br>
<br>
We finished up role call and began to create groups around 8:30 EST... and were beginning to move into the zone by a little after 9, as I recall.  I had to turn a few folks away at the last minute, and for this I apologize - but I really can't make exceptions and modify groups once we get moving, there's too much for me to do to stop and re-assign people.<br>
<br>
We had 8 full groups, and a couple extra's who we slotted in for the final assault on the dragon in place of 53+ support personel.<br>
<br>
Clearing the FG's all the way to the lair &quot;ready-room&quot; went fairly easily as not all of them had re-spawned... we had a little excitement with one particular FG who had a fondness for teleporting once he started running, but eventually he was taken down (by the two groups left in the area at the time, good work!).<br>
<br>
Paralax had been camping Ragefire and clearing FG's before Naggy spawned, so the FG spawns were a little scattered, but they helped us out a ton.  Arthurr actually pulled several of the FG's that popped up behind us (including Skarlon) all the way up to where we were settling in, so we were able to get a full spawn of named kills before we fought Naggy.<br>
<br>
A special thanks goes out to Kefo, our brave Iksar monk who did a wonderful job pulling.  He was coming out of Naggy's lair with a FG wizard in tow once and managed to Feign Death successfully with 93hp remaining! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Auldiwen, charming as ever, was also supurb on crowd control in the situations we had more than one in a pull. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
After waiting (very patiently, thanks everyone) for the last FG spawns in the lair to finish popping, we set up the buff-line and began working our way through.  Paralax lent us a level 57 Cleric for buffs and a level 60 (?) Enchanter for Clarity II, as well as proving to me that I hadn't done my homework nearly well enough when it came to high level Shaman buffs... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Once buffing was complete, we went over strategy in the chatroom, and everyone logged back in... we replaced all the 53+ support personel with 52 and under combatants for the assault on Nagefen, and charged in!<br>
<br>
Triage was set up just around the corner from the door to the lair, and the tanks did a marvelous job of keeping Naggy pretty much exactly where I wanted him during the bulk of the fight.  He wandered out on to the bridge once, but everyone pulled back after a couple shouts and he came back to the center of his lair where he remained until he went into run mode.<br>
<br>
The main reason I think we did so well this time is really a combination of several things:<br>
We had a very high level showing for our tanks... the lowest level Warrior was 48, and the lowest Paladin was 49... as the first wave in this made it so very few people were feared right off the bat.  Also, almost all the tanks had decent resistances - I would like to thank a few people who I know left the raid early because they didn't have sufficient resist gear.  The willingness to not participate in a raid because they didn't meet the requirements set forth shows great courtesy and sportsmanship.<br>
<br>
The combination of good resistances and levels made our tanks last a long time against the beast - I didn't see the first wave of heal-me shouts until he was at 70% life or so... <br>
<br>
We also had a very good showing of healers.  Our last attempt at Vox was with a single cleric, we had 5 (?) on this raid, 3 of them level 51.  Add to that a number of 51+ Shaman and Druid, and we had a very well stocked triage line, indeed.<br>
<br>
Casters were called in when he was at about 50% life, and he started dropping like a rock after that... I didn't remember to start my stopwatch when the battle commenced, but the whole thing couldn't have lasted more than 2 1/2 or 3 minutes, tops.<br>
<br>
Naggy died a little after 2am EST, and we began rez'ing all 5 people who had died... heh.  Runesteel of Paralax helped out again by providing level 56 reviviscence to all who had perished.  I wish him the best of luck with Ragefire and completing his epic!<br>
<br>
Out of superstition and tradition, I think I'll make sure we <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>don't</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> pre-roll for Paladin book drops on Nagafen.  For one, corpse recovery is much easier in Naggy's lair as there aren't any pit traps for people to fall down - and two... we seem to have a better track record against him when we don't pre-roll... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
A last few thanks are due here: Kelemevor did a great job as Primary Assist, especially when we were pulling FG's from multiple directions as they re-popped behind us <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> in the lair in front.  Since Kelemevor never actually managed to get himself killed, Numeldar never got to do his job as Secondary Assist, but I'm sure he would have done equally as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I'd also like to thank Yizelar and Creirwyy for their support and help, as well as all the group leaders on the raid.<br>
<br>
This was a kind of odd-ball raid because of the timing on FG spawns, but everyone rolled with the punches and it turned out being smoother and easier than I could have ever hoped for.  Kudo's to everyone who came, and let's have as good a showing for the next time we assault Vox!  We owe her as good a thumping as we gave Naggy this time! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

We were in Fear waiting for a pull, when Dogedme announced over guildchat that the CoG was about to charge Naggy. It seemed like less than 3 minutes when he came back and told us Naggy was dead! We hadn't even gotten the pull in yet! LOL! Sounds like a great raid was had by all, and good to see the dragon go down again to the CoG. <br>

Great raid everyone!</span><hr size=1> I congratulate all on a great raid !!  Sounds like everyone had a super time.  Wish I could have been there......on that note I have to say that I was extremely disappointed to have posted here weeks ago for the sign-up, taken the time off of work, and checked the posts daily to make this raid only to show up and not get to go.  I did everything asked of me by signing up, etc.  and there were many who did not sign-up and showed up at last minute but got to attend.  I'm sorry if I sound like a complainer but all in all I just felt very cheated.  I was around five levels higher than some of the others going.  My main reason of wanting to go so badly is because I had never gotten to do Naggy.....and now will not because I will be to high of a level.  I understand that there were many late-comers and am not so sure why I wasn't told to &quot;hang around&quot; if people were going to be allowed in late.  Just not sure why I wasn't put into the groups in the beginning since I was on time....signed up....and standing there waiting over others who had not done so ???  Anyway.....congrats again to all.....great raid guys.  <br>

I'm sorry I couldn't make it, my brother's B-day was the same day as the raid and we had dinner planned right about starting time on the raid.  My ISP took a crap on me and I couldn't get a connection above 19.2 kbps, so I couldn't have helped much even if I was able to show up late <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
