<br>
At 8:00 we had exactly ONE cleric and TWO druids in the 40-52 range, so we got off to a late start after having to talk a few more healers into joining us.  <br>
<br>
Then he got out of his lair while the last group was going through the buff line, and eventually made it out past the throne room, so we had to wait for him to go home again, and do a CR before we even got started.<br>
<br>
Once we actually engaged, we managed to get him down to 3% before he killed the last person.  Unfortunately, he managed to get out again while we were fighting him, and a couple of our caster-types got caught in death loops in the buff room.<br>
<br>
We did manage to recover all corpses without having to have them summoned, although getting everyone rez'ed took quite a while, and things went WAY too late for a weeknight, IMO. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Overall, not the success to be hoped for.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who attended, special thanks to support, buff line, and CR folks, particularly Kefo, who had to run back in from being ported out some uncountably high number of thimes while dragging corpses out of the lair. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

  The resulting cr and having to reorganise the buffline etc, wasted OVER an hour during which half a dozen people already in the chatroom got bored and left - with only a few more melee naggy would have died.<br>
<br>
Ps A huge slap on the thighs to the person that went for a heal when they had aggro, in so doing dragged naggy through to the buffline resulting in multiple bind loop deaths.<br>

And Vox is likely a ways off... we're 8th up now, she should spawn for the current guild any day.  Even if everyone ahead of us fails or passes, it won't be any sooner than the middle of next week.  <br>
<br>
I don't expect as many passes on Vox as we saw on Naggy this time through, though.  Many guilds take her more seriously, since she and Gore are the only places to get white scales / frozen books, and Gore is on an even longer rotation, while 4 mobs drop red scales, and 4  drop burnt books, at least one of each not on rotation  (Scalekeeper in the Hole and Ragefire for red scales, Melalafen in Western Wastes for book -- I've heard it drops off Ragefire as well, but not confirmed).  Since the only reason some of these guilds are doing old-world dragons is for epic parts, this makes Naggy less important to them than Vox is.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't surprise me all that much if we saw Naggy yet again before we see Vox. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

I don't think it was that person's fault whatsoever since I happen to be one of the very few that took the time and actually talked to them after and ask what happened.<br>
<br>
There was 1 group left to be buffed, how hard was it for everyone to get back in, get in line, buff them and be done? Not very since everyone was dragged and rezzed quickly.<br>
<br>
People were not paying attention to Nerissa and doing as told, people were not even attempting to help the raid itself. Support group mostly buggered RIGHT off as soon as a fail came by and didn't even bother to help with your CR. The few of us left had to call in other support to help.<br>
<br>
And by the way if you hadn't noticed, it was the only cleric on the entire raid that Rilellore decided to tell to loot up and get the hell out, causing her to eat 6 unrezzed deaths and leave you with no cleric. It was also that same poor cleric that came running all the way back in to rez your sorry asses.<br>
<br>
You want to lay blame for something? Fine!<br>
<br>
I blame the raiders for being greedy loot whores and too over-excited to /random that none of you would listen.<br>
<br>
I blame the raiders for not trying to help to be a solution instead of contributing to the problem.<br>
<br>
I blame the support team for having <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*WAY*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> too many Useless people along and then buggering off at the first hint of trouble.<br>
<br>
I blame the idiots that kept repeatedly trying to go into the lair to pull corpses and repeatedly punting the support crew trying to help.<br>
<br>
I further blame said idiots for doing it REPEATEDLY until yelled at to stop (and even then continued but invis).<br>
<br>
I blame the buff line co-ordinator for having the stupidest buff line setup I've ever seen in my life.<br>
<br>
I blame the buff line co-ordinator for superceeding the raid leaders authority and punting the only cleric in attendance.<br>
<br>
I blame the buffline co-ordinator for ignoring every piece of advice offered.<br>
<br>
I blame myself for overriding Nerissa durring the CR and trying to get things back under control.<br>
<br>
I blame myself for thinking CoG couldn't fail, and not trying harder to make it a success.<br>
<br>
I blame myself for not speaking up and pointing this crap out earlier in the raid when I had a chance.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, the lack of respect show to the raid leader, raid co-ordinators and other raiders last night shows me that almost none of you were anything but greedy selfish twinks looking to spin a quick dollar. If KCoG has fallen that far since my time leading here, then it is time for me to move on and never look back.<br>
<br>
Don't lay blame on people until you're ready to take a bit yourself. In the meantime, if you think it was that person above's fault, why dont you try talking to them and ask what really happened.<br>
<br>
When they start doing Age / IQ / Maturity tests to play eq, I will be a happy lady. Try sitting back and wondering if you helped or hindered last night before you bitch. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/VLRVsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

(though, for the record, there were multiple clerics on the raid of combat level - it was only at the very beginning that there was only one).<br>
<br>
Blaming the fail on the person who pulled Naggy is complete crap.  If people buggered off during the CR and res'ing from that, those people shouldn't have been on the raid in the first place.<br>
<br>
If you wuss out and head home with your metaphorical tail between your legs at the first sign of trouble, please, do everyone a favor and don't leave the precious safety of your home in the first place.<br>
<br>
Raids are dangerous.  There <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be setbacks.  There <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be long, painful CR's.  There <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be mistakes made.  There will, even, on occasion, be problems that have not yet been encountered (I, for one, would have sworn up and down until last night that Nagafen couldn't leave his lair... that's the first time I've seen that happen).<br>
<br>
But blaming the person who made a single mistake and pulled the dragon out of the lair is being pretty short-sighted.  Vox leaves her lair all the time.  She has been pulled to the buffline, and far beyond, a large number of times.  There have been partial wipes, people caught in bind-death-loops, giants respawning and killing people as they log back in to help, and numerous other problems.  In the past, we've dealt with it, stuck around, and got the job done anyway.<br>
<br>
Telling the person to loot un-rez'd corpses and leave the raid is totally un-called for, except in the most extreme cases (some who is, purposefully training the raid multiple times, for instance).<br>
<br>
Like Vree, I have a fair amount of issues with the buffs that were set up and given last night.<br>
<br>
To anyone planning on running a buffline for Nagafen or Vox in the future, please, read this thread:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=303.topic">pub140.ezboard.com/fcounc...=303.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Also, a few words about specific buffs and the order they should be given.<br>
<br>
1) Endure vs Resist<br>
Using Endure &lt;poison/disease/cold/fire&gt; instead of Resist &lt;same&gt; is unnacceptable.  Endure buffs are dispelled far more easily than resist buffs, making them useless as junk buffs to buffer the &quot;important&quot; buffs (namely, the magic resist and fire/cold resist buff for the dragon in question).  Never, ever, use Endure &lt;anything&gt; as a junk buff.  Period.<br>
<br>
2) Stat buffs<br>
Even accounting for a relative lack of Shaman on the raid, there were stat buffs that could have been put on.  Druids can cast Storm Strength or Girdle of Karana (both fairly tough to dispell), and rangers can cast Feet like Cat (or whatever their Agi buff is called).<br>
<br>
3) Ranger ATK buff vs Brell's HP buffs<br>
Brell's Steadfast Aegis and Brells Mountinous Barrier are both extremely hard to dispell (BMB has something like 36 counters, enough to last through 2 fully un-resisted dispell blasts from Nagafen, which do about 18 counters a piece from what I've seen) - ranger ATK buffs are far easier to dispell, and don't provide as many hp, which is far more important than adding a couple points of melee damage from the higher atk rating.  Oh yeah, they don't stack... something that someone setting up a buffline should know before they take the job, or something they should be told by the buffers as soon as they try to set up the line with both being cast.<br>
<br>
4) Cleric AC Buff<br>
There was no AC buff given.  While AC may only be useful if you are being melee'd by Naggy, Shield of Words and higher AC buffs are tough to dispell.  And ultimately, EVERY BUFF put in front of MR and CR/FR buffs is basically there to be a shield first, and a useful buff second.<br>
<br>
5) Circle of Summer/Winter placement<br>
Circle of Summer/Winter should, always, in every case, without exception, be the LAST BUFF IN THE LINEUP.  Never, ever, should it be put before Symbol, for example, which was the case last night.<br>
<br>
6) Mana/Mind buffs<br>
Mana regen and buffs of similar nature are useless.  Period.  They should never be put on, and they should especially not be put on AFTER the MR and FR/CR buffs... that is just retarded.  The bottom line is: if the fight lasts long enough for mana regen to make a difference to a healer, you've lost anyway.<br>
<br>
7) DMF<br>
When available (which it was last night) DMF should be put in front of the MR and CR/FR buffs.  The lev component of DMF is not that useful for Nagafen, but DMF is very tough to dispell (notice a trend here?) and as such, acts as an excellent shield for the resist buffs.<br>
<br>
We had, after LD's, 33 people of combat level in the raid, with an average level of 47.  That should have been more than enough to kill Nagafen.  With a proper line up of buffs in the proper order, he would have been a dead lizard.  The people who wussed out at the first setback didn't make the difference.<br>
<br>
And, now that this post has gotten pretty long, I have one more point to make:<br>
<br>
Whoever is in put in the position of calling the abort on the raid if/when the leader dies (if the leader is a melee class), don't be afraid to call the abort.  Once all the melee classes are dead, abort, abort, abort.  Nukers simply CAN NOT kill Nagafen if there are no melee's left.<br>
<br>
Nagafen and Vox, when they have no one on their agro lists, regen something like 1000hp/tick.  Nukers are completely incapable of keeping up with that.  The time it takes to reload the zone after a death is more than enough to let the dragon regain health, regardless of how many nukers you have going in.  And, nukers by themselves probably won't last long enough to actually CAST, much less land a spell, since you have to be in melee range of the beast or your nuke will be resisted automatically.  How many 52 and under casters can survive long enough to not only get into melee range, but also have a 6-10 second spell go off interrupted?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to down-play the great sacrifice that the casters made last night... Sholokan and Krouton alone probably had 20+ corpses between them.  Even with 96% rez's on every corpse (which they didn't get) that's still a lot of xp loss.<br>
<br>
However, once the melee's are all dead, call off the attack... anything else is futile.<br>
<br>
And, on a nicer note, I'd like to thank Kellory, Kefo, Vree, Anngelkiss, Rufeuz (sp?) and Montey for coming to help with the CR.  Kefo, at 65, pulling all the corpses out of the lair was awesome, and Montey getting some &quot;Nagro&quot; (I love that word) while pulling door corpses, while being very careful about keeping Nagafen away from the buffroom where rez'ing was going on.... that was good work. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.chrometiger.com/~anubis/stuff/kommisig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

The only way to get naggy out of his lair is to drag him out, and there is absolutely no excuse for going past the buffroom and therefore being close enough to aggro him in the first place.<br>
<br>
  I died and was rezzed within 30 mins and my only suggestion at the time was not to loot the only other corpse there as she was a druid and could buy coffins, and then port any1 that needed a summon to lavastorm before being rezzed herself allowing us to quickly move on to rebuffing. I know coffins are expensive and people don't like to resort to them, but i thought it was worth considering to allow us to get the raid back on track as quickly as possible. My logs show it took another 40 mins to recover the final 2 corpses. Including re-doing the buffs thats quite a wait for people in the chatroom to sit around and i can understand why some got impatient and left for other things, i might not like it either, but it happens. <br>
<br>
  I was not in the buffline and therefore cannot comment on any aspect of it except to say maybe a new thread should be started on which buffs would be preferable over others and the relevant order that they are given might help out any raid/buff co-ordinators now, and in the future.<br>
<br>
  I am sorry to hear somone left with un-rezzed corpses i sincerely thought Tulewin was the only 1 not to be rezzed as he had to leave as it was approx 7am here in the UK by then, but I know we had Montey drag his corpse to the zoneline so he could have a guildee do it for him. I didn't get a port out until i thought everyone had been rezzed and we were all on our collective way out.<br>
<br>
  After 30hrs without sleep obviously my intent wasn't apparent, but my 'Ps' in my previous post was a definate shot at the people that failed to listen, especially to the line &quot;Dont go for a heal if you have aggro&quot;, i thought enough of us repeated that line often enough that it would be clear to everyone. I believe Krouton himself had 22 corpses from a loop, which could easily have been avoided if people had paid attention.<br>
<br>
  Maybe we need to move the bind point further back, maybe up the steps to the top of the ramp from the drawbridge, so that people that do die have a little extra space to re-mem spells or if the abort is called have a little extra time to /q out without getting trapped in a loop, or maybe move the healers upto the door/bridge area into the lair so there is more space between death spot / bind spot.<br>
<br>
  Maybe now that i've had some sleep i am more coherent in my rambling's (probably not<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), or maybe i posted previously while i was still a little frustrated at the way people didn't do as they were told, as i said as the top, naggy's lair is a bloody big no-go area and people should have done as they were told and stayed out.<br>
  Either way if i pissed anyone off, i apologise, but sometimes it helps me if i can rant and let off a little steam and then come back afterwards to pick through what went wrong so that it doesn't happen again.<br>
<br>
<br>
As i said before - i had a bloody good time - deaths included,  it wouldn't be a proper raid if i didn't get to use my ranger gate spell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Personally I think the few people that left WOULD of made a difference...  Naggy has what 30K hitpoints, right?  Well, 3% of 30K is about 900hp.  You mean that a few extra swords and an extra nuke wouldn't of made a difference???  Also, from what was reported to us in chat by who I thought was someone in leadership said that the person that pulled Naggy was told repeatedly not to go up the hallway, ignored repeated instruction and was immediatly removed from their guild for doing so.  So yeah, some blame goes to that toon.<br>
<br>
I agree with Vree's take that some raiders didn't listen to instruction... but how is this different from most KCoG raids... I mean, lets be honest here, what do you expect on &quot;pick-up raids&quot;... there is little that can be done to enforce rules (i.e. a single guild is more likely to threaten booting the person out of guild, stuff like that).<br>
<br>
Buffline stratagy... I'm WAY to green to even begin to comment on this... I will say that from what I've read on this board and what I've heard about Kommisar, I'd listen...<br>
<br>
Support team -- Some crucial mistakes were made after the wipe that cause the &quot;death-loops&quot;... I understand that raids are dangerous and that there are unforeseen circumstances that will need to be accounted for...  Whether the fire giant was pulled or popped in the buff room, there is NO WAY he should of stayed there, support should of done their job and supported... keeping the giant in the buff room caused Naggy to come out of his lair for the THIRD time... and caused some to be killed in excess of 20 times.<br>
<br>
A huge THANK YOU to the clerics that hung around with their 90/96% rezzes and rezzed my 6 corpses (therefore, only down 2% XP, the only saving grace for the entire night).  Also, thanks to Nerissa for another dragon raid.  You did your job, it's up to all of us to listen to our leader.<br>

None of these things in and of themselves contributed to the raid failure, but they illustrate a general lack of paying attention, following instructions, and courtesy.  Unfortunately, for the most part the people who really NEED to read this won't.<br>
<br>
<br>
First and foremost, BE ON TIME.  I am NOT going to wait for someone who is still in SK and doesn't have transport already lined up when I've got groups made up.  I'll wait for you to run from the next zone, I won't wait for you to try to find a ride from the middle of nowhere.  If you can manage to get here before we zone in, great.  If you can't, don't expect me to wait for you.  Last night we got off to a slow start due to an initial lack of clerics.  If that hadn't been the case, I think several melee types would not have made it either.<br>
<br>
Equally as important, when you get into the zone where we are gathering (Lavastorm for Nagafen, Everfrost for Vox), turn /lfg ON, /anon OFF, /role OFF.  This was announced SEVERAL times in various channels.  Yes, this means you can't group up to pass the time while waiting.  Be a grown-up (even if you aren't) and deal with it.  As I was about to make groups, someone mentioned something about their group getting the xp if we didn't use raid... someone who was NOT on my list.  The explaination I got was that they didn't have /lfg on because they had been briefly grouped for some reason.  That doesn't fly.  Here's why:<br>
<br>
I started my list at about 7:45.  At that point, I typed &quot;/ lfg 40 52&quot; and wrote down the results on a series of lists by class.  Periodically (average probably a minute apart) from that point until groups were finalized, I repeated the &quot;/ lfg 40 52&quot; and added any new names to my list.  If you were not on the list by the time I was ready to make groups (I recall that as being about 9:00 but I may be off there... it certainly wasn't any earlier), then you were NOT in the zone with your flags set correctly AT ALL during that time.<br>
<br>
For future raids, I intend to use several different colors of pen when I write down names -- one up to 8:00, another from 8:00 to 8:15 or so, another from then to 8:30, etc.  If we ever end up with too many people, the ones who went onto the list last will be the first to be sent away (dependant on class, of course).  Note that being in the zone is NOT enough.  If you don't have /lfg ON, /anon OFF, /role OFF you will not show up when I do my listing, which means you will not make it onto my list.  (Some exceptions apply... I've had a few cases where people brought one toon for support and another to engage, and told me ahead of time.  There are also other RARE occasions where the person is unable to be where we have gathered but will be able to join us before we buff, such as having their toon camped in the throne room or buff area for whatever reason.  Those people make it onto my list when they discuss the matter with me and have been approved as exceptions.)<br>
<br>
Also, every time I type &quot;/ lfg 40 52&quot; I scan for NEW names. I do NOT check to see that the names I have already written down are still there.  If you decide that you are unable to raid with us after you have already been in the zone long enough to have shown up on my list, it is only polite to TELL ME YOU ARE LEAVING.  If you have asked me to save a spot for a friend and find out they will be unable to make it, TELL ME.  It makes my job in forming groups many times easier when I know AT THE TIME who is going to be there, rather than going through five kinds of contortions trying to figure out what to do with that odd person out, only to find out after I announce groups that several people have left and I could've fit that person easily into another group... on top of having one group that was supposed to have 5 members only have 2 still there, which then needed to be disbanded and disbursed to other groups.  I do understand that sometimes people go LD and have trouble getting back in, but almost never as many people who disappeared on me without warning last night.  Beginning with the next raid, I will be making lists of people who disappear w/o warning, and deal with them accordingly for future raids.  (I'm not sure how yet, but I have a few ideas in mind.)<br>
<br>
Next, please notice the &quot;40 52&quot; part of my listings.  Early in each raid, I hunt down a sacrifice... er... volunteer... to organize support.  (And many thanks to Korban, who has done so for me several times.)  I then announce several times in various channels who they are, and for anyone 53+ to contact them.  After that, I leave it to them to handle things.  If you are 53+, I'm not the one making your groups.  Do not wait for me to do so.  If you don't know who is handling support, ask in either kcog or the appropriate raid channel.  Someone who knows the answer will tell you. While I wholeheartedly appreciate the 53+ folks who help us out on every raid, I can't organize both support and those who are engaging, so I delegate the support task.  If you are not in the zone (SolB or Permafrost) with the rest of the support team by the time I've announce groups for everyone else, you're running late.<br>
<br>
And speaking of announcing in various channels.  You NEED to be in ALL appropriate channels.  You NEED to PAY ATTENTION to what is being said in them.  You NEED to ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT PERTAIN TO YOU.  One of the most important questions I asked last night was &quot;Does anyone NOT have PoP?&quot;  The first few times I asked, someone mentioned that a friend/guildmate who was planning to attend did not, but didn't mention a name.  Since I know that people will occasionally change their mind about raiding by the time I make groups, I asked one last time just before I made groups.  This wasn't idle curiosity.  I needed to know WHO did not have PoP in order to make effective groups.  I got NO responses.  Zero. None.  Reasonable assumption would be that the person in question decided not to join us this time, right?  Was I surprised when one person was unable to be invited into his group, and I had to once again shuffle things around to create a non-PoP group out of groups I had already made?  Not particularly...<br>
<br>
Finally (for now), while we are gathering, please refrain from doing the following things near enough to me for your spam to show up on my screen:<br>
(1) Fighting anyone or anything<br>
(2) /random for any reason<br>
(3) anything else that will not be filtered as a chat channel, emote, or spell/song.<br>
The reason for this is that I am continually doing &quot;/ lfg 40 52&quot; and anything that interrupts that, or makes the results scroll off my screen, will make my job in making groups that much slower.  And no, I will NOT change my filter settings for dragon raids, as someone suggested on a previous raid when I requested that people refrain from attacking the merchant at the druid ring.  I give MY time to lead these things.  YOU can do me the courtesy of not making my job more difficult, or YOU can find someone else to raid with. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
        You'll have to excuse the support team for this one I believe we were all running back from being banished from naggy getting pissed. In case you didnt know(dont take this as an insult just informing) the second you get on naggy's agro list, if you step in his line of sight, start to cast a spell or get casted on by his ae he will immediatly banish you to lavastorm and believe me its a bitch running back when there are mobs up.<br>
<br>
         Anyway onto other things I just gotta say was fun seeing naggy again after all this time but lemme stress this DO NOT try to drag your corpse or anyone elses for that matter unless you can FD. At one point during cr I was banished at least 2 times from naggy being agro on someone trying to drag their corpse out of his lair and that just delays the cr even further. <br>
        <br>
        Also if someone asks you for consent dont reply, dont type out a long sphel out how you already consented someone else. If I ask for consent and I dont get a response or a consent within 5 seconds I move onto the next corpse and I leave yours for last, if it happens that I take too long and your corpse timer expires tough luck. If your gonna go afk find out who is gonna drag ahead of time and consent this saves alot of time and will make CR faster. <br>
<br>
         If this seems like I'm ranting its cause I am. There were many things that went wrong last night that built upon the fail but lets hope ppl learn from their mistakes and next you can kill naggy.<br>
<br>
         My thanks goes out to Vree, Kommi, Kellory, anngelkiss(who came back to help rez after being yelled at) and montey for helping out with either killing repops so I didnt have to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and dragging the corpses to the rezzers after I got banished over and over <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I said hello, I asked if you were buff co-ordinator as well as several questions regarding the order of your buffs. I had to resort to sending a tell to Nerissa to get your bloody attention. (you did notice she ran in and went through the buffline herself to see what was going on?) And I was not  on ignore since you accidentally sent me back a mistell once.<br>
<br>
The majority of support group did NOT stay. Did you do a head count? In alot of ways it was a blessing cause the Useless support people left and made it easier for the rest of us that were doing something. There is such a thing as too much support group and that would be from person number 7 and up. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It is a PRIVILEDGE to be allowed to go as support and be allowed to roll.

And yes Rile, you're right, it IS the raid leaders job to remove someone from a raid, but that didn't seem to deter you in the slightest.<br>
<br>
If it was so late for you, and you had never done it before, then perhapse it was a bad idea to volunteer.<br>
<br>
You can find my attitude whatever you want, I dont much care, everyone else in CoG is already used to me and has been for 4 years. When there is a valid gripe, I bring it up, you deal with it however you want. I believe your bitching, whining and moaning started last Vox complaining about how late it was and how long it was taking??... well it's very simple. Then Don't Come. I dont wanna listen to pissing and whining and neither does anyone else. So I guess you're attitude stinks too and I dont like it either.<br>
<br>
have a great day. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/VLRVsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
Yes Nerissa did come down to go through the buffline, becasue I asked her to come down and check that things were ok.  Before you start saying things, why don't you actually get your facts right.<br>
<br>
&quot;And yes Rile, you're right, it IS the raid leaders job to remove someone from a raid, but that didn't seem to deter you in the slightest.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would like to know how you thought I managed to remove someone from the raid.  I thought I had made this clear but you obviously are choosing not to understand, now pay close attention - NERISSA REMOVED THE PERSON, NOT ME.<br>
<br>
As for me volunteering, noone else did which was why I did it.  I didn't see you volunteer, no all you did was sit in the middle of the buffroom all evening doing nothing.  As well as volunteering for the buffline, I also arranged to meet people in PoK that didn't know the way and guide them there.  In addition on the last Naggy raid it was me that paid a druid to port me to Lava and come with me thorugh Sol A into Sol B to check if naggy was on track, and I wasn't even able to attend that raid.  I have done all that I can to help, yet you seem to want to have a go at me whenever possible.<br>
<br>
As for the last Vox raid, all I did was ask if the chat people were going to be logging back in and you jumped down my throat.  You are a totally unpleasant individual and it would be a great pleasure to ignore you.  Unfortunately that won't be an option as it would make future raids difficult. <p>Rilellore Elenahin<br>

I ran through the buff line at Vree's request, it is not something I would have done otherwise.  I have no experience in running buff lines either, but upon being told by someone whose experience I trusted that the setup she was seeing wasn't going to work, and that she felt that she was being ignored when she tried to give adivice, I decided to intervene.  When I saw something that made me wonder (CoS and CoW both), I asked someone I knew has a better understanding of druid buffs than I do -- Vree.  I'm actually surprised that one of the druids you had casting buffs didn't bring that problem to your attention.<br>

Next time try running a buff line without a bard.  It takes twice as long, and then some.  You may not realize it, and I will assume you didn't mean it that way, but this statement in and of itself is insulting to bards in general.<br>
<br>
As for removing Anngelkiss from the raid.  I will admit that I should have looked into things a bit more closely before following Rilellore's rather strongly-worded advice.  Honestly, I tend to assume someone who is level 59 probably has more raid experience than I do (that may be an incorrect assumption).  That, combined with being an officer in their guild, causes me to assume that they will have made a careful investigation and have a very good reason before asking me to remove someone from the raid.  To be quite honest, all I know of what happened is what I was told by Rilellore, and I apologize for not having made further investigation.  The only explaination (not excuse, there is no excuse) I can offer is the frustration with how late things were already running and an unfortunate tendancy (which I am trying to overcome) to let other people make decisions that I should be making.  For the record, my impression was that Anngelkiss had been told multiple times to stay off the ramp, but went up anyway, which is what pulled Naggy from his lair.  Repeatedly and willfully not following instructions IS cause to remove someone from a raid.  My only regret is that I made my judgement based only on one side of the story. <br>
<br>
And with that, I'm going to lock this thread.  Further discussion is just going to flare tempers and fuel animosity. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
