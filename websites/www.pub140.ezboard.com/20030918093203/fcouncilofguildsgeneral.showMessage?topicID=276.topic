Yes, thats right, me, not Shadowland.  The guild Trucidation is in no way Norrath Terror Corps!<br>
<br>
I read in a former post that my guild had a clean slate and that were welcomed but, Shadowland wasn't.  I also read in your vision section that you DO NOT judge a guild or individual.  If this a true fact .. please tell me why my guild is all of a sudden getting rejected and disciminated.<br>
<br>
Tell me, if Shadowland were to disband from Trucidation would than my guild be given equal rights as everyoone else on the Karana sever?  Isn't that what KCoG is all about?  Being equal and giving EVERYONE an equal chance to do the same things?  Thats what I have come to understand from your &quot;Vision&quot;.<br>
<br>
How can you judge one person for a whole entire guild?  Wait, you don't judge people do you?  If that was the fact, my guild would have already been approved and all this could have been taken care of, yet it hasn't.<br>

KCoG is not some ruling body, we dont control anything.  We dont even control who goes on raids and who doesnt, thats pretty much up to the raid leaders.  Since you havent signed up for, nor been denied on any grounds, space in a raid I fail to see how you are being discriminated against.<br>
<br>
Shadowland Trucidation<br>
<br>
53rd Necormancer.<br>
PVP MASTER.<br>
Leader of Trucidation. <br>
<br>
Please note that last line.  Are you saying when he posted that he wasnt the leader of Trucidation?  NTC had a bad reputation.  One that Shadowland carried over.  In forming Trucidation he moved that reputation to that new guild and even those of us who were neutral in the whole thing got rather upset with his attacks against KCoG based on his disagreements with a few other people.  Now you say he isnt the leader?  At this point I dont know who or what to believe.  And frankly I dont know if I really care anymore.  You say one thing, he says something else.  Last I heard he was a co-leader.<br>
<br>
The point is that he is representing your guild.  Period.  When he lashes out in the fashion he has, without anyone else apologizing or even saying he might not speak for the entire guild, we are forced to make some assumptions.  Mainly that he does speak for the guild.  Right or wrong, you never gave any impression that you felt his words were misplaced or that he didnt have the right or authority to make such posts.<br>
<br>
Frankly I personally dont care about Trucidation.  None of this has or had anything to do with your guild.  It had to do with Shadowlands.  And since he was assumed, by his own admission, to be the guild leader or at least a representative, we were forced to take issue with the entire guild.<br>
<br>
Now if you are saying he has no authority within the guild, then thats fine to me.  I can then go and continue to amuse myself with his threads and ignore Trucidation.  But even so, he has damaged your guild to some degree.  I would think that you'd be making some effort to mitigate or repair any damage his posts might have caused.<br>

But I am guild creater and primary leader.  True, him lashing out with vulgarity was uncalled for and I apologize for that as has he in a former post (not sure which one).  Shadowland's first post on this forum was to clear up any rumors any one from KCoG had heard about him and right away he was attacked.  Of course this is going to anger him, he wasn't given a fair chance.  And as for him &quot;lashing out&quot; well what would you do or how would you feel if you submitted your guild and the post was being deleted?<br>
<br>
And as far as giving us a fair chance or whatnot I am talking about a guild as a whole not just Shadowland and I.  Many of my guild members would love to do Plane raids and stuff like but, again we do not have tons of people so therefore we looked to you guys for help and yet we are being &quot;ignored.&quot;  You said that if Shadowland had no rights in my guild or any say that you would have no problem than with Trucidation.  Hmm that sounds like you are telling me if I want my guild to do anything or a be a part of anything that Shadowland cannot be a part of this guild.  Well that is just wrong.<br>
<br>
And yes we did sumbit our guild.  Shadowland e-mailed Haemish over a week ago and has yet to get any sort of reply from him.  I am truely sorry if you got the wrong impression of Trucidation because they are in no way NTC there is no point in making a nother guild name to have the same people and same problems as last.  I simply made Trucidation because I was sick of the people who ruined it for those of us who didn't deserve this kind of treatment.<br>

I would have continued to post asking that my posts not be deleted.  In a mature and civilized manner.  I would not have devolved to profanity and personal attacks.<br>
<br>
Of course Shadowlands wasnt being given a fair chance.  What did you expect?  He was the guild leader of a guild that by his own admission had a bunch of theives in it.  Of course people arent going to like him.  Regardless of whether or not he was involved.  He gave no indication that he took responsibility for the actions of his guildmembers, he simply wiped his hands of it and said, gee, its not my fault.  I'm just the guildleader.  People took offense at that.<br>
<br>
And I wasnt saying Shadowlands cant have anything to do with your guild.  However, if he is going to speak for your guild you will be responsible for what he says.  If he manages to brand your guild with a bad name, then thats your responsibility.  You cant just write it off as it not being your fault.  <br>
<br>
Haemish not replying to your emails for a week.  It recently took him over a week to respond to a fairly urgent email I sent him.  Or rather a series of emails.  Oh well.  Thats how it is sometimes.  Fair or not doesnt really come into play.<br>
<br>
Well, if you were sick of how others ruined it for you in NTC, your going to be even sicker about how Shadowlands has ruined it for you here.  Since he's managed to pretty much insult everyone here.  Thats quite a feat when you consider that there are people here who will disagree with me, or Haemish, or Kommisar just because we say the sky is blue.  Yet none of them are willing to defend you.  Doesnt that say something?  <br>
<br>
I never said you cant have Shadowlands in your guild or anything else.  But if he is going to post, and has the apparent authority to post for your guild, then you are going to be responsible for the consquences of his actions.  Its that simple.  Thats what being a guild leader entails.  Perhaps thats different from what you believe a guild leader does, but it is the common consensus here that a guild leader is responsible for all the actions of all the members of their guild.  It is up to them to make things right.<br>

You didnt try.  You came here expecting that no one would hold you accountable for the actions of your past guild just because you created one with a new name.  And people called you on it.  A Reputation stinks dont it?<br>

Shadowland may have a temper and hey maybe thats why he made a dark elf character but, he is still a good person.  If anyone knows that for sure its me.  He ended up getting upset and his posts getting worse and worse only because he realized this is a losing battle.  Try taking him along with you on a raid.... see how he conducts himself...... how he plays his character....... all you need is to give him a chance.<br>
<br>
Shadowland never once stole anything and when people were stolen from he said &quot;I'm sorry I'll tell him to give it back but, I cant say its gonna happen&quot; and they flipped out.  We are not anyones parents here we cannot tell them to give something back.  You all act quick to take everyone elses side before you even know the whole story or the person envolved.<br>

<br>
As guild leader or co-leader your behaviors effect your guild, because you are the guild's representive.  Shadowlands posted as &quot;Leader of Truicdation&quot; and conducted himself poorly.  No matter WHAT happened his actions are unacceptable. Judging him only on the past mistakes with NTC and his behaviors, why should everyone be so willing to give him a chance?  This is all we have seen from Trucidation his immature behavior. And Staar as &quot;primary&quot; leader is justifing it to the end.  What does this say of your guild?<br>
<br>
Shadowlands didn't give everyone in CoG a chance before he blasted KCoG, without even asking why things where going on.  He continue his attacks. <br>
<br>
Shadowlands is ducking the responsibility of his actions by blaming others. Quite frankly it is sickening.  YOU alone control your actions and the fact that Staar defends his positions does not show me anything good.  This maybe acceptable in your guild, but it is not here, and the fact that the true guild leader Staar is so willing to dismiss Shadowlands posts and turn it around on the KCoG does not show any real progress for Tricidation.  All is is saying is &quot;yeah, I know that what he did is wrong, but it is KCoG fault.&quot; That is NOT justification.  Just because some post where deleted and members of this council where unwilling to shallow the I-am-guild-leader-but-I-will-not-take-responsibility-and-just-start-another-guild explaination for NTC is still not reason enough.<br>
<br>
If anyone from Trucidation had something to say and conducted themselves civil without attacks and vulgarity then this all could have been prevented and would probably turn out different.<br>
<br>
Now, it doesn't matter how many threads your clog this board with or how many post are made, until you stop trying to justify this poor display of behavior that is directly reflecting on your guild (because guild leaders are held responsible PERIOD) Then your cause will go no where.<br>
<br>
Staar as &quot;Leader&quot; or &quot;creator&quot; or whatever contradicts herself by apologizing and then defending Shadowlands.  <br>
<br>
The fact is that Shadowlands conducted himself as leader or co leader, his actions reflect your guild. <br>
<br>
You want to fix this problem then start with Shadowlands, because all this could have been prevented if he would have acted civil and approiately.  <br>
<br>
No matter what has happened.  Two wrongs don't make a right, if you felt something was unfair, I could have thought of 20 different ways for you to handle it, and the way Shadowland choose to handle it on behalf of your guild is not one of them. <p>As Always,<br><br><A href=" http://www.geocities.com/karanadp/Enter.html"><img src="http://desirrae.homestead.com/files/Desirraechievous1.gif"></a><br><br><i>Of the 44th Circle.</i><br><br><b><i>"The mold of your life is in your hands to break" --The Hobbit</b></i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ustaartrucidation.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StaarTrucidation</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/14/01 3:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=276.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Discrimation towards Trucidation</span><hr size=1> honey you got it all wrong.. people from trucidation DID conduct themselves in a good fashion w/o vulgarity and attacks.  myself and renandarr... and i have already apologized for shadowland's outbursts and said that i dont agree with them.. what more can i do? break his fingers so he cant type on this board anymore? c'mon. hes a grown person he's gonna do what he wants.. this did not start out as an attack on kcog.. it started out as apology and turned into something ugly and no i have never tried to turn it around on you guys.. just trying to let you see both sides.. i am starting to see that this a big waste of my time because everyone here reads what they want and turns it all around.. as far as i know i probably wont be playing eq for a long time.. good luck shadowland and trucidation see ya someday.<br>

You can politely ask him to not post any more concerning this matter, to please let wiser(and hopefully calmer) heads handle it.  As Co-leader of my guild, this is what I would do were I in your position and in this situation. <br>
<br>
I dunno if this is gonna have any bearing on your decision of how to handle this, just giving an option. <p>Mairi<BR>

Mature people do not react the way he has.  Verbal abuse and flames on a message board NEVER help you make a point.  Ever.  No matter how abused you have been yourself.  If he doesn't understand that he shouldn't be allowed to speak for your guild.  If you have no control over your guild members and how they represent you and yours... you are a very poor leader, indeed.<br>
<br>
If you have no ability to influence people, especially the ones that follow you or the ones that are closest to you... once again, you have a much bigger problem than just not being allowed on KCoG raids. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

<br>
And it takes a whole lot of balls to flame people on here doesnt it?  Oh yes, allow me to bow to your awesome display of your manhood.  You've obviously got two large brass ones dont you?  Oh yes, I'd really better be careful now on these boards, or I might get really flamed by you wont I?  I wouldnt want to make myself a target of such a powerful baller such as yourself.  <br>
<br>
Man, you have no idea just how amusing you really are.  No one here has taken you seriously for over a week now.  We've simply been responding as we would to a child.  Watching them fumble around.  Hoping they'll make the right connections, but laughing when they dont.  Its not about balls my friend, its about time.  And frankly I dont have the tmie to take you seriously.  I always have some time to listen to an amusing story tho.<br>
<br>
So by all means, please continue.  I havent been this amused in almost 2 weeks.  Oh, but I would suggest looking up the former guild leader of Shattering Steel.  He was much better at these insults than you.  And you dont want us getting bored and having to go find new amusement elsewhere would you?<br>

Hey, yer the one(s) that came to us looking to be accepted.  If that's not important to you anymore, why are you still here?  If it is still important to you, why haven't you learned that insulting, name calling, and flaming isn't doing you any good?<br>
<br>
And puh-LHEEZ don't start bringing Real Life threats of physical violence into this.  That is pretty much the only thing that Haemish will actually ban a person for... and I'd hate to see that happen to either of you (Staar or Shadowlands)... you are far too amusing.<br>
<br>
I should probably add that RL threats are about the most pathetic thing you can say in a forum like this...  you would be just as well off starting a &quot;My dad can beat up your dad&quot; thread on here.  Come to think of it, that's probably more age appropriate for you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.
