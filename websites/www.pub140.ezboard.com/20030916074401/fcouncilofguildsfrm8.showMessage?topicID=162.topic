<br>
I'll post a more thorough recap later, but I'd like to say thanks to all who came.  We had a very full raid, taking in 2 more groups than I had planned on, and a few extras beyond that.<br>
<br>
Vox dropped an eyepatch, 2 RBB's (marking the 4th and 5th uber-melee item we've gotten from Vox and Naggy in the past 4 raids), a Warhammer of divine... something, and a white dragon scale.<br>
<br>
After 2 dragons in as many nights, I'm glad to be able to take breather for a while... though at the rate the Vox and Naggy rotations have been moving, we may be up for these two sooner than expected.  Those darn level caps seem to be making life hard on a lot of the other guilds and alliances.<br>
<br>
In the mean time I'm gonna rest up and kick back.  This raid marks the last Antonican Dragon raid that Creirwyy will be attending - she's been a great help to me on the last 4 raids, and I'm sure we'll all miss her.  It's also most likely the last dragon raid the fearless Kefo will be able to participate in as well... so not only do I have to find a new loot master, I have to find a new giant puller for the next dragon raid... heh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

I can only say 'thank gawd' we didn't do both in the same day, though it sure felt like it anyways.  For me personally, a sense of accomplishment we took down two dragons in 24 hours.  As well, I never died once in any of my dragon raids.  We had many a new face this weekend, and the wonderment that some of you have in attending these raids, always puts a smile on my face.  To clarify, I may visit another dragon, I just won't be assisting in the CoG dragon raids any longer. <br>
<br>
Kommisar and Talovar, my sincerest thankyous for giving me the opportunities to run these with you.  I have learned a great deal and look forward to assisting my guild and the alliance in someday taking on Vox and her b/f Naggy.<br>
<br>
/em soapbox on.<br>
For all those who were there last nite, I wish you to remember one really important thing.  These raids are run on a voluntary basis for the pure reason that many of you would never have an opportunity to see a dragon alive or dead, if people like Kommisar, Haemish, Lagadlen, Flarren, Kellory, myself or others didnot invest a huge amount of our time into doing them.  Go visit other servers and you will see that this is just not done.  On Karana, you have the freedom to belong to your small guilds (size) and have the opportunities to see places you would never see and a chance at loot that you normally would have no opportunity to attain.<br>
There were many people who appreciated our efforts last nite.  There were many who took it upon themselves to ruin the evening for the others in attendance and certainly for myself.  From Thursday thru to Saturday nite, I attended four raids and ran/co-hosted three of them.  By the time, we were rolling, my fingers were cramped from typing (literally) and my eyes were so blurry, I truly couldnot read the screen.  The more people 'bitched', the more difficult it became to scroll back.  I was always 3-4 tells behind in questions, concerns, problems and complaints.  <br>
Friday's Naggy raid, we had to drag people to get to, last nite's Vox raid, we not only had to turn people away, I actually had to ask someone to leave a group as someone who had been there before 8pm est, got missed in the group making.  Sixty plus people is alot to make happy (worse than co-ordinating a RL wedding).  <br>
For those of you who feel the need to 'bitch', feel free to volunteer your services and time, along with your guild's to run large-scale raids.  Feel free to offer constructive criticism and suggestions on the general boards, to accomodate everyone after a raid.  Continue the way you were last night, and people won't want to run them for your experience.<br>
A personal thankyou goes to each of you who personally rooted me on when I wanted to /q.  To those who sent private tells with hugs and kind words, you are the inspiration to continue running raids.<br>
/em soapbox off<br>
<br>
Wishing CoG Dragon raids, continued success.  <br>

<br>
Creirwyy was an honor to see you in Action on your last raid. I used to help run these CoG raids myself so I know the work it takes to make it all run smoothly and for what I saw the Management staff did a great job. For those staying on keep up the great work for those joining, watch and learn, you will learn a lot of important things that will help you later on.<br>
<br>
Now all you Cannon fodde… I mean Raiders, Creirwyy make some really good points in her post. It's really easy to take all this for grated and that's a shame, Try to imagine how hard it is to get 60 people from over 15 guilds from levels 40 to 52 all following one plan, with for the most part has to be followed to a tea. Running a raid of any size can be Stressful, make sure you congratulate the people that tiredly work to make sure you have fun and that you succeed at what you plan to do. With that you should all pat yourselves on the back for Taking out the Ice Queen. It's not an easy thing to do, may of the larger guilds have problems with her. <br>
<br>
Good hunting and hope to see you all out in the BattleFields. <br>

I was able to attend both and only died in the last few min of Lady Vox.  Was glad to die to spare you on your last KGoC raid Creirwyy.  <br>
<br>
I had the pleasure of grouping with Creirwyy, and I did not want to add to the spam during the raid by adding group comments, but you did a great job handling the loot.  I was shocked just have been able to take down both dragons in the same weekend.  I wish others there would realize how lucky they are to be rolling for loot instead of waiting for corpse retrival from a failed raid.  Our guild has always had the policy of &quot;Need before Greed&quot; which makes everyone happier in the long run.<br>
<br>
Anyway great job everyone.  Shows a lot, when a bunch of Hooligans can band together with some great leadership and take down the bigger mobs.<br>

<br>
Anyway, at least from me Lag, I would be happy to make some room on a raid somewhere for you or Flarren or anyone else who has once worked with CoG.  Although I'm sure I dont know everyone and might accidently leave people out if I'm forced to limit numbers.  But regardless of what guild you are in now, at one time you helped those who needed it, you helped those who had never gone to a plane or seen a dragon to have new experiences.  Should you or Steelheart or anyone who once led a plane or dragon raid for CoG want to attend a raid of mine I say come along.  And by all means redirect any complaints to me so I can boot their sorry butts from the raid.  Its one thing to complain about people who double dip, and another to complain about the inclusion of those who contributed much to the past success of CoG and just want to see and talk and adventure one more time with old friends.  You paid your dues, its time to stop worrying about what the whiners say about you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I would also like to thank Dogedme for joining me as my guest and for doing wonders in Corpse Retrieval, along with Steelheart and the others who joined.<br>
<br>
I want to thank all those that have written kind words and have sent me private tells over the past few days.  In all honesty, it's people like you that make people like Kommisar and myself to continue to do what we do.  I look forward to aiding Kellory in Planes Raids and seeing many of you real soon. <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">

My friends and I had a great time taking down Lady Vox again.  I just want to thank all those that worked so hard to make this happen.  If it was not for KCoG our small guild would never get to do a Dragon raid.  Keep up the good work and let me know if there is anything Council of True Elements can do to help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW: the Following are some screen shots of the Vox raid.<br>
