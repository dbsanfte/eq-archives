I have spent a good deal of time building and working on the reputation of my guild and  its members.<br>
<br>
About 3 months ago a probationary member in my guild commited a fraud on someone. I found out about it, Chastised the criminal and booted him from the guild. I further more paid the debt incurred upon the victim.<br>
<br>
This criminal deleted his character and attempted to get into the guild on more than one occaision to do this again. This past weekend he succeeded, his new alt is named Chinlao. I do not know if the Holistic Crusaders are the only target of this person but know this. I am armed, I own a .45 calibber and I am looking for your address.<br>
<br>
I will find you Chinlao.<br>

What happened? Maybe if you talk about it here, the other guilds can keep an eye out.<br>

Sorry to hear this happened but is threatening with a gun a good way to deal with it? <br>

As i said above.  this person was then booted from the guild.<br>
<br>
he was named Hirosaki. He has several toons most low level. His typical scam is to get someone to give him something do a fake trade and run off and camp or what not and pass it off to other people. Its basic stuff that only nails newbies or the trusting but it happens. We believe he then sells stuff on ebay.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse though he preys on people I or my officers have formed relations with. He gets people pissed at me by saying I said I would deliver the goods while hes got the coin. He got booted for this but has made efforts to enter the guild with an alt toon to continue his scams. This weekend he succeeded.<br>
<br>
I will post part of what happened as explained by Bearog an officer who got hurt in this scam from last night.<br>
=======================================<br>
Some pretty serious events took place last night.<br>
<br>
A person I know personally, and have dealt with for at least 35 levels started shouting discrediting remarks about HC in the tunnel. He was the victem of an attempted theft, and him and his party were mislead by an HC member. Chinlao who also has an alt named Aeries, was the problem. This person backed a deal based on HC's name and on several members. They used My name, Dems and a few others to convince Zan to leave Seb and come to EC to do a trade, this trade was based on 17k CASH money backed by the names listed above. He came, leaving a choice camp in Seb, believeing the deal was for real. On arriving, the person said give me the item Bear has the money. Zanos, is not a complete fool. At any rate the thing escalated between him and this person, resulting in words inpublic with witnesses.<br>
<br>
After this there was some shouting about not dealing with HC, that we could not be trusted, that we steal lie and lots of other unsavory things. I talked him down and we discussed it. He then publicly apologized to HC and me.<br>
<br>
As I have it, this is not the first instance of this kind of thing happeneing within the HC ranks.<br>
<br>
As for Chinloa or whatever, Personally I want the HC tag removed ASAP, we can ask questions after, I want that tag gone until some answers are put forth.<br>
=========================================<br>
<br>
<br>
Chinlao is hirosaki, his manerisms and his MO are the same. He keeps attempting to harm the HC and me personally. I do not know why, but when you keep deliberatly attacking someones honor and reputation you better know who your screwing with.<br>
<br>
Whats more apparently Hirosaki is a currently in a guild called Norrath terror corps and some members of their guild were likewise booted from the HC for similar misconduct and they have been conspiring as of late to cause us mischief in a similar manner.<br>
<br>
Verant is looking into the issue.<br>

my friend (anon) got ripped off by this guy as well for 2k cash. he never got anything in return. It was a unlike him to do something like this but Hirosaki talked him into it and made my friend (anon) loose his cash. i wish you luck and hope you can work all this out and not result to the violence you were thinking about.<br>

There is an active group of people farming the commons and causing these scams. Its going on on our server, and I think if we dont clean it up no one will.<br>
<br>
I have reports (not all confirmed, so far Hirosaki and his alts are the only ones I can confirm) are the ones doing the scaming. It is also believe the items being ripped off are being sold on ebay or some similar manner.<br>
<br>
Another possibly related scam, are groups of alts that are lowbies, pretending not to have any items that are begging, mostly in the commons to get things. These things are then transferred to a ring leader who stores the items while the lowbies go out and get some more.<br>
<br>
To the casual observer it looks like your helping out, but to people dedicated on more serious observations the scam becomes clear and more insidious.<br>
<br>
I also recieved an email from the verants rep on the Karana Server:<br>
=============================================<br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
Well what you are suggesting is very serious.  Unfortunately I am limited on<br>
what I can really do without any proof to back up what is being said.  What<br>
I would need to continue any investigations are /reports of trade agreements<br>
where people are using your name and what the agreement is.  Also I need<br>
/reports of any slander made by the accused person.  Thank you for bringing<br>
this to my attention though so I can watch to investigate what is this<br>
person is doing.  Please feel free to email me if you gather any more<br>
details.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to you,<br>

In short they are doing nothing at this time unless they can be provide with hand in the cookie jar type proof at the moment it happend.<br>
<br>
These vagrants are organised and prey on the week. If we truly represent the Karana Server I suggest that it is up to us collectivly to enforce Justice on these people.<br>
<br>
I would like to set up a sting operation with logs, screenshots, and /reports en mass to try and get some of these people removed.<br>
<br>
Any takers?<br>

I guess there's a *slight* chance he was legit, but I smell a rat so here's what happened:<br>
<br>
Guy name Deko (level 4 I think) came up to me in the tunnel and asked if I could help him with a transfer.  I said sure.  He asked how many slots I had open and I said 6 (I knew I had more but I was too lazy to count em).  He gave me 6 items (orc belts and and 2 leather items.)  Then he started admiring my froggie robe and asked to see it in a trade window.  I said no, but told him the stats instead.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure he was hoping I'd put it in the trade window and then when cancelled he would snatch it as it sat on the ground.  It wouldn't have worked anyway since I still had slots open, but I'm sure it would work on lots of people.<br>
<br>
When his scam didn't work he made a show about how he really wanted a froggie robe and then said he had to do some other stuff quickly then he'd log on his alt to pick up the stuff.  Alt's name was Cryonaen.<br>
<br>
Well 5 minutes pass, then 30, then 60.  No word from either Deko or Cryonaen to pick up the stuff.  My guess is that he scammed someone else and then logged.  <br>
<br>
I reported this to the GM who made note of it.  Perhaps he wasn't doing anything wrong, but be careful if you find yourself dealing with this guy.<br>

He was telling some sob story about a lost corpse in OT and how he had nothing.  I thought he might be legit, but I wanted to test him out, so I have him some arms, think 7ac +2 dex arms or something.  Good for a ranger, maybe worth 50-100pp.  <br>
<br>
So I go about my selling in FV, turn in some dog teeth for exp, ect...  About 5-10 min latter I am back at the bank to cash out, and that guy is still begging, but he doesnt have my arms on.  So I tell him, &quot;Why don't you even have the arms on??&quot;  He said he forgot to equip and thought they where on.  So he puts them on when I am there.  Then I sit and camp out.  I wait about 15 min and I log back in.  What do you think I saw?  Same guy asking someone for something because his body was lost, without the arms on.<br>
<br>
I know this guy was scaming for items.  Guess its just like the real world.  What better place to do it then the bank?  Just watch out.  I know I would have given the arms to someone and not sold them, so I don't feel bad.  Just sad someone that could have used them didn't get them.  <br>
<br>
What I don't know is if he was a part of some larger group of scamers.   <br>
<br>
I guess it might sound harsh, but just give stuff away to people you don't know.  <br>
<br>
Have a great day.<br>

He also got in the second time because he claimed he was a friend of someone I knew, that person was not online at the time, and I believed him. He uses knowledge he gains as far as who is friends and he name drops in order to get what he wants from the unsuspecting.<br>

So far I have learned he lives in Hong Kong... I have not gotten his home address yet.<br>

I lost my soul binder that i could have sold for about 10k. i saw someone auctioning WTS a fbss. Well as usual i figured i could trade my item for the fbss for my friend. I noticed that Denelornae or something very similar was a low level female monk and all she was wearing was the belt. i inquired of how she got it and informed me of her lvl 52 monk trakq in Royalty of Norrath guild. I figured she was legit and i didn't think anything bad about it. All i wanted was the belt. Well when i went to do the trade with this char i accidentally hit trade. This person didn't give me the chance to cancel. I can't believe i was so stupid to do it. She said it was on her monk and she would have to log, yet it was on that monk. At that point i couldn't do anything as she logged. Thats the time you wish you could nuke them hehe. So i left after about 5min and told a guild mate. Well it appears not to much later a lvl 1 paly is shouting out the PC on a soul binder. A sk only item that is a rare drop in karnors. Yet some reason a lvl 1 paly is looking for the price on it? I bet was her and talked to her yet she denied it and couldn't explain of how she got it. than she logged as well and i am without a weapon or belt. Just becareful with your shopping in EC with anyone there. Thank you.<br>

Zanos is not a fool at all. He taught me how to play the game pretty much. He is a real life friend and unoffical uncle in rl to my sisters kids. I know him in real life. Sorry know that this isnt about the topic but i felt i needed to post it because Zanos is a real life friend. Hehe. <br>
<br>
Ok now on to the topic. I spend alot of time in eq on various alts that i have. I buy and sell constantly for some odd reason. So in all actuallity i see alot of what happens in ec first hand. Now some of my information might be a little off, or just based on hearsay since sometimes my brain hurts from reading auctions. <br>
<br>
About a month ago i was sitting by the stacked boxes behind shady. It is usally pretty quiet there, but i get the occasional spam ems and such. Standing in front of me was a half elf. Not sure of what class. He had semi decent armor on. Now his name is a little fuzzy but i am pretty sure that is was the same guy you have been talking about, or a closeness to that name. Hirosaki or some sort,im sure of is his guild tag. It read &quot;Norrath terror corps.&quot; Now this guild was started by a guy named Shadowlandds That i have met and talked too on several occasions although under different charecters then the name i am currently posting under. Well back to the pertinet issues. This half elf had a naked person come up to him and ask him the stats of a certain item he was selling. He told him. The naked one said ok how much for that item. He said some price. The naked one said ok deal, and as far as i could tell put money in trade. Now at that point The half elf said push trade and ill be right back on so an so alt to give you the item it is on that charecter. The naked one being a smart naked one said no thanks logg that charecter and ill give him the money. Then the half elf started begrading the naked on and saying things not to nice, which was in my oppiniopn an attempt to get him to give in and think he was being a jerk towards the half elf. it didnt work. The naked one left. About ten minutes later an ooc was heard stating that the half elf was ripping off newbies for weapons. Seems that he was telling newbies he would sell them weapons for like 10 pp or so and then logging to &quot;get the weapon&quot; He scammed two people that i know of at that time. I didnt have log text running so i cant be for sure. Then the half elf logged, and soon another charecter came back selling the same stuff as the half elf and when i did a who all new name he also was in norrath terror corps. I didnt get a race on that one because i never actually saw him, or her as the chance may be. Later on that night i was talking to a bard that had asked to inspect me so he could get an idea of what items he needed to get to look like me. (i was playing my bard cause sometimes i help a friend with a little selos to get their massively platinum overwiehgted selves moving) He had asked me about my guild and i stated that my guild is a nice guild of friends and we have fun together in guild chat if nothing else. Then he proceeds to tell me of the guild he just left. <br>
This guild he told me he just left is called &quot;Norrath Terror Corps&quot; He told me that he wasnt new to the game but he was new to this server and a freind had given him some money to start out on this server. He was shouting for a guild one day and he was invited to join &quot;NTC&quot; and he did. He then told me that apon entering there guild he was told of the rules. To make it short, and also cause of lack of memory and sleep, they were as follows. Lie, Cheat, and steal as much as you possibly can. We will not look down on you for it, And we will help cover it up for you. He then told me he had removed himself about ten minutes later.(Because the officer was still in zone and he didnt want to be harrassed) Although he ended up being harrased by there members any ways and had to remake his charecter. Now i am not one to belive everything i hear unless i see it personally. The reason i am even taking this story at half truth is because this guy never asked me for anything, and never even asked to see an item in trade. He just wanted to know what i had on and was going to attempt to buy it, which he started to do right after he inspected me. To make a long story short, i am not accusing this guild of doing anything accept one member that i personally saw cheating, or &quot;trying to cheat&quot; another fellow EQer.  I posted it here in the center of all commerce of the karana guild world to give you the cheated and the guild in question a chance to represent them selves. My guild on karnana was resently cheated and called names the same way after a member was invited. Late on night he and two other members were the only ones on and he ripped one of them off under the pretense of being a fellow guildie. The cheated was lured into a false sense of safety and cheated out of around 50 k worth of stuff. So our name was tarnished, and i know how that feels. This post called out for me to post and let people know you are not the only ones. <br>
<br>
In closing Shadowlands if you want to come forward and tell all here that you dont premote that kind of stuff, feel free. This is a forum for us to express our veiws of the world we know as eq. This is also for the leader of HC to help you out as much as possible with your hunt, in game perferably to uncover this villan and get him his just deserts. Know this that all members of Dark Radiance will help you if they can in your search. We know that sting and never want to feel it again. Well i must go i am tired and out of ciggarettes. <br>

(it didnt occur to me at the time to do a /guildstatus) a<br>
<br>
nyways, this guy was auctioning that he was selling a Silver Chitin Hand Wrap. so i sent him a tell and we negotiated a price. we finally settled on a price of 8kpp and a howling harpoon (a deal too good to be true)! so i put the money and spear in the trade window and he puts the handwraps in the window too. being a person who has been in EC for many many lvls, i checked to see if it really was the handwraps in his trade box. it was and so i pressed trade and waited for him to do the same. a few secs gone by until he finally did something. he pressed cancel and gave me a tell saying &quot;oops, i pressed cancel by accident&quot; or something close to that. i thought nothing of it and proceeded to do the trade again. so i put the money and spear back in trade window and he put gloves back in his window. again, i right clicked on the gloves to check if it was the proper ones. but what do i find? it wasnt the Silver Chitin Hand Wraps, it was a pair of large cloth gloves! i obviously pressed cancel and told him wrong gloves (the Silver Chitin Handwraps have the same graphic as Cloth gloves) he said &quot;oops, sorry&quot; and then runs off to do something. i sent him a tell and asked him if he wanted to do the trade or not, etc etc. he then stalled for about 15 mins making up excuses and finally said &quot;oh, my friend doesnt want me to sell the gloves afterall&quot; <br>
<br>
So in short, when you guys do trades, please PLEASE right click on the items being traded to make sure that these are the proper items that you were trading for.  <p>Jbear Strongpaws<BR>

<br>
Also, I highly recommend not giving anything to anyone who asks for it. People who ask me if I have anything to spare either get ignored or told no (depending on my mood). These people will ask anyone regardless of level for items so don't feel compelled to give in, they arent' going to use what you give them, half the time, they'll be selling it 5 minutes later.<br>
<br>
Reminds me of something that happened over 2 years ago in old Unrest. A savant's cap dropped and some gnome cleric I was grouped with was in full bronze including the helm so everyone figured he'd use the cap as an upgrade. He got it, and 10 minutes later (after most of the group had logged but I was still around) he was selling it.<br>
<br>
Having played EQ from release I just feel compelled to post here, please don't give random beggars items... they don't want the items they want the cash they'll make from selling them. <p>ZealPath Skyphire<BR>

This guild is built from the ground up to be nothing but cheaters, liars and thieves. A friend of mine in another guild was recently scammed out of an FBSS by one of their members. When my friend's guild leader contacted the leader of Norrath Terror Corps, the aforementioned Shadowlandds, Shadow proceeded to do nothing about it, then threatened the guild leader when she insisted something be done about it. <br>
<br>
This guild is filth that does not deserve to exist on our server. I don't normally make &quot;blacklist&quot; type posts like this, but everyone should know about these people, and avoid them like the plague. <br>
