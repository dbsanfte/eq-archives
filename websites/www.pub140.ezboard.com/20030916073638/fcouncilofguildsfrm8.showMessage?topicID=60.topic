She went down last night to the might of the Alliance of Valiant Blades. Nawty and Merithment of Illuminatus were on hand to witness the event. The patch this morning (that was not announced in advance, those bastards) means that Vox will be up tonight or shortly after the servers come back up. H/Cok will take her on tonight, unless the server comes up later than 5 pm PST. If they skip BEFORE 8 pm PST, we HAVE to take her down tonight, Jan. 31st. Otherwise if they try and fail, we will be up for her on Thursday, Feb. 1st. I will be alerting the email list of this eventuality, but also wanted to warn you here. Get your cold resist gear ready.<br>
<br>
The raid will be for all classes, levels 40+ EXCEPT Wizards, Mages and Necromancers. Those classes must be 45+. All cold and magic resists should be a minumum of 70 WITHOUT buffs, the higher the better. Those with the Fearless or resist disciplines, I suggest using one of those disciplines as the fight commences. <br>
<br>
Those who wish to go on this raid should also bring with them 30pp (this is a little lower than I would like but should recoup some of the costs) which we will distribute to the clerics, enchanters and other classes who need reagents for their buffs (such as symbols, runes, etc.). This money will be collected and passed out to those of this class who attend BEFORE the raid begins. Those classes are ESSENTIAL to the success of the raid, and they often have to shell out MAJOR bucks just to buff folks on large scale raids. This is one way to say &quot;Thank you for your buffs&quot; and to interest them in coming. I will post the loot policy on this thread as well.<br>

Someone will always feel and in some cases will always be given less than their chance to get an item. Fact of life. There will always be exceptions that we cannot forsee which will mean that someone gets slighted. Human nature is one of greed but it can also be one of giving. So with that in mind, here is the loot policy we will use for the dragon raids led by the Sacred Band. <br>
<br>
1) No item is worth a friendship. The Dragons of Norrath don't drop friends, they drop weapons and stat bonuses and proc effects. Once a friend is lost, no GM can get him/her back. There are no resses for friendships and no to summon 20 stacks of friends. No str or dex or int or mana bonus can ever replace a friend. Always argue with this in mind. <br>
2) No one in your group, your guild or the raiding party pays more or less for their time on Everquest. You are not more or less important than any one else who might have an opportunity at that item. We are all equal and we are all here for each other. By depriving someone else of an item, you are depriving yourself of a friend. <br>
3) All members present at the time the item drops (and those who went linkdead during the fight) who can USE the item (i.e. their class/race combo is on the item) may lotto for the item. Only the character that is being played is to be considered (no twinking secondaries from our raids unless no one else wants the item). The only exceptions to this rule that may be made are to be determined by the raid leader prior to the raid and can include: a) Chances for those present at breakin/buffing to get the item, b) It is used in an important (level of importance determined by the raid leader) quest that a member/members of the raid needs or would like to do. If said item is to be given to ONLY 1 person on the raid (say we get Belce a piece of the warrior epic quest, though there are other warriors on the raid) instead of all lottoing, that should, when possible be announced beforehand, c) the item is not needed by anyone on the raid, and there are those who wish to sell the item, at which point all who wish to do so may lotto on the item.<br>
<br>
If any of these exceptions are present, I will announce them when the raid briefing is given.<br>
<br>
4) Only group leaders and the raid organizer (or designated loot person) should loot on raids where items of importance are dropped. Split should be on except in extenuating circumstances (monks in the group, etc.) or unless the group leader prefers to manually split the coin loot. For the dragon, the ONLY person on the raid who may LOOT the dragon will be either: 1) The Raid Loot Organizer who is designated by the raid leader beforehand or 2)A person in the group who got the experience for the kill that is designated by the Raid Leader or Raid Loot Organizer. NO ONE else may loot the dragon for any reason. If you do loot the dragon by mistake, you could be removed from the raid and possibly banned from future raids. <br>
<br>
5) The raid leader/organizer shall be the final word on any raid they lead. Not even guild leaders should call into question the decisions of the raid leader, except in situations where it completely contradicts the spirit of these rules. <br>
<br>
6) Preferential treatment based on number of raid attendances shall be not be used. I.e. I'm on my first dragon raid, I will have a chance to get something that drops for my class. <br>
7) Any exceptions to the above should be noted in advance of the raid, at the very least by the raid organizer in his/her pre-raid briefing. <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Once an item has been given to a person from a raid, from that point forth the item is considered that person's to do what they wish with it, whether it be use it, give it away, sell it or destroy it. <br>
9) In places where multiple items for a person's class are dropped (i.e. the planes, Karnor's etc.), winning a lotto for one class specific item (or class usable item) puts them out of the lotto for any other class specific items until all of their class have won something. <br>
10) The notable exception to the no secondaries rule is in a situation where someone has 2 characters of fairly equal level (such as a level 40 sk and 42 cleric). If the person is asked to bring one character over another based on need for that class (for instance we need clerics so the cleric is asked). If the raid leader agrees, the cleric may loot for the SK (and therefore lotto for the SK gear) but only at the cost of NOT being in the lotto for his cleric gear. Again, this is the raid leader's decision whether to allow or disallow this, but if it is allowed, it will be announced before the raid. Note that ONLY those who are ASKED by the raid leader to come as a certain class are eligible for this. Do not ask the raid leader if you can loot another class's item. <br>
