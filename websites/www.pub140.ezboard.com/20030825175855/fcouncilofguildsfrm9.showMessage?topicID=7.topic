 <br>
Time:  5:00 pm PST (PST) <br>
 <br>
  Time to try and take down the toughest mob in the druid epic. Bring all of your druid friends that are ready to spawn and kill this little dragon friend. We will kill him as many times as needs be. He is a triggered spawn and he will only be dropping a peice for the druid epic so don't get all excited about cool Faydedar loot, there won't be any. The druid that spawns the dragon will get to loot the dragon.<br>
<br>
50+ is recommended level, but if you are 45-49, you're welcome, but come with some serious resist gear. Everyone should have minimum Magic resist unbuffed of 50 (preferably higher) and fire resist of as close to 100 as you can. <br>
<br>
Melee's should bind in Freeport, then take the translocator to Butcherblock, then the next translocator to Timorous Deep. Casters can bind on the dock there in Timorous Deep. Target location is the oasis hidden inside two ringed cliffs at the south end of TD. The oasis is accessable only through two underwater tunnels, the outer one being at Neg 11520, Neg 3776. Once through the cave, travel counter clockwise around the inner ring and the inner tunnel is at Neg 11333, Neg 1352. (For you monks, the NPC Lhaeo, whom you need to turn in your Robe of Whistling Fists and reference from Danl, is located in this oasis... if you've gotten that far in the monk epic).<br>
<br>
A dwarf, on a 12 hour respawn, named Dolgin Codslayer, is fishing in this quiet little spot, and is the trigger for Fay. DON'T MESS WITH HIM please. I'll be checking the night and morning before to make sure he'll be up... if he's not going to be I'll reschedule the raid.<br>
<br>
We'll need 20-30 people for this battle. I can't imagine doing it without Rulon, Itara, Ironfury, Clob, Delnara, and any and all others who are our top-flight raiders. Additionally, Ridik will be joining us (shaman) and is inviting a couple of high level clerics from his guild (one with epic) to join us. <br>
<br>
As much as nukers help, this is really a battle for tanks and healers... so the more of those you can invite, the better our oods are. Clerics are key... as I think we already have the damage-per-second required.<br>
<br>
Faydedar is a lvl 55 magician (petless), 32K hitpoints, who hits in the 300 range and has three AoE spells he casts. One is a dispell, so we will be strict in our buffing session to add four junk buffs up top to everyone before getting to the meat of the buffs. He's rather fire resistant, but will take a cold based nuke or wizzy lure line.<br>
<br>
He opens his attack with an AoE Fear spell, so your MR should be up there or you'll wander around useless for a while. <br>
<br>
His main spell is an AoE lava spell, doing 300-500 damage. Thus the need for high fire resist.<br>
<br>
Bards (54+ for their resist song are ideal), Mages (for mod rods, resist gear, nice pets), enchanters for buffs and runes, are all needed in addition to the tanks and healers.<br>
<br>
Tactics:<br>
<br>
Fay HATES casters... but more, he HATES people sitting. From the turn-in until Fay drops NO ONE BUT THE MAIN TANK EVER WILL SIT. Aggro on a sitter will be fast, they will die, and most likely the raid will wipe. You'll hear me warning about this ad naseum, so I suggest going in to your keyboard mapping and turning off the key you use to sit/stand just so you don't hit it by accident.<br>
<br>
Once buffs are done, all but the MT group will gather in the tunnel, as far from the AoE effect as possible, then I will turn in the Froglok Essence to the dwarf ( I get it back, so if there is a wipe, thankfully no re-doing of the quest needed). At this point, the MT (Clob) will be sitting down... thus drawing Fay's aggro. Rulon and any other pally's will have a pre-set LoH order to initially heal Clob, the idea being that the MT gains and holds as much aggro as possible. Any healers in the MT group should NOT use CHEALS, but rather pound him with lesser heals in order to prevent aggro on the clerics.<br>
<br>
Once MT has aggro, ONLY then will bards (we really do need em) start singing resist and haste songs. Enchanter in MT will chain cast rune (I'll bring buckets of peridots for enchanters and clerics). After Clob is sure he has aggro.. about 30 seconds into fight, other tank groups will be called into battle. NO ONE casts anything until you are in melee range. We don't want aggro on the groups in the tunnel.. and if you are nuking, remember that you must be in melee range anyway to land them.<br>
<br>
Shamans and druids will start healing those caught in the lava breath spell. Then, at 60% shamans/ench will attempt to malo/tash and slow Fay.<br>
<br>
At 50% rest of groups emerge from tunnel and start nuking.<br>
<br>
At 40% any offensive Discs can be used.<br>
<br>
Fay only drops the pod of seawater for the druid epic.<br>
<br>
In case of wipe out, I'll have an alt stashed at TD docks with batwings, fish scales and a coffin or two if we have a necro there. Fay depops 30-40 minutes after last having aggro.<br>
<br>
More detailed buff group info and any other unanswered question will come in further posts.<br>

The first and only time I ever fought Faydedar, I was expecting a large dragon. He's not. He's a tiny, salamander-like wurm, short and about as long as a man is tall. If you are looking for Vox, you'll be surprised and confused. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And the sitting aggro thing is completely correct. Not one person should be sitting in the entire cavern when he is spawned. Whoever is sitting, no matter how much aggro you've built on him, will die before they can blink.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

It may take 10 minutes to coordinate this, but well worth denying the possibillity of a wipe because of habits.<br>
<br>
Also, don't forget the /book command.  I have a key mapped to &quot;/book 1&quot; that I use all the time.  If you are going to have people unmap &quot;/sit&quot; then have them unmap and &quot;/book&quot; keys they have, too.  I personally wouldn't go to the raid if I had these keys mapped because even a mis-key ( my &quot;/book 1&quot; is right next to my &quot;/assist &lt;ma&gt;&quot; key ) could cause a wipe and I wouldn't want to be the one to cause that.<br>
<br>
I have some family issues to deal with right now, but may still be able to make the raid.<br>

<br>
Fay went down.  Of course, what else did you expect?<br>
<br>
The normal small problem existed and don't need to be rehashed by me, I'll let someone else do it.<br>
<br>
Fay did go crazy and try to wipe the raid, but the tanks sat down and regained control.  Great job on giving the appropriate orders, Maur.<br>
<br>
One major problem, though - it seemed that some caster(s) were nuking early.  The strategies for raids are there because they work.  If someone doesn't follow the directions, then a whole raid can wipe from one bad move.  It is important to listen to the raid leader and keep the raid channel clear of idle chatter.<br>
<br>
Clob and Rulon did an EXCELLENT job, as usual as MT and MA.  Healers did a great job, also.  I'm guessing Rulon saved Clob's hide with a well-timed LOH, from what I heard.  Great job.<br>
<br>
This Council is tough.  We have what it takes to do things, as we prove over and over.  VS will be trivial on our second go around at this rate =)<br>
<br>
Kudos all around.  Awesome turnout.<br>
