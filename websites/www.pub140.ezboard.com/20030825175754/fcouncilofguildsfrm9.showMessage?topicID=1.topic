This forum is here on an Interim basis only. If it works out, it'll stay, and if it doesn't, it'll be gone. <br>
<br>
Many of the guilds who are regular contributors to the Council of Guilds events are smaller, lower-leveled guilds not capable or interested in maintaining their own raids on planar and KGC rotational targets. These targets include the Plane of Fear, Hate and Sky, Vox and Nagafen, the Kunark Dragons, Trakanon, Venril Sathir, named Velious dragons in the Sleeper's Tomb key quest such as the Keeper, Zlandicar, Cazic Thule, Yelinak and North Temple of Veeshan. This forum is not to be used to discuss, criticize, argue about or schedule raids for any of these rotational targets.<br>
<br>
This forum is also NOT to be used for begging. Any posts whose only or main content consists of &quot;Help me get my epic, plzkthx&quot; will be deleted. Anyone who repeats posting this type of post will be banned after the third one. The CoG is not here to get you your epic. Period. <br>
<br>
The CoG guilds will, I'm sure, HELP you get your epic, provided you are willing to do some legwork on your own. That's what this forum is for. If you have a NON-ROTATIONAL target (i.e. those targets that aren't listed above or that are not in the planar zones listed above) that is part of your epic quest, you may post about it here asking for raiders to help you take down this target. In order to ask for this kind of help, you need to either:<br>
<br>
1) Be willing to lead and/or organize this raid yourself or<br>
2) Have someone who has agreed to help you specifically with this raid as leader/organizer<br>
3) You must fully and specifically state the loot rules for this raid in your signup post. This is to include any and all loot that could potentially be gotten on this raid, including the epic piece. If you want to run a raid to get yourself an epic piece, you better let people know about it in your intial post, and if there is incidental loot involved, such as the loot from the Dark Elves in Kithicor when going after the General, you need to have researched what can drop, and post who is allowed to roll on the loot that might drop. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. Don't expect people to come to your raid if &quot;All the lewtz are belong to you.&quot; Keep in mind the principle of &quot;You Bleed, You Roll&quot; when making these rules... if someone comes and helps, they should get a chance at incidental loot or they should know whether they'll have a chance at reward or not.<br>
4) Either your raid leader or yourself (if you lead) must post a strategy for this raid in this forum before the raid. Be organized. <br>
<br>
Some other rules involved with this:<br>
1) Do not clog up the KCoG raid channel with your raid on nights that a rotational target raid is taking place. If there is a Planar Raid or a Dragon Raid, let them have the channel and make your own.<br>
2) If there is a CoG rotational target raid on the night your raid was planned or scheduled, do not expect people to come to your raid. You may need to reschedule. Rotational targets must take precedence because of their rarity. <br>
3) Do not crosspost your epic raid in another forum. Other people not interested in doing these raids for complete strangers aren't going to want to read about it and shouldn't have to. You only have one chance to mess this one up. Spam twice and you are gone. <br>
4) No KSing, Camp-Jumping, Training or any other kind of underhanded bullshit. Don't be an ass if the raid target you'd scheduled gets taken before you get there. Do not get into shouting matches in the zone because of it. Be RESPECTFUL, because it's there world too. As moderator of this board, if I hear about it, your epic posting privileges will be revoked. <br>
5) This is not a board for arguing about who gets to go after what epic piece. Don't even start it. If someone posts the same raid as you on the same night, work it out IN PRIVATE amongst yourselves. Bring it to the boards and you will be removed. If you try to run the same raid on the same night, don't blame the other guy if he gets more people to his than yours. <br>
<br>
If there are a number of raid leaders who would like to volunteer their services for leading these raids, post in this forum. Working out a system among you is fine with me, just work it out on this board so people know about it. Keep it in public. If someone volunteers to lead a raid, DON'T pester them to lead yours. Remember they are giving up their time to help people and don't take advantage of it. If no one will volunteer to do it, do it yourself. Leading a raid of more than 6 people is stressful, but it isn't rocket science. Not everyone can do it, but it can be done. <br>
<br>
Finally, the epic weapons and the quests involved are long, arduous (some more than others) and have caused more arguments than anything else in the game. Keep it civil, keep it respectful. Remember before you take someone's head off that it's just a digital piece of information, not a life-defining event. If you don't get it today, persevere and you WILL get it eventually. You are not your items, epic or otherwise. These rules seem harsh, but I have personally seen the depths of what people will go through to get these trinkets, and it sickens me. Do not let your thirst for your epic turn you into a manipulator, someone who uses other people only for their own gain, or into less than what you can be. A hero's measure is not in his weapons, but his heart.<br>
<br>
