Mainly, my idea was/is to have a small group of higher level chars, (25+ prolly) of every class (if possible). These people will act as Big Brothers/Sisters to various newbies of the same class. Now, first question: No, its not powerleveling. Both parties need to understand that from the begining. The high level should not interfere directly with the whole newbie process of rat killing and running from big mean pumas <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . If the newbie is about to die and they just leveld again for the 3rd time or something of that nature, then yeah you can step in..thats just being generaly nice. <br>
As this is not powerleveling, its not truly required to even be in the same zone. Mainly the Big Brother provides a few things. <br>
1)Training and knowledge gained from experiance on how to play their shared class. This can be anything and everything, from mage pet use, Necro fear kiting, druid kiting, warrior taunting, monk equipment use, evil class/race faction tips, etc etc etc etc.<br>
2)A friend and future ally. This newbie will be level 60 someday, most likely. and if you are still playing, then thats one more level 60 you can most likely count on for Veeshan's Peak.<br>
Also, the higher level can provide a sounding board and faq for the newbies on stuff like quests and faction and the bazaars, and just generally be a friend. <br>
<br>
Now, there are a few problems that could pop up. <br>
1)This is not aimed at the level 3 mage from a guy that also plays a level 45 warrior, since the guy behind the keyboard most likely knows most of the stuff we can teach him, at least the really basic newbie stuff. All we can provide to him is the same thing 50 mage specific sites provide. <br>
2)A seperate website will prolly need to be created to hold a submit area for newbies who want to join, lists of the higher level chars of each class, maybe screen archives, news..etc etc..short of like a mini-guild website. <br>
3)The program needs a seperate director to monitor what Big brother goes to what newbie, monitor submissions, maintain the page, etc etc. This could be both an easy or difficult job, depending on the person. <br>
<br>
Over all though, I think this could really give newbies a real nice outlook on this game from the get go, and maybe soften some of our 30+ cynic player hearts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So one night a week, we designate this as big brother night for Qeynos (just as an example). We gather 1 of each class that can start out in Qeynos or Halas (close enough to count) and hold little mini-discussions/panels. Each class groups with the big brother for their class and sits and talks. The big brother answers any questions, and can demonstrate anything that can't be explained. Then the next week we send the big brother team to Freeport, etc. We'd need a volunteer from each class to teach this. <br>
<br>
It would almost be like open seminars on class tactics, etc. Any big brother could also do guild recruiting while they were there as well. <br>
<br>
This might be better as a bi-weekly thing, but that would depend on how many volunteers we have. The web site is a good idea and normally I'd volunteer my services, however I'm about at the maximum web work I can do. :-) Any other webmasters out there wish to volunteer some time to this? <br>

Maybe it's something that happens when your level 45 and up or because I'm a rogue, not sure. Over all I think it's a good idea. <br>
<br>
I think the people that want to know the Answers are the ones that ask the questions. They don't know when they will need to ask any questions or when they will have problems. So it's hard to set a day. &quot;Okay you level one warrior you can only ask me questions at this date and at this time.&quot; Of course the flip side is you don't want to be flooded with questions when your fighting lady Vox. (Which has happened to me. Heyyy maybe that's why I died. Yeah I'll blame the newbie.)<br>
<br>
What I usually also do, is if I'm in a newbie zone and I have a couple of Gaint Snake Fangs or some other low level item that rogues can use I look for newbie rogue and give it to them and then give them some tips. &quot;And If you ever need any help or have any questions give me a tell.&quot;  Works great. &lt;Grin&gt; I'm still a little worried that one deal all those people are going to take me up on that offer and I'll be sitting in Hate talking to newbies no stop. &lt;Snicker&gt; but we'll see.<br>
<br>
So in short, great idea but not sure how it's going to work. You can't really force people to ask you questions or for you to be around them until they do. &lt;Shrug&gt;<br>

It wasn't a mentor/mentee relationship and I never received any items, but I think it really helped me become a more stranger-friendly person on EQ - I mean, I met a person who was then way older than me at the time and who was nice enough to stop and spend some time with me newbie.  I knew I was able to chat with him and ask questions when I needed to, and just knowing that he was around and always ready with a friendly word or two made my entire eq experience so much more pleasant.  <br>
<br>
I think it would be worthwhile giving this a little trial period, but how would we go about recruiting newbies? *grin<br>

Like talk about some tactics then go demonstrate em in Blackburrow heh.<br>
<br>
I still like the one newbie to one big brother though, so both parties can get some friendships going, which is really important.<br>
<br>
As for the webpage, I can make one, only part I would need some help with would be the submission area, my knowledge of making forms has declined a good bit heh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, on the problem of actually getting newbies, we could use the Submit Press Release form on the Council page to advertise the site, and maybe have an initial event like the one Haemish suggested to introduce newbies to the concept and maybe get some recruits.<br>
<br>
Oh, and ill obviously volunteer to be one of the mage tutors, Id love to show some newbie Magicians how much thier class really does rule =)<br>
