I think it's because of the small hope that people on Karana are above repor and generally are the cream of the crop. I've had so many good encounters with guilds and people of Karana, that when I meet the not so good ones, they really leave a bad taste in my mouth.<br>
<br>
Here is a link to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://royalkol.tripod.com/cf.html">Last nights log</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
I have removed most of the clutter like melee, casts, and non essential stuff. I have bolded the names of the people who were causing the most problems and headaches for not only the leadership and support team, but also the members of the raid.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about most people, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when silliness starts to happen. These raids do take a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>long</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> time to get organized and to turn 32 guilds into <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> fighting force. However. My patience does have it's limits. Sumr, Urrdar, and Kanlaor all represented their guild horribly last night.<br>
<br>
I'm going on the pretense that Celestial Fury is a decent guild by their Charter<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>CODE OF CONDUCT<br>
<br>
In order to have a Guild that reflects Loyalty, Compassion, Support and Focus certain rules and procedures need to be set in place to ensure the Guild will prosper. Celestial fury would like to be the type of Guild that offers its members unconditional support and in order to do this we have devised a simple set of rules for all members to follow. Whilst these rules a merely set up as a guide, any ignorance of these rules will not be tolerated and each member will be given 3 warnings further incidents will result in dismissal.<br>
<br>
     *When playing your Character/Characters your Guild Name MUST be showing at all times. If you wish to play anonymously you may do so by using the /role-play command.<br>
<br>
     *Ill behavior or Ill-treatment of other players is NOT permitted. This would include but is not limited to: any form of 'Ninja Looting', 'Grief' playing (going out of your way to cause other players grief by immature and irrational behavior and/or abuse) Abusive language or vulgarity of any form, Ksing (Kill Stealing) and harassment.<br>
<br>
     *Support and Loyalty are two things that are of utmost importance to our Guild. If and when a Guild-mate is ever in trouble or in need it is your responsibility to do all you can to assist, whenever feasible. Loyalty goes without question. If you are a member of this guild, you are required to show loyalty to the guild and its members. <br>
<br>
    *No selling over guild talk. If you have an item you would like to get rid of, pass it down to someone who can use it. Otherwise go to EC and sell it.<br>
<br>
     *Our reputation is something we also need to uphold. Please keep this in mind when you are carrying out your day to day adventuring in Norrath.<br>
<br>
     *Always remember - to watch your manners. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sumr, Urrdar, and Kanlaor decided to throw out CF's code of conduct last night as they continually hurrased the raid leadership, and continually pushed the rules to limit and eventually broke several rules. I think they each were warned several times if not in kcognaggy channel, in tells and says to stop doing what they were doing. Due to their boredom they decided to try and break the rules. In one instance the leadership asked that no one go past me down to the draw bridge. Kanlaor decided to try and invis past me, but I had see invis on. This was after <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>several</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> kcognaggy says telling everyone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>DO NOT PASS ME</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. At that time I kicked Kanlaor from the raid. Sumr's group leader Jevhaddah, chief officer of Royal Knights of Light, kicked him from the raid. Finally I kicked Urrdar after he and Kanlaor decided to try and pull Nagafen while we were still in the buffline. Kanlaor had even ninja'ed an item, after being raid kicked, from a FG, luckily Ainure (Senior Guide) destroyed the item and replaced it.<br>
<br>
I could go on for a long time explaining each intrisic detail of their stupid acts to try and hinder the raid. But, I'll let you read through the log of that. This is uncalled for behavior and one that I will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> allow on any of my raids. Farrnusno can make his own decision for the next Vox raid, his last one. But, Sumr, Kanlaor, and Urrdar are not permitted to join my raids unless some serious reprecautions are taken. This type of behavior is not welcomed during one of my raids and if others decide to do these things, they will quickly join the ranks of raid banned.<br>
<br>
/rant<br>
These raids take too long as it is, for people to be absolute jerks during the raid which only slows them down further. If the raid leader, group leader, or a support team member tells you to do something, do it. This is not a democracy. You don't get a vote. You either listen, or you leave. Simple.<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Therefore I am asking Weadias (Wead) Mystwalker, Leader of Celestial Fury, to review the log and to handle this situation according to their rules posted on their <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www20.brinkster.com/cfguild/RULES.HTML">public board.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Several members of other guilds <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> put these three and CF on a no buff, no rezz, no port list, due to these three's actions. However, at this time I will welcome any other Celestial Fury member to my raids, except the ones listed above. I am giving CF the benefit of the doubt, but I do hope that actions are taken by the leadership.<br>
<br>
I hope that further encounters with CF will prove me wrong about the members of your guild. For as now, I don't hold them too high.<br>

If that doesn't happen, then I'll treat the entire guild the same way I'm treating those three.  Shiftie is also on my list because of his behavior when Sumr was kicked, although since no formal complaint was made, I'm not holding CF responsible for his actions.  (Starting at [Fri Jan 10 23:14:01 2003]  on Qam's log)<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that in 3 years of playing EQ, I have put exactly one person on /ignore.  Last night, I added two -- Urrdar and Kanlaor.  Sumr wasn't spamming raid channels, so I didn't feel the need to add him.  Besides, I'd kinda like to keep an eye on him.<br>
<br>
I'd like to draw particular attention to this line (in reference to Sumr's ninja of the Magus): <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Fri Jan 10 23:23:14 2003] Kanlaor tells kcog:2, 'gues who told him to do that i did!' <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Keep in mind that Kanlaor had been long since kicked from the raid at this point, and both he and Sumr were claiming to have been kicked &quot;for no reason.&quot;  Sumr even went so far as to say it wasn't his fault he did it, it was the fault of the person who kicked him out of the raid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you say you have banned my guild before I have time to handle the problems then CF doesn't want your one sided help anyway.  If you judge a book by its cover then what kinda person are you?  CF is not made up of 3 people.  Anyone that has grouped with me or known me should know that I am fair and easy going.  I have handle problems before like this and I am sure I will have to do it again.  Any guildleader will have to deal with it.  People can always slip through the cracks.  As for how am I going to handle this, ask Farr how I handle problems.  See if he was happy about the outcome of the problem that concerned him.

Thanks for replying. I have stated that I wouldn't hold CF responsible. I will give every guild the benefit of the doubt. RKoL has had it's share of idiots and I know exactly what you are talking about. That is why I did allow any other CF to come to my raids except the three listed.<br>

I did spend two days trying to get a hold of you but you and I were never on at the same time.<br>

I think some people are in the guilty until proven innocent mode as of late. Whether anyone agrees with me or not, but your members represent your guild. If one is being a dork, someone will think your guild is a dork. Is this right? No, but it's human nature. By you posting here, it shows me that CF is a most honorable guild and my faith is restored with CF. I believe that others will do the same after reading your post.<br>
<br>
I thank you for handling this and I do hope that CF will join me on my raids, for the invintation was never withdrawn. I would like to talk to you in game or email so send me a tell or shoot me an email.<br>

I know everyone is sour atm with some guilds. But, we must try and at least give guilds the benefit of the doubt before we are quick to handle judgement. Until the leaders, or officers have ample time to handle a situation I think that all guild wide bans need to just be held for the moment to give them a chance to take care of the bad apples.<br>
<br>
Put yourself in CF's shoes for just a sec. You have 3 people causing huge problems on a kcog raid. Several people blame you for their actions. Not quite fair eh? Let's switch to innocent until proven guilty again, at least when dealing with the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
Now this doesn't mean that you can't ban the individual player(s) as they IMHO deserved their raid kick. But, lets not be too quick to judge the guild by the bad apples. We've all had them. Now had Wead not posted here or sent me a tell in game then that would be a different story. He has shown that his guild is honorable and for that I commend him. <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>

We all know their frustration was not directed personally at any of the CF members who were not involved, yet we also understand why Weadias was offended, and we would likely have each been similarly offended if we were in his shoes. As we all know, text based communication media are ripe for creating misunderstandings. Email, message boards and games like EQ allow incomplete communication at best, and as such it is not uncommon to get the wrong idea or to post something that is not exactly what you meant or comes across a little stronger than intended. I think everyone here realizes this, and I also think that this was clearly such a misunderstanding. <br>
<br>
I would like to offer apologies to Celestial Fury and to Weadias in particular. Though I did not post above, I too made the mistake Qamgine describes in judging CF by the actions of a few members, and for that I'm sorry. You clearly handled this difficult situation decisively, and you &amp; CF have my respect.<br>
<br>
KCoG is a community, and as such we need to support each other. I know we all agree on this point, so I propose we put this misunderstanding firmly behind us and move forward! <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=457258"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rinalthelis Wolfbrother</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org">&lt;Ancient Adventurers&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
As the leader of a raid group as diverse as KCoG, Qamgine did what he could to make sure that inappropriate behavior is reported on to others who might become victims of this behavior. Unfortunately, that often amounts to witch hunt mentality. As you well know, those who wear your guid tag create the impression that your guild has on others. If all the person ever sees of your guild is idiots, what are they going to think? No, it isn't fair to the good people in your guild, but that's where your actions as a guild leader come into play. You can't change what they did, but you can change someone's impression of your guild, which you just did by posting here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

Weadias has apparently dealt with Sumr appropriatly.  That's great, good to hear it.  Faction reset to indifferent.  Hope to have a good experience to work it back up.  Never been less than &quot;kindly&quot; with Weadias personally.<br>

<br>
I will say this though.<br>
<br>
For the entire time I've been with KCoG we've followed a simple rule.  Acceptance without prejudice.<br>
<br>
That night I saw a lot of calls from people attacking Celestial Fury and talking about bans and the like.  As far as I could tell, CF did not even have an officer in the raid.<br>
<br>
CF seems to have handled things as soon as they were made aware of it.  Which is as it should be.  But not allowing them the opportunity to fix things and holding it against them is simply against what I knew KCoG to have been.<br>
<br>
Not a single guild here is innocent of wrongdoing.  Each guild here, including mine, has had members who have trained others, caused zonewide problems, disrupted raids, and generally caused trouble.  In the past we have always given the guilds in question the benefit of the doubt and allowed them time to deal with their members.<br>
<br>
Something to keep in mind for the next time this happens.   And it will.  Take a look at that player, especially if you are an officer in your guild.  Take a hard look at them and what they are doing.  Then remind yourself that there but for the grace of god could have been a member of your guild.<br>
<br>
Dont be so quick to pass judgement on others.  The next time it could be you.<br>
