<br>
So in all fairness, if you really want this event series to take off, you will have to do your thing...here's a thread to post CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS and IDEAS THAT HAVE WORKED FOR YOU.  I am sure the people organizing the raids would be happy to hear good ideas and advice.  Stormbeard has set a very nice example earlier on the board, and I would like to encourage him and others to share their experiences.<br>
<br>
No flames and useless whiny/snobby remarks, please.<br>
<br>
Ok, let me start:<br>
<br>
I haven't been to any plane raids so far, my apologies, but one overall suggestion I would like to make is that to have:<br>
<br>
A briefing on the run either posted on here, e-mailed to the participants at least 2 days prior to the event and/or  a 30 minutes briefing online before heading out to make sure everyone is on the same page when the raid starts up. The briefing can contain anything, from how to communicate, who the raid leaders are, whom to complain to, what NOT to do, how the raid will proceed, etc.  <br>
<br>
I found that when we organized the kedge mixer hunts, having a prior briefing really cuts down on the time to set things up and ensured that we only had to communicate about the immediate issues throughout the event.<br>
<br>
What do ya think?<br>

It's quite unfair to complain to her.  And I can tell you right off these raids will never be perfect.  However, I do want to hear your opinion in order to make this better.  However, if your going to complain, I don't want to hear whining about &quot;I didn't get an item.&quot;  That kind of whining is a good way for me to mock you, cleverly yell at you and then add you to my ignore list.  So please make intelligent complaints, bring up valid points.<br>
<br>
Here's is another problem I am aware of, which is a no win situation.<br>
<br>
- 36 to 40 people is too many people.<br>
- Scheduling only 24 people means complaints that you signed up 1 month ago and still on priority list from then to the raid happening next month.<br>
<br>
And I noticed in the title experience sharing in the title which would be apparent someone is complaining they aren't getting experience for kills.  I can tell you right now, that will never be fair.  Groups are set up to contribute to the overall success of the raid, not to ensure everyone gets experience from a kill.  This is near impossible to ensure, and I will never promise each group will get experience.  Afterall when is the last time you heard someone say, let's go to the planes get some good experience I want to get to level 51.  Planes are about having fun, being able to work with multiple groups as a team, for the challengs, the treasure, etc...   Definetely not about experience.  So if your looking for experience you need to go to Karnor or equivalent.<br>
<br>
As I look at the overall of all the raids it has been very successful.  We never failed to break into the planes yet, and I have been with guilds that have failed and request for another guild to help them get their corpses back.  We also have about 70 to 95% of people completely brand new to planes yet we've manage to break in, kill lots of creatures and have something to show for it.<br>

That is definitely not the attitude to go on these raids with. While I've never been on a plane raid, whenever I do large raids such as the Mixer Hunts or other type of multi-group events, I always make sure it's stated that this isn't for experience, this isn't necessarily for loot (Unless we are going to get a specific item), it is for fun. Perhaps when I post the press release for the next plane raid, I will state that:<br>
<br>
&quot;The Council of Guilds does not guarantee that anyone will get experience, or an item, or anything other than the fun to be had by making a large scale plane raid. These raids are provided as a fun adventure for all those who might normally not be able to go on a plane raid of this nature, and should be approached with that spirit. The Council is also not responsible for any experience lost, or items or corpses; the raiding party will do everything within their power to retrieve all corpses and experience ressurect all deaths but you attend the raid at your own risk.&quot;<br>
<br>
How's that sound? <br>

<br>
Sorry about that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
and no, so far I haven't gotten negative comments from people that actually have participated in the CoG plane runs, only from people who haven't.  So I guess they don't qualify as complaints either.  But yea, I would be curious to hear back from more participants who have gone.<br>
