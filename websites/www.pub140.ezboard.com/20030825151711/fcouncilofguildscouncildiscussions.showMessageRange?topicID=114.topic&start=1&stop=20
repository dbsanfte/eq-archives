The repop rate is fast fast fast, and I really don't see it being the sort of place you'd WANT to have restricted to a single guild or alliance at a time.  It might be appropriate to have Innoruuk and/or the Maestro on rotation (from what I hear, they'd be beyond most of the guilds on Karana), but the general zone pops are too fast and too plentiful to be restricted.<br>
<br>
On more than one occasion, we've been up there at the same time as two or three other groups and had plenty to keep us busy (by groups I mean our raid of 17 people, and 14 people tagged to guild_x, and 30 people in alliance_y).  One night there were over 70 people up there and we never saw any of them.<br>
<br>
As for PoF--since it hasn't has a revamp to my knowledge, it may be appropriate to leave it on rotation.  That 8 hour respawn would kinda bite for general xp-ing.<br>

I am in favour of the rotations continuing.  This will anoy a lot of guilds but I think it is the only fair way for all to get a look in.<br>

This is the major argument for leaving the rotations as they were.  I don't know how likely it is, or if the uber guilds have better things to spend their time on these days.  Many of them are no longer even concerned with their members' epics, as they're seeing better stuff dropped in higher-level zones.  I believe part of the reason for the test period was to see if this was, in fact, going to happen.  I haven't heard one way or another whether it has or not. <br>

Are you volunteering to lead them?  I think most folks here agree that we &quot;should&quot; be doing this, but raids only happen if someone leads them.  Nobody has stepped forward to take the position of planes leader since Farr retired, so we're pretty much stuck until someone does.  If the planes stay off rotation, we might not need a single leader.  Instead, planes would be just like any other raid -- we go when someone sets up a raid and has enough interest.<br>

Maybe... From what I'm hearing of the new PoH, it sounds like the re-design sets it up as more of an xp zone with a handful of raid-level mobs than a raid zone, in the same way that SolB is an xp zone that happens to have a raid-level target in it.  In that case, you wouldn't be organizing a PoH raid, but a Maestro raid, for example, in the same way that you don't do a raid on SolB, you do a raid on Nagafen.  PoF, however, has not (yet) seen a re-design.  They may be watching PoH to see the response while they decide whether or not to do the same thing to PoF.  At the moment, the only thing making PoF a raid zone, rather than an xp zone, is the slow repop time on the mobs.<br>
<br>
My gut instinct is to want to keep PoF on rotation, and maybe put some of the &quot;minis&quot; in PoH onto a rotation, but to leave PoH as a zone out of the rotation system.   <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

Unfortuantely, I am in the wrong time zone (GMT).  When most raids start, it is usually 2am in the UK which is a little bit of a problem when you have to be up at 6 am for work.  That is why I pray that some of the MOBS happen along either at the weekend or when I have a day-off. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Epic drops are supposedly dropping off yard trash.  We killed Magi P'tasa (the mini who formerly dropped the mage epic staff) and he dropped jack.  <br>
<br>
If you're after cash loot, there are considerably better places (Necro in Seb springs to mind).<br>
<br>
Hate's respawn rate is comparable to the PoP planes now.  You can either crawl (which is actually pretty darn dangerous), or pick an itty-bitty corner to pull to.  There would be no way for an uber guild to monopolize spawns.  And no reason for an uber guild to want to: cash loot is subpar, it costs a 52 plat component to even get there, and Hate armor is in most cases abysmally inferior once you're 55+.  <br>
<br>
If PoH stays off rotation, KCoG could still head up there, not unlike how people have organized and led PoG raids in the past.  Hate is a fun zone, pretty unforgiving, a chance at nice armor.  The revamp has made it an xp zone, rather than a raid zone.<br>
<br>
Edit: to respond to Nerissa's question of whether the ubers were up there monopolizing during the test week: I heard that Night Eternal tried the Maestro and wiped.  Other than that, on the four days that we spent 3-5 hours per day up there, we saw one group from the Haven and a smallish raid from Lightbringers.  Everyone else was in a mid-level guild or alliance.<br>

Since it hasn't changed, the same mobs are still dropping the stuff people want, and the respawn time is still about 8 hours, if I recall correctly.  Are the more desirable mobs being perma-camped?  If not, might it just be the newness of PoH, and might that change when the newness wears off?  (Personally, I doubt it... as I said above, most of the ubers have bigger fish to fry.)<br>
<br>
<br>
My guess is that if the rotations are dropped completely, most of the larger guilds who have stayed on the rotation would visit PoF maybe once every couple of months, or less, as members need/want stuff from there.  They're no longer the ones who will benefit from dropping the rotations. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
I'd say that neither rotation is necessary in anyway these days. <br>
<br>
The ubers are not going to be farming PoF for armor. With less effort, you can get better armor elsewhere. Hell, even the PoG armor is easier organizationally speaking than PoF. The only thing any ubers might need in PoF is epic stuff, and I hear that's not even that big a deal anymore. Yard trash armor drops in PoF aren't going to even be sneered at by a guild that can do NToV, high Luclin zones and those who exp. in PoP won't want to bother with PoF stuff. <br>
<br>
The changes in PoH make it sound as if this zone certainly doesn't need to be on rotation. If the Magi dropped absolutely nothing, farming for armor or cash or epic drops really isn't worth the bother for the &quot;ubers.&quot; <br>
<br>
There's enough content in the world that there really shouldn't be much conflict over these two zones. The organizational headache these rotations add to a guild/alliance leadership isn't needed any longer, and were I still a guild leader in EQ, I'd welcome the change. <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
Guilds like mine ( small, but good players ) can use Hate for EXP and upgrades for some characters.  We've gotten a couple upgrades already while receiving decent EXP.  The cash drops aren't too awful bad after paying for the port stones, but not that great that ubahs are going to farm the zone for cash.  Hate can now easily support 10 groups of 6 that are constantly EXPing.<br>

The &quot;bosses&quot; are TOUGH.  I don't know how they compare to some of the higher tier mobs, but I'd venture that they put the Kunark dragons to shame by a big margin.  This means that you're going to have to have a serious force to take them, and then you need to weigh risk -vs- reward.  Is it worth it to go camp/race for Inny or is it better to work on Vex Thal, etc, where you are getting many upgrades in the same amount of time it would take you to get just a couple?  I don't see the guilds that can make short work of Inny and Maestro wasting their time on them without good reason.  I don't know what these 2 are dropping, now, though so can't take that into account in my decision.<br>
<br>
Our guild hasn't seen en epic piece drop, yet, but I think that is what the vote will come down to - how it impacts the lower guilds' abililities to get their epic drops.  I don't think the ubahs care that much for most of the epics as a guild, although the members may still want to get them on their own time.<br>
<br>
Our guild hasn't taken a formal vote on what we think of keeping the rotation on Hate, but my guess is that it would be to leave it off of the rotations.<br>
<br>
Fear is another story.  I can't decide what makes the most sense ATM, and probably won't have a strong opinion unless it goes off of rotation and I see the impact after a couple months.  Haemish is correct that ubahs really don't give a crap about the armor drops there, but some may still want an epic piece or 3.  But, that means taking time out from Ssra, Vex Thal, NToV, PoP to gather for a Wraith of a Shissar kill.  Who knows, though - maybe they will try to monopolize these types of spawns, but at least with that particular spawn, it can't be MQd so they won't do it unless they have a chanter sans Epic and they're worried about getting everyone hasted FAST after a wipe.  Changing Fear is a tough call, but I wouldn't go against a majority on it.<br>
<br>
My assumption is Sony will see that changing Hate was a GoodIdea(tm) and do it for Fear within the next year and all of this will be moot. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

I was kinda thinking the same thing, but until then, I'm also wavering on what I'd like to see rotation-wise for PoF.  I'm actually considering suggestiong that we give a less formal &quot;sign up&quot; system a try for a while, and converting back to a normal rotation if too many people end up wanting the same spots. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
OK Folks, here comes the time to really decide what we would like to have in our further planes.  I m thinking about that trouble since more than 3 weeks, and here are purposes I offer you to decide on, feel free to express all points you can have in your mind.<br>
<br>
- PoA isnt a real matter, so it will be added to the global decision.<br>
<br>
- PoF is the largest trouble we can meet, due to major Epic mobs dropped by Mini's, and due to its large respawn time.<br>
PoF really have to me retain into rotation.<br>
<br>
- PoH (new) could be considered as an open zone, but there is some major epic parts on this plane either. As the epic side has always been the &quot;tip&quot; to decide to put mobs into rotation, I guess we have to let new PoH in a rotation.<br>
But ... respawn time is faster than ever, and there is 2 twinked mobs which could be interesting for some <br>
<br>
That is why I suggest we :<br>
<br>
- Start again with ALL rotations like before<br>
- Nothing changes for PoA or PoF<br>
- Amend the PoH rule as follows : Only the UP guild has right to kill Mini's (excepted Maestro and Innoruk). Anyone else who want just discover the zone would be authorized to gather in. We will just ask them to be careful to not interfer with the regular up guild.<br>
Maestro and Innoruk would actually be FFA, as they are stronger than ever  We would look for a rotation on them the day they would be perma killed by number of different guilds.<br>
<br>
I hope I havent forgot something important, but feel free to correct or ask to amend all points, this is nothing else than a purpose.<br>

The more believable sources say that the minis are on a 30-minute spawn cycle with placeholders.  If this is true, then  I don't see a reason to put them on rotation.<br>
<br>
Other people have said they are on a 24-hour cycle, which lends to a rotation being a good thing.<br>
<br>
My guess is that some minis are the former and others are the latter.  Until there is no doubt what the spawn-cycle is like for all the minis, and there is no doubt about what can drop what epic pieces, KGC taking a vote on what to do with PoH would be premature.<br>
<br>
The reason for the rotations would be to insure that people get a chance at epic drops, and if we don't *know* how the epic drop mobs work yet, then we can't cast an intelligent vote. <p>Zymyool, Officer of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientadventurers.org"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ancient Adventurers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on the Karana Server<br>

Phinigel is not on rotation.  Verina Tomb, Vessel Drozlin, the Tangrin.  None of the Chardok Royals.  I'm sure that there are others.<br>
<br>
They aren't on rotation for valid reasons.  Fast repop or only dropping one epic piece for one class seem to be the main reasons.  (And of course, critters that are spawned aren't on rotation, e.g., Faydedar, Ragefire, several of the monk fights).<br>
<br>
Restricting the minis while keeping the plane as a whole open is basically just a death sentence to whatever puller accidentally aggroes them.<br>
<br>
Since the minis don't necessarily drop anything and the yard trash supposedly does, it doesn't make sense to me to restrict them in any way, unless you restrict the whole plane, which would be a huge waste given the repop rate.<br>

I can't remember exact quotes, and I am feeling to lazy to actually look up the threads, so this is paraphrasing.<br>
<br>
What actually made a target a potential rotation target was if there was too much competition for it (i.e. Perma killed without guilds getting a chance at him ever unless you were waiting in it's room for it's spawn).  Simple as that.  Now, no targets have really been added to the rotations since Velious, and even then there were only a couple added.  Epic drops are coincidental, mostly because most of the biggest targets in Original and RoK dropped epic pieces, so that was to a certain extent incidental.  The epic drop status itself was not considered in whether a target went on rotation, just the competition level. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
I wish we could get a raid together to test it out, but I think we've run out of time.  Some people have already cast their votes, and a decision will have to be reached soon.  We only have a few more days. <br>
<br>
It looks to me like the voting is leaning toward returning PoF/PoA to the original rotation system, and leaving PoH off.  From what I've seen here, as well as in other places, I think that will likely be my vote as well. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
