<br>
But there is also the question of best use here.<br>
<br>
With some of the changes, clerics can make a good case at being able to roll on a CoF.  I'm fairly sure, however, that most of the melee's would be pretty upset at a cleric winning one of the best haste items in the game.  And rightly so.<br>
<br>
The use a bard would get out of Torbin's Eyepatch is similar.  I dont think anyone would question that a bard (or SK for that matter) wouldnt get some use out of this item.  Some will even get quite a bit of use out of it.  However, neither will get anywhere close to the amount of use a pure wis/int caster will.<br>
<br>
Add to that a bard cannot use any form of mana regen and more does not always equal better.  Would you like an addition 150ish mana that will take you 10 minutes to regen...or some AC + random stat which will make you more effective in combat and a better tank?  I dunno about you...but if I were a melee type I'd go for haste/ac over wis/int.<br>
<br>
And at the end of the day, there is this little fact.  And one that has stood the test of time over many many many KCoG raids.<br>
<br>
Cloak of Flames - Lord Nagafen = melees<br>
Torbin's Eyepatch - Lady Vox  = casters <br>
<br>
Each of the 2 dragons will drop a piece of loot that is restricted by class type.  Unless you want to make the CoF rollable for everyone, to balance things out the Eyepatch should be restricted as well.<br>
<br>
As for this being a reason why people wont show up.  I suppose thats possible.  Still...there is the white scale for bards and the book for paladins.<br>
<br>
And after all the loot is settled, the premis for KCoG is not loot or who gets what.  KCoG is about an idea and vision of everyone having the opportunity to do these targets.  It doesnt matter what guild you are from, how long you've played the game, or where you are from.  If you want to see a Dragon or a Plane then KCoG offers that opportunity.<br>
<br>
The loot rules are setup not to encourage people to show up to certain targets, but to ensure a certain amount of fairness in an otherwise unfair world.  KCoG operates on the belief that people will show up even without any other motivation other than a desire to help others and do things they might not otherwise have a chance to do.<br>
<br>
Of course we all play for different reasons.  Thats a good thing.  But since no one can please anyone in an environment that has a limited supply versus demand, the best we can do is try to be fair.  Some people will get screwed in this arrangement.  I would it be otherwise, but unfortunatly its not.  As such the best we can do is promote these events as a fun thing and try to make loot a secondary factor.  So that at least if you have fun you'll have something to take away even if you dont get any hard loot.<br>
<br>
And remember.  One day we'll all leave EQ.  Some sooner, some later.  But eventually everyone will move on.  When that happens what loot you got, what levels you made, what guilds you were in will matter not.  All you'll have is the memories of the raids you were on, the friends you made, and the experiences you had.  Which is, I think, a far more important thing than any loot you can recieve.<br>

I can't belive you would want that eye patch.<br>
<br>
That just screams caster.  <br>
<br>
Bards are CHA base not INT base.  When you have no way to regen mana it does you 0% good.  Charm mobs for long and you will be OOM and dead.  You can mes mobs all day and thats CHA based.  You can get a good +9 or +11 WW dragon mask for like 500-1000 pp.<br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to win a RBB back in the day when I did dragon raids and let me tell you what would a caster have done with that?  Sold it or thrown in on an alt.<br>
<br>
After I won the RBB I did many many more raids with CoG and still do from time to time.  Who knows how to measure the gain people recived in that.<br>
<br>
If casters could have rolled on RBB and CoF?  I don't think very many people would like that at all.<br>
<br>
What if a white scale drops?<br>
<br>
Should I roll on it just so I can sell it?  After all your argument is you bleed you roll....<br>
<br>
That eye patch would have done you little to no good, honestly.  You would be MUCH better off just getting a kobalt jester crown for 500 plat (-30 int +30 CHA)<br>

You have to be the ONLY bard I know that chose the wrong class to play from day one if you're trying THAT hard to be an ench.<br>

Perhapse it is best if you just stick with your own alliance's raids from now on since everyone here has told you no and you just wont stop trying to prove we're all wrong.<br>

*note - ordinarily yes this is double dipping, but cause of the lvl cap on vox/naggy they have no restrictions on aid from outsiders, so yes other alliance people can go. But they had better be prepared to be the first to volunteer to leave if there are too many people.<br>
<br>
and as much as you are gonna insist that bards are int based, I am gonna disagree with you till the cows come home cause thank you having a high cha makes a world more difference for me then int, and I'd rather have my CHA high to have a chance at landing that charm in the first place.

For you to tell me how to play my character and to tell me which ALL/ALL items I am allowed to use shows that you obviously lack the imagination to truly play this game. I play because I want to, and it's people like you who ruin the experience for myself and others.<br>
<br>
I really didn't want this post to end up like this; I tried to be nice and explain my point clearly and as concise as I could. But when faced with people who constantly throw inaccuracies like &quot;bard's mana is Charisma based&quot; and &quot;bards would never wear something like that&quot; I have to take issue with it. Like I said before, I didn't win the item because I didn't get a chance to roll. Fine. I really don't care anymore. I am extremely happy that someone else got it. I have enough equipment to keep me more than happy, and I guess you're right. I was being 'greedy&quot; for wanting to take my character in a totally new and unprecedented direction. Forgive me, please.<br>
<br>
Yes, I will stick to my guild and alliance raids. No, I will not boycott KCoG raids, nor berate/ridicule those that wish to participate. I think the KCoG is a wonderful idea. What better way to help people learn the ways of a guild than to band together with others and learn how to take down a specified target. Haemish and the others who have devoted their time and effort into this program are to be saluted not only for their tactics, logistical acuity and leadership, but for their kindness as well. They are training a new crop of people to enjoy the wonderful world of Norrath.<br>
<br>
But this will be my very last post on this board. Since there are some people who only seem to want to hide behind misinformation and excuses, I have no real need to post here anymore. You can lock this thread if you wish. If any of you have need of a 52 bard in game for help, please do not hesitate to ask. And if you are thinking of sending me tells (like someone else did the other night, I will not name names) with threats/profanity/curses, prepare to be reported. Thank you all.<br>

<br>
First of all Lautrec, no one should be sending you ugly tells.  That is wrong on a lot of levels, and if it continues let ME know about it and I will resolve it for you.  People may not agree with you, but that is no reason for harrassment.<br>
<br>
Second of all Lautrec, you are not making friends here.  You have managed to insult virtually all of KCoG's past and current leadership.  That requires some effort, and is a dubiously impressive mark.  Unfortunately it is not the way to proceed if you want to actually change things.  A lot of people's statements you have maybe read wrong or are deliberately twisting.  For instance peoples numerous attempts to explain to you that bards are charisma based.  Yes, they actually get their mana pool from int, but virtually all the songs they use are given a resist rate off of your charisma, so that having a high charisma will help you much more than having a high int.  That is what they meant when they said that bards are charisma based rather than int based.  That is like a Paladin saying that since he gets his mana from Wisdom that wisdom is the only stat he should work on, when really it is a secondary important stat because he really needs the melee based stats more.  Also you should not ignore those that have more experience than you.  For instance Lagdalen who you have insulted several times in this thread, is not only a previous dragon leader, but also has a (I believe) 53 Bard named Vree.  Among numerous other alts in the 50's.  I would really really be surprised if you knew game dynamics better than her, because she has been playing for a long time.<br>
<br>
Frankly, telling you which all/all items you are allowed to roll for is our job.  You can wear whatever you want, but when it comes down to it, we have to make this as fair to as many people so we WILL restrict rolls to make it fair as such.  I have trouble believing that you cannot understand this concept after being in an alliance like SB.  SB restricts the items the same way, so why are you not blasting people there with this stuff?  I am sure Rbecka (a leader I have a lot of respect for) would be interested in hearing your arguments and dismissing them much more abrubtly than we have here.  Throwing in the &quot;it's people like you who ruin the experience for myself and others&quot; is not only a low blow, but it is inaccurate and can be twisted around other ways.  For instance I might say the same thing about you, because you are not willing to step back and look at it from a leadership standpoint, you are only willing to look at it from what you could possibly gain from it.  So what gives you the right to ruin my experience?  Obviously I have to deal with things like that, so it gets much more complicated, but when you deal with just the base reality you are being just as unfair to me as I am to you.<br>

I do not hold any grudge, or anything like that. Nor should anyone else (/em looks around the room daring a response).  You are welcome to come on further raids with us, and there will be no hard feelings.  Just remember, that other people want to be able to win stuff besides bards, and sometimes you just have to look at the whole picture.  Incidentally if you do not want to be insulted, you might want to look at holding your tongue sometimes, and not insulting others, especially those like Lagdalen, Kommisar, Haemish, and others who have earned our respect many times over.  I have a feeling that is the reason behind whoever it was that sent you that tell, and despite the fact that it was inappropriate for that person to do so, you might want to look at why they felt the need.<br>
<br>
As a side point, according to current rules (which I need to get around to rewriting), with Naggy and Vox anyone from an alliance is welcome to come.  Those that are in a guild that is in the rotation by itself are the only ones restricted, but Silver Daggers is only in the rotation via the Sacred Band alliance, which means they are welcome to come.  The only restriction I place there is that no one that is in a guild that is in the rotations in any other way may roll on epic items (scales and books). <p>Farrnusno <BR>

You are an exception to that. <br>
<br>
However, the loot rules were written to be as fair as possible for the most people at once. As all of the loot rules I've ever written have said, NO LOOT POLICY is 100% fair 100% of the time. There will be situations where one individual isn't given what he considers as his fair share. So long as you only have yourself to consider, you can make anything fair. When you put more than 1 person into a situation where not everyone is going to be rewarded, you will never be completely and totally 100% fair. That's life. Dragon raids often have up to 60 people in attendance, and usually not more than 4-6 items will drop from the beastie. Hard to divy those up completely fairly. The loot rules as I wrote them &quot;back in the day&quot; and as they've been modified to this date, are as fair as they are probably every going to get for the largest numbers of people possible. Sometimes, the needs of the few must be sacrificed for the needs of the many to be met.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
It's every raider's responsibility to familiarize themselves with the loot rules of a raid prior to joining and by joining the raid - there's a tacit implication that by joining you accept those rules.  You should know that by now.  The loot rules for Vox/Naggy fights have been posted for over 3 years now, so for you to bring this up now confuses me.  These rules were posted to head off issues like these because they came up time and time again at every raid until Haemish and the KCoG council put their collective foot down and said from here on in - this is the way it's going to be, if you agree to it, Great, then raid with us - if not - then be on your way.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, maybe you're trying to spark some interesting debates, or just vent your frustrations.  Whichever it is you're doing, please keep in mind one thing - you bear the Silver Dagger name wherever you go - and people's impressions of you will be their impression of our guild.  That's not something the SD officers take lightly either.  <br>
<br>
I'd suggest you get these issues straightened out - because like the posters above said, we have the exact same loot rules, plus a hundred other class restricted loot rules.<br>
<br>
As far as Dagger participation in this KCoG raid, I'm not sure if this raid was one of them, but from time to time, a raid leader will announce a &quot;Call to Arms&quot; and invite members from the Silver Daggers to participate.  Though this is discouraged by the KCoG - it's the raid leader's responsibility to assemble an effective fighting force, and hence at their discretion.  Additionally there was a vote held over 2 years ago that agreed to allowing up to 6 additional members from other planar/dragon capable guilds to participate on KCoG raids.  I don't know if that was ever made official, but I do know that it was allowed.  This can arguably be construed as double dipping, but again - a raider's participation at a KCoG raid is also at the discretion of the raid leader. <p>Ephemeral Bliss<BR>

If I might say, KCoG isn't about ignoring people's opinions or views. They take them very seriously as this post has shown. I have only been a member for less than a month, but from reading the pluthera of past posts I can see that while KCoG has a series of rules set in place, they always take in to account what people have said. Have they always agreed with them, no. But they have, as this post has shown, tried to explian the logic and reasoning behind what they have decided upon.<br>
<br>
By no means do I think anyone here doesn't want to hear your views. Nor are they unimportant. But, on the other hand perhaps you should hear and listen to their views as well. Perhaps before you flame anyone on what they post, step back and try and see it from their standpoint.<br>
<br>
I can't speak for anyone, but I believe all opinions are welcomed here. If you have a suggestion, post it. But, don't get upset if a majority of KCoG disagree's.<br>
<br>
The best ideas are the ones never invented. The only stupid question is the question not asked. Heh, I've asked a bunch of questions already.<br>
<br>
Not meaning to beat a dead horse, just don't want you to walk away feeling as though KCoG doesn't listen to people's opinions.<br>

But make sure that when you are coming here you do it with respect, as coming in here with an antagonistic attitude is a bad thing.  Frankly, I have this little tendency to ignore people that give ultimatums and threats, as it usually isn't worth my time.  Same with those that try to discredit others to prove their points.

Lautrec,<br>
Don't be so hard on yourself.  The last thing the world needs is a person or a player unwilling to speak their minds.  Some very big decisions have been made in our alliance because members had the courage to step up and say, &quot;Hey - there might be a better way.&quot;  The biggest tragedy would be if we stifled opinions from people like this.  We're 1000% better off because these discussion took place, and we wouldn't be there if those people hadn't spoken up.  <br>
<br>
But from my time in this game and on these boards - I've learned some valuable lessons about posting.<br>
<br>
#1) Know your shit...if you make a mistake - you'll be called on it<br>
#2) Never EVER take anything personally, people can taunt you all day and you'll never be the wiser<br>
#3) Opinions are great, Flames are interesting, But to effect change - Good Even Keeled Arguments &gt; ALL<br>
<br>
In my eyes - you got off easy :) Back in the day if Mr. Smartypants ever got a hold of you....boy.../shiver.... Let's just say that the legend of Mr. Smartypants is the kind of story parents tell their kids when they're misbehaving.  I miss his posts more than anything in the world but god help you if you were on the receiving end of his &quot;eloquence&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just one last note - don't alienate yourself over this.  SD has strong ties with the KCoG because we were born out of its tenets.  Simply put - we're the successful guild we are in a successful alliance because of what we learned in our tour of duty with the KCoG.  Don't deny yourself that experience :)<br>

Do not ask questions, during or after a CoG raid.<br>
<br>
Although the leaders appear to be saying that they invite comment and constructive criticism, they actually seem to thrive on ridiculing and antagonizing the person who asked a very real question arising from a very real concern.<br>
<br>
I am behind the Bard, when he says you are ignoring the concern here.<br>
<br>
There also seems to be a great deal of misinformation about the relationship between int/wis and mana.<br>
Having 9 characters on 3 servers, only 2 do not have casting ability, I can tell you that int and wis are the stats that increase the mana pool, Which is what this bard is looking for.  Cha is great when casting to prevent resists by the mob.  But it is my understanding that mana regen spells do not help bards, only flowing thought items help, which are mighty hard to come by until you are upper level.  This means that a bard needs an expanded mana pool, so that he can continue to play needed tunes for the benefit of the entire group, through-out the fight.<br>
<br>
I am not surprised that the liaison would be party to this misinformation, since this has been his history for the past 12 months that I have been playing.  I have seen him tell people that certain areas were not safe, that you could not go in them until you were in the upper levels ( I think this was because he didn't want to go in), I have seen him argue with others in other posts, and on e-mails.  He has been known to make threats and create problems for people in the game.<br>
i.e. running to an ex-guildmates new guilds and making trouble for them, by telling untruths and embellishments and twisting their words.I will not name names, but he should know who they are.<br>
<br>
Much of what the Bard had said was valid, and who are these leaders, who know so much more than Varent about who should have or use items. All/All is about as self-explanatory as it gets.  I agree that you read what is written but you don't hear what is being said.<br>
<br>
To humiliate and belittle another, for the way they chose to play their characters is childish and irresponsible, especially when you call yourself leaders.<br>
It is not the bard who should apologize for asking a simple question but the leaders who have all handled this so badly.<br>
<br>
When it appeared that you had all run out of new material you even resorted to dragging in SD and the guild leaders, to take this one individual to task, after you egged it on and made threats and insults to him.<br>
<br>
I am sure that there will be some response to this, and having seen what some of you are capable of, I fully expect that I will be in some way threatened, or black -balled by you.<br>
<br>
Not to worry!  I do not let things upset me to any degree.  I do not desire to be part of your little political tyranny, and will avoid CoG raids in the future.  And, by all means, if I question anything at all, it will be silent.<br>
<br>
Good Leaders are hard to come by, seems like those in power at CoG and many of the Alliances have earned their position by being unfair, antagonistic and hostile.<br>
<br>
I fully expect to get flamed big-time for this, but then that would prove my point about the leaders, wouldn't it?<br>

Ok sorry, done laughing heh.<br>
<br>
When you get a char to dragon lvl and actually participate on one of these raids, then I can see you actually having a valid statement under the premise that you might know something about that which you speak. As it is, there are ways that things are done in higher lvls that you cannot understand right now.<br>
<br>
Either way, this thread was dead and forgotten and the matter was ended. For you to drag it up at this point means you obviously dont come here very often anyway or you would have noticed the date on the last reply. I also find it quite interestig that you would attempt to target and flame someone within your post, someone that throught the whole debate here stayed about the calmest as the rest of us lost patience. Personal vendetta maybe and this was the easiest place you could see to vent it?<br>
<br>
The reasons for everything was clearly stated by multiple people. CoG has not survived near 3 years (about 2 years more then you said you've been playing) because it is an antagonistic, hostile and ridiculing place. It has survived because for a common good, everyone agrees to these rules and reasons, and in agreeing to it there resides a place where even guildless people can go to see a dragon or a Plane. It just happened in the case of this thread that the writer hadn't read CoG's rules before participating on the raid.<br>
<br>
Before you try and blast your &quot;all/all&quot; propaganda on a dead issue, please read the FULL posts including the reasons why things are as they are. At that point in time if you have something useful to contribute I'm quite sure CoG's dragon leader will adress it.<br>
<br>
I'm quite sure there are some pieces out there that even though they say all/all, are designed specifically for your class (epic pieces for example). I assume you would be very upset to not get that item solely based on the theory that all/all means all/all and anyone can have that piece designed for you. Think about it.<br>
<br>
Feel free to not participate in CoG's raids if you really dont want to, plenty of other people have alot of fun either way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but in the meantime, this thread is dead. goodbye. <p><center> <img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/LagKommipic.gif> </center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showMessageRange?topicID=93.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showMessageRange?topicID=93.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showNextMessage?topicID=93.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.emailToFriend?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.threadControl?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub140.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsfrm9">CoG Epic Raids<option value="councilofguildsfrm10">CoG Venril Sathir Raids<option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions>Council Discussions</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
