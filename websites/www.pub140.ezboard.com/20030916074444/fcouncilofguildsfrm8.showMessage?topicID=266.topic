We had a slow start (when I got there at 8pm sharp there were 11 people).  When we started gathering people we didn't really have a steady flow, we went from not having enough to having 10 full groups plus support very suddenly.  Add in to that the mass ld spikes, and the problems with chat channels going down several times and we actually went into Sol B at 10:20.  Someone managed to pull the efreeti room, which wiped a whole section of the raid that was heading to the SS room, which slowed us down a lot.  We had a lot of problems with coordination and communication, frankly a lot of people were not listening to commands.  Giants went smoothly thanks to the support team just taking them out rather than pulling them, so we were able to move pretty quickly to the buffing hall.  I do want to add a special curse to the designer who decided it would be a good idea to add a switch to the drawbridge on the bridge, but then every raid leader does.  The monk wiped once trying to split the lair, but the second time he got it done (still died, but got the giants out first).  The buffing line was slow, because there was a lot of confusion (coordinating 12 groups of people isn't as easy as I make it look).  Since we did not have anyone who had run a buffline before I had to get Rredd to organize it, and he had to figure it out first.  We did manage to somehow bring along a 60 Enchanter, Cleric, and Shaman for buffs, so the buffs were awesome.  Once the buffline got going we were able to speed through it pretty quick.  When we all got to the chatroom everyone managed to listen up and we had the raid briefing done very quickly.  We got back and organized very efficiently as well.  Once everyone was organized we engaged, and the engagement went very well.  Only a few LD's, and not very many lagged very bad.  Naggy's help dropped like a rock, and he went down in about 45-60 seconds.  We only sustained 2 deaths from what I saw (one was a death I heard about but only saw corpse of 1 person), which is awesome.  <br>
<br>
Loot was pretty good (especially for bards), but I am sure all the melee were discouraged by no CoF and Paladins are always are upset when no books drop.<br>
<br>
I want to appologize for the raid taking as long as it does, as 2:30am EST is much later than we usually end up (and for the record I have to get up at 8am, so I want it not lasting that long as much as anyone).  Unfortunately because of the conditions of the night, we just were having problems proceeding smoothly.  There were several Mass LD's, and I counted chat channels going down 4 different times.  Add to that that we had 10 full groups (and all the confusion that comes with that), and it was a very turbulent time.  We had a lot of problems with people not listening, which added something like an hour and a half to the total raid time.  We had a huge percentage of what appeared to be first time raiders, and the ratio of veteran:new was very bad.  Unfortunately that is the way it goes sometimes, and you can only do so much.  I do want to say that I am proud of the fact that despite all of the problems going on last night, we were successful and have another stuffed dragon head to add to the collection on the wall.  Great Job to everyone for coming through when it counted.  We have a lot of room for improvement, but it went much better than it could have last night.<br>
<br>
I do want to especially thank a few people.  I will miss out on a lot of the individuals that did a great job, but know I do remember.  I just want to make sure I say something about those outstanding people.  First of all Jeyct and the support team did an awesome job.  They had the way cleared just ahead of us and they did a great job of providing cover.  One of the smoothest support runs I have seen.  I want to thank the 60 Enchanter, Cleric, and Shaman that came along, those buffs really helped.  I am sorry, but the names escape me, and I am at work so cannot look in my logs.  I want to thank Kakita (56 Cleric), that came for support.  We never used her so she just sat around trying not to look bored, but just being there gave me a lot of confidence in case things didn't turn out the way they did.  I also want to thank Rredd and Kyzzyxx from my guild, they both ran interference for me and helped me with organizing the crowd and keeping everything as smooth as possible.  Rredd also helped organize the buffline.  There are a lot more people that I am leaving out, but remember that your efforts are appreciated. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

I am soooo glad that other people are willing to lead raids like this, because I don't think I could do it.  So many times I just wanted to shout &quot;PEOPLE, JUST SHUT UP, LISTEN, AND DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD&quot;.  We could have all been out of there hours earlier if people would have done that.  However, that's something that is going to happen when you don't have people who are used to working together.<br>
<br>
I'm still boggling over the number of people who stopped at me in the buff line though... I guess they wanted those cool bard buffs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Not like I wasn't prominently holding a drum or anything...  For future reference, it seemed to help when Taybris moved directly in front of me, it might be something to think about in the future to avoid confusion among those who don't realize that holding a drum probably means someone isn't buffing.<br>
<br>
Another thing you might want to try in the future is to zone in one group at a time, and make sure at least one person in each group knows where they are going... even with a map, it's sometimes tough to figure out where you are and how to get from where you are to where you want to be if you're not all that familiar with the SolB (and apparently many people last night weren't).<br>
<br>
Oh, btw, I realized as I was camping last night that I'd forgotten to give anyone my raid fee... who do I need to get that to? <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
