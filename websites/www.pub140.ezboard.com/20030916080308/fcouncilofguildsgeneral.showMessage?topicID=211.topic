What I noticed upset me, I notice other member from other guilds on our raid who have there own Vox raids. This very much offended me and upset me. I noticed a Few from CoGF alliance with the Lore Guardians Tag. They have there own Rotation why is it that they can come on our raids. Isnt this a violation of KGC rules. This is just my thoughts.

Since many of the larger, higher level guilds were having trouble getting enough people UNDER level 53, the restriction against guests were lifted. As for that particular raid, the SB was having a problem getting enough of the right classes (i.e. enchanters, damage casters and necros) without which a Vox run is suicide. So I asked reps from each guild in the Sacred Band alliance to ask their friends who were of these classes to come help. Thankfully they did, otherwise we  (the SB) would have had to pass. <br>
<br>
It's only on larger, higher level targets, such as Venril Sathir, the gods, the Kunark dragons and Trakanon/Zlandicar that guests aren't allowed by KGC rules. <br>

Please, in the future, don't ever be too scared to ask questions.  I heard a Chinese proverb the other day that went something like this (I know this will be a slight misquote):<br>
<br>
&quot;He who asks a question is a fool for 5 minutes.  He who does not ask a question is a fool for a lifetime.&quot;<br>
<br>
All in all, I am glad that you did ask a question, but it concerns me that you didn't discuss this with one of your guild's own officers first.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to reveal who you are, I'd love to discuss any problems you may be having.  Also remember that other officers (with whom you may feel more comfortable) are there for you too. <p><img src="http://www.twilite.org/~chrome/images/sigs/eressig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kellory>Kellory</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Unguilded Sexless Drood</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/26/01 10:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=211.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guess on Dragon Raids</span><hr size=1> Hmmm...but what happens if all you do is question?

<br>
Anyway, I would say this probably is a good place for the question.  While I agree he probably should have gone through guild leadership, at the same time this is a question that tends to pop up a lot.  Not really surprisingly considering how messed up KGC can be sometimes.  After all, KGC is not held together by trust or friendship but rather more by mutual self interest.  The thing is this way at least more people who might also have been wondering the same thing but not willing to look silly by asking a question that everyone else obviously knew the answer to, now knows.  I'm sure Mack225 didnt mean any harm in posting his question here and it does reach (I hope) a larger audience.<br>
<br>
Anyway just my 2 cents.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think it more comes down to how MANY guests you have, how many of those are already on their own rotation and how many double or tripple dip if they can.<br>
<br>
There are many guilds/alliances that participate with CoG in planes runs that already have their own rotation slot so in escence detract from the loot that the true CoG'ers can get.<br>
<br>
Most if not all of these alliances are in a planes rotation already and I'm sure everyone knows of a member from them that goes with CoG on a regular basis :<br>
<br>
CGoF Alliance - in Vox/Naggy rotation<br>
-Circle of Friends<br>
-Lore Guardians<br>
-Celestial Knights<br>
-Sign of One<br>
<br>
TNO Alliance<br>
-The Silent Watch<br>
-Forever Knights<br>
-Nocturnal Reign<br>
<br>
AoVB Alliance - in Vox/Naggy rotation<br>
-Haven of Light<br>
-The Haven<br>
-Legends of Valor<br>
-House Al'Nasir (sp?)<br>
-Fury of Faith<br>
-Children of Virtue<br>
<br>
FA Alliance - in Vox/Naggy rotation<br>
-Lightbringers<br>
-Pact of Aegis<br>
-House Marr D'accep (sp?)<br>
-Phantoms of Norrath<br>
-The Watchmen<br>
<br>
CoK Alliance<br>
-The Valorous<br>
-Awahili<br>
-Drac<br>
-House Kendan<br>
-Legion of Divine Light<br>
-Shield of Kaladim<br>
-The Sisterhood<br>
-Wyrmlore Council<br>
-Champions of Thanatos<br>
<br>
SB Alliance - in Vox/Naggy rotation<br>
-Silver Daggers<br>
-Illuminatus<br>
-Fell Omen<br>
-Storm's Justice<br>
<br>
Now in all technicality I believe that if any or all of these combined make up over 30% - 50% (was an old post on KGC and couldn't find it) of the members on that raid then possibly you shouldn't be in the rotation.<br>
<br>
As Haemish pointed out, all set restrictions are waived for Naggy and Vox cause of there being a serious lack of people below 53.<br>
<br>
Question from me now (that I've been thinking about too long)<br>
- Does CoG have enough non allianced people to actually even run a raid on their own? <br>
<br>
The topic was brought up about expanding to take on more of the larger target Dragons. Sure we would have enough with everyone that goes now, but they would not be allowed to go SO.. do we/you (whichever way you look at it) have enough? Somehow I really dont think so. Alot of double dippers. And no since most of you are thinking I am being hypocritical right now, I will not and would not participate in both my new raids and yours.<br>
<br>
Interesting to read through that list though and see how many go to every raid they can.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Mack225, though its frustrating as hell to see people taking loot from your rotation slot, there are some targets their allowed to help with. Others you have the right to complain but its the officers choice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Afterall, I would have GLADLY put Zellex in my management team (who are exempt from the restriction basically) just to have him pull for us. There are always exceptins to the rules, it just depends on how often people like to be greedy and push them.<br>
<br>
*throws a handfull of change on the floor*<br>
More than my 2 cents so I'm sorry to step on feet.<br>

<br>
The KGC, for better or worse is there for 1 thing: Peace. Everyone wants some of the loot off of the targets the KGC does rotations on. Better to agree beforehand on who gets what when and avoid the bickering that can cause such server wide animosity. On many other servers, the largest or most uber guilds can and will control whatever targets they want until they are tired of them. Imagine wanting to get a piece of planes armour, and not being able to get into the planes because every mob there has already been killed every night this week by one guild. For the last 6 months. Expand that to the Kunark dragons or Venril Sathir. Imagine every time one of those mobs popped, your guild having to race to get 30 people together and get the mob killed before someone else did. Imagine KSing arguments over VOX. Picture the problems we sometimes have in the Oasis over KSing and magnify that 100 times because the mob being argued over drops godlike loot. It's that kind of counterproductive bickering that burns people out on EQ at the high levels fast. <br>
<br>
The KGC is a give and take situation. Larger guilds who could own the planes every day of the week give up a little time there in the sake of peace. Smaller guilds save themselves the stress and bickering and also get a shot at some targets they might never be able to get if other guilds didn't agree to not attack a target. Is it the best system in the world? No. It is a system of as Lagdalen said, &quot;mutual self-interest&quot; though not necessarily enlightened self-interest. It makes mistakes, and it gets people pissed off sometimes, but I think it works. And I think for smaller guilds of less than say 30 planes capable people, alliances in the KGC work best. I wish I could get every small guild that has been to a CoG dragon or plane raid that DOESN'T have an alliance into one, and that the CoG could move away from dealing with the KGC as an entity. Because I think it distracts people from the real goal of the CoG, events that aren't tied into lewtz, experience or items. Just plain fun. <br>

<br>
On a more serious note I would add that I'm not a fan of how KGC is run.  Mutual self interest is fine so long as you can agree on what best defines a compromise.  On the other hand it is a far sight better than the total FFA anarchy that happens on most other servers.  You really need to have played on one of those servers to understand the level of animosity that Haemish was talking about.  The thought of an how long a guild like Valoran (Sorry Lag just needed an example) could monopolize Hate or Fear is mind boggling.  So there is much to be said for KGC.  Still their insistance on frowning upon double dipping can really keep smaller guilds and alliances from ever getting to the Planes.  And I've said thats just the begining of your post 51 raid experience.<br>
<br>
For all of the guilds listed in alliances I can name dozens that are not planes capable and probably never will be.  This is in part because they are unable to field enough people.  As they gain planes capable players they lose them just as quickly to other guilds.  So can CoG actually field enough people just from their non planar/dragon capable guilds to run these raids on their own?  I would have to say probably not.  At least from the numbers and guilds that I've seen show up.  It seems that as soon as we get some good people something happens to put us back to square one.  Which pretty much sums it up for many other guilds out there as well.  <br>
<br>
Solution?  You've got me.  Run more raids perhaps.  Encourage people not to leave their guilds.  Take a firmer stance on guests maybe.  The last is hard since that would pretty much exclude everyone on my friends list (short tho it may be these days) and its not much fun raiding without friends.  And I'm sure it'd be the same for many others out there.<br>
<br>
One thing tho.  Expect things like this to come up a lot.  Like it or not many of our best and most experienced players are part of planes capable alliances or guilds and double dipping will happen, if for no other reason than when you need someone to cover your back you'll call for a friend.<br>
<br>
What was the point of all this?  Now that I re-read it I'm not entirely sure, but I'm too tired to redo it.  So take it as it is.  Sort of a rant sort of my own personal philosophy on this.  Perhaps if we too meditate on these facts we can learn some Tai Kwan Leap.<br>

To me, dragon raids and planes raids as they are in EQ isn't really (or shouldn't be) about the LEWTZ anyway. Lewtz, items, they are all just gravy. The fun of taking down a tough target, of having a battle that you just barely scrape through, THAT'S fun to me. Just mindlessly killing the same looking mobs over and over again hoping that the &quot;Stick of Insect Bashing&quot; or the &quot;Robe of Unholy Mooning&quot; will drop isn't fun, it's repetitive. Something I've always argued for in the KGC is doing the planes and other big targets for FUN and Challenge, not for equipping yourself with full planar armour, oh and the other 95 people in the guild as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  No offense meant to those who do this, but it isn't and shouldn't be what the game is about. However, to many people, that is all that killing dragons and raiding planes do. If that's what you like, fine for you, but it ain't what I like, and it ain't what I feel the CoG should be doing. <br>
<br>
So what if someone comes to a dragon raid and gets two pieces with two different raids? Big deal... did you have fun? Was the rush of blasting or bashing that dragon diminished in anyway? If it was, you probably don't need to go on a dragon raid, because you'd get better lewtz easier in places like Sebilis, some of the Velious dungeons, etc. AND you'd have a better chance, because you'd be rolling against less people. Honestly, from seeing the &quot;high-end&quot; loot coming out of Velious, once you get to a certain level of equipment, you CAN'T get any better... there just isn't any loot better than some pieces. SO then what? Once you have complete Dragon (Velious) or Kael quest armour, primal and/or epic weapons, then what? <br>
<br>
I'm rambling too, but my point is that once you boil down dragons and planes and other raids to the lewt, the fun factor goes WAY down.

And generally one that I agree on.  However, part of the problem is that &quot;fun&quot; really isny quantatative.  I cant go to my friend and show him all the fun I had last night.  Especially when they look at me and say, &quot;wow, and all I got was a cobalt bracer and heirophant cloak.&quot;  Lewt is part of &quot;keeping score&quot; and however immature and infantile it may be, thats still part of human nature.  We're all competative at some level.  Then there's always the point that getting the good equipment actually keeps you alive and helps ensure that you do contribute to the group besides just adding to their ping times.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying your wrong, in fact the fun of a raid used to be the only reason I tended to go on these things.  However, even I have to admit its begining to pall on me.  Spending upwards of 4 hours helping to organize and put together a raid, spending 6 nail biting hours getting them to DN and setup and running and trying to keep them alive, then another hour at 2am porting them all out can get tiring when you never get anything.  Perhaps its just burn out talking, but there is only so much fun you can have before it becomes more of the same.  After all, going to DN still is fun, but I dont go there anymore for the fun of it.  I go because friends ask me to, because I'm needed for some reason, and because there is always the possibility I might win a drop.  But fun?  Hardly.  Fun has become more of a by product rather than a reason in and of itself.<br>
<br>
In the end, at least in EQ, I think we're fooling ourselves if we think that fun can be an end all.  Its not, anymore than the phat lewt or level60 is.  They're all part of the same and as such have equal parts in the sum of the whole.  That means that we do need to take the phat lewtz into consideration when looking at double dipping in my opinion.  Especially on things like Dragon Raids.  Sure, that level 53+ support group makes things easier.  But thats 6 more people to roll against.  And really, they can only help buff and maybe clear.  For most people on the raid they have maybe 2 or 3 chances against each dragon, maybe, before they hit the level limit and probably never see the dragons again.  Is it fair to them?  I dunno.  <br>
<br>
I can also see it as being discouraging to other players as well.  Here you are, from a small guild and CoG is the only way you'll ever see a plane with members of your guild.  But you cant win anything because half the people you're rolling against are from planes capable guilds who are double dipping.  I can see people in that situation either giving up or switching guilds, neither of which are a good thing generally.  Now I would agree that we can ban double dippers from rolling, thats just not right.  Nor can we even run some of these raids without them half the time.  Which brings me to a new point.<br>
<br>
Is CoG really still viable?  Or have we simply become a second chance for people to get more phat lewtz while under the disguise of helping others?  If people think that we are still viable then I think we need to take a hard look at ourselves.  In point of fact, I suggest the next dragon raid have absolutely no double dippers and no 53+'s.  If we cant do it without them then I dont see how in the end CoG will be able to continue to do these raids and maintain standing in KGC.  Because if they do get upset enough about it they'll simply reinstate the ban on double dipping there.  Now as far as is KGC right or wrong in their idea of double dipping?  Who knows, I think its sorta irrelevant since there's nothing any of us can do to change it.  We can either abide by it, or really find a new server.  Perhaps it is possible to change it, but we wont be able to until CoG proves it really doesnt need the double dippers.  You cannot negotiate from a position of weakness and expect to be taken seriously, and however unfair it may be, you cannot suggest changes when you're the new kid on the block.<br>

There is plenty of double-dipping going on outside of CoG ... <br>
<br>
The only reason why CoG is more likely to get &quot;punished&quot; or judged for it because they / we are the only ones being completely open about our policies and procedures, with the inner workings for everyone to see. Honesty always comes with a price to pay.<br>

People only have what power others choose to give them.  KGC doesnt have any more enforcement powers than CoG.  However, to not abide by KGC is to return to chaos and anarchy.  Dunno, but I really wouldnt want to see that happen.<br>
<br>
Also I'd think it'd be easier to &quot;punish&quot; CoG than say AoVB or CoK.  KGC guilds dont have much to do with the smaller CoG guilds and probably dont care much one way or another.  They do have friends and stuff in many of the other alliances.  Plus those other alliances are a force to be reckoned with.  If they decide to break with KGC it could all come apart.  Can you really see CoG trying to KS Vox?  I doubt we could even if we tried.  Still, it's almost be worth the admission price to see something like that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I like to think I say things to make people think, and play Devil’s Advocate.<br>
<br>
I understand how you feel and the way you think Haemish.  Having fun in the game should come first.  Otherwise why play the game?  But let me point out a couple things.  First, the idea of “fun” differs from person to person.  Some may have fun by chatting with friends, or grouped with buddies taking on tough targets.  Others may have fun exploring the world, and others have fun finding new items.  And yet others have fun by getting phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I still think having fun in the game should come first.  But I also think that the items do come into play in having fun.  For me it is not fun to be under equipped at a large raid, dying constantly and being a drain on the raid’s resources.  Thus, I need items to have fun.  Even the CoG’s loot rules mirror this train of thought.  Example, the Cloak of Flames.  Only melees can roll on it.  Why?  So they can be stronger the next time the CoG takes on another large target.  Is it really fun to resurrect dozens of people at the end of the raid?  But knowing we only had 5 deaths on the raid is exhilarating.  <br>
<br>
In all this, I just wanted to point out that the lewt is part of the equation that equals fun.  What the rest of the equation is, I don’t really know.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think my biggest peeve about lewtz, and the biggest reason I want the CoG not only to not focus on them, but also to promote fun outside of them, is that of all the things people argue about in EQ, that causes the most conflict at the higher levels, is lewtz. I've seen guilds tear themselves apart (and I mean big and small) and friendships trashed over arguments about lewtz. If I could pick any single thing that hinders the growth of the MMORPG community in Everquest, it would be the need for lewtz that the EQ engine places on a character's effectiveness. Granted, it's a math game, but the math game is often more important than the tactics (i.e. see the levels requirements for Kunark dragons, the math gimmicks of rune on Venril Sathir raids). Items are all too often so self-oriented that people get downright backstabby over them. It hurts the community, IMNSHO, because it gives that nasty side of human nature, self-interest, free reign. ENLIGHTENED self-interest, means you want things for yourself, but you aren't willing to bury your dagger in someone else's back, and you ARE willing to give up something for yourself in the hopes that others will follow your example. <br>
<br>
To me, focusing on items turns this into fantasy Quake Deathmatch with everyone fighting over powerups. That's fun for Quake... it ain't why I play EQ. <br>

Sorry I was getting the feeling this was getting a tad bit too serious.<br>
<br>
But once again on a more serious note, I would have to say I'm not terribly impressed by Ash or AoVB.  More to the point...Ash who?  I had to think on this one hard, but I dont think I've ever grouped with anyone from them.  Could someone please refresh me as to who's in them?  AoVB.  Ummm...oh yeah the people I argued for 15 minutes with on our last VoX raid for 1 lvl49 enchanter who has been one of my best EQ friends for over a year because of double dipping concerns.  In fact that was a major I removed my application to The Haven.  (kay I wasnt actively pursuring it but...)  I'm certainly not joining any guild/alliance that will put restrictions on who I personally can help.  Now if I were asking for all of The Haven, that would've been something else.  But c'mon, 1 alliance member that we desperately needed that was a longtime personal friend?<br>
<br>
As I said before, fun is fun.  But Zatriz has the point that loot does also help in the fun as well.  And is it fun putting your xp on the line when you know that someone who isnt doing more than buffing is going to roll with you?  Or that the person next to you is going to go up against Vox next week with their own guild, but you may never see that dragon again due to the level limits?  Well, perhaps its irrelevent.  Perhaps for most people the dragons happen so rarely that it never stops being fun regardless.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder?  Hmmm.  All I can say about fun is, ask your guild who wants to explore DN.  After everyone says sure lets do it, tell them you're going to run through SG since you dont have a high level druid/wizard.  See how many are willing to go still.  Those are probably the ones who are in it for the fun.  My experience is that the numbers will be fewer than you think.<br>

<br>
First and funniest - in the patch they said they just made it more &quot;fun&quot; to try and get to DN. I'm assuming they changed the safe point to the little ledge inside and to the right to stop succoring. <br>
*snickers to herself, LOL and all the suckers that think succor is the only way through.*<br>
*blush, my guild included*<br>
<br>
Since everyone here seems to think its unfair let me explain why I wanted 53+ help on dragons. Not as much on Naggy but on Vox specifically, I've seen raids wiped cause a train of bears made it to the chamber. They were killin Vox just fine till 20 bears ran in and BANG, everyone dead. The 53+ers were support. The assumption was that they would only roll if they REALLY REALLY needed the item, since that is typically not going to happen I wasn't worried. In Ogun's case (since I know thats what you're all thinking with the eyepatch) yes he DID need it badly and I dont think anyone minded the stick rezzes, or clerical buffs, or quick rescue from the pits that night. Also note - he was the only Valoran of the 8 or so that came, to roll on anything that night and just happened to have a lucky roll.<br>
<br>
BESIDES - there was absolutely NO one that had the guts to stand up and say &quot;umm, I'm not really sure if I like the idea of bringin em&quot;. Everyone sat like mice, scared to pop their heads up to the hawk (of which I am not) and say they didn't like it. Far as I knew no one thought bad of it. And now you understand why we get no where. Just cause someone is the &quot;titular&quot; leader does not mean they are perfect, or experts or any other term you can think of. Without advice we are lost too. Past experience helps but only to a certain degree.<br>
<br>
I can guarantee you I have been killing these dragons longer than any of you to remain below 53. I saw many a raid with Jzonn leading. Thats back when Pippi was lower than me and Haemish was in his 30's or so *giggles, I gotta lvl*<br>
<br>
Point? SPEAK UP!<br>
<br>
Agreed Zatriz, everyone's view of fun is VERY different. And agreed Kellory, after a while, going and getting nothing has a tendancy to do nothing but tick you off and make it NOT fun. I've never won a thing from a dragon, so for those that are pissy they didn't win anything on the last 3 or 4? too bad, try complaining after about 20 dragons. But that still doesn't stop me from going and hoping each time.<br>
<br>
It's not as much the winning as that feeling as you've typed in /random 1 200 just before you hit the enter key lol.<br>
<br>
As to Double Dippers, agreed Pippi, we just get viewed more openly cause EVERYone can read our policies and loot rules. Then again I think you guys would find that CoG isn't as badly frowned on as you think. We actually do have alot of friends in there. Yes there are people from all over the place that go with us, such as I posted above. I can imagine all of you recognize numerous guilds from that list. But there are also numerous guilds that AREN'T on the Vox/Naggy rotation. For example Valoran. We do neither dragons. Sure we do the other ones but not Vox/Naggy. I have no use really for the loot they drop (though the eyepatch would be nice) so I go to see my friends. To those that gripe about Valo going.. why dont you try griping about people already killin em rather than one that has no chance against the 2 lizards. If anything it hurts.<br>
<br>
I still want to do stuff with CoG, unlike the rest that left, I dont feel like dropping off the face of Norrath to do other things. I don't forget who my friends are as easily as they did, so to be told &quot;you're a Valoran, get lost we dont need you&quot; which I was in tells last Naggy raid, I dont appreciate it and you have alot of other people you can gripe at other than me.<br>
<br>
I hate big long posts and I'm sure you hate reading em so I'll stop now. Think that was a bit confrontational but I dont have the energy to proof read it.<br>

That is so sad. I have from the moment the CoG was founded, asked, invited, and openly welcomed members from larger guilds, like Valoran, Grey Hawke, Shadowed Fates, etc. Basically, ANYONE, regardless of guild size, &quot;uber&quot;ness, whether you were in a guild or not. The whole point of CoG isn't to just provide those who CAN'T do dragons a chance, but also just to do them. I have never said no to anyone helping on a CoG raid... I've never sent anyone that was from one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds away because they were in a big guild. My first Mixer Hunt had a Grey Hawke member in it. I'm damn happy that Valoran members like Ogun volunteered to help the CoG dragon raids. Those res stick rezzes make things VERY easy. <br>
<br>
Only one time did I ever stop someone over 53 from rolling on a Vox raid, that was when Talovar came and helped us on I think our 2nd or 3rd SB-Run CoG Dragon raid. And if it happened now, I would let him roll. I actually regret NOT letting him roll that time. On my own dragon raids for the Sacred Band, I've encouraged 53+ people to come, let them roll, get buffed by them, and it makes a huge difference. <br>
<br>
The only reason I ever restricted any raid membership by guild was due to KGC restrictions on planes and dragons, which have largely been removed for dragons. <br>

<br>
In my book, I honestly don't care which guild anyone is in, each guild has good people and their share of total arses..  Just because someone has a specific guildtag over their head doesn't mean that they stop being an arse ..  just because someone has a &quot;good reputation&quot; on Karana doesn't mean that they stop being an arse. <br>
<br>
I have a hard time some times remembering which guilds you guys belong to - yea, that's a good thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
First off Lag my intent with these discussions were to get all the disagreements and arguments out now before they happen again.  However, they were never meant to accuse anyone of doing something wrong on the previous raids.  If I actually said so (I dont think I did, but I'm not sure) or even implied such then you have my deepest apologies.  As for not saying things sooner, well thats because I dont think during a raid is the time to bring up anything that can cause trouble.  And nothing causes trouble faster than people complaining about loot, especially if one of them is a group leader.  Oringally I never had any intention of going on that Vox raid and only attended because either you or Flarren had posted that you might need help due to not enough people potentially showing up.  I came not for the loot, not even for the fun or experience, but because someone I trust and respect said they needed some help.  So bottom line I didnt complain or say anything.  Perhaps I should have sent a private tell, but keeping everything going was kind of hard on that raid.  And the second raid, well Vox kinda poped up suddenly and I felt ideology and idealism needed to take a back seat to reality and pragmatism.  And while the person leading the raid isnt perfect, they do deserve every benefit of the doubt and they deserve the respect of not arguing with them.  And so I dont.  If you think thats a mistake on my part well, perhaps it is.  But for now it's still my own personal belief.<br>
<br>
My first Vox raid was in January of 2001.  Does that give me any right to say anything?  Perhaps I havent been doing it as long, but I think 6 months qualifies me for some public opinions.<br>
<br>
As to the whole Valoran situation well a lot of people just dont like uber guilds and those that belong to them.  I think thats a silly attitude by they exist.  Also a lot of people probably havent been on raids you've lead and so they're just looking at your guild tag.  I'm sorry they exist and if I knew who they were they'd certainly get more than a small piece of my mind, but you'll always have idiots like that and I'm sorrry but thats a price you'll have to pay for being in a large guild.  For me, I just remember how many of Zellex's raids Valoran has joined in on and rolled on, not to mention that Vox raid only to find out that when I went on a Valoran DN raid I wasnt allowed to roll on the black marble that dropped.  Now I understand the whole quest gem for the guild thing and all that, but I was asked to come over there and help Valoran recover their corpses in there and stayed because they were short of healers and died several times.  True, I didnt come for the loot I came because a friend asked me to so it didnt bother me too much.  But it shows me how the larger guilds think.  As far as I'm concerned individual members of Valoran are great, some are friends (I hope I can still count you and flarren as 2) but the guild as a whole I could do without.  And there are many who dont even bother to seperate out individuals.  Those people are sadder and poorer for their attitude, but they do exist.<br>
<br>
As far as excluding you I agree with Haemish, I think its sad anyone would think of doing so.  The two of you have earned a place here with blood, sweat, and tears by running raids when no one else was able or willing to step up.  That alone earns you a place on any raid that the KGC rules say you can attend.  And yes, I have so stated and told Kommisar that straight out the last time he asked me before Naggy.  We may or may not agree on everything, but thats life.  Friendship is supposed to transcend things like that, not destroy them.  I think discussion and even arguments can be good and sometimes theaputic, but at the end of the day we all need to remember the while this is a game it's played by other people not just ourselves.<br>
<br>
I wanted these discussions to be about how best to solve loot problems and how best to run and work these raids.  Yes, I've wanted it done my way, but in the end if I want things my way I should get off my lazy ass and run the raid.  But seeing as how people are begining to take things the wrong way (not necessarily you Lag) and these threads dont seem to be doing anything more than stirring up animosity and causing poeple to take sides, perhaps its time to just lets these threads drop.  Let the raid leaders make their decisions and let them be final.  If we dont like it, run the raid ourselves next time.  Just my thoughts anyway.  Feel free to disagree after all, historiclly I've been wrong more often than I've been right.<br>
