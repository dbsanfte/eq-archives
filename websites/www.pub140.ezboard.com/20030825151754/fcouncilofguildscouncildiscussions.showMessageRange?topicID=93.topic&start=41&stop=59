It was as though you wanted people to get ticked off at you.<br>
<br>
I will make this a short and simple post because obviously you didn't spend the time to read the long DETAILED posts prior to your flame.<br>
<br>
1.) If you go on a KCoG raid you agree to the rules and conditions that they have set in place. Don't like it? Don't go. Simple.<br>
<br>
2.) If you have never led a dragon raid, even been on one for that matter, than don't flame a Great Guy. If you are only level 24 in the past two years than obviously you aren't an Ubah PLYR.<br>
<br>
3.) Need before Greed. It is simply amazing how everyone else understood this, but you don't see it.<br>
<br>
4.) No one insulted the Bard. They did however prove him wrong when he flamed everyone that replied. If you flame, be prepared to be flamed.<br>
<br>
Think...No, really think before you reply. These are not that difficult. Everyone else who has joined KCoG has AGREED to this rules for the GOOD of OTHERS. Perhaps if you don't agree that is fine. But, don't flame people for it. Especially Farrn. He busts his butt time and time again to make a bunch of non-uber guilds get a dragon or plane. Now you gonna come here and bust his chops. Don't think so. How dare you sir. Get some experience under your belt then when you have something good to add come post.<br>
<br>
KCoG accepts all opinions and suggestions. If they didn't they would close the threads and say deal with it. But we as leaders/officers/kcog members have taken the time to TRY and help you understand the reasoning, but you just wont listen.<br>
<br>
Greed is disgusting... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But I think that this post was more of an attack on me, and just to make it look valid he threw in the stuff about KCoG.  I have a pretty good idea of who this person is, and if it is the person I am thinking of he probably doesn't care a whole lot about KCoG one way or another, he just wants to try and drag my name through the mud.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a little history of my guild.  Once long ago there was a Ranger in my Guild (I am not going to name names).  Apparently he is a pacifist in RL.  Someone in my guild (who didn't have a lot of tact, and has since been removed for an unrelated issue, and as far as I know no longer plays) mentioned something about the bombings in Afghanistan that were going on at the time, and the Ranger reacted almost violently to it, and went on a big campaign.  I tried everything to calm down the issue, from hand holding, to debating, to pleading.  When he left (after upsetting 3 of my officers to the point that they told me that if he didn't leave they would) of his own volition (aka I had not told him to remove himself, but probably would not have been far in coming) he had split the guild and done immense damage to both it and it's morale.  It upset me to the point where I all but stopped playing for over a month.  I told this person (despite what he had done to me) to let me know if anyone said anything to officers of his next guild, as I didn't want this issue to be brought to a head again and did not want any passing shots over it.  I have heard from him three since, blaming me for being kicked out of guilds (Note, I do not have him on my friends list or try to keep track of him in any other way, and two of the times he approached me I didn't even know what guild he had been in) because I had &quot;lied to his guild officers about me&quot; (again note, I did not know which guilds he was in, much less who their officers were, and I don't randomly tell guild history to strangers).  The third time a guild that was close to us at the time had recruited him, and then asked me about him (They approached me).  I told them that I had past history with that person (though did not specify beyond that) but that I did not feel it was my place to dictate recruitment policies for that guild.  Pretty venemous stuff eh?  The Ranger seems to be pretty paranoid (among other things), and doesn't feel shy about letting me know that he knows I am behind the vast conspiracy of the universe to harass him.  To be blunt I now have this person on my ignore list and haven't heard from him in months (and do not know right now what guild he is in, or care for that matter).  Add to that about a dozen people I know of know of on this server know that story, and less know that the Ranger has accused me several times of talking to guild officers, and it is not that hard to figure out why the poster seems to have a grudge/problem where I am concerned.  If it is not the Ranger himself, it is someone that only knows his side of the story, I will say that.<br>
<br>
As far as the accusations about not listening, well the fact that I am responding to every concern here says something.  Also the fact that former leaders (one of which who does not even play the game anymore) are reading everything and responding definitely leads me to believe that the posts are without a doubt being ignored (insert massive sarcasm here).  The fact that I do not agree does not mean I am not listening.  Again, I have to go with what is best for the group as a whole, and that means that not everyone is going to be happy.  I have explained this several times, other people have explained this several times, and there are not many more ways that it can be explained.  Part of being a leader is knowing that sometimes you have to make a call that someone is really not going to like, and you have to go with it despite the complaints.  I personally learned that lesson hard during the problem with the Ranger.  I do my best to please everyone, but it is an impossible job, so all I can do is give my best.<br>
<br>
As far as the all/all thing, it is very well known if you had done any research that Verant uses Templates for item creation.  Therefore you often see items that have a class listed, but no races that can be that class. Or you have races listed, but no classes that can be that race.  It is common to see that, and since they use templates that are that inacurrate that means that those aren't exactly set in stone.  Frankly most alliances and big guilds ignore the who can use it, except to make sure the class they are assigning it to can indeed use it.  Don't bother with that arguement, as it has so many holes it in it looks like swiss cheese.  And frankly, Lagdalen (who has a 53 Bard), and several others, including a 60 Bard, have all said they wouldn't use it, and that intelligence doesn't affect a Bard as much as Charisma.  Sure, Intelligence does help them to a certain extent, but not as much as Charisma and other stats.  And by the way, there are (from my knowledge, which about Bards isn't incredibly deep) 3 songs that use mana at all.  2 are charms, one is a damage spell with a ridiculous ratio.  Correct me if I am wrong about that.  So even with 10 intelligence, a bard will be able to play group songs just as well.  Not to say there are not times where those three songs cannot be of use.<br>
<br>
As far as the supposed misinformation.  Yes, I do tell people in my guild that zones are probably too high for them, occasionally I might be wrong, but I tell them what has been my experience.  I generally don't go shouting over zones things like that, but I suggest to my guild when I think that would be a bad idea.  On occasion a bad experience has left me with a wrong impression of a guild (zoning into a deep zone train, and thinking that those mobs were ent mobs, things like that), but generally my information is ok.  Frankly I don't know everything, but I do know more than average people, and I try to help people with that knowledge.  If you don't like my advice, don't listen simple as that.  Am I a stubborn bastard?  You bet.  Most people that are leaders in this game are, it is that tenacity that makes them leaders.  Go to leaders of various alliances and you will see the same trait in all of them.  So I will defend my points, and explain them and rehash them, and then explain them again.  That is how my mind works.  I like debate to be truthful, not so much arguement as debate.  Again, if you don't like it don't listen.  Do I threaten?  You bet.  I threaten people on my raids that if they do not pay attention or they do not follow orders they will be raid kicked.  I warn people KS'ing that they will be petitioned.  I warn people that camp steal and do other things of that nature that I will inform their guild leaders/officers.  Threat of retribution is what keeps people that want to ruin others gameplay in line, and I do not hesitate to use it.  Do I threaten just for the amusement of threatening? Nope.  I always use threats as a way to control how people act towards me.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I don't think anything said to the Bard needs to be appologized over.  Oh, and I did not drag SB into this.  I don't even know any of their people (except Rbecka who I only know very loosely).  I don't know where their boards are, much less post there about this.  SB was originally part of KCoG, and some of their members come back from time to time.  One of those that do apparently stumbled upon this himself, and reacted as you saw, and probably told others.  As far as I know no one from here actually brought SB leaders into this though.  As you see, most of these people that know me at all, know that your accusations are baseless.  I have defended myself to your accusations.  If you have something more positive to add to the conversation, go ahead.  If you just want to try to blast me more, then I am done with this thread.  Live with it.<br>

and thank you Lautrec but I am about the least 3l33t person you'll ever find from an uber guild. I'm not a kewl d00d, nor do I keep up with various boards everywhere all the time. I dont spend 10+ hours a day in front of a computer and I never bitch about other people's loot policies cause.. well I just dont care much about loot usually. What I DO do, is defend long time loot policies that are in everyone's best interests.<br>
<br>
yes this topic is dead, the only purpose that person hiding on their wizard, came here to do was flame farrn. The easiest source to do that was to use your post to do it. You wont garner support for your odd bardish idea's about loot on CoG it just kinda makes you look like a loot whore quite frankly.<br>
<br>
There are parts of this game that NO one can understand till they get there. When you are lvl 10, CB is still a nasty place. When you are 20, HH can be an interesting camping experience, at 30 you start going back to CB and realizing it was a complete pushover, by 40 you've graduated to DL level and can now hunt in it rather then dying in it. <br>
<br>
at 50 you're in the middle of dragon raids. At this point things go from a 6 - 30 min spawn up to a 7+ day spawn. Things become interesting and you find you need more then 1 group to accomplish things. in the lvl 55 range alot more of the game opens to you. By the time you hit 60, your view of targets usually drastically changes. Of course that depends on what size of guild you're in. I happen to be in a larger one but I dont ever forget I was part of CoG for a long time too.<br>
<br>
The difference between you and I lautrec is that I have been there, done that and accepted how it was for reasons given. I dont post unless I have a point to make that I have thought out and done at least a little research on.<br>

Don't condescend to me or my guild for your shortcomings. You should be ashamed. You certainly seem to have some rather elitist views... views that are certainly not needed in an organization that promotes fair game play. I came to post on this board a long time ago to ask a question about a policy THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF. How many times do I have to say this? Are you just too stupid to understand this? I did NOT want a flame war, but because of your actions and your asinine remarks, you now have one. I point the finger at Lagdalen and Lagdalen ONLY.<br>

<br>
Where the hell did this come from? <br>
<br>
Lautrec has most certainly flamed in this thread, and &quot;sheiagypsy&quot; most certainly flamed, insinuated and flat out made him/herself look silly. <br>
<br>
But just to reiterate. <br>
<br>
ALL/ALL items do not always belong with all/all. Some items just make more sense for one class as opposed to another class. Bards are somewhat of the exception, because of the number of hats they can wear. But, for the greater good, over the needs of one or two individuals, some of these items have been restricted. Again, if you can't stand that, please do not come to the raid involved. The raids are an opportunity for some to do something they may not otherwise be allowed to do. I think that's a good thing, and is worth all the heartache, stress, and insults I've taken over the years because of it. Leaders make decisions, and everyone else gets to armchair quarterback them. <br>
<br>
The CoG doesn't supress dissent; if we did, this thread would have been locked quick, Lautrec would have been banned, and that would be that. Should &quot;sheiagypsy&quot; or &quot;Lautrec&quot; want to continue with their insulting, flame threads, I will ban them. Consider that a warning. <br>
<br>
As for your scenario, Farr, it's amazing how much of a cancer one person can be in a guild. There are some folks that just can't get along in certain organizations. They aren't necessarily bad people (though some are), they just don't fit and don't know when to quit. Sounds like this was one of them. Unfortunately, they often drag others down with them, then leave them high and dry when the need arises. Be careful what you stand up for. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

<br>
It truly saddens me to see this type of thing. But, as we deal with people who are not only young IRL, some are just immature. Their attitudes, actions, and behavior would never work in the real world so they bring their immature behavior and whinings to the game. In doing so whenever a logical discussion approaches that other person is always the newb, or idiot. Logic isn't working here. I don't think that there is anything more we as a body can do to convince these two toons about anything. I think they are just getting a rouse out of us and they have nothing better to do. Frankly, if they want the eyepatch they can go to an online 'We Buy PP site' and buy 25K with their allowance money and go to the bazaar and buy it.<br>
<br>
Sadly these people will always be around. I've had a few in my guild. They take pleasure out of the game and basically should switch to a PVP server if they wish to be so blood thirsty for loot.<br>

I've wasted enough words on them. <p>Qamgine Nighteagle<br>

This has amused me to no end today.<br>
<br>
Although it did distract me from my planned anime purchase.  I think I missed the cutoff for my order to be shipped today.<br>
<br>
It was worth it though.<br>
<br>
The fact is, yes.  Lagdalen can sound elitist.  Because as she pointed out, the game changes.  Everyone I know claims it doesnt when they're below the level.  To be honest, I didnt really believe the game changed that much at 55 when I was 51.  Hell, I was doing ToV when I was 52, why is everyone saying the 55+ game is different?  They're just a bunch of elitist bastards right?<br>
<br>
Then I hit 55.  And I realized how right they were.  Yeah, I was still doing ToV.  I also didnt die much because I was starting to actually resist the AE's.  And I thought...the 60 game?  Whatever.  I'm playing the 60 game.<br>
<br>
I was so wrong.<br>
<br>
Then I did the old Vulak ring with some friends.  And learned what the 60 game is about.  The 60 game isnt about ToV or ST or VP or Trakanon.  Those are things to do and do often but it isnt the 60 game.<br>
<br>
The 60 game is XP grinding for 10 hours a day in places most of us dont even consider raiding in much less xp grinding.  The 60 game are things like the Vex Thall and places where the yard trash is red to a level 60.  The 60 game is so beyond where most of us are, we simply cannot comprehend it.  In fact, its so far beyond us, we think we can.<br>
<br>
Rotation mobs and targets?  Hah.  That isnt the 60 game.  If the mob/zone is on rotation then the large guilds are beyond them.  They put those targets on rotation so that they dont have to bother checking them and fighting to them.  So they can get on with their real game.<br>
<br>
Elitist?  Condesending?  Perhaps.<br>
<br>
But its equally condesending to pretend that that perspective doesnt exist or that its wrong to express it.<br>
<br>
If we have room for the little guy here, we have room for the elite as well.  And if we have room for debate, we have room for all sides of that debate.<br>
<br>
But there is a difference between debate and outright personal attacks and flaming.  One is okay, the other is not.  One can generate change if your arguments generate interest, the other only serves to ruin any chance you have at change.<br>
<br>
And remember, there is a difference between not being wrong, and being right.<br>

I have seen her die like 10 times on a naggy raid and each time she mem'd a nuke and ran straight back into battle with no regard for her own personal xp. I don't think she ever won a single item at any CoG dragon raid (correct me if I am wrong) and you attended one raid and bitched cause you couldn't roll on one item that was basically of no use to you at all.

<br>
Please do not continue on the way that this thread was going.  The first 5 6 posts were great, what we are looking for in discussion.  Sure, we didn't agree, but the posts were well thought out and clean.  After that it spiraled into a big flamefest.  Anything after page 1 is not even worth reading.<br>
<br>
Here is the big difference in what is appropriate, and what is not.  If you are making a comment that is directed at a specific person, then it is probably not appropriate.  Suggestions on class abilities are borderline appropriate.  Discussion (repeat, Discussion, not shouting matches) is perfectly ok and encouraged.  So please, if you are about to make a post that is a direct attack on someone, back away from the keyboard and do everyone a favor.  I mean this for people on both sides of this.  Discuss the issues, not the people.  If you are not sure where your post will fall, imagine that you are the person you are directing the person at, and think of how they will feel, if you do not know at that point, then don't post it.<br>
<br>
Again, please keep it to clean discussion, like the first several posts on this topic were.  Thank you. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

I explained exactly what I meant etc when I told you, Lautrec, that bards would never use it. 15int/wis face item would do you no good. An illusion mask (besides flayed barbarian skin mask) with those stats would do you better than this would. I'm 60 and charm/swarm kite a lot. Trust me 15 int would do nothing for our small mana pools and would be a waste. If you had won it, and used it, I bet you anything a few weeks later it would end up for sale in the bazaar.<br>
