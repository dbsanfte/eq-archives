The main reason seems to be the price of the coffin.  And I don't disagree - coffins are expensive.  The most common one to use is the jade inlaid coffin, at around 150-170pp.  <br>
<br>
But at level 57 (or on various robes and items), the component is a Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffin, at 40-50pp each, and they are stackable.<br>
<br>
When I look at the time it takes to grab a couple of corpses versus Summoning them for an immediate rez, especially on a time-intensive raid, I wonder why the coffins aren't used more often.  As I understood it, the raid fees cover such contengencies.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that some of the fees that have been collected be used to buy a stack of coffins, and they be used when they would save time - just to see how long a stack would last for KCoG.  I think there are a lot of raid leaders who would be very surprised at just how much time this would save - especially when you have just a couple of corpses down in the pits at Vox, or when a Fear break goes wrong and the whole party got zapped by imps.<br>

(barring a couple of tough spots in the pits for Vox)  I tend to prefer to get as many as we can without summoning, and save the money for times when we absolutely CANNOT get the corpses any other way.<br>
<br>
The other problem is that you aren't always available <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If we are stuck with a lower-level necro or SK to summon the corpses, then not only are we out more cash, but the coffins are heavy and not stackable, and that nice stack of tiny coffins isn't doing much good.  If we don't have the coffins with us, the call has to be made whether it will take more time to get the corpse(s) or to run out for coffins, and I don't think many of our leaders have enough experience to make a very good guess on that.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying I won't try it... as soon as I get my bank organized a bit to make more room, I plan to go buy a stack to have ready for the next dragon raid, and we'll see how it goes.  <br>
<br>
Have you found much difference in prices between merchants in various locations?  I've got the CHA, and can get the faction, to get best prices pretty much anywhere, but if base prices are better some places than others, I'll go there.  (I already know NOT to buy anything in OT, for example... even with good faction and CHA, you'll pay more than base price elsewhere) <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

Charisma does help.  And this is also the best place to get them mid-raid - just have a druid or wizzie bind and port to PoK, grab the coffins, gate back.<br>
<br>
As to the cost:  Again, I think it may be worth it just to summon when there are fewer corpses - as long as the person is in zone, this is done in seconds, with no risk whatsoever.  When time is a big factor (often the case on dragon raids), summoning 3 people will basically eat the fees for one group on a dragon raid, or 2 people for a planes raid.  And if the coffins are already bought and kept on hand by the RL, it's much easier to say just summon him and let's get going.<br>
<br>
And even if I'm not at the raid, you may want to try giving me a tell.  If I'm not on at all, just try to contact any necro over level 57 (or in a guild that does velious content regularly) - most necros will do summons for a raid pretty cheap, especially if the coffins are provided.<br>
<br>
Oh, and just to remind everyone - In order for your corpse to be summoned, you must be in-zone, and grouped with the summoner.  The summonee does not have to be close to the summoner, either.  This tactic is also used to move people between islands in PoA, when the raid doesn't have enough keys.  And when did the PoA keys become permanent?  just was wondering... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub140.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jgotbear11>jgotbear11</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://strike9.com/file.aspx?path=/jgotbear11/fullsize/Point.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8E9173>(8/8/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning corpses</span><hr size=1> Ohh am i not fast enough corpse getter for you high end people (dragon raids) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lol im just kidding.. but dragging corpses is fun for me an less money consuming.

Could we not take KCOG donations or have a fund raising raid on a zone to get the old raid fund up?  I think he is right, it would save some time in certain cases just to summon the corpse.  <br>
<br>

I've actually got enough overflow from the last few raids to cover a few corpses per raid, even with full-sized coffins.  We've been lucky to have Aliona around the past few raids, so we've used fewer peridots than we might otherwise have done due to MGB, which has helped the raid fund considerably.  Of course, if anyone wants to donate to the raid fund out of the goodness of their heart, I won't turn them down. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Also, if you do want to organize a fund-raising raid, it certainly wouldn't hurt.  We occasionally have people who forgot their raid fees, or were never told they'd need them, and it would be nice to not have to scrape to cover them.  For that matter, I'd like to waive fees for folks we specifically invite due to lack of necessary classes, but I'm not really sure we've got enough surplus to make that a policy yet.<br>
<br>
I think logisitcs is a bigger problem than cost in some cases.  <br>
<br>
In the past, I haven't had coffins with me when we really needed them, nor the cash on hand (since I normally haven't collected fees from group leaders yet and generally drop any cash over about 100pp in the bank before raids due to weight) to immediately reimburse folks who buy them, and if we need the full-sized ones, I still won't.  I'll just have to ask folks who buy them to get with me after the raid to be reimbursed.  I'm also thinking that me carrying the entire stack of pre-purchased coffins is a bad idea... what happens if I'm the one who needs summoning?  I'm thinking half on me and half in the bank at any given raid -- if 10 coffins isn't enough, we're in pretty deep trouble to start with.  <br>
<br>
Then we have to get the person to the zone.  Admittedly, that's less of a problem with PoK than it has been in the past, but there are times when that is an issue as well.  Unfortunately, this often comes down to paying attention and following directions -- at any given raid we have people who can't manage to /consent when told to do so, managing to get them to the raid zone when most of them have no clue how to get to Lavastorm without a druid is something I don't look forward to.   <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
I would suggest that if you have a necro on the raid and he has a couple of coffins on him... get it done faster...<br>
<br>
Alternatively...<br>
<br>
If you have a monk who knows what they are doing pulling corpses out of the pits then they can get the job done faster than a necro could get to the raid.  Drags by a skilled monk are pretty quick, having a necro/sk port run all the way across everfrost takes a while.<br>
<br>
This is all a part of the character of these raids though.  On Nagafen raids, you have a higher time to clear the path to the lair.  On Vox raids the path to the lair is trivial, BUT you always have some people fall in the pits.<br>
<br>
To REDUCE the numbers of corpses in the pits people could check the maps and actually understand what they are dodging on the way in AND could get better Magic Resistance.  Rredd was NEVER ONCE feared on a KCOG Vox/Naggy raid!  He simply met the resist requirements for melees and that was good enough with buffs.<br>

The night Naggy came out of his lair while we were buffing, we had at least one person either feared or running (I don't remember which) who got lost and died not knowing where to find her corpse.  While we were taking lots of time trying to find her corpse, most of the raid was sitting in chat wondering what the heck was going on.<br>
<br>
However, that's a VERY rare occurrance, and yes, as far as dragons go, it's mostly the pits around Vox's lair that we have trouble with, although we've mostly been able to get by without summoning so far.  I tried at our last raid to explain in advance exactly where the pits were, but unfortunately we still have to deal with that new &quot;feature&quot; that sometimes turns auto-run on when you don't mean to and have had one or two turn into the hallway and have auto-run take them into the pit at the far end.  (For future raids, I'm going to suggest people only use their mouse to move in that hallway, I don't think the problem shows up if you do that.)<br>
<br>
Really, I think in our last Vox attempt, we had more problems with the pits BEFORE we engaged than we did due to fears.  <br>

There's tons of space between the bears, so you can easily reinvis and never get agro (if ya can't FD). <br>
