I personally like the idea, just curious as to what others think.  I know it would help the raid leaders deal with what they have to deal with and not be bothered by the discipline problem while they are planning the next phase of a raid.  Just my 2cp<br>
<br>
I believe that it would help with the discipline of everyone involved if there were someone to draw a line in the dirt and say this is how it is.  IE, with the flag and people crossing...having someone say from the get go &quot;This is the fighting boundry, let the pulls come to where I stand, anyone crossing this line will get a warning...3 warnings and we'll see you next raid&quot; or to that effect.  Gets the point across, but isn't too commanding about it.  <br>
<br>
As far as order goes, that person could get down right mean if they had to, but only if they had to.  I have a few ideas/suggestions should this idea go through, and I'd apply for the part, should it be created officially. <p>Good Journies,<BR>

It's not fun when the raid commander says 3 times to NOT go sit on the throne, and as soon as the room is entered, 5 people go sit on the throne. The reason these things are so bad on raids like this is the immense amount of death that can result from someone zigging when they should have zagged. Nothing like a 4 hour corpse recovery, with 50 bodies layed out because you a few on the raid weren't listening to the raid commander. <br>
<br>
And speaking as a raid commander, it's a lot less fun running a raid when you have to repeat yourself 4 times to keep people from doing something that could get everyone killed. <br>

There has to be an action of last resort to remove disruptive players that refuse to listen to the Raid Leader. <br>
     I was on the last Naggy raid and was appalled at the lack of discipline of some players. These players need to know that for the good of the rest of those on the raid that there will be consequences for disobeying the Raid Leaders instructions.<br>
      People should know by now that these rules are not only for the safety of all involved but also to ensure a successful raid. enough said? <br>
     I think we should tryout a Raid Enforcer if for no other reason than to free up the Raid Leader to plan the raid and not have to worry about enforcing raid guidelines and strategies.<br>

It was hard keeping up with whats going on and then dealing with warnings as well. The whole problem is finding someone charismatic enough to disciplin without alienating themselves from everyone.<br>
<br>
On Vox a threat was required to get people to wake up in flag room. Something along the line of &quot;Fine, either you stay behind Kommisar where you are supposed to or I will be removing you right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the hate raid last night it took a threat once again to get people to start listening. I'm not completely sure yet why it was necessary but after the lack of listening skills I believe that woke some up. Something along the line of &quot;I didn't want this many people nor did I need this many people here. Either smarten up and listen or I WILL start removing people, and if you feel I cant remove you or want to get snitty you WILL NOT LOTTO&quot;.<br>
<br>
I dont want to do that, I shouldn't need to and really our best option might be to find someone to deal with just that. Joke or not, its a good idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Didn't know it was a musing for the raid enforcer, but I do like the idea a lot.  Again, I'd be willing to give it a shot or at least suggest some ideas I have on how I'd prep the masses.  <br>
<br>
I have a few games in mind to keep the people busy while the raid leaders go about doing their bit.  The games I have are geared toward Everfrost area (relay across the frozen river, Simon (Or in my case, Stoney) says, maybe even a mini-staggerfest.  <br>
<br>
With Lavastorm...especially that Lava part, things may be a touch more difficult to work out game wise.  May need to save those for Vox and just go over the discipline stuff for Naggy.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Stoney says&quot; thing would work not only to occupy the minds of the impatient, but to serve as a disciplanary tool as well.  By being able to get people to recognize the people involved faster, the more alert they should be when they see a /shout or piece of text with the raid leader attached to it.  I know it's a spam fest of not only words, but weapon emotes, spell emotes, and people talking in group.  If we can &quot;train&quot; the eye to see a name and recognize it through all of that...discipline should be a little better.<br>
<br>
What I have in mind is to take everyone aside...say to Sol A zone for Naggy run and do the Stoney says thing over there...that way the emotes wouldn't reach the raid organizers.  After a little Stoney says, I'd /shout something to the effect of...<br>
<br>
'May I have your attention please...I will be laying out some general info, so please pay attention.  To acknowledge what I've heard...after every set of info I give in the /shout text, stand up and sit back down'<br>
<br>
'Those of you not sitting yet, please do so now'<br>
<br>
'All those in attendence for the Naggy raid be sure that you have LFG on for the raid commanders.  The faster you do this, the faster they can get things started'<br>
<br>
'Everyone sitting here before me is a part of my stopwatch.  You can do nothing as a piece, but together you can make the watch work.  The better my watch works, the better and faster we can do our jobs'<br>
<br>
'In other words, the more organized we are and the less screwing off we do, the faster we kill that Dragon and the faster some of you East Coast guys go to bed.'<br>
<br>
'This will take time, people, so please be patient.  It will be well worth the patience in the end when we are looting that Dragon instead of looting our own corpses.'<br>
<br>
'Sorting out loot takes about an hour, hour and a half...pulling our corpses and rezzing can take in upwords of 5 hours if we don't kill that wurm.  '<br>
<br>
So if you have patience now, there's no reason we shouldn't be done about an hour after we kill the dragon.'<br>
<br>
'If you're impatient and decide to wonder off or not listen to the orders, prepare to either wait 5 hours after our rush, or find a way to get out of Naggy's lair alone if you can't stay up that long.'<br>
<br>
'For those of you that don't know me, I'm Stonescale Thulefist and I've been assigned the task of Raid Enforcer...I'm here to make sure discipline doesn't have a negative influence on the raid.'<br>
<br>
'From this point until I say otherwise, there will be no emotes or talking in channels other than /tell, unless its' to respond to raid leaders, myself, or people greeting the zone'<br>
<br>
'I assume you're all baseball fans, or at least have the concept of three strikes'<br>
<br>
'If you guys violate a rule laid out by one of the raid leaders, that will be one strike...three strikes and we'll see you at , understand?'<br>
<br>
'For the purposes of this raid, the raid leaders are your Gods.  I follow Cazic-Thule, but for this raid, Lagdalen, Flarren, and Creirwyy are my Gods...you will treat thier word as prophecy.'<br>
<br>
'If one of them tells you to sit, I expect to hear 60 butts hitting the ground in unison...if one of them tells you to jump in the pit of lava behind me...I expect to see 60 people getting up off their butts and bailing into that lava like there's no tomorrow.'<br>
<br>
'They won't tell you to jump in the lava...so don't worry, they will, however, be telling you to sit, stop at this area, pull back, etc.  If they say to back off, BACK OFF, if you choose not to back off, you'll get a swift kick in the leggings from me'<br>
<br>
'This raid is not a democracy, it's a dietic dictatorship, They are your Gods and they tell YOU how, what, and where without question or comment, just do it'<br>
<br>
'I am their archangel, thier messenger...treat my words as if it were thiers.'<br>
<br>
'To review, who are your Gods?'<br>
<br>
'If they tell you to jump into that pool of lava...what will you do?'<br>
<br>
'If I tell you to sit on a bed of spikes, what will you do?'<br>
<br>
I'd have a few commands set up ahead of time in hotbutton form.  &quot;Eyes up&quot; meaning shut up and watch your text...i'd use this if someone was going to make an announcement.  &quot;Watch your pets&quot; before every fight and after we move to a new area, and &quot;Listen to the lady/man&quot; depending on who is leading, it will be the appropriate gender.  I'll use that if people don't listen the first time around.<br>
<br>
This is all up for adapting, but that would give you a general feel for how I'd go about doing it.  I'd let some stuff slide before I gave a strike...verbal warnings i'd give at every lack of discipline though.<br>
<br>
Sorry this was so long...probably got carried away, but that's my pre-raid plan. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Good Journies,<BR>

The part that interested me the most was about spam.  The text box is only so big, and a lot of things are going to be flying through that little window.  And scrolling back to see what happened, while other things are going on, is a pain.  There are some things that can be done to eliminate a lot of that spam.<br>
<br>
-Turn off spells.  Not just affects, but you can decide whether or not you see &quot;Soandso begins casting.&quot;<br>
<br>
-Turn off other misses.<br>
-Turn off other hits.<br>
-Turn off NPC spells (might be part of the generic spells section up above)<br>
-Turn off NPC hits and misses.<br>
-Turn off all bard songs (so you don't get the message &quot;You mind clears.&quot;)<br>
-I think you can even turn off your hits and misses.  In the end, who cares if you hit or not?  As long as we kill the dragon.<br>
-NO emotes at all.  Ever.  This includes macros.  I think you can even turn off emotes.<br>
-Turn off guildchat and auction.  Might even go so far as to say turn off OOC, but that might be Raid Leader specific.  Some like to use OOC for group leaders only.<br>
-Make sure everyone has /shout enabled, and maybe even have them change the color to red if it is not already (provide instructions on how to do this).<br>
<br>
Doing all this will substantially reduce the amount of text that enters your window, and highlight the text that we want to make sure people read.<br>
<br>
Just more thoughts from a rambling mind. <p><hr>

Having assisted on the Vox Raid, I felt very frustrated on behalf of Lagadalen and her crew.  Though I was the loot co-ordinator, I was continually stunned watching people open and closing gates and doors.  It was impossible for the raid commander to keep an eye on everything.<br>
<br>
I think it's a brilliant idea, so that the others can do their jobs and do them well to protect us from death, and better yet for a successful raid.<br>

Even with that, stuff flew by pretty fast, I can only imagine what the Warriors go through during a dragon raid, at least with my set up.<br>
<br>
I'd advise that opponent's hits and misses stay on, at least for casters for spell timing...hard to get a spell off if you can't see that you're being hit or at least swung at...just my 2cp.<br>
<br>
Point being...the text can fly by and you can miss stuff...but you'd only need to say it two times at most if anyone is paying attention...that's sort of the idea of the eyes up line of text...to let people know stuff is coming...that way you should only have to say it once.<br>
<br>
If the Enforcer can get people trained to listening to him/her first...or recognizing the name for a set of commands, then the Raid Organizers can get their stuff in once the Enforcer calls them to attention...that's kinda the route I'd take it anyway. <p>Good Journies,<BR>

<br>
For starters I dont think the idea of a raid enforcer is that great of an idea.  In theory of course it is good, however these things are like communism, they just dont seem to work out in real life.  Anyone that knows me would know that I am a firm believer of discipline.  With the high level raids thats all that keeps the raid alive.  Now one problem is just that the raid enforcer would not have any real power short of telling someone they cant lotto.  I say this because it still rely's on that group's leader to kick the offending person out if it is so called for.  You're just adding in another layer of red tape here.  Raid enforcement in my opinion should be done by the group leaders with a final decision up to the Raid Commander, or maybe more likely the Vice Raid Commander.  Of course, this also has its disadvantages in that you now need 6-8 people who can keep control of their groups.  Not exactly the easiest, but I think we do have that number of people.<br>
<br>
Now the main problem is still discipline.  And the Raid Commanders having to repeat themselves multiple times is not a good thing.  What we need is not a Raid Enforcer but rather more like a guild enforcer.  What I think a lot of people forget is that especially on CoG raids you are not just representing yourself but your entire guild.  Your actions can impact other's feelings and thoughts about your guild and I think its high time we do something about it.  If guild members fail to listen to the Raid Commander on any raid then not only do we warn/disband/not allow that person to lotto for that raid, but also inform on this board and ingame that player's guild leaders and CoG representative.  If they fail to take action or they screw up on another raid (not just the next one) measures should be taken against that guild.  From not allowing the entire guild to attend or lotto on that raid to fully banning that guild from CoG raids for a specified time.  And of course if you dont have a guild you get your three warnings then appropriate measures are taken.  This seems harsh and perhaps even partially against what Haemish wanted for CoG, however, these measures are needed if CoG wishes to continue raiding.<br>
<br>
I say this because the game has changed since CoG first started.  A year ago Plane and Dragon raids were the end game.  These things were pretty much the biggest things a guild or alliance or group could do.  The only other large multi group target would probably have been the efreeti in SolB.  Then Kunark came out and raised the bar a bit.  The Kunark dragons are even harder and use different stratagies.  Many zones became raid oriented and pick up groups there non-existant.  Finally we have Velious.  Forget finding a group in the Dragon Necropolis or Sirens Grotto or Velk's Lab.  These zones are totally raid oriented and its bring your own group.  To do half or more of the zones outside of the Old World you need 30-60 level 50+ people all working together.  Failure can mean massive wipeouts that take hours to recover from.  You do not want to wipe out in the Halls of Testing in the Temple of Veeshan for example.  The game has changed and now the Plane Raids and Old World Dragon Raids are just the begining of your raiding career.  If people cannot show the discipline and courage on these raids there's no way they can go on other higher end raids.  And believe me most Epic mobs are easier than whats lurking in the shadows in Velious.<br>
<br>
This is not to say CoG cannot do these raids.   Zellex regularly does pickup raids to DN.  About once or twice a week in fact with generally only a couple of groups.  He has proven that if a group has discipline and they are willing to die once or twice in pursuit of a sucessful raid then you dont need &quot;Perfect&quot; groups and you dont need to be lvl 55+ to be in many of these places.  Its all about discipline, courage, and a willingness to do new things and try new stratagies not for the good loot, not because its efficent or because you want a lot of xp, instead it's all about having fun and doing something other than camping LGuk or Karnors or Old Seb.  There is no prize for being 55+ or being the first in your guild to level 60.  I will honestly rather have a lvl38 cleric with just revive who knows what they're doing on a raid than a level 60 with a rez stick that thinks the rules dont apply to them.<br>
<br>
In the event this post has gone on quite long enough.  The main point is we dont need a Raid Enforcer nor does the Raid Commander have to be a dictator and the Right Hand of Innoruk.  We need group leaders who know what they're doing and we need group members that will do as they're told.  If necessary they get their three strikes then they and or their guild suffer the consequences.  I would not want to see this happen.  CoG Raid Commanders should not have to implement any kind of discipline rules.  But we will never be able to continue to the higher end raids if we dont have better discipline.  It comes down often not to the skills and leadership abilities of our Leaders but rather the discipline, Vision, and courage of our raiding party members.  To use a cliche you are the weakest link.  We should all be having fun, whether just a party member, a group leader, or a raid commander.  And if people refuse to listen and refuse to learn then eventually we will stop having these raids since the leadership will not put up with this level of stress indefinitly.  In the end its all up to each and everyone to rise above themselves and think of others instead of just themselves or their group.<br>

<br>
The group leaders should carry more responsibility with the raiding, I agree.  Downside is it's hard to take 50 people from all walks of life in various guilds and pick the leaders out of that group.  I can't recall who was picked at Vox for group leaders...i'm guessing FoF members, but I was only in 1 group out of the 10 there.  Anyway, to successfully pull of having disciplined raid leaders, they would have to be screened and/or chosen before hand.  That way the raid leaders would know that those people are reliable and wouldn't have to worry about keeping an eye on someone they just picked out of those that show up.  <br>
<br>
Great idea, though hard to impliment with the guilds of the size that the CoG has.  If FoF wanted to pick out of their guild, they'd have to make sure everyone that they'd like to run a group was there and have a list of back ups should someone or a few don't show up.  I don't know how big FoF is, but for most guilds that stretches them pretty thin.<br>
<br>
My vision of a raid enforcer would be basically a glorified group leader.  Just a half step above the group leaders in authority, but not someone that would make decisions like &quot;he won't loot&quot;, &quot;she's not going on the next dragon raid&quot;, etc.  As Kellory put it, it would be a little red tape, the enforcer would ideally pass on delinquint actions to the raid commanders based on either what the enforcer saw, or what someone tells him happened (like a group leader).<br>
<br>
I do agree with the long range discipline...someone continuing to be rude or just plain not listening should be punished accordingly.  I don't know how well I personally like the idea of punishing a guild based on one person, I know it would take something extreme to do so, but as I've found myself a few times, some guilds just have bad apples, plain and simple.  This would take some paperwork in taking notes of who screws off and passing that word along, not troublesome, but an added and probably necessary step.  Point being, this area would have to be case by case basis.<br>
<br>
As far as efficiency on raiding...yah we can do a lot better.  Twenty to 25 well disciplined 45+ chars can take out Vox with minimal casulties.  Witnessed it myself.  I forget the name of the guild, but I was camping the preacher in Perma and they took out Vox with 3 deaths.  I'm sure they were equipped to the teeth and had many dragon kills under their belt, but if they can do it, why can't we <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I'm not suggesting that we strive to do it with low numbers of people, more increase our efficiency on Uber raids.  Discipline is a big key to that, as i'm sure anyone can figure out.<br>
<br>
As far as Uber zones, yah, i'm sure we can hit those too.  Catch is we'd need to get everyone more disciplined, which is proving difficult, but I think the Vox raid was a step in the right direction.  Once I hit 46, I'll see how the plane groups differ in discipline and see if I can suggest any changes.  People that just don't listen seem to be the killer, though successful raids have been done with those that just don't care.  <br>
<br>
Something has to change in the discipline department if we wish to be able to move on to bigger and better things, just a matter of putting our heads together to figure it out. <p>Good Journies,<BR>

In serious enough cases, I would report the problem to their guild leader directly in tells or if I didn't know their leader, to an officer of their guild. The people I did this to didn't return to later raids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for maintaining a list of troublemakers, I've always been against that. I don't like blacklisting people. It leads to personal attacks and flame wars on the boards, and that's something I've always felt was counterproductive to good open discussion, which is what the CoG is about. Discussion. <br>
<br>
As for larger scale encounters, other than the PoG, I really don't think the CoG should pursue them. They tend to degenerate into item hunts, and items are the LAST thing that an event should be about. I think the CoG dragon and planes raids already attract too many item hungry discipline problems as they are. Thankfully, there are enough disciplined people as well that most of the time it evens out, such as the people who've posted on this thread. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

However, the beauty of CoG is that they dont have to.  The diversity of CoG means that the Raid Commander can take one or two really good people from each attending guild.  Every guild has at least a couple of leaders in it.  This allows decentralization of the leadership positions.  Each guild begins to gain a little bit more and more experience in these large raids.  It also helps them to understand the stress and problems and joys associated with a raid.  And understanding is always a good thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Now as I said there are downsides.  Primarily is that you do need upwards of 10 people.  But as I stated, we should be able to handle it.  In general each CoG raid has at least 10 people attending who are experienced and level headed and able to lead raids.  You do not need to draw them all out of 1 guild.  I agree that guildchat is a wonderful thing.  But it is hardly necessary.  Shout and OOC all do about the same thing.  If you miss something in one of those, then you'll likely miss a guildchat.  Not to mention thats just one more channel the raid leaders need to monitor.  I dont think that guildchat offers enough advantages to offset the disadvantage of an additional channel to monitor as well as the possibility that you'll end up using less experienced people for group leaders just because they're in the same guild as you.  Diversity of experience is a good thing, and as I said one of CoG's biggest advantages.  No other guild or alliance on the server can potentially match CoG in the numbers it can draw or the skilled people.  And I believe giving those same skilled people leadership responsibilities will help draw them back which will only strength future raids.<br>
<br>
And experienced and good group leaders would seem to me to obliviate the need for a Raid Enforcer.  All problems are then handled within the group and then kicked up to the Raid Commander for final decisions if needed.  Unity of spirit and purpose comes from within small unit organization.  It cannot be imposed from the outside in my opinion.  Micromanagement of the leadership will only result in more hassles and less efficency.  Choose good leaders, give them responsibilities, and let them go.  All the Raid Enforcer would do is to do the job of the group leaders in maintaining order, except they would have to handle upwards of 60 people instead of just 6.  It would also mean group leaders would not have much to do besides form the group.  This will not help the overall goal of growing new leaders by giving them responsibilities on raids.  In order to hit the larger targets CoG's discipline must get stronger and you do that by growing leaders who understand their responsibilities to a raid, not by becoming a dictator and telling everyone to step first with the left foot.   <br>
<br>
As for guild responsibility that kinda worries me too.  But in the end something has to happen.  Guilds will be allowed the chance to fix any problems.  If its only 1 or 2 bad apples the guild should be able to either talk to them, or in extreme situations boot them from the guild.  We have guild representatives here with email addresses, reporting problems should not be a difficult task, distasteful tho it might be.  Failure of a guild to respond to our concerns would indicate to me an unwillingness to play by the rules that bind the rest of us.  Which in turn would indicate that the problem goes beyond just a few members of that guild.  And I would note that under this system those of us who are not guilded have even less chances.  Because we have no guild, messing up a three or four times will result in suspension without any more chances.  A guild is supposed to be more than just a powertrip and a system for powerleveling.  There are distinct advantages and privlages that come with being in a guild, and with those perks comes responsibilities.  All the guilds who have joined CoG have agreed to the principles behind CoG.  It becomes their responsiblity to enforce that on their members or face the consequences.  CoG is not an enforement body, therefore enforcement must devolve to the individual guilds that make it up.  If a guild is willing to allow its members to consistantly endanger a entire raiding party and claim its not their fault or fail to do anything about it then they need to seriously re-evaluate their role in CoG and indeed in any alliance they may be in.<br>

I guess I took too long posting my previous comment.  Heh.<br>
<br>
Anyway, while in general I do agree with you and your ideas Haemish, I feel I need to disagree with your belief that Plane and Dragon raids are all the raids CoG should do.  As I understand it, one of the major concerns people were having was that their higher level people were jumping guilds to larger uber guilds and so they werent growing very much.  This problem will remain as long as we are limited to the lower end raids.  And make no mistake Planar raiding is the easiest of the types of raids out there.  Plane and Dragon raids are no longer the end game, now the end game is all about raids, but raids on the Dragon Necropolis, Kael Arena, ThurgB, Howling Stones, Chardok, Velk's Lab, Temple of Veeshan, Sirrens Grotto, you get the idea.  These raids are all generally more complex than Planar raids since many require you to dungeon crawl.  If you want to take on the rat city in DN for example you do not stop moving.<br>
<br>
And it isnt all about items either.  In many of the velious areas, items are good and they are very nice, but they drop very randomly.  Sometimes you'll have 3 or 4 chetari wardstaffs drop in a 4 hour DN raid, other times you'll see only velium weapons.  These things become more about the experience and fun of going since there's no mobs to camp for specific items.  If there are people who are only interested in the items then they'll soon stop coming and you'll be left with the people who are there for a good time and to go where they've never been before.  To experience new things and try different stratagies.<br>
<br>
If CoG does not step forward and try to offer these experiences to our members, then they will go elsewhere to where they can get them.  Although I'm not part of any guild on Karana, I would hate to see many of the smaller guilds either break up or fail to grow simply because they keep losing higher level players to bigger guilds.  I too would like to see more drunken races across Norrath, chessgames, and the like.  But no matter how you look at it, raids are what the post 50 game is all about.  And I see no reason why CoG cant sponsor both.<br>
<br>
As for blacklisting, I too do not particularly like this idea.  But for there to be discipline there must be some sort of enforcement mechanism.  If CoG is not going to do it (and I agree it shouldnt) then this must be left up to the individual guilds.  (Check the earlier post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  And I agree that in general those who mess up dont come back.  However, I still see people messing up, and often they are part of the same guild.   And really I'm not talking about blacklisting I'm talking about suspending them from CoG raids for a period of time, say 1-2 weeks for first offenses.  Its harsh, but people or guilds who are causing raid failures or wipeouts cannot be tolerated.  If you want to see CoG do the fun things you must also help them do what they want to do.  And successful raids are part and parcel of that.  If that means we need to make sure that guilds police themselves, then perhaps thats what we have to do.  I agree with speaking softly and carrying a big stick, but eventually the big stick must come out otherwise all you're doing crying wolf.<br>

They just don't have enough firepower to take on stuff that big.  The TZ chapter of the Peacekeepers ended up mergering with another guild to be able to accomidate for the 50+ population of the guild.  They were about 50-60 in membership...i'd say 90% of that were above 40 and most of that 90% at least half were above 50, and they still couldn't do very many dungeon raids, mainly due to getting everyone together with the time they had.  They took out some Uber guards and things I haven't even begun dreaming about, but as far as DN, Velk's Lab, Howling Stones, etc, they couldn't muster up the numbers to pull a raid off.<br>
<br>
Point being, VI hates small guilds.  Of course they'll contest that to the very last letter, but the way the game is set up you have to have a large, capable group of people to pull off most of the high end zones in the game.  Most people would like to keep raiding to a guild or alliance, and even then it's still tough to pull off a raid of that scale.<br>
<br>
The CoG provides an answer of sorts for the small guilds out there...gives everyone a bigger pool of people to draw from, and as it is now, sometimes too many, but at least there's a chance to take on high end creatures.<br>
<br>
I don't know about limiting the CoG to the planes.  I totally understand the item hungry people would be first in line and there would be a lot of them, but for those of us that see the items as icing on the cake, rather than the cake itself, hitting places like DN, CoM (i know it's much lower), Old Seb, etc. would be a lot of fun and something that most smaller guilds, like mine, wouldn't be able to do without some help.  <br>
<br>
To do this or even go about doing this, we'd need people to run stuff.  Right now we're pretty short on volenteers, though I'm sure there are people out there that would love to attend a raid.  I know Lag and Flarren are probably stretched pretty tight with times running both dragon and planular raids.  They'd probably do a great job elsewhere, but I know from experience that running raids can and usually is very draining.  <br>

If we could train and teach people how to run raids, then we could do things like DN without spreading our resources too thin.  I know I've been slacking a bit in the Mixer event area, not that it's required, but being a guild leader is a big job in itself, let alone stacking events on top of all of that.  I'd love to run some more events...and once I get moved and settled I'll continue to at least try to hold them.  Only way to get good is through practice, and practice I will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
I need to start hitting some dungeons and learning the layout, that'll help for later runs, and I'd suggest finding people that know dungeons to at least volenteer for a leadership position, not necessarily a raid organizer.<br>
<br>
I guess the point of all this rambling is to say that the CoG will be capable of doing larger scale raids, but not untill we solve some basic fundementals...ie discipline, finding more people to run raids, etc.  Basically getting the raiding part of the CoG more organized and running a little more smoothly.  We're doing well as is, but there's always room for improvement. <p>Good Journies,<BR>

If CoG is meant to help smaller guilds then running other types of high end raids will become more and more important.  Not every guild has enough people or even friends to pull off large scale raids.  Not every guild is in, nor may want to be in, an alliance.  And even those that are, many cannot do these raids either.  I'm not interested in turning CoG into an Uber alliance.  I want more people to go out there and have fun.<br>
<br>
One thing tho is that you do not need to be 55+ for most of these little adventures.  DN can be done with just 2 groups.  No, you wont take out zlandicar, but you can do the tunnel and walk aways with both a nice look at the zone as well as some very fun fights and if you're lucky some nice loot.  As for levels, 50-55 works fine in here, and even sub 50.  I first went there with zellex at 49.  I'm sure if you dont mind potentially dying once or twice and have some courage even lower is possible.  If I had the chance I would certainly have gone in at a lower level as well.<br>
<br>
The thing to remember is that if you are willing to die some with or without rez, then no where is closed to you.  I made 50 3 months ago, and am now just 1 yellow into 52.  And thats with almost constant playing and raiding (I did take 1 weekend off for a anime convention in seattle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I may not have leveled much, but I can tell you I had a hell of a good time.  Yeah, my equipment makes most level 40's laugh, and many of my friends are now between 3 and 5 levels higher, but I have been and done things most people would say are impossible at my level.  I've run through Hate naked, as well as Sirens Grotto (Thanks to zellex showing my the way), I've explored ToV recently and been to most of the zones in the game (I will get the VP key one day!).  None of this is meant as bragging.  These are all pure statements of what can be done at any level if you are willing to take some risks.  If you are then the high level game is open to you at almost any level if you know what you're doing.  If you are not willing to risk, then much of the game is closed to you.  So perhaps our problem isnt so much making more raids and showing people how to do it, so much as changing attitudes?<br>
<br>
Now theres a thought to mull over.   How many risks are you willing to run to have fun?  And just what is your definition of fun?  Is spending 6 hours and 2 deaths to see a new zone fun?  Hmmm.  Now that might be interesting to find out.  Heh, I see a new thread coming up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'll keep it short if I can.<br>
<br>
To me a raid enforcer would be more of a taddytale position so I can keep track of who is doing what. I cant be everywhere and see everything and group leaders dont always have the &quot;infulence&quot; to control a group even if they try OR, they try and deal with it and it doesn't get to the commanders attention (this one happens more often that not so I never know who to watch). Anyone thats sent me a tell durring a raid can attest that it usually takes me a while to respond, I'm not necessarily a fast typer and I stare at the keyboard so I have to constantly scroll back up.<br>
<br>
Group Leader wise - for me personally I choose group leaders that I know have experience where we are going, preferably FoF yes, but not a requirement. I know the limits of my mates just as they know me and I wont ask them to do something they dont feel they are ready for. At the same time there are a few of you out there that I trust implicitly to do what I need on time and thats why you have been asked to fill positions here and there. I would not hesitate at any time to choose any of you again.<br>
<br>
Guilds Responsibility - possibly yes possibly no. Its unpleasant enough to deal with someone sending me a complaint about one of my guildmates but being an officer its my job to deal with it. On the other hand it must be reasonable. Lets say I get 2 KS complaints. One is off an orc pawn in Gfay and the other is the AC in OOT. Obviously both parties are greived but the AC would be the only one I was concerned with unless it was a repeated KS by the orc pawn person. There is only so far you can hold a guild responsible for its members before its forcing them to remove a person just so they can go on stuff. What if the person we want gone happens to be the GL's nefew? Not pretty and now you have alot of pissed off people. I would rather keep it to individual faults myself.<br>
<br>
New Raids - There are times that I lay awake at night regretting volunteering to run CoG. I'm figuring its cause I'm a woman that people ignore my shouts. I've accepted that now though, but there are other days, like when we were standing over Vox's corpse that I was really proud to have had the guts to stand up and say &quot;sure, I'll try&quot; *note - not &quot;sure I can do it&quot;* As to opening CoG up to more raids, it wont be by Flar and I sorry. Our baby is crawling and pulling herself up on furniture now, and leading even dragons is a major hardship right now. To be honest - yeah sure we have the people to do it BUT, the people here are not used to working with eachother, dont understand eachothers habbits, quirks and manerisms. Some things that their guild puts up with, others wont (like me with emote spamming and swearing). When style gets cramped and you're not in familiar territory things start going wrong.<br>
<br>
Yes bravery is a big problem. Gating out of Hate cause &quot;omg I'm gonna die on break in&quot; is not the brightest of tactics but that person learned the lesson. People stopping at Naggy's door going &quot;I ain't dyin one more time, forget it&quot; well heh, I still remember you. Expanding to do more raids could be asking for a hefty corpse recovery. I'm just as curious as any cat out there adn am more than happy to explore, but most aren't. Most stay with whats familiar cause its exactly that, familiar. Good luck to anyone starting up DN, SG, SC or any other raid. I'll be the first to admit I wont envy your job and you know I'd stand behind and support you as much as possible though.<br>
<br>
I took too long.<br>

If there's enough support out there for high end raids, by all means there's a way to do it.  Just a matter of finding out how.  I don't believe in impossible tasks (not suggesting high end raids are)...it's all in finding how to do it.  Given, a human can't run at 70 mph, but one can drive that fast.  A jet can't fly warp 1, but eventually, some sort of craft will be able to travel at that speed...at least the theory has been proven mathmatically.  A 55+ dungeon raid will happen...just finding someone to do it.  I wish I was high enough to volenteer and I would, but i have 11 levels to go <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
This topic is pretty much fizzled out...so as far as raid planning, we should start a new thread.  In pursuing the raid enforcer, we managed to open up some topics that obviously need some looking into.  Not saying we can't do it here, but it's hard to discuss event planning and management with everyone under the &quot;Dragon Raid&quot; forum...hehe<br>
<br>
I've said my 2cp on the Raid Enforcer, so i'll leave it up to the management of the raids to decide what to do with the idea.  If ya like it...I'm all for applying for the spot.  If ya don't, then at least we discussed the idea (quite thoroughly i might ad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
If ya need help with future raids, I'm always willing to help.  May not be able to run one, but I'll find a way to try to smooth things out somewhere along the line.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the little one Lag and Flar, I know 3 times over how much fun that can be.<br>

I stopped attending CoG raids a good while before SB stepped down.  My reasons are my own, but primarily it was because I had other avenues for raiding and did not wish to seem to be a &quot;raid hawg&quot; at the time.<br>
<br>
I have not attended a CoG raid since then, but I have quietly followed the progress.<br>
<br>
I've also had the pleasure of being on a raid with Stone and many others, whose names I have seen here.  My heartiest recomendations to these people.<br>
<br>
As for a raid enforcer.  Good dea that has workable solutions, however, it will turn into a bureaucratic nightmare on you.  You'll get smashed with the following:<br>
&quot;Why does wallywanka get to be enforcer?&quot;<br>
&quot;Slaphappy Dominatrix removed me for no reason!&quot;<br>
&quot;What a suck up!&quot;<br>
&quot;Children telling other children what to do!&quot;<br>
&quot;She is just gettin in good with the leaders.&quot;<br>
You will see such assinine bullshit concerning some one with this kind of power.  whats more, if you intend to have the Enforcer &quot;tell on&quot; the offender, the leader is not going to be able to focus and concentrate on far more important matters at hand.  Like leading the damn raid.<br>
<br>
The problem is respect and discipline.  In all the raids CoG has had problems on, I have many friends who have attended, it has been few mistakes my leaders, and more about raid discipline and respect or lack there of for the commander.<br>
<br>
Why is it, that guilds that raid dragons on their own have this sort of thing ironed out and have so few problems?  Experience and having worked together before, OR, they respect the Command body enough to comply with each command straight away.<br>
<br>
The members are more concerned with their team mates than their socialite standings and just how many people they can have looking at them at any given time.  They are  not more concerned with popularity contests and witty assinine comments.  These types of people, that do the crap I just listed,  are a very real reason I do not set foot onto CoG raids anymore.  Sick to death of people who either cannot read, refused to read, or are just plain too damn stupid to follow commands. People more concerned with &quot;why dont I get to roll&quot;  and &quot;this is taking to long!&quot;  &quot;When do we roll?&quot;  &quot;huh huh when do we lotto&quot;,  I got much better things to do with my time than babysit several 20somethings without a clue.<br>
<br>
Now then.<br>
<br>
How to fix it.<br>
For your next series of raids, invite 1 rep from each guild you think will attend. They are observers and are NOT grouped together. These people simply write down the names of the people who do not follow commands, who break the rules, who shout, or spam or in general cause disruption and are a liability to the raid itself.  These lists are then compiled by the management body after the raid, any name found twice or more on this list, is publicly named here on this forum, and forthwith removed from ANY future CoG raid of any type.  You can warn this person one time, if you like, personally if you have not read or cannot understand the rules for CoG raids you neither deserve a spot, nor are you capable of handling it anyway.  Learn discipline, it ain't hard.<br>
<br>
Do this on 2 raids, and yer discipline problems will be fully resolved.<br>
<br>
<br>
