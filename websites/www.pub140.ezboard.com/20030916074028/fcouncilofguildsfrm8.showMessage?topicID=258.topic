Seemed like everything kept going wrong there.  We came up the last few slots in the rotation in days instead of weeks, and I think a lot of our problem getting people there was that most did not realize we were due up.<br>
<br>
When I got to Lavastorm there were 8 people there, and 11 people in channel.  People started sending tells out, and right before I was about to call it we managed to get enough people that it was doable.  We had as I remember (at work, so don't have my notes on me) 34 people there when i formed groups.  What I felt made this doable was that we had 5 wizards there, to make up for a slight lack of melee, and I felt that the wizards could do enough damage that we could get away with skimping a little bit on the melee/healer backbone.<br>
<br>
We actually started zoning in at 10pm, which is really late for a raid.  The support group lead by Jeyct went ahead to start clearing giants, or if necessary to get ready to pull them.  Unfortunately someone had already killed the giants, so the support team went further in to scout, when all the giants started popping behind them.  Lousy luck, and the support team didn't have much of a chance.  We managed to recover from that, and fought our way through the freshly repopped giants to recover everyone's corpse.  The monks did an awesome job splitting the lair, and pulled all the giants without Naggy without a single death from the pull.  Omegag did a great job doing the gruntwork organizing the buffline, though we both learned a lot from the process.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately by this time it was getting late, and we lost several people, I think that we actually assaulted with just under 30 people (and we lost 3 of our 5 wizards).  We got Naggy down to under 20%, but after that we had just lost too many people, and couldn't sustain the fight.  It was a heartbreaking loss.  I think Naggy might have actually dinged <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  See <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://gucomics.keenspace.com/d/20000920.html">gucomics.keenspace.com/d/20000920.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for a screenshot.<br>
<br>
I want to thank the Monks and Clerics that did an AWESOME job with corpse recover, it was handled fairly quickly and efficiently.  Thanks also to Steelheart, who came to help with getting the last few corpses that Naggy was sitting on.  We finally ported the last people out at just after 3am EST.  I want to wish SB good luck in avenging us.<br>
<br>
There were a lot of mistakes made because of the change of leadership, and I will be the first to admit that.  If I had the knowledge that I had to day things may well have turned out differently, but that is the way it goes.  I am not going to step through every mistake I made, but there were many of them, and I learned from each of them.  I look at last night as a learning experience, and I hope all of you will bear with me while I learn how to do this.  It looks easy, but when you put on the shoes there is a lot of a change in viewpoint.  We will get the next one, I have confidence in myself and everyone else.  Thanks for coming last night, and I wish it could have turned out better, but we will avenge ourselves. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

Pretty irritating all around.  Think it is because of the changes to the Cleric Epic, now that the merchant that is on a 24 hour pop in SolB is the bottleneck, I think that people are assuming they can kill the Giants with him.  I have names, and if necessary, I will use them though I would rather avoid.  Cost the support team a lot of deaths.<br>
<br>
Let me mention though that this wasn't what caused us to fail.  It was highly irritating, and slowed us down a lot, but in the end it didn't influence the outcome of the raid.  It is against KGC policy, for basically that reason, having them repop in the middle of your buffline is just not that fun a thing.  But the timing was right so that they only killed the support team. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

Agreed though that it is also very possible that people may rush in to snag the cleric epic pop right after a patch.  IF they have to get past the giants to get cleric epic and they can do this before naggy pops, then at least while cleric epics are still backed up, this is probably something we are going to have to live with.<br>
<br>
Question is... knowing what we know now, is there a way we can proceed past the giants that will not cause a problem?<br>
<br>
Perhaps have the group move more as a team, or have the whole raid there to kill giants as need be till we are doing buff line.<br>
<br>
Wish I could have been there, just logged on after dinner with the parents to hear the tail end of corpse recovery.<br>

When you consider that Naggy usually pops around 12-20 hours after server up, the Giants WILL be up when Naggy is up, unless they have been put down.<br>
<br>
There are other ways to get to the FG area, but you HAVE to go through the FG area in order to get to Naggy, no way around it.  There are ways we could make it safer to travel to the spot, such as staying in a group, but that is more dangerous in a lot of ways because of the short attention span during raids.  We would end up with a lot of fatalities while inching along, and probably several trains.  It is much easier having the support group clearing, and when necessary pulling to the main group, then to travel as one body.  Also you have to consider what if the timing was right that the giants repop while the buffline is finishing up?  Something like that could really screw up the raid for the night, because the buffline would die fast (no tanks remember), and then the tanks would have to log on unorganised with few healers in the middle of a combat zone.  That sound fun to you?<br>
<br>
As far as the cleric epic is concerned, I can understand people wanting to get to it, but the fact is they need to work with the Naggy group.  KGC rules bluntly put that Giants are not supposed to be killed while the Respective Dragon is up or is due to spawn.  If you want to kill giants for a few days since dragon was killed, that is fine, but if you want to kill giants right after a server reset then you are violating KGC rules.  As I posted on the KGC boards, most of the time the Naggy group is bluntly not going to care about the RF merchant, so if you talk to us you can follow us in.  But if you are screwing with our raid, that is bad juju. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

And as far as the attack I would give those commands in shout its alot harder to miss something in RED than the grey chat color of chat channels which seems to remain full of chatter all the time. And considering the dispute we had over loot rules prior to attempting naggy, their should be a run down of drops and who can roll on them before we start, this could be done while you are forming groups. Also don't count on people shouting out the health of the dragon you should enter behind the tanks and monitor that for yourself. And just a bit of advice on Vox I would send the chanters in with the second wave of melee, mana sieve has very little taunt and the chanters can stand on the other side of the room away from Vox and sieve until they are oom.  <p>Yizelar Kontrol<br>

Not all guilds post Naggy rotation schedules on their board.  And not all FG hunters are guilded to ask a pointman for rotation info.<br>
<br>
I don't see why they don't publicly post ALL rotation schedules for everyone to see.  I seen the arguments against unnecessary spam as the reason why KGC discussions are off limits to non-officers.  But the rotation schedule, like the raid calendars on other servers, should be open but LOCKED for all to view.<br>

<br>
Not required when raiding Hate/Fear because we own the zone so we own the broadcast channels.<br>
<br>
For Naggy (and vox to a lesser extent) raids there will likely be several groups in the zone not related to the raid.  It is VERY rude to be spamming ooc or shout with raid commands.<br>
<br>
With the new UI I put the commands channel in it's own box at the top of my screen which makes commands VERY hard to miss.  It seems that we have a requirement for a chat spam channel in addition to this for the general chatting, humor, and questions to the group that come with a raid.<br>

It is self updated (which means that as a guild kills a target or fails,  it updates the list to reflect that information), and so has to be postable by all the members.  Yet in an open forum we will get people spamming, guild non-officers trying to do things to the list, lots of confusion, etc.  We do post it in other places, so that people can see, and generally if you ask an officer of your guild they will let you know what the rotation looks like.  As for unguilded, a good many pass through here or are unofficial members of another guild that they primarily tag along with. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

Also, ya last time i was there they popped right as we were finished buffing and they had started to engage naggy. It was hectic sitting there waiting for them to pop not knowing when etc.<br>
<br>
Ill admit, before a vox raid i had accidentally killed some ice giants (not in the lair though) that had attacked me .....but it was no problem since they have fast pop time, but for people to kill FGs hours before a raid and to have them pop on the raid is just rediculous. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=84680">Seisekerr Swiftstrike</a> -- Master of the Celestial Fists<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102119">Avante Vires`Fortitudo</a> -- Virtuoso of the Wind<br><i>Karana Server</i><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urreddd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rreddd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/11/02 9:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub140.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy Recap 9/6</span><hr size=1> If anyone is ever desperate to know what's up on a rotation, I normally have a second computer running for lookups etc.  As an officer of Souls of the Valiant (Farrnusno's guild) I have access and would be happy to let anyone know where things are on a rotation.<br>
