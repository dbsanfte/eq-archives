-from what i have seen , the cog does dictate rules..<br>
&gt;I'm sorry, but exactly what rules has CoG dictated?  Has anyone here said you must only allow dark elves in your guild?  Has anyone said that you cannot roleplay?  I could be mistaken, but I dont think so.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are not a ruling body, nor do we have any say over the way our member guilds run their guilds.&quot;<br>
- If this statement is true, Then why does guild trucidation and me get bashed constently..<br>
&gt;Because of what you have said and more importantly how you have said it.  We are not bashing Trucidation, we have taken offense at you.  Some dont like you because they feel Trucidation is simply NTC with a new name.  Others, like myself, dont like your language and broad statement attacks.  In any event none of this pertains to how you run your guild.  If you dont like what we say, you can always take your ball and go home.  No one is forcing you here.  But if you hold to a stance that most people here find wrong, expect to be called on it.  That is not some dictatorship thing, its simply the will of the majority.<br>
<br>
&quot;We recognize and tolerate all types of guilds, neutral, good, or evil, roleplaying, game playing and all types of guild in between.&quot;<br>
- If this is also a true statment , Guild trucidation would please like to me a member of this council now..<br>
&gt;There is a difference between roleplaying an evil character, and cheating someone out of items and platinum.  One is acceptable.  The other is not.  If you are unable to tell the difference, I suggest you consult a priest or phychologist so they may explain the word morality to you.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are all equals here.&quot;<br>
- hmm we are? thats wierd because everyone here seems to get along quite well and i seem to get treated like crap.. =\<br>
&gt;Yup.  Equals.  Doesnt mean you arent going to get bashed by everyone if they dont like you.  You have every right to defend yourself in a mature and civilized manner.  But people saying bad things about your guild or former guild doesnt mean you arent an equal.  Equality is a two edged sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;We realize that conflicts between guilds and personalities will arise. They are to be handled by the conflicting guilds or personalities in whatever way that they see fit. The Council will not force its will or judgement on any member guilds, nor is it responsible for settling said conflicts.&quot;<br>
-This quote right here from the COG vision.. Is the one that troubles me the most.. If that was the case , then everyone here including me should be on a clean slate with COG... Witch i would love more then anything .<br>
&gt;Trucidation did start with a clean slate.  You Shadowland did not.  There are those here that obviously feel that Trucidation is simply NTC with a different name.  You did nothing to alleviate these concerns, you did nothing to show that you in fact had tried to change anything.  You then further muddied the waters with your attacks against everyone when you only had problems with a few.  Rather than show people here had been mistaken, you only proved that they were right.<br>
<br>
In any event all this is a wonderful attempt at being a rules lawyer.  Unfortunatly none of it is really true.  No one in CoG has tried to interfere with how you run your guild.  You are free to do with it as you please.  Heck, you can even violate PnP for all I care, you'll be dealing with Verant on that not me.  People have just expressed their own opinions of you and those that we in NTC.  Rather than defend yourself in a mature fashion you attacked.  And you continue to do so with posts like this.  In case you didnt notice, you are the only one that is hurting your guild.  People that might have taken a positive or neutral stand on this are being forced against you by your continued attacks here.<br>
<br>
As for welcoming Trucidation now, I dont know.  I'd probably ask it to be put up to a vote.  At one time this post might have made sense and actually helped you.  That day passed several days ago with your attack upon KCoG.  After all that, you now want everyone to welcome you with open arms?  Well, I wont speak for anyone else.  They'll make that decision.  But for me, at this point, I'd want to see that NTC really is dead.  I'd like, as Haemish suggested, to see Trucidation run events for the server, run some newbie aid stations, help out low level characters.  You had a chance to be welcomed with no strings attached.  You blew it.  Now earn it.<br>

just look at what your saying..<br>
<br>
First you say<br>
<br>
&quot;Has anyone said that you cannot roleplay? I could be mistaken, but I dont think so.&quot;<br>
<br>
but 3 lines of text later you say, that my guild aint roleplaying in the game because somone stole somthing..<br>
<br>
LOL tell me this darkelf is evil race right? tricksters?<br>
<br>
If you walked up to a hoodlum on the street and gave him 200$ and said for him to wait right there... and you came back and he was gone? would you be supprised..... NO and if you were , then its your own foolishness for trusting somone of that kind.. Same thing as trusting a darkelf.. Our guild does roleplay.. <br>
<br>
<br>
LOL then you say <br>
&quot;&gt;Trucidation did start with a clean slate. You Shadowland did not. &quot;<br>
<br>
And that line right there STILL goes agenst everything in your great &quot;VISION&quot;<br>

Okay, got that?<br>
<br>
There is no one in charge of KCoG.<br>
<br>
I apologize for the repetition, but it seems this point must be made every month or so.<br>
<br>
No one here makes any decisions on anything.  We all work together towards common goals.  Leaders step forward and are followed, not because anyone has to, but because people decide on their own to do so.  <br>
<br>
Frankly Shadowlands knew there was animosity towards him.  Then he goes about to introduce your guild, with a tag that says he's the leader.  And you expect people to believe that its totally seperate?  <br>
<br>
In any event, whether or not Trucidation is different from NTC is no longer the core issue here.  Its Shadowlands attacks against everyone who hasnt agreed with him.  And I'm still waiting for a public apology from him about all of that.  And not some nice vague one liner either.  Some humility when asking for something is generally a good thing.<br>
<br>
Of course, as I stated above.  You dont need my approval or anyone else's here to do anything.  But dont expect warm welcomes until you can repair the damage done by Shadowlands.<br>

This tells me that when someone comes to him and asks him about an issue, that he takes offense to it, and instead of trying to deal with the issue, instead gets defensive and starts making threats. This is a sure sign of childishness, as in &quot;I'm gonna take my ball and go home&quot;. If you want respect for yourself and your new guild, then show some respect when someone comes to you for you to resolve an issue with one of your guildmembers. Don't just get defensive and start throwing threats around. DEAL with it.<br>
<br>
And in response to what Tedain said in another thread, I was also a member of CoU when Shadowlands started spouting off there about CoU being a lousy guild, and that he was gonna go make his own guild where he could do what he wanted to do. Now I don't know about everyone else, but to me this means that he didn't want to follow the CoU rules, so he was gonna quit and start his own guild with no rules. <p>Mairi<BR>

&quot;Inless i get my item back your guild will be disbanded and You will be kicked off everquest&quot;  <br>

<br>
So excuse me if they get the same in return , but what they do is overlooked because they are the &quot;victim&quot;....<br>
<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS ALSO, Why do  you think Verant doesnt do anything when somthing gets stolen from you ??<br>
<br>
its because if you are stupid enough to put somthing on the trade its your own fault.. not just that but they even WARN YOU  more then twice a month on the Server MOTD..<br>
<br>
NOT ONLY THATTTT, But when you hit trade you are agreeing meaning you see your item , and then you see what they are offering and you hit trade you hit trade.  done deal.. If you walk up to me and i give you a peny and you give me twenty dollers , Dont ask for it back.... I dont pay for your stupidity , even though im not the one that was involved in these stealing incidents , since im the one getting the blame for it i might as well defend it..<br>

<br>
Oh man.  That's brilliant.  I've got to remember to tell Rob this the next time he's up to defend some smuck rapist.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Your Honor, She was asking for it.  I mean, she should have known better than to walk down Main Street at 11pm wearing nothing but a string bikini.  It was her fault.  What was my client supposed to do?  Just walk away?&quot;<br>
<br>
That'd be like my easiest win ever.<br>
<br>
You just totally lost your case here and now Shadowlands.  Your blaming the people who got robbed?  Even though you are right legally, that doesnt make it right in a metaphysical sense.  Here, let me make it easy for you.<br>
<br>
Thou Shalt Not Steal.<br>
<br>
Okay.  Get it?<br>
<br>
And yes, you are expected to react and talk civily.  At all times.  Regardless of provocation.  Its what I've taken Haemish to task for more than once.  Someone being rude to you is never justification for you decending to their level.  All it is is an excuse.<br>
<br>
And yes, it is stealing if you told me that the penny was a rare mint defective penny worth say 30 bucks but you were willing to sell me for 20.  Then you switch the real penny for a regular normal one.  Thats stealing.  And its what your guild members were accused of doing.<br>
<br>
And yes, as the guild leader you are responsible for the actions of your guild members.  Deal with it.  Just like the guild is responsible for your actions.  Its part and parcel of the responsibilities of being a guild leader or an officer.  Or do you believe its just a free ride?  You have responsibilities as a leader.  Its time you start acting like one.<br>
<br>
But if you choose not to, thats okay.  These threads are much more amusing than many I've seen recently.<br>

When Shadowland said the word Victim he said it because it has been used to him before.  &quot; I am the victim here &quot;  and honestly if you put something in the trade screen for nothing that is your trade and its final says verant.  Or do you people not understand that?  Stealing is very wrong which is why it is not allowed in my guild and has never been allowed by me but, open your eyes please don't just read what you want and than twist it around .. <br>

When you steal you steal.  It doesnt matter to me in the least if it was right in a legal way IF it was wrong metaphysically.  Or morally.  Do you people even understand what that word means?  Just because you CAN do something it does not therefor follow that you should do such a thing.  If you cant understand that basic point, there is no place for you in KCoG.  We need to understand and completely trust everyone here.  By your very views you've shown you dont understand that.<br>

Stealing is stealing.  Dont try to rules lawyer it.  You were the one getting all hot and bothered earlier about how language doesnt matter.  Yet here you are trying to split hairs?  At least try to be consistant.<br>

By Trucidation...</span><hr size=1> When you tempt someone into a transaction with one item, and then switch the item actually available to them, it's called a &quot;Bait and Switch&quot;.  It is illegal when a retail store does it with ads or promotions.  It is also morally wrong.<br>
<br>
When you prey upon someone's trust to cheat them out of something, it is called a &quot;Confidance Game&quot;.  Public authorities refer to the practitioners of these as &quot;Confidance Artists&quot;.  We know them in the vernacular as &quot;Con-Artists&quot; or &quot;Con-men&quot;.  Playing confidance games is illegal in real life.  You will be criminally prosecuted if you are caught.  It is also morally wrong.<br>
<br>
Staar and Shadowlands, you openly admit to practicing confidance games within EQ... yet you expect us to welcome you and your followers with open arms?  Why should we?  Because you have &quot;strict rules&quot; and a &quot;code of conduct&quot;?  So do most serial killers.  If you don't believe me, read up on it.  Very few famous criminals completely lack a code of conduct or morals.  The Mafia, in fact, has an extremely strict code of conduct.  They just have a different code of conduct than the rest of society considers acceptable.<br>
<br>
There is a big difference between being a-moral and im-moral.  If you don't know what that difference is, look up both of them in a dictionary.  I am not trying to patronize when I say that, I merely want the vocabulary that I'm using to be clearly understood by everyone involved.<br>
<br>
So let me get back to my point... you defend your actions by pointing to the rules laid down by Sony Interactive and Verant... yet your actions go against what the EverQuest community at large considers acceptable.  And when part of the EQ community rejects you because of your actions and attitude, you throw a tantrum.  Explain to me why we should treat you with respect and trust when you have clearly proven unworthy of either?  You have shown no remorse for your actions nor the actions of your previous guild members.  If this was a parole hearing, you would most definitely still be in prison.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know that this is a game.  It is not real life.  You are just Roleplaying.  Fine.  You roleplay untrustworthy and selfish characters.  That is your choice.  But don't get mad at the rest of the people who play EQ when your choices come back to haunt you.  If you play a character who is not worthy of trust or respect, you should not be surprised when no one trusts or respects that character.  Expecting anything different is merely delusional.  The theory of Causality applies to virtual reality as well as actual reality.<br>
<br>
So you aren't breaking Sony's rules... fine... play with all the GM's and Guides.  If you want to play with the rest of the EQ community, you must conform to what we consider acceptable behavior, not just the rules Sony and Verant made.  If you cannot understand that both virtual and real societies require this, you have a much larger problem in your life than simply being dis-allowed on KCoG raids. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

If you don't want to include Shadowland and I, thats fine but, please don't shut down the other people.  Thats all we ask.  Shadowland is getting worse and worse only because he sees it is a losing battle with you people so therefore he doesn't care what you think now.  He just wants the other people in the guild to be given a chance  You cannot judge them because you don't like Shadow or his behavior or anything.  Your &quot;Vision&quot; states that.<br>
<br>
I must add that NO I am not Shadowland nor is he me.  We are two seperate people who share a computer and yes I logged on her with my account and he never switched it.. could that be at all possible?  Lets think about that one......<br>
