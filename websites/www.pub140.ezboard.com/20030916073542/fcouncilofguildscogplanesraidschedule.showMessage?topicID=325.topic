We started off solidly, and even though we had a few bumps in the road we finished up strongly.  I think it is safe to say that this was the most successful raid KCoG has done up here, and was personally the Best Raid I have ever been on.  Everyone that was there is owed congratulations on the Great Job!<br>
<br>
Breakin was nearly flawless, with the exception of G1's cleric having invis fade just as she zoned in so that she had to stand and die.  After that though, we got the rest of the groups in with little to no problem.  We quickly cleared the area and headed north to the temple, as the Shissar was up.  Due to a fluke with chain aggro we ended up pulling virtually the entire temple at one time.  Somehow though, before the last person went down we took the 15 or so mobs that came and killed all but 3.  Great Job, better could not have been asked.  Took a bit to do the CR, but was not as bad as it could have been.  We quickly pulled the Wraith and relieved her of her head.  I managed to win the roll, and got my Epic Bottleneck.  On a personal note I was beginning to think that I would never see my epic bottleneck piece.  Thanks for all the help getting it, I am extatic and very appreciative of all of the effort.<br>
<br>
Then we went back south and then East, and despite a few detours we went to visit Fright.  He was quickly dispatched, and we made another Shammy happy.  Then we pulled the Broken Golem.  Wow he had a lot of HP.  Someone parsed him at something like 150k hp.  He took a long time to take down, but we ended up putting him in the grave to make a wizard very happy.  Dread, very shortly, joined his other friends in the ground.  Unfortunately he did not spawn the iksar child as he was supposed to.<br>
<br>
At this point we headed across the zone to meet Terror.  Unfortunately a wanderer aggroed us and chain aggroed Terror.  As a result we were unprepared for the fight and wiped.  We did the CR, which took a while because of the position we were in and decided to take another shot at Terror.  This time adds were controlled and we were able to take charge of the situation.  I have to say that he was hands down the most difficult of the 3 &quot;Golems&quot;.  Rezzes were done, and then everyone ported to tox to do the rolls for dropped items.<br>
<br>
Again, I cannot say enough about how well this raid went.  5 Mini's is no mean feat, especially for an organization like KCoG.  Great Job to everyone there, and you have my personal thanks for the epic piece.  See you in Hate on Wednesday.  Maybe Inoruuk will be up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
What he didnt mention is that we had 12 mins left in Fear and we went for Terror. If he had wiped us it wouldnt have been nice. Still a good gamble and he spawned the Iksar Broodling and i won roll for Child's Tear. A GREAT raid - Kumaelyon didnt get picked on too much by Fright, althoug it as surprising fun to vision him and watch him HT Qamgine (suicidal puller) and Farrnusno was stood at the front of the raid and got stood on - Fright didnt even seem to stop he just moved past Farr and he died. Then he HT'd the MT and a few others died and then Fright was down. We got broken/enraged golem - his HP do seem to be at around 150,000 but we took him down easily. 1 add and that was mez'd by our great chanter team and i dont think Rredd (MT) even went under 60pct health thanks to all the healers on him - a long but easy fight. Then we met Dread - on Allakhazam there is confusion over whether Dread or Terror has the AE so we put up cold resist just in case. <br>
