For the sake of our members</span><hr size=1> Ummm I actually have an idea if you really want to be accepted here why don't you go away for a week or so calm down and let some of the dust settle. Because all you've manged to do between you so far is piss off the councils founder and annoy a few of the CoG stalwarts and highly respected people. Now if you haven't noticed this hasn't been a good start.<br>
<br>
Give it some time and space and I have to say maybe you should tell Shadowlands to chill because threatening people is never a good way to get on peoples good sides. Now I know that he isn't representative of you or your guild but by your relationship with him and the postition he seems to hold in your guild he isn't helping your cause.<br>
<br>
Being in the CoG is a privilage not a right and it has been my privilage to be part of the CoG for 46 levels now and I know it is a worth while body with some great people involved. So if you really want to be part of the Council then let the dust settle a bit and give it some time.<br>

For the sake of our members</span><hr size=1> Okay, your guild leader, Shadowlands goes off threatening people, flaming people, insulting them and swearing at them.  And you want to start over?<br>
<br>
If you cared about your members, you know what to do.  Shadowlands must apologize publicly and promise to work with everyone in the future, even when people say he's wrong.  Its what we all agree to.  But when your guild leader goes off burning his bridges, its a little late to ask to start over.  <br>
<br>
And yes, it is important.  When problems occur here, we need to know that those who are in charge of a raid will have the last say and we dont get into this huge argument over who is right.  <br>
<br>
Shadowlands has never apologized to anyone here.  Until he does so and more than just in some off hand manner, you arent going to be accepted.  If you really care about your members, have him do so.  If you cannot put others ahead of yourself, you dont understand what KCoG is all about.<br>

If he gets angry and flies off the handle, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> need to tell him to chill, and don't post any more until he calms down.<br>

Second, you should make him apologize to everyone here whom he has offended with his childish remarks, threats, and name-calling. And it will go over better if he MEANS it.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> need to realize that as guild leader, you have to take responsibility for your ENTIRE guild, not just yourself. Realize as well that the actions of just one person DO affect your entire guild. <br>

Those three things will do wonders for making people step back and take a look, and possibly even think &quot;well, looks like Staar is taking responsibility for her guild, maybe we made a mistake.&quot; Not saying thats <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> gonna</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happen, just that it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <p>Mairi<BR>

Then, lass, I'm sorry for you, but your problems are never going to end. As long as he keeps posting the kinds of comments he's been making here, everyone is going to hold that against him, and you by your association with him. In the legal world, it's called an accomplice. Guilt by association is a very real thing.<br>
<br>
And you are telling us that you guys are a couple, and are living together. Hmmm...and you can't make him do anything or keep him under control? Maybe you need to go back and ask your mother how she kept your father under control. Believe me, it can be done...I've been doing it myself with my husband for 17 years now.<br>
