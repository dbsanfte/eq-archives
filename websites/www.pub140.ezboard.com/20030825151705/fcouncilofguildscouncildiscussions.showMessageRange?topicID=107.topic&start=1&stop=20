<br>
Over the past 3 weeks at least 5 Kunark Rotational Dragons have been killed between the times that they were spotted and when the Rotation Guild came to engage.  Zlandicar, Severilous, and Gorenair have each been killed once, and Trakanon has been killed twice.  No one has been able to identify the people that have been taking these targets as of yet, and any names of organizations that were brought up lacked specific names or any proof (and really believeability).  This is a serious breech of Server Protocol, as the server has been a strong supporter of KGC rotations for a long time.  The fact that the server can share targets like this has made us one of the most unique servers out there, and it is painful to see something like this happening that could jeopardize something like that.  After all if rotations didn't exist, then KCoG wouldn't exist in the form that we do today, as we would never be able to engage dragons or planes.  This needs to stop, and stop as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
If you see anything strange happening, I highly advise you to contact your guild leaders (or if you do not have any that you can contact or do not want to contact them then contact me and I will speek for you) so that we can get to the bottom of it.  If you see 2 dozen people in EJ from one guild, and they aren't headed to CoM chances are they are trying to engage Sev.  If half the population is Seb is from one guild, someone needs to make sure they are behaving.  I am not saying that you should assume guild, but contact an officer or guild leader in good standing with KGC that can question the behavior to see if it is just unusual or it is indeed criminal.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately until we can get names of people that are doing this most likely this will continue, and it will threaten the stability and peace of the server, which is just wrong.  I do not want to see this degenerate into finger pointing or accusations, I just want everyone to be aware of the situation so that people can be on the lookout.  The more people paying attention, the less chance that whoever it is can get away with it.  Again, if you see something suspicious that looks like it may be a group trying to steal a target, let people know.  I will gladly talk to anyone, and I am sure that your guild leaders will as well.  I also want to remind everyone that KCoG has always been a strong supporter of KGC and I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is detestable greedy behavior and if you are involved in anyway you should stop. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
VI keeps server logs of all of that.<br>
<br>
However, we as players have no access to it.  Nor do the guides.  As VI does not recognize rotations other than the VI imposed Stormhammer Server rotations, what happens does not count as a KS situation, but a normal FFA practice.<br>
<br>
As such there is no point in asking a Guide or GM for information as they either cannot (a guide) or will not (A GM) give out that information since as far as they are concerned, everything happened the way it should.<br>
<br>
The only option we have is to stake out those targets 24/7 and keep track of the people in the zone and do /guildstatus checks on /anon people.<br>
<br>
FYI: By typing /guildstatus  you can get the name of the guild and if they are an officer or guild leader of anyone that is anon in the zone you are in.  You have to be in the same zone as them, and they need to actually be in a guild for that to work.  Otherwise you'll get back something saying they need to be in the same zone as you, or they are not in a guild.  However, it is a nice way to find out what guild people who are /anon are in.<br>
<br>
I've surprised and embarassed more than 1 KSer or troublemaker who thought that they were safe by being /anon by naming both their guild and what I would be telling their guild leader.<br>

In fact...it is going to hurt us the most. KCoG is the only way most of us here will ever be able to hit an old world dragon, or plane. If these turn into a FFA, or perma-KS you might as well kiss uber loot and your epic goodbye. KGC has worked for years, and now a bunch of immature people who have nothing but time on their hands are trying to disrupt it. I don't know about you, but I'm not going to sit idly by and watch it happen.<br>
<br>
This is YOUR server. We as KCoG can amass the amount of support needed to try and hit our targets when we have to. If we know we are up for Planes, or a Dragon, we need to watch these zones! No one person can be on 24/7, but we have enough people scattered about to help in the watching.<br>
<br>
Turn your log on, take screenshots, send tells to those guilds who you see are forming for something. This needs to be nipped in the butt, but no one person/guild can do it. This has to be a serverwide effort. Even if you aren't on any other rotation the KGC offers, you are a member of KCoG which is on Vox, Naggy, Planes, and now VS rotations. This does affect Everyone!<br>
<br>
Let's take some initiative to try and &quot;scout&quot; out our zones several days prior to a pop to make sure that we are all over it to try and preserve our target or better, catch these KSers. If you don't do anything, it wont get done!! <p><img src="http://www.talonswitch.com/qamcard.jpg"><br>

<br>
<br>
BTW, something that hasn't been mentioned here is that in many of these cases, the target was spotted late night or morning US time and missing by evening, so this seems to be happening primarily during the day US time, or prime time in Europe. Folks who play during those times times should be especially vigilant, because they're the ones who are most likely to spot something going on. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

I posted this, this morning on KGC. I think it would behove everyone to at least read through it.<br>
<br>
----------- My Post on KGC--<br>
KGC is turning into the biggest joke due to everyone's lack of apathy and gumption to get off their duffs and take care of something. Everything KGC has strived to stand for, is being walked on by a few select people. Guilded or not, it makes little to no difference. People are getting lazy with taking down mobs. These few people are tired of seeing good loot and mobs basically &quot;rot&quot; by not being killed.<br>
With level 65 and AA points of the plenty, it will only take a party of 2 groups to take down what most of us would need 5 groups to take down. Most of our Rotation mobs are being compared to PoP's yard-trash.<br>
<br>
This server is LARGE, it has already been split once, and IMHO needs another one. The server has created a bureaucratic organization that works to help ALL people, no matter size of guild, race, or class! The people that are doing this only care about them, and not everyone else.<br>
<br>
Yeah, they have friends, their own click sticks, etc. With the release of PoP, ports are rarely needed. They probably have gear that most would just only dream of having. They probably play close to 24/7 and have some other form of income (parents) or what not. SOE designed this game to be for both the advid, and casual gamer. However, these people don't care about that. In their eyes, if you are casual, you are not worthy of playing this game. &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; was quoted on one board.<br>
<br>
You know what? I'm an exceptionally casual player. Most here, have probably never heard of Royal Knights of Light. Frankly, there is nothing that I can do to stop this. By myself that is. We as Karana can. How? By hitting these mobs pronto and taking them down. Leaving them up for 48, 72, etc hours is annoying.<br>
<br>
Most mob rotations allow for at least 1 if not many more months in between. In that time, you should be running mini-raids to &quot;improve&quot; your raiding skills. Yeah, I'll admit at times, the dice just don't roll in your favor. Things happen. But, when you come up for a mob, you should have had a bit of &quot;training&quot; prior to at least know what you are supposed to do.<br>
<br>
Can we threaten these KSers? No. Can we Blacklist them? Sure, but from the looks of it, they have more resources than most here. We really only have one &quot;valid&quot; non-bannable choice. Engage and take our targets down before they can. If KGC is diligent in taking down it's targets then these rogue players are left with either getting a life and going to PoP mobs, or going on the rotation.<br>
<br>
/rant<br>
I pay my monthy fee just like everyone else here. This is not Unreal tournament where the player with the most frags wins. There is no real &quot;Ending&quot; to this game. Yet these rogue players are turning it into that. If you want a challenge of pure RPG - go to a red server and get yourself Pk-ed a couple of times. Try and KS a target and see how many darks enter a zone ready to wipe the place with your carcass. In some ways, I enjoyed being on PVP, in others I hated it. But one thing was for sure, people didn't sit around on their duffs when something like this happens. So far, all that's been done is a bunch of complaining in MB's.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm complaining, but I'm a low man on the totem!! I couldn't stop someone from taking a most mobs, much less a rot target. Karana guilds are sitting on their duffs with their finger up their nose hoping this will just go away. No offense to anyone, but because no one here wants to do anything about it, the lower guilds are getting hurt more.<br>
<br>
Yeah the rotations are LONG. Not everything is perfect. But, KGC has &quot;worked&quot; because we all feel as though this is for the benefit of the &quot;entire SERVER&quot;. Now we are just sitting back and watching this happen, and we are being joked about.<br>
<br>
If YOU don't do anything, it isn't going to get done. Man, if I coming from a smaller guild know that, you should! This can be stopped, but only if we work together and get take our finger out of our nose and get some gumption!!<br>
<br>
Don't mind mobs being Perma-Kill? Don't mind FFA? Don't care about your Epic? Fine, but do me a favor, get off of Karana. It's too big for people like that. Go to a smaller server where there aren't as many guilds stealing all the mobs.<br>
<br>
And to the Rogue Guilds (yeah, I'm sure you are reading this), if you want a challenge, go PVP. Just try this over there. It may last one or two times, but guaranteed you will see the server join together to take you down and make sure you feel the blisters afterward.<br>
<br>
My hope is that Karana can get some of that inspiration that this is OUR server and we aren't going to let some jerks perma-kill the mobs.<br>

My memory gets hazy so it might have been 3 and I missed one.... well if you include the AB split anyway - but supposedly we're at the max amount of times a server will be split (which is ghey).<br>
<br>
The last split was well over a year ago, thats 3 splits in 2 years and now nothing. Without having a serverwide petition to split and more then half of the population of the server signing it, I doubt that option will come through.<br>
<br>
And to easy some worries Quam, yes the ubers are looking. what starts with baby lizard kunark yard trash ends with killing things like our NToV rotations.. and thats not good. (just a different way of lookin at it though)<br>
<br>
Nothing really works fast on this server but they will get caught. With as many people in their guild as they have, not all of them can keep silent all the time to people outsde their guild. They will be their own destruction eventually.<br>
<br>
Just keep your eyes open, your brains working and eventually, something will happen and they will get nailed, and then every person on the server will get their chance to kick em in the perverbial backside. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/Vreesig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

That comment was made by, you guessed it, Little-Selfish-Brat Dazzadi. That name rung a bell. Wasn't it one of the Forced-To-Disband guilds? Just curious.<br>
<br>
BTW, there is ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT that I saw in all them rants: KGC guilds/alliances that aren't getting off their collective behinds and either passing or attacking need to be KICKED OFF THE ROTATION! Simple as that. I don't blame Dazzadi and gang for whacking mobs that were sitting around for DAYS, IF the guilds/alliances involved were dragging their feet on getting to them. As I understand it, however, Dazzadi is a rogue member of Nightbane who, as a guild, agreed to the KGC system. Therefore, if NB doesn't clean its own house, I'm all for the &quot;sanctions&quot;, though I'm not sure it will truly hurt them. We also need to know if there are members of other guilds (I'd say Trakanons_Corpse proves there are UNguilded involved) that are helping in the KGC attack.<br>
<br>
KGC will only stand if we do our part. If we are slow and apathetic in getting to targets, then too bad for us. As was stated over there, ALL MOBS ARE FFA! There are NO rotations, NO camps. PERIOD. However, Karana chose an honor-based and honorable sharing system and I'm proud to be a part of it. Let's make sure we are getting off our butts and hitting these mobs or taking passes to get that next guild/alliance up ASAP.<br>

<br>
But thats immaterial right now really.  As Quag pointed out, currently, it appears to be a rogue group of players attempting to pursue their own agenda.  Calling for sanctions against Nightbane at this time is premature.  They need to be given time to fix this on their own.<br>
<br>
And yes, recently many targets have been up for several days.  But since Nightbane had removed themselves from those rotations previously, Dazz doesnt really have much ground to stand on.  Also, neither does Nightbane as they remained on the Vox rotation which they coincidently did not bother to take down for a couple of days and eventually took a fail.<br>
<br>
No one's hands here are particularly clean.  And their complains do have some truth to them.  I know of many guilds and alliances who cannot take their targets alone.  I've seen Talendor and Gore and Sev raids where there have been several guests invited.  And while guests are usually okay in small numbers, they shouldnt include your MA, SA, and 2 level 60 clerics.<br>

If you want to see how to beat people like this, do a search on this board for &quot;Shattering Steel.&quot; You have to be united. You cannot give even one of the people associated with it any help whatsoever. No ports. No SOW. No trading whatsoever. If the guild that people like Dazzadi are a member of does nothing to stop their activities, you have to take it to the guild that's doing it. <br>
<br>
It all comes down to what you think is important. If the KGC rotations are important enough to you, you'll do what it takes. It will be ugly. You will lose friends. It will be an ugly place to be for weeks. <br>
<br>
The KGC would not be necessary if all people on the server could agree to respect other people. That won't happen, which is why the KGC is still around. <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

There are many many more people that think its time is coming to an end. All it will take is a few like minded guilds to put a stop to this rotation, and make this server just like every other server where only the strong survive where the lazy get nothing. Any guild is capable of killing any target they just have to get off their lazy duff and work for it instead of be handed everything and whine like babies when somone takes it away.  <p>Yizelar Kontrol&lt;br&gt;<br>
