<p>
Congrats Baladinn on the hilted spike whatever and Croso on the necklace!<br>
<p>
Then it was off to Karnors to take down everyone's favorite lizard, which we hadn't killed in about a year, /thanks huge rotations!<br>

for his epic!<br>
<p>
Those of us who have been on have mostly working on smaller things, leveling, alternate advancement, quests, twinking secondaries etc. <br>
A group of us went off to the City of Mist to try our luck at obtaining the ever-elusive Jade Reaver<br>

We didn't get one but training half the zone around is always entertaining<br>
<p>
Speaking of trains, we also hit up fear with a couple groups<br>

Grats Genessee who had been waiting on this piece forever!<br>
<p>
So theres a sampling of what we've been up to lately, and here's your obligatory Legacy of Steel type quotes:<br>
