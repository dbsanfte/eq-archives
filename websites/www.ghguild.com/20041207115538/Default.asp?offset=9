Perhaps the greatest tragedy of this game we all devote so much time to, of this second life we lead is that in so many cases, the relationships we form with 
people are founded entirely within Everquest's context. How easy it is to forget that behind each character and anonymous identity is a living person. A person 
who may be feeling happiness, sorrow, depression, or pain, and all of these emotions unbeknown to us. <br>
<p>
How easy it is to forget, and how much we lose by not remembering, and by not working harder to further establish these relationships outside this game. I have 
always been one who felt that this life and my "real" life should be kept separate, and I have very few real world connections to any of the family members I 
call Grey Hawke. It is days like this that I can truly realize that this is not a wise approach, and one that I regret. <br>
<p>
I am deeply saddened to say that Lisa, or Vinrea as we knew her in game, passed away a few months ago. I did not have an extremely strong relationship with 
Vinrea in game but she was my guildmate and in Grey Hawke that makes her family. We fought together in this imaginary world and with this family we triumphed 
over all manner of struggles. But I did not know about her triumphs and struggles in real life and the tragedy that brought on the terrible loss that we are just 
learning about now. Hermana was able to relate more about the person behind the character, the person that I never got the chance to really know, and never 
will. <br>
<p>
“I was lucky enough to know a bit about Lisa's life and she was a woman who walked a rocky road but still kept her head up and a smile on her face. She had 
dreams and a passion for life, she had two cats she loved, she adored flirting and making her friends laugh and smile, she was a big into gaming and had 
grown up and lived in Montana. She was in her late twenties I believe, and worked nights at a local bar. She was beautiful inside and out."<br>

For Vinrea (written by Kaasa) <br>
<p>
I never heard your laughter or the sound of your real voice.<br>
Fate so cruel and heartless will not give me that choice.<br>
<p>
My eyes they did not know the color of your hair.<br> 
I had no way of knowing if your skin was dark or fair.<br> 
<p>
My heart knew more important things than my eyes could see <br>
You always were and will remain a true friend to me. <br>
<p>
There's an aching in my heart as tears run down my face, <br>
There's an emptiness where you once were that none will replace. <br>
<p>
May the angels hold you in their arms and raise you way up high <br>
May your words live in our hearts forever and your memory never die. <br>

Friends Without Faces (submitted by Grapaully) <br>
<p>
We sit and we type, and we stare at our screens <br>
We all have to wonder, what this possibly means. <br>
With our mouse we roam, through the zones in a maze <br>
Looking for something or someone, as we sit in a daze. <br>
<p>
We chat with each other, we type all our woes <br>
Small groups we do form, and gang up on our foes. <br>
We wait for somebody, to type out our name <br>
We want recognition, but it is always the same. <br>
<p>
We give kisses and hugs, and sometimes flirt <br>
In tells we chat deeply, and reveal why we hurt. <br>
We do form friendships - but - why we don't know <br>
But some of these friendships, will flourish and grow. <br>
<p>
Why is it on screen, we can be so bold <br>
Telling our secrets, that have never been told. <br>
Why is it we share, the thoughts in our mind <br>
With those we can't see, as though we were blind. <br>
<p>
The answer is simple, it is as clear as a bell. <br>
We all have our problems, and need someone to tell. <br>
We can't tell real people, but tell someone we must <br>
So we turn to the 'puter, and to those we can trust. 
<p>
Even though it is crazy, the truth still remains <br>
They are Friends Without Faces, and odd little names. <br>
<p>

<p>
It is my deepest regret that I knew her only as Vinrea, and not as Lisa. May she rest in peace. <br><br><br><center> </b>You may pay your respects to Vinrea (Lisa) in our forums.
