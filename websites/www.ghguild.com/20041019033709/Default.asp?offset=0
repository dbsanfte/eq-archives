<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once upon a time there was a game called 
EVERQUEST! <br>
<br>
It was a game of MAGIC! Good and evil! Dragons and gods and elves! Oh, it was a 
happy place, where elves frolicked with humans and dwarves frolicked with 
helpless animals until the Great Restraining Order of Freeport. <br>
<br>
Great battles were fought; heroes and villains made themselves known to the 
world and a HISTORY of the server began to take shape, each world unique and 
exciting. Agreements between the greatest guilds and a handful of roachy 
alliances took place in a massive egocentric society full of powerful people. 
Enemies were divided and slain by the thousands. A world of epic proportions 
took hold and began to create a new history for itself. I fondly remember 
breaking Fear for 6 hours and losing a level or two… painful but wonderful 
memories. And being the first in the door to rush headlong at Nagafen because I 
told a warrior friend he was a pussy and I would beat him in. What amazing 
stuff! <br>
<br>
Eventually, new races were discovered. Lizards! These evil bastards added life 
and vigor to an ever expanding world, and furthered the epic story. Then the 
land of dragons was opened for adventurers and, oh, what a crazy time that was! 
Some of the best times I can remember were spent getting wiped out in North 
Temple of Veeshan. <br>
<br>
Next came the moon…. Hmm… Ok keeping an open mind, it was alright. Cats were 
introduced… and….aliens? Yeah, a little bizarre to put aliens in a fantasy game 
but oh well, it kinda made sense as it was presented. At least we got the Nexus! 
Then FROGS were introduced, and not just the French kind. That was a hoot! 
Because along with frogs came new zones that were instanced! Oooooh. Now if I 
wanted to on off-raid days I could go and play in a zone that WE owned with some 
friends for an hour or two. Very refreshing. Almost like drinking a lime rickey 
while getting serviced by a wood elf maiden but not quite. That’s hard to top.
<br>
<br>
But before frogs, came the best expansion of the game in my opinion. Planes of 
Power. Granted, flags are a pain in the ass at times, but they really separated 
guilds to their level of effectiveness for the most part. And a central zone 
where I could go ANYWHERE in under 10 minutes! And GODS! DRAGONS! Oh YES! YES, 
BABY! DADDY WANTS MORE! I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT EXPANSION! <br>
<br>
…Or so I thought… <br>
<br>
Aliens? What in the name of fuck? And now I have to run to a zone to get a port 
to a zone to get a port to another zone to run through yet MORE zones, filled 
with angry mobs that can sometimes see through invisibility? Which means a death 
and then MORE running and maybe, just MAYBE I can get in a group in about 30 
minutes or so. What the fuck happened to the clean hub system of the Planes 
expansion? And the new instanced zones are not only so fucking hard to get to 
that it RUINS the fun, they take FOREVER to do. This is now a 3 hour commitment 
at the MINIMUM if you ever want to advance. And thanks a lot for making it 
nearly impossible for some classes to play since people are so fucking adamant 
about making the “perfect group” to even complete the trials because you made it 
all such a fucking CHORE. Isn’t this a game? Isn't a game supposed to be fun and 
not an utter pain in the ass? Way to think clearly there. <br>
<br>
And ALIENS? What….the….fuck? Aliens made sense, a little, in the Luclin 
expansion. We forgave Sony because it was kinda cute that we went to the moon 
and aliens were there. Even if it made no sense that giant snakes would live in 
a zone WITHOUT ANY AIR, we forgave and forgot. Hey it was the moon, it was cute… 
BUT ONLY FOR ONE SHOT. Come on…why would anyone in their right mind put ALIENS 
into a fantasy game except as a joke? <br>
<br>
Fine, after 7 expansions I can forgive one serious fuckup like that. Chalk the 
Gates expansion up to a bad drug trip that went through Sony. Calm… breathe… 
next one will be better… go to the happy place. <br>
<br>
Happy place my ass. More fucking aliens in yet another zone full of mobs that 
want to kill me and can see through invisible as I'm trying to meet up with 
friends IF I CAN EVER GET THERE after running for God knows how long. What ever 
happened to the hub system? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FANTASY CREATURES IN A FANTASY 
WORLD? Is Sony so freaked out at the 12 people who actually play Anarchy Online 
that they had an emergency meeting and some suit screamed at the top of his 
lungs “WE WILL NOT LOSE THOSE TWELVE CUSTOMERS! THE NEXT EXPANSIONS ARE GOING TO 
BE ALL ABOUT ALIENS EVEN IF IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH A FANTASY WORLD 
GAME! WE WILL COVER ALL GENRES OR WE WILL SURELY DIE!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I mean come on…if you want to make a fucking 
game about fucking aliens then fucking make EverAlien or something. I want to 
see dragons, I want to see gods, I want to see storylines on dark elves and 
trolls and shit like that. Right now if I saw a fucking laser gun drop off of a 
mob in Wall of Alien Invasion or whatever the hell it’s called I wouldn’t be the 
least bit surprised. Yeah yeah, you gave me level 70. But that’s a halfassed 
attempt to cover up the fact that someone in the design department has run out 
of ideas and is so scared to lose their job that they won’t even ask the 
COMMUNITY what they want, but they know how to convince the Sony suits that 
their bullshit will work as long as the graphics are pretty. <br>
<br>
I have played EverQuest since beta 1, when Everfrost had Ice Giants on top of a 
mountain that weren’t even active yet, and I am probably one of the biggest fans 
of the series. But this alien nonsense is causing people, including myself, to 
lose a little faith. Why not take EverQuest for its next expansion and start 
destroying it? Make Kaladim a bloody hole in the ground! No one goes there 
anyway! Turn loose an army of dragons and demons and drachnids from below the 
world on the entire continent of Felwithe so people at least GO there again. I 
would love to wander through a city I remember from long ago and see it taken 
over by some truly horrible things. I would take that over some ALIENS that make 
ZERO sense in the fantasy genre any day. <br>
<br>
Next expansion: EVERQUEST: SPACE BATTLES!! You and your friends can craft your 
very own spaceships to fight off the incoming space aliens. New epic lightsabers!
<br>
<br>
EverQuest 2 had better not have any fucking aliens in it! And I better see that 
in writing! This is what I want to see: <br>
<br>
We, the makers of EverQuest 2 do not have our heads in our asses. We fully 
understand that a fantasy game should have no aliens in it because we realize 
that it makes us look stupid and ruins the entire premise a fantasy genre based 
game. If we run out of good ideas, we hereby promise to ask our community what 
they feel would be the coolest thing rather than assume we are smarter than 
everyone else. So sayeth us. <br>
<br>
Oh and I want that writing in blood, please. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now on to my segment we call “Ask Mr 
Smartypants” <br>
<br>
Q: As a rogue, we deal a very nice amount of DPS.. therefore i'm puzzled as to 
why we are the very last to get a group invite or a group at all? is it 
jealously? is it fear? i just dont know. <br>
-Syphin <br>
<br>
A: Take my advice; if you want a group then you need to find people who aren’t 
offended by the fact that you are a manginia. Grow some balls and a weewee 
because listening to your annoying man-voice but seeing boobs on you is 
disturbing. <br>
<br>
Q: And by the age of 6 a child knows to whip his ass after he goes &quot;poo poo&quot;, 
why after 6 years of eq people still forget to consent the almighty rogues? <br>
-Syphin <br>
<br>
A: You are an idiot. A child “WIPES” his ass not “WHIPS” his ass. Sicko. <br>
<br>
Q: What are your view on the way in which SOE chooses to cost in-store purchase 
of expansion vs online downloads and their inverse relationship in terms of 
cost? <br>
-Aramus <br>
<br>
A: Sony specifically sends out enough copies of their expansions in stores to 
cover just over the amount of pre-orders. This forces many people to pay for the 
higher cost of a download and puts more money in their pockets. Because, without 
the cost of a CD-ROM, box, manual and any added items they pocket 100% of the 
HIGHER cost than the game is in the store. See, a retail box has what are called 
COGs. Cost of Goods. <br>
<br>
So a publisher that sells a game in Best Buy for $25 only makes a few dollars 
per box after all the middle-man stuff is said and done. What this means is that 
if they limit the amount of boxes available at $25 where they only make $10, 
then they can make up the “loss” (because all execs think that paying ANYONE ANY 
amount of money is a loss) by overcharging for that same expansion online for 
$30 and rape people but good. I would estimate that the cost of download for 
them is in the PENNIES. The reason they don’t put the downloads up for less 
money is only because Wal-Mart and other big retailers would tell them to go 
take a flying fuck. <br>
<br>
My answer: Put it online for the same amount as retail, then drop the price in 
half in 3 weeks when it should be sold through at retail chains anyway. Win-win.
<br>
<br>
Q: What do you think about stores that consider the release date of games to be 
more or less the week of their release and not the actual date? I had one store 
employee say to me &quot;It's not like a movie or CD release with a fixed date.&quot; Does 
that makes sense to you? I'm confused. <br>
-Aramus <br>
<br>
A: I think that retail chain executives think ENTIRELY too much of themselves. 
And unfortunately publishers don’t have the power to threaten them. Also note 
that the store employee who told you that games are not set to a fixed date is a 
fucking moron. With rare exceptions, publishers have SPECIFIC dates they want 
the games on the shelves to best optimize sales. That can mean anything from 
guaranteeing to be out before a competitor to making sure they beat a holiday to 
generate the best sales. Tell that pretentious idiot he should be a gay 
prostitute for a living because his “asshole” is being utilized incorrectly at 
the moment. <br>
<br>
Q: how come the word for male genitalia can get past the surname filter? <br>
-Nedd <br>
<br>
A: Your life is focused on male genitalia entirely too much. Maybe living in the 
Bay Area is having too much of an affect on you. <br>
<br>
Q: Is that a greater lightstone in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
<br>
-Chantela <br>
<br>
A: The only people happy to see you would be a lynch mob. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Q: Could you please share your thoughts on the 
new 'guild tribute' feature of the expansion. <br>
-Avienda <br>
<br>
A: Good question! I think that creating a guild tribute is a great way to make 
guilds bicker and come up with absolutely stupid fucking rules on the use of the 
system. If it were up to me, I would make it so officers would ASSIGN tribute to 
people because you just KNOW some dumbass is going to fuck it up for the entire 
guild and cause even more armchair generals to want to place even more 
restrictions on a stupid idea. Eventually I see guilds flushing the idea 
entirely or breaking apart. Way to think it through, Sony! <br>
<br>
Q: Do you support yesterday's official ending of the broad U.S trade embargo on 
Libya which, among other things remove restrictions on US-Libyan air travel, 
suspends most commercial sanctions and allows US firms to invest in Libya and 
buy its oil? <br>
-Mongo <br>
<br>
A: I think the better question is “do you CARE”? No, I don’t. Politicians of any 
caliber are lower on the class scale to me than used car salesmen. <br>
<br>
Q: Are all the measurable dimensionless parameters that characterize the 
physical universe calculable in principle or are some merely determined by 
historical or quantum mechanical accident and uncalculable? <br>
-Ravann <br>
<br>
A: I would answer this but you are too stupid to understand it, so I'm not going 
to waste my time. <br>
<br>
Q: Why does it burn when I Pee? <br>
-Brendelin <br>
<br>
A: Because we poured Drain-O in your penis when you were sleeping. <br>
<br>
Q: Can you please explain why SOE decided to make Knights be closer in tanking 
ability with a ranger then with a warrior? Where are our avoidance discs? <br>
<br>
A: Because, like everyone else, Sony likes to hear Knights whine and bitch about 
what they WANT rather than what they HAVE. &nbsp; </font></p>

WELCOME TO THE NEW MESSAGE BOARDS! <br>
  <br>
Greyternal Hawkquiem welcomes you!  We are a group DEDICATED to excellence (for the first month).  As new officers in this amazing guild that we created from the ruins of our old guild and anyone else we happened to see along the way that was unguilded, we are very pleased to be here.  Specifically because if this works out like it does with other spur-of-the-moment guilds, officers make out like BANDITS with the loot! HELLS YEAH! <br>
  <br>
/hugs self <br>
  <br>
Man I cannot WAIT to get some amazing loot so I can sell my character on Ebay like so many other people do.  It’s awesome to get as much as you can from the sweat of other players then sell it on Ebay.  Then I can use that cash that others earned me and buy cool things like….ohh…. cars and stuff.  People are so impressed by how cool I am.  They are! <br>
 <br> 
This is going to be so COOL.  And when I brag to that stupid bitch at Arby’s…THIS time she better have something nice to say or BAM, I'm gonna kick her up a notch.  When I told my mom SHE was impressed at least.  It’s hard to tell sometimes… she has a naturally sarcastic voice around me.  She has since I was very young, and I used to tell her about how cool I was ganking people with my posse in Ultima Online.  Very strange how it suddenly appeared one day… <br>
 <br> 
Anyway, here we are!  A new guild with big dreams and new hopes!  Just to kick off our <b><font size=4><font color=red>NEW GUILD</font></font></b> (editor please make this a really kick ass font so I look like I know HTMEL or whatever it is you geeks use) we decided to kill QUARM!  Yeah!!!!  Here are some pictures.  In one, this guy Finneus or something wouldn’t get out of my way.  I was like “WTF NOOB UR IN MYWAY” and he was like “??”…. Fuckin n00bz.  Behind him is Quarm though.<br>
 <br>
<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/C57437DFFC4248CDB2FE43464E367F07.jpg"><br>

<br>

<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/20E55F98200F4C84BFBB5A3AECD9AABA.jpg"><br>
<br>
  
Quarm is this huge dragon with like 9 billion heads or something as you can clearly see here in these amazing pictures I took.  He breathes like every DOT known to man, and WOAAAAH he hits hard (I tanked him solo a bit, but I don’t like to brag). 
  
So we didn’t kill him or anything.  We just wanted people to see we could like totally take cool pictures of him.  WHICH WE DID!  WOOOO-YAH ™. <br>
  <br>
Oh and I took a picture of this thing that looks like a tonsil or something.  WTF!!! <br>
  
<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/746DDEE174324D0395B523DC6A09AB81.jpg"><br>
<br>
 
  
Oh if you want to join our guild and be like TOTALLY FUCKING COOL!!!! Then please send Grapaully a PM (that means personal mention for you tards out there! LOL) and tell him I TOTALLY WANT TO ROCK OUT!!! WOOO-YAH ™. <br>
  <br>
We need SKs that can play more than once a year, please.
