<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">GREY HAWKE DISBANDS!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Yes you heard it right.  We 
are done.  We decided that we are finished with EverQuest.  In fact, the guild 
leadership made the decision for the ENTIRE guild because we don’t feel that our 
guildmates should have a right to make their own decisions.  And don’t even 
bother asking to keep the name because it’s MINE and you can’t have it!  
MUAHAHAHAA!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Man, I love having an ego 
more raging than a teenage hard-on in an R-rated movie with boobies in it.<br> 
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br> 
 <![endif]></span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Anyway, we just decided 
that it was time.  We beat EverQuest and we just think it’s time to make our 
guild and all its history vanish forever.  We want to be like EVERY OTHER guild 
for once.  </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Here are some of the 
reasons that Grey Hawke is done:</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">1)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">We beat the game and we are 
bored.  We officers just feel that EverQuest is getting old for us and as you 
get older your pituitary glands or liver or whatever stop producing as much 
adrenaline.  So it’s a physical reason, first and foremost.  Since WE don’t get 
excited about the game there is no reason for anyone ELSE to want to play it.  
Right?  I hope you buy that shit because it was the best physical reason I could 
make up on the spot.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">2)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">The loot just doesn’t come in as 
fast these days.  It used to be, when we were killing all kinds of stuff and not 
letting people in our guild ever enjoy seeing what the sky looked like, we, as 
officers, would get an average of one loot per 25 minutes.  And our guildmates 
would get loot like…almost one a month if you can believe that!!!  I mean that’s 
INSANE.  But we treated those idiots well since we graciously allowed them to 
get us loot.  Hey, you have to, right?  Whiny fuckers will turn on you faster 
than a $3 whore with a crack habit if you don’t feed them table scraps 
sometimes.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">3)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">No one is impressed with us 
anymore.  I mean seriously.  I called my mom up and told her I just got a new 
piece of dope phat lewt and she was like “So?” and I was like “What do you mean 
so?” and she was like “I mean so” and I was totally like “wtf”!  Not only that, 
none of the people at McDonald’s were impressed either.  So I went to Arby’s, 
and even those bastards weren’t impressed, and they are like the bottom of the 
barrel.  WTF is going on here?  It’s almost like people don’t care how amazing I 
am in this game!  So fuck it, I need to find somewhere else to make people see 
how amazing I am because this bullshit is too much to handle right now.  I mean, 
I almost lost it on this level 4 wizard.  I was like “WTF NOOB” and he was like 
“??”.  Fucking noobs.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">4)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">RED?  BLUE?  PURPLE?  WTF? PICK 
ONE!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">5)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">NO RAIDS.  What in the name of 
peanut butter and chocolate hell is going on with the lack of raids?  I haven’t 
been on a raid in almost TWELVE MINUTES.  I mean sure, it’s a holiday weekend in 
the summertime, but why aren’t people feeding my loot bag?  YEAH SO WHAT, it’s 
nice outside.  SO WHAT that your baby hasn’t been fed in a week.  SO WHAT if you 
are only getting 2 hours sleep a night and you are going to get fired from your 
job the next time you are late.  This isn’t about YOU, you self centered pricks, 
it’s about ME and what I want.  HAS THIS WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  DID I MENTION 
IT’S BEEN OVER TWELVE MINUTES?</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">6)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">Finally, as if the other stuff 
wasn’t enough, the officers here decided we have been around too long.  We are 
the oldest remaining guild on this server. We haven’t changed our name ONCE.  
Can you BELIEVE that?  What the hell were we thinking? I mean we could have 
easily been Grey Eagle and Grey Wolf  and Grey Pony and Eternally Grey and 
Greyquiem by now but nooooooo, we had to use the SAME name like a bunch of 
sissies that were too scared to break up and splinter ourselves off into groups 
of people constantly try to cockblock and be spiteful to each other.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">So to wrap this up: Thanks 
everyone for the memories on Karana.  By the way, don’t even THINK about 
recruiting our old guildmates or we will act all pissed off and call you 
dishonorable for trying to give people we dumped a new home where they won’t be 
treated like shit.  What the hell is wrong with you?  </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><br> 
Man, some people piss me off.</span></p>

Wouldn’t it be great if it were that easy? But it ain’t, kids. It’s about as 
easy as explaining why Star Wars Episode 2 had enough redeeming qualities to 
make Episode 3 worth seeing. Maybe easier, because that is almost an 
impossibility. But I digress… <br>
<br>
In fact, getting to where we are now, Phase 5 in the Plane of Time, has been one 
of the biggest pains in the ass I could possibly imagine. A bigger pain in the 
ass than unwanted anal sex from a strange cowboy that you met in a dumpster. But 
I egress… <br>
<br>

<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/4713F2D76F54417DA233667C0C175E88.jpg"><br>
<br>
WHY is it such a pain in the ass you ask? In the first place, you gotta kill 
practically every single mob in the game a few thousand times to be high enough 
LEVEL to be able to get to the bosses of the zones that let you START the quest 
to get into Time. Then after killing the bosses for YOU, you have to kill them 
again for all your guildmates. Again and again and again it seems. It’s like an 
episode of Dawson’s Creek; it never seems to end. But I undress… <br>
<br>
And sometimes you have to go with OTHER people and kill those boss mobs when 
your guild isn’t doing it for what seems like the five billionth time. That can 
be a blessing or a curse. A blessing because once you have that flag, you don’t 
have to go again. A curse because sometimes those other guilds are completely 
incompetent to the degree you may seriously consider looking on their guild 
website to see if they have instructions on how to wipe their own asses. Not 
always… some guilds are full of great talent and good people… but some….yeesh.
<br>
So…after you kill those bosses it unlocks OTHER zones with OTHER bosses you have 
to kill that unlocks even MORE zones and bosses. Finally, in about 6 years, you 
are down to four bosses that allow you access to the Plane of It’s About Fucking 
Time. <br>
<br>
Fennin Ro (anagrammed out to Infernno) God of Fire <br>
If you do this guy right, it’s pretty bloody easy. One misstep and easy becomes 
“CONSENT YOUR ROGUES PLEASE” very quickly. And your first couple of times are 
just one giant misstep after another. Don’t feel bad, everyone screws this one 
up a few times. Beyond that I might recommend practicing in Blackburrow or 
something. <br>
<br>
Xegony (anagrammed out to Oxygen) God of Air <br>
This bitch is fun fun fun. Not only do you have to kill her, you have to kill 
all her happy little munchkins that she initializes as she dies. Not incredibly 
difficult, but not as easy as one might think if you have your head in your ass 
as much as some people seem to. <br>
<br>
Avatar of Earth (anagrammed out to Avatar of Earth) Earth guy…thing... <br>
Bring PLENTY of Clerics, tanks and Enchanters and Rogues and Rangers and Druids 
and …. well hell… bring a LOT of everything. And then block out about 30 hours 
to do it. Good luck! <br>
<br>
Coirnav (anagrammed out to Bitchface) God of Water <br>
Easily my most hated and most loved boss mob in the game. Hated because this 
event is a BITCH to kill and it kept us from Time for awhile. Loved because it’s 
keeping everyone ELSE from Time too. I can describe this event easily; 15 
minutes of total concentration and luck. Bon Apetit! <br>
OK so now once you kill all these four mobs you have to go make this stupid 
thing that is comprised of uber rare items (rare enough that Night Eternal 
bought one piece from us for 700,000 plat…which we turned around and divided up 
with every member online as a happy 10k gift per person) that combine to make a 
bag to make the part that you use to go to a zone that lets you into another 
zone that lets you into the zone you WANT to be in. Sound confusing? Try DOING 
it. <br>
<br>
Ok so once you GET to the zone you want to be in (Time), you gotta do all these 
silly events called PHASES. I'm not going to go into detail on the phases 
because I want you to figure it out like we did. But anyway once you get to a 
Phase called Phase 4, you have to kill the SAME FUCKING GODS YOU JUST KILLED NOT 
LONG AGO. WTF!!! And now…to add flavor…you are timed in your attempts. <br>
<br>
Killing two of them in Phase 4 isn’t that bad. But the last two…holy shit on a 
stick. They have been the bane of our existence for awhile. And we all know…when 
things are great, people are happy and fun and full of energy. When they are bad 
though…people leave the guild, they leave the game, they start watching fucking 
TV instead of playing in the raid, they AFK for HOURS at a time (I mean this 
literally, too). And some people pull the best thing of all…they assume you are 
a bunch of fucking idiots and try to tell you, the very same people that helped 
GET THEM WHERE THEY ARE, what the fuck is up. EVERY SINGLE ARMCHAIR ADMIRAL 
thinks they know it all, and it pisses me off. Enough that I have a little rant 
about it below. In the key of F minor. <br>
<br>
Let me give you a hint about something in life, kids. If you are unwilling to 
publicly stand up and HELP lead then sit the fuck down, and shut the fuck up. NO 
ONE WANTS TO HEAR IT unless you are willing to risk failure too. Because that’s 
what leaders do…we let EVERYONE take the credit when things go good, and assume 
all the blame when they go wrong. Sitting back in your little armchair, where 
you think you have all the answers and everyone else is a dumbshit because they 
aren’t following your master plan that you probably got off the fucking internet 
from some whacked out crack addict ANYWAY is about as stupid and arrogant a 
thing as I can imagine. And I can imagine A LOT. <br>
<br>
So sit back and enjoy the ride or help drive this crazy bus (help means being a 
part of the team, not assuming you have all the answers). Everyone is important 
in events this big, and if everyone does their part, amazing things can happen. 
If you are not the leading type, that’s ok. We want you here just as much as 
anyone. If you ARE the leader type, we appreciate and relish your help. But if 
you think you know it all and refuse to lift a finger other than to backstab, 
politic, and just basically make everyone else out to be idiots…then I have a 
nice warm cup of STFU waiting for you near the door. The same door that’s gonna 
hit you on the ass very soon… \<p>More pics:</p>
