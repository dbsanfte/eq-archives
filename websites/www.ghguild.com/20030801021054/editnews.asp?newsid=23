So, its 2am and you've been in VT for almost twelve hours at which point the zone geometry starts to look a little... different:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/blurry.jpg"><br>
<p>
and before you, magically if not biblically, the heavens part and there  stands the great MOSES, reincarnated as a mostly-afk warrior!<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/keithh.jpg"><br>
<p>
but all were not pleased by this turn of events, and forth-came Marley, father of the hawke and high deity of the gnomes, awoken from his dark eternal slumber<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/marley.jpg"><br>
<p>
but even with BOTH Moses and the Eternal-Gnome-Deity, there were some in our greyed land who were displeased, dare I say, upset... and so, in an effort to reconcile, <br>
I present the one and only, the dark mistress herself, Tatatatatatatateto

<p>
But perhaps on to more relevant, but certainly not more important, information.  Today was a week of patches, so many and of such poor quality in fact that I had to double 
check my calender to make sure some stealth expansion hadn't been released without my knowledge.  On the other hand, SoE/VI have maintained their near perfect record of being 
unable to change the smallest game feature (in this case, making sure DOORS OPEN CORRECTLY) without either deleteing bards, destroying the entire user interface, or causing fire 
beetles to drop Plane of Time loot.  You have to admire their consistency.
<p>
This patch week has also provided us with the undeniable pleasure of recieving continued customer satisfaction in the form of Sony's exclusive "bend over" in-game assistance plan.  
I for one was surprised to learn that unless a GM or guide specifically witnesses the act, you can break any and all of Everquest's rules without punishment... but I digress.
<p>
Thats not to say we've been sitting with our thumbs up our asses, as much as Stormbeard might like:

Check out Metfan in his new flaming headpiece<br>

<p>
And here's Bastage, who looks like a woman, no shocker there<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/bast.jpg"><br>
<p>
We also got a shot at Mister Inquisitor, and I have to say this was a unique experience, its not everyday you can kill seru and get a guide killed in the process<br>

Sadly, the people who won those pimp legs were far too ugly to be pictured here<br>
<p>
In other news, while Aramus assures me that I bash paladins too much, just look at this guy's profile, he's ASKING for it:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/aram.jpg"><br>
preserve, protect, yawn boring whatever, but after that you're just making up words
<p>
For comparison, here's Dasmexa's profile, exponentially better... <br>

if you're out there, we miss you Figgser, relax!<br>
