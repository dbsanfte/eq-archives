WELCOME TO THE NEW MESSAGE BOARDS! <br>
  <br>
Greyternal Hawkquiem welcomes you!  We are a group DEDICATED to excellence (for the first month).  As new officers in this amazing guild that we created from the ruins of our old guild and anyone else we happened to see along the way that was unguilded, we are very pleased to be here.  Specifically because if this works out like it does with other spur-of-the-moment guilds, officers make out like BANDITS with the loot! HELLS YEAH! <br>
  <br>
/hugs self <br>
  <br>
Man I cannot WAIT to get some amazing loot so I can sell my character on Ebay like so many other people do.  It’s awesome to get as much as you can from the sweat of other players then sell it on Ebay.  Then I can use that cash that others earned me and buy cool things like….ohh…. cars and stuff.  People are so impressed by how cool I am.  They are! <br>
 <br> 
This is going to be so COOL.  And when I brag to that stupid bitch at Arby’s…THIS time she better have something nice to say or BAM, I'm gonna kick her up a notch.  When I told my mom SHE was impressed at least.  It’s hard to tell sometimes… she has a naturally sarcastic voice around me.  She has since I was very young, and I used to tell her about how cool I was ganking people with my posse in Ultima Online.  Very strange how it suddenly appeared one day… <br>
 <br> 
Anyway, here we are!  A new guild with big dreams and new hopes!  Just to kick off our <b><font size=4><font color=red>NEW GUILD</font></font></b> (editor please make this a really kick ass font so I look like I know HTMEL or whatever it is you geeks use) we decided to kill QUARM!  Yeah!!!!  Here are some pictures.  In one, this guy Finneus or something wouldn’t get out of my way.  I was like “WTF NOOB UR IN MYWAY” and he was like “??”…. Fuckin n00bz.  Behind him is Quarm though.<br>
 <br>

<br>
  
Quarm is this huge dragon with like 9 billion heads or something as you can clearly see here in these amazing pictures I took.  He breathes like every DOT known to man, and WOAAAAH he hits hard (I tanked him solo a bit, but I don’t like to brag). 
  
So we didn’t kill him or anything.  We just wanted people to see we could like totally take cool pictures of him.  WHICH WE DID!  WOOOO-YAH ™. <br>
  <br>
Oh and I took a picture of this thing that looks like a tonsil or something.  WTF!!! <br>
  
<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/746DDEE174324D0395B523DC6A09AB81.jpg"><br>
<br>
 
  
Oh if you want to join our guild and be like TOTALLY FUCKING COOL!!!! Then please send Grapaully a PM (that means personal mention for you tards out there! LOL) and tell him I TOTALLY WANT TO ROCK OUT!!! WOOO-YAH ™. <br>
  <br>
We need SKs that can play more than once a year, please.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">GREY HAWKE DISBANDS!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Yes you heard it right.  We 
are done.  We decided that we are finished with EverQuest.  In fact, the guild 
leadership made the decision for the ENTIRE guild because we don’t feel that our 
guildmates should have a right to make their own decisions.  And don’t even 
bother asking to keep the name because it’s MINE and you can’t have it!  
MUAHAHAHAA!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Man, I love having an ego 
more raging than a teenage hard-on in an R-rated movie with boobies in it.<br> 
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br> 
 <![endif]></span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Anyway, we just decided 
that it was time.  We beat EverQuest and we just think it’s time to make our 
guild and all its history vanish forever.  We want to be like EVERY OTHER guild 
for once.  </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Here are some of the 
reasons that Grey Hawke is done:</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">1)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">We beat the game and we are 
bored.  We officers just feel that EverQuest is getting old for us and as you 
get older your pituitary glands or liver or whatever stop producing as much 
adrenaline.  So it’s a physical reason, first and foremost.  Since WE don’t get 
excited about the game there is no reason for anyone ELSE to want to play it.  
Right?  I hope you buy that shit because it was the best physical reason I could 
make up on the spot.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">2)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">The loot just doesn’t come in as 
fast these days.  It used to be, when we were killing all kinds of stuff and not 
letting people in our guild ever enjoy seeing what the sky looked like, we, as 
officers, would get an average of one loot per 25 minutes.  And our guildmates 
would get loot like…almost one a month if you can believe that!!!  I mean that’s 
INSANE.  But we treated those idiots well since we graciously allowed them to 
get us loot.  Hey, you have to, right?  Whiny fuckers will turn on you faster 
than a $3 whore with a crack habit if you don’t feed them table scraps 
sometimes.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">3)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">No one is impressed with us 
anymore.  I mean seriously.  I called my mom up and told her I just got a new 
piece of dope phat lewt and she was like “So?” and I was like “What do you mean 
so?” and she was like “I mean so” and I was totally like “wtf”!  Not only that, 
none of the people at McDonald’s were impressed either.  So I went to Arby’s, 
and even those bastards weren’t impressed, and they are like the bottom of the 
barrel.  WTF is going on here?  It’s almost like people don’t care how amazing I 
am in this game!  So fuck it, I need to find somewhere else to make people see 
how amazing I am because this bullshit is too much to handle right now.  I mean, 
I almost lost it on this level 4 wizard.  I was like “WTF NOOB” and he was like 
“??”.  Fucking noobs.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">4)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">RED?  BLUE?  PURPLE?  WTF? PICK 
ONE!</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">5)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">NO RAIDS.  What in the name of 
peanut butter and chocolate hell is going on with the lack of raids?  I haven’t 
been on a raid in almost TWELVE MINUTES.  I mean sure, it’s a holiday weekend in 
the summertime, but why aren’t people feeding my loot bag?  YEAH SO WHAT, it’s 
nice outside.  SO WHAT that your baby hasn’t been fed in a week.  SO WHAT if you 
are only getting 2 hours sleep a night and you are going to get fired from your 
job the next time you are late.  This isn’t about YOU, you self centered pricks, 
it’s about ME and what I want.  HAS THIS WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  DID I MENTION 
IT’S BEEN OVER TWELVE MINUTES?</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in"> 
<span style="font-family: Arial">6)<span style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"">     
</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial">Finally, as if the other stuff 
wasn’t enough, the officers here decided we have been around too long.  We are 
the oldest remaining guild on this server. We haven’t changed our name ONCE.  
Can you BELIEVE that?  What the hell were we thinking? I mean we could have 
easily been Grey Eagle and Grey Wolf  and Grey Pony and Eternally Grey and 
Greyquiem by now but nooooooo, we had to use the SAME name like a bunch of 
sissies that were too scared to break up and splinter ourselves off into groups 
of people constantly try to cockblock and be spiteful to each other.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">So to wrap this up: Thanks 
everyone for the memories on Karana.  By the way, don’t even THINK about 
recruiting our old guildmates or we will act all pissed off and call you 
dishonorable for trying to give people we dumped a new home where they won’t be 
treated like shit.  What the hell is wrong with you?  </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><br> 
Man, some people piss me off.</span></p>
