This update is a little late coming, and its not pants' fault, its mine and I apologize.  Its been a pretty amazing week, with us finally breaking into the elemental planes.  Its 
strange, during the RZ fight I could feel it, I think everyone could feel it, almost right away.  It reminded me of our first victory against the Emporer in Ssra, at like 80% 
life I already knew we were going to win, and as his life continued to drop you could tell everyone could feel it, hearts racing, swearing in guild chat.  It was intense and 
I'd be lieing if it didn't feel... contrived.  I believe it was fate that brought us to that point.  I believe that that night held for every one of us, the very meaning of our 
lives.  This is a war, and we are soilders.  What if tomorrow, the war could be over?  Isn't that worth fighting for?  Isn't that worth dieing.... oops wrong speech<br>
<p>
I know what you're thinking... I can't believe he made a matrix joke.  Oh well, thats enough from me... <br>

Dear MSP,<br> 
<p>
Why ru such a fag?<br> 
<p>
Anonymous<br>

REPLY<br> 
Well Anonymous (who actually used an untraceable email unlike the first emailer), before I reply to your email I want to commend you on a truly spectacular grasp of the 
English language. Your eloquent prose truly moved me, and your mom and I are very proud of you. We will be even more proud when you graduate Jr. High! Personally, I just 
think you are there because the kids like that you are old enough to buy beer. <br>
<p>
Anyway, why am I such a fag? Well, it depends on how you define fag. I am going to assume you mean fag like the verb fag which means “to droop”. Well I'm droopy because 
I don’t work out as much as I should. I'm on a diet though, so it won’t be for long. And then your mom will start paying me full price again…. <br>
<p>
…ohhhh…<br> 
<p>
I see! You are concerned about your mom spending all of her money on me, and you won’t be able to buy the other kids beer because your mom is such a slut she has to have that 
big ol “MSP shlong of love” at every opportunity. <br>
<p>
Tell you what, I will eat this donut. I hope that helps.<br>
