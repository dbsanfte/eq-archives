You know what really pisses me off? Ok… I admit… a LOT of things piss me off. 
But today, I want to talk about drivers. Other people who drive usually piss me 
off.<br>
<br>
I admit it, I drive relatively fast. Not like “push it to the floor” fast, but 
more like “as fast as it looks like I can travel within reason” fast. The speed 
limit here on freeways is 60. So I go 65-70. But there always has to be some 
stupid motherfucker right in front of me that has decided that 60 really means 
“between 45 and 55 as long as I stay in the fast lane”.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck is it that these people seem to drive in front of me every single 
fucking night I go home? I think it’s a conspiracy of some kind. But I am 
working on fixing it. I have developed a rather attractive steel and aluminum 
hat that I wear now to ward off any of these conspirators reading my mind so 
they don’t know when I'm going to travel. NO LONGER will I be stopped from 
getting home in time to make raids into Vex Thall, or Solusek Ro (WE KILLED THAT 
MOTHERFUCKER SO SWEET).<br>
<br>
But maybe by announcing “Mr Deathray Stopper” (what I call my cool hat) I have 
just fucked myself and they will figure out a way to read my mind anyway. Or 
maybe they will just post spies like they used to when I wore all polyester 
suits for those 6 months (polyester isn’t as good as aluminum foil but it LOOKS 
good in greens and browns). YEAH I SAW YOUR SPIES! YOU CAN’T FOOL ME! HAHA!<br>
<br>
SITTING UP THERE PRETENDING TO BE COPS OR JOGGERS OR TELEPHONE REPAIRMEN OR OLD 
LADIES WALKING DOGS! Ok, yeah, the COP was real. I found that out when I started 
throwing things at him and yelling “I SEE YOU, YOU SPYING MOTHERFUCKER! HERE! 
SPY ON THIS FUCKING ROCK! HAHA! HEY! SPIES GET HANDCUFFS? WHAT THE FUCK?” I 
think he was a GOVERNMENT spy though, to be fair. <br>
<br>
But that old lady spy was cute. HER ROBOT DOG WENT DOWN! DOWN LIKE A…well a dead 
dog I guess. It must have been very sophisticated technology.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah… I hate people who drive slow, man. They piss 
me off.<br>
<br>

Dear MSP, <br>
<br>
Do you think that current state of sociological public policy in this country 
sufficiently takes into account the ramifications of well-established but not so 
well-known psychological phenomena such as learned helplessness and cognitive 
biases? I am particularly concerned about these conditions as they relate to the 
proliferation and normalization of American media.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scott Rollins<br>

****<br>
Dear Scott “Henry” Rollins,<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful email you clearly spent at least 5 minutes on. Excellent use 
of a Thesaurus! Keep up the good work. <br>
<br>
As for the answer to your question, no of course the current state of public 
policy currently imposed on us by the American media doesn’t take into account 
that they are creating cognitive biases. The American media, although not solely 
responsible for these type of heinous actions, have stripped the archetypal 
American down to its most base level of perspicacity, and is clearly bent more 
on dynamic and dramatic posturing rather than clear and veracious fact. However, 
I feel just as strongly that this is due greatly in part to the education system 
working parallel to the media.<br>
<br>
For good references, I suggest reading “the deliberate dumbing down of America” 
by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt. Oh, and thanks for giving me the word “fucktard” 
to use about a year ago. It seems to have caught on, oddly.<br>

Dear MSP,<br>
<br>
Can you make Hammeron fall head over heels in love<br>
with me? If not, can you atleast make him give me<br>
head? If not, can YOU please give me head?<br>
<br>
Look man, I really want some love and/or some head.<br>
<br>
Can you arrange it, especially if you can get it from<br>
Hammeron.<br>
Thanks for your time and patience.<br>
<br>
-Biljac Dogfood-<br>
<br>
<br>
****<br>
Dear Biljac,<br>
<br>
I think that the way to make Hammeron fall in love with you is to stop being 
such a pansy and tell him how you feel. Just say “Hammeron, I love you. Or at 
least like you enough to allow you to give me oral pleasure.” I think you will 
find that a direct approach here can have positive results!<br>
<br>
As for me giving you head, I am afraid that I am spoken for, but I appreciate 
the offer. <br>

This update is a little late coming, and its not pants' fault, its mine and I apologize.  Its been a pretty amazing week, with us finally breaking into the elemental planes.  Its 
strange, during the RZ fight I could feel it, I think everyone could feel it, almost right away.  It reminded me of our first victory against the Emporer in Ssra, at like 80% 
life I already knew we were going to win, and as his life continued to drop you could tell everyone could feel it, hearts racing, swearing in guild chat.  It was intense and 
I'd be lieing if it didn't feel... contrived.  I believe it was fate that brought us to that point.  I believe that that night held for every one of us, the very meaning of our 
lives.  This is a war, and we are soilders.  What if tomorrow, the war could be over?  Isn't that worth fighting for?  Isn't that worth dieing.... oops wrong speech<br>
<p>
I know what you're thinking... I can't believe he made a matrix joke.  Oh well, thats enough from me... <br>

Dear MSP,<br> 
<p>
Why ru such a fag?<br> 
<p>
Anonymous<br> 
<p>
REPLY<br> 
Well Anonymous (who actually used an untraceable email unlike the first emailer), before I reply to your email I want to commend you on a truly spectacular grasp of the 
English language. Your eloquent prose truly moved me, and your mom and I are very proud of you. We will be even more proud when you graduate Jr. High! Personally, I just 
think you are there because the kids like that you are old enough to buy beer. <br>
<p>
Anyway, why am I such a fag? Well, it depends on how you define fag. I am going to assume you mean fag like the verb fag which means “to droop”. Well I'm droopy because 
I don’t work out as much as I should. I'm on a diet though, so it won’t be for long. And then your mom will start paying me full price again…. <br>
<p>
…ohhhh…<br> 
<p>
I see! You are concerned about your mom spending all of her money on me, and you won’t be able to buy the other kids beer because your mom is such a slut she has to have that 
big ol “MSP shlong of love” at every opportunity. <br>
<p>
Tell you what, I will eat this donut. I hope that helps.<br>

Hammer here, and its been a very exciting week.  After spending quite a bit of time working on the Rallos Zek script, the only thing between us and the elemental 
planes, we finally got to the "fake" RZ:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/fakeRZ.jpg"><br>
<p>
He fell quickly, bringing us to the warlord himself and an amazing battle.  I must say, I thought we did pretty well for out first attempt<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/RZTW59.jpg"><br>
<p>
I really wish I could make movies of EQ because Rallos does a crazy cool animation with his axe where he tosses it up and catches it and then swings it around.  Another mob 
that has an outstanding animation is Arlyxir in Solusek Ro's Tower<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/arlyxir.jpg"><br>
<p>
The swooping attack on it is phenomenal<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/arlyxir1.jpg"><br>
<p>
We've also killed Tallon, Saryrn, and Mith Marr recently:

<p>
Out of the few emails I got since my first post, this one was the funniest.<br>
<p>
Mr Smartypants,<br>
<p>
Who are the people in EQ that influenced you the most?<br>
<p>
Anonymous<br>
<p>
Well, Anonymous, the first thing I can tell you is that if you send an anonymous email, don't use an email address with what is obviously your EQ character's name.  
It kinda makes the whole "anonymous" thing not quite as effective.  <br>
<p>
Regardless, I will answer your question.  I don't think anyone really INFLUENCED me at all in EQ.  I mean, I have some people who made EQ fun, but I honestly cannot say 
anyone influenced me.  Although, there are a few people that really kept my energy high, and a few people I would thank along the way for giving me some good insights 
and laughs.  <br>
<p>
For example, thanks to LARINY for letting me use your password so we could look at the Nightbane boards.  Got some really good stuff from there, and I appreciate it.  
It's a shame they booted you from Night Eternal, though.<br>
<p>
Another person I would thank would be ZFALCON.  Every time I needed someone to be my bitch, there you were.  Thanks.  Probably one of the funniest egomaniacal liars of 
all time.  Don't get me wrong, I don't miss you one bit.  I just enjoyed watching your foot as you tried to talk around it.<br>
<p>
And hmmm who else?  In GH, I would have to thank HOOLOOVU.  A strange person, but fun as hell to torture people with.  If you ever want to hear a creative use of the 
English language, talk to Hoo.<br>
<p>
Oh and I can't forget STORMBEARD.  In some ways it's too bad that we never really got into a heated argument.  At least he would have given me a run for my money.  
I'm betting his posts made me laugh more than mine did for him. <br>
<p>
Finally, I would have to thank the awesome people who would send me all the inside dirt on your guilds.  It really made some of my more memorable posts just amazingly 
easy.  I always enjoyed watching some of the ego filled shitheads spluttering and fuming when you helped me spill all the good juicy bits of their idiocy to the rest 
of the world.  Remember kids, people LOVE to see others fail.  It makes for great drama.  When you treat others like shit, don't be too shocked when those same people 
will ram that plug up your ass at the first available opportunity.<br>
<p>
Until next time!<br>
