You have downloaded the most comprehensive in game list of locations for everquest.

First off, I want to give credit to Athee, who developed the format on which I built the PoP addons.

Second, All you have to do is place the EQUI_FeedbackWnd.xml in a custom skins directory in your everquest folder. This can be an existing skin, or if you have no custom skins this will be a new folder.

Once in game, type /loadskin "foldername" 
where foldername is the name of the folder from >>  \everquest\uifiles\foldername

Then you have to reposition your windows and alpha settings etc, sorry :(


To open the locations window, simply type /f and hit enter.

Enjoy!!
