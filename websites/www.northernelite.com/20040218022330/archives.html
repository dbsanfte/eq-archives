	<p>At last! The Northern Elite now has a functional, attractive and multi-faceted EZBoard to replace the awkward, dysfunctional BraveNet forums.</p>
	<p>Once upon a time, BraveNet was a happy place. Small, hip and unassuming, they provided well-built applications, free of charge and reliable, to overworked webmistresses everywhere. Alas, BraveNet has grown. And while they still provide the same services (plus some) with the same no-fee ease (if you don't mind the omni-present advertising), they have become anything but reliable. Servers down, applications not functioning properly and a whole host of other issues, if you didn't notice, began causing communication gaps and long, frustrating delays in information flow that do a guild no good at all.</p>
	<p>So one day, in the midst of yet another attempt at revamping the existing forums, the Webmistress gets a note from Sumatai, reading simply: "Right now I am building an EZBoard Forum for us because a few members have been having problems viewing the boards.  Plus, I like the EZBoard layout as well.  You can take a look at it...it is still in it's VERY early stages." And the Webmistress looked, and was pleased. VERY pleased. Kudos, Suma! Your proactivity and dilligence have proven, yet again, to be a huge asset to the guild.</p>
	<p>As for your posts and memories of old, they still reside on the BraveNet servers but are inactive, so that you might keep track of things said, old ideas, etcetera, while enjoying the better functionality and so on of Suma's brilliant EZBoard. The old BraveNet forums will be linked as archives off the main forum entry page of the scrolls.</p>
	<p>Good day to you all, and happy posting!</p>

	<p>A ceremony to welcome rogue officer Sumatai as the new Chieftan of the Northern Elite, and to commemorate the founding Chieftan Anguss MacShield, will be held on Saturday, August 3, starting at 11:30pm EST. A location of the ceremony has yet to be determined, though (and the Webmistress is guessing here) it is likely to take place on the Halas ramp in EverFrost.</p>
	<p>The change in leadership has been long in arriving, as MacShield has been hesitant to let his beloved guild family go though RL priorities have called him away. On Monday, June 29th however, the course was set as he made the journey to Luclin in order to pass the leadership torch to officer Shabay Icebreaker until she may in turn hand it off to Sumatai.</p>
	<p>Sumatai, a founding member of the Elite and reigning rogue class officer, is highly skilled and trusted by his fellow Elites, and will undoubtedly make the transition to guild leader with unprecedented grace and ease. Between his recent drive to secure the Northern Elite a place in the Fellowship of Guilds and his understanding of the founding priciples of NE, Suma is a wonderful choice to lead the Elite both in battle and in politics, and will make a fatastic Chieftan, carrying Anguss's legacy onward and upward.</p>

	<p><i>As submitted on the general message board by Snowminx</i></p>
	<p>Hail Elite! The fireside storytelling event has been moved to Sunday, June 30, at 10:00 p.m. est., so that it doesn't conflict with the Fellowship Mistmore raid going on on Friday. I hope this is more accomodating to everyone's schedule and that we'll have a good turn out.</p>
	<p>To recap, if you'll be attending, please come with the intent to stay in character for the duration and with a story to tell about your Barbarian personna. Also, as an aside, why don't we invite those whom we are considering for membership to come and observe?</p>
	<p>This event will be held around one of the campfires at the base of the Halas ramp. Who knows, maybe our tales will spark the curiosity of fellow Barbarians and perhaps bring to us others worthy of being called Elite!</p>
	<p>p.s. oh yea, an' bring ale...lots o' ale. Tellin' tales is thirsty work!! Rum is good too...</p>

	<p>In a ceremony conducted in true Elite style, the Northern Elite inducted three worthy young warriors last night, after promoting a deserving shamaness to the position of officer and High Advisor to the Chieftan. Taking center stage in the induction circle on the Halas ramp to recieve official membership from Warrior Officer Shabay Icebreaker, Kumedor, Kergan, and Dalehaggis were recieved with cheers and much fanfare prior to a ceremonial excursion into the tundra to slay Redwind and the Ice Giants. Having proven themselves to be Elite material, all three are sure serve the guild well and continue the legacy of the Elite.</p>
	<p>Before the induction festivities even began however, an important and well-deserved shift in the ranks occurred as Chieftan Anguss MacShield promoted Shamaness Snowminx WintersHope to the honored postion of officer and High Advisor. Snowminx, serving as a link between the generations of the Elite and an all-around worthy Northwoman/Shamaness/tailor/member, will no doubt perform her duties with her usual flair and aptitude.</p>
	<p>Congratulations, Minx, and welcome, new warriors!</p>

After a long night of hunting and resurrections in the Stonebrunt Mountains, <a href="darwal.html" target="_blank">Darwal Rillidey</a> of Tunare's Legionnaires, forced to leave the world due to a RL career move, divided his estate and made his final camp surrounded by friends and family.</p>
	<p>Those of us who know and love Darwal will miss him terribly, but it is rumored that he leaves with the hope of accomplishing as much in RL as he did in Norrath, and will no doubt be valued and honored as much wherever he goes. Ever noble and brave, willing to help wherever needed, thoughtful, kind, and generous, Darwal will be a tremendous asset to any world he enters. While Norrath will not be the same without him, it is far better off for having known him.</p>

	<p>Time for a little change of scenery. We will begin moving to Freeport to set it up as our field base for operations this week for raids in Lavastorm, Faydwer, the Desert of Ro, Kunark and Velious. Freeport offers our 20+ members a lot of benefits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Freeport (and the surrounding area) is a new city which many have yet to explore</li>
		<li>There is great support for every manner of trade skills</li>
		<li>There are nice soloing opportunities in the Desert (Sand Giants anyone?)</li>
		<li>The docks to Velious are in the desert</li>
		<li>The boat to Faydwer (and ultimately, Kunark) leaves from here. This is also a convenient place for us to team up with our allies from Tunare's Legionairres so we can practice fighting with clerics, wizards, enchanters and bards.</li>
		<li>Lavastorm is a barren place, the antithesis of Everfrost. It is HOT. Nothing in the zone will aggro. Be sure to use levitate if you feel you might accidentally fall in a lava pit (this is hard to do). But, the dungeon of Najena provides a good training ground and some Totemic items (terror splines). Once we have conquered Najena we will be ready to take Sol A, a good dungeon filled with the fire goblin cousins of our own ice goblins in Perma. Excellent loot and XP. These goblins are ten levels higher than the ones in Perma. The dungeon is ruled by Lord Nagafen, the other dragon of Antonica, the fire version of Lady Vox.</li>
		<li>All shaman spells found in the Oasis will be close by.</li>
		<li>All shaman spells found in the Oasis will be close by.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On the way to Freeport from Halas, DO NOT CROSS Kithicor Forest at night (for those of us that do not know this piece of wisdom). If possible, bind in HPH or Rivervale on the way to Freeport just in case...</p>
	<p>To pass through the East Commonlands (off of Freeport) to Lavastorm, you must pass through the zone of the dark elves. We are KOS in this zone. Take care to either run along the left zone wall, use invis, sneak and hide, whatever is easiest to avoid confrontation in Nektolus forest zone on the way to Lavastorm. If you do get attacked by the guard near the commonlands zone, or should you choose to fight him, he can be beaten by any two or three of our members with a little effort, so use the buddy system to travel through here. A good idea is to visit <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">www.eqatlas.com</a> and print out some maps of Nektolus, Lavastorm, Freeport, Najena and Sol A.</p>
	<p>Please try to begin assembling in Freeport at the earliest possible time. Once we have sufficient strength, we can begin fighting together in this new area. Aside from Lavastorm, a few forrays to Kunark are made easier by being located here near the boats. Also, anyone who wishes to fight in the Ocean of Tears will find this new home base convenient.</p>

	<p>WOOT! True, it took a while, but the Northern Elite was finally granted official guild status on Saturday, April 6. In a tremendous display of fellowship, patience, and determination, thirteen members-in-waiting gathered on the Blackburrow ramp in Everfrost to show their approval to the gods in order to finalize the formation of the Northern Elite, their hours of waiting rewarded not only with guild tags and the ensuing, celebratory Permafrost raid, but with a lifetime of brotherhood and sisterhood yet to come.</p>
	<p>The festivities began, a couple hours earlier than planned, with Anguss MacShield planting his warrior butt on the BB ramp in order to start gathering members for the initiation ceremony and to petition the gods for support. It became apparent that the early starting hour was a good idea when the schedules 7:00pm EST came around with still no word from said gods, but members-to-be kept cool and entertained each other during the long and frustrating wait. By the time the gods could finally be coaxed into sending a representative down to grace the ceremony, the hour was growing quite late and some waiting Barbarians had already come and gone due to unavoidable prior commitments, but in the end the requisite ten were present, and Anguss was able to receive his long awaited guild leader tag. (Thanks go to Snout the druid for not only porting Absu in to make the ceremony, but for advising Anguss and Gisela as to how they might better gain the attention of the gods.) Immediately following his tagging, Anguss inducted the remaining twelve members, asking them to pledge thier support and fellowship in the name of the Northern Elite. Inductees were levitated as they joined, and there wsa much food and drink in celebration.</p> 
	<p>As a first guild-wide act, new members raided Permafrost in a strikingly successful night of goblin hunting. Joining them in a symbolic and much-appreciated show of solidarity was Temolin the bard, guild leader of Tunare's Legionnaires, a most honorable and formidable fighter and healer whose songs not only kept up morale but, in a few instances, kept some Elites alive.<p>
	<p>The founding members are as follows, in alphabetical order: Absu, Anguss (Chieftan), Balthur (Officer), Gindadar, Gisela, Jinen (Officer), Kayce, Oana, Shabay, Sudan, Sumatai (Officer), Thoxira (Officer), and Vilis.</p>

(Oh, and we need a minimum of ten to show your shining faces before the gods will bless Anguss with his tag.)</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>When:</b> Saturday, April 6, 7:00pm EST</li>
	<li><b>Where:</b> Ceremony will take place on the Blackburrow entrance ramp in Everfrost.</li>
	<li><b>Who should attend:</b> All who have been invited into the Northern Elite. "Members in waiting" under 15 seasons of experience should attend, but will not receive the guild tag at this time.</li>
	<li><b>What exactly will take place:</b> First, we must gather at the ramp. When the first ten Barbarians have arrived, Anguss will be able to petition the gods for final approval of the Northern Elite as an official entity. Once approved, he will receive the guild tag through an act of divine (GM, anyway) intervention. At this point, the guild will be completely official and Anguss will be able to bestow the tag upon the pre-selected members.</li>
	<li><b>What else:</b> What else? This being our first planned event as a guild, it will be what we make of it. Aside from the giving and receiving of tags, there will be plenty of song, dance, drink, gift-giving and levitation.</li>
	<li><b>What more:</b> A post-ceremony raid will take place. Details will be released soon.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Upon arrival at the Blackburrow ramp for the ceremony, members should tune into the Northern Elite custom chat channel. (To do this, type /join NorthernElite. To communicate within the chat channel, type /1 and your message, where 1 is the number in front of the channel name when you join.)</p>
	<p>That's pretty much it. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the initiation ceremony, please feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:anguss@northernelite.com">Anguss</a> or <a href="mailto:gisela@northernelite.com">Gisela</a>, or contact them in-game.</p>

	<p>The first official steps were taken yesterday to make the heretofore theoretical Northern Elite quite a striking reality. That's right folks, the process has begun, kicked off at 7:30pm EST yesterday by soon-to-be guild leader Anguss MacShield, squatting the Elite chat channel for nearly two hours while other potential members were rounded up in order to show their approval. A thunderous round of applause is due Jinen the rogue for patiently executing said rounding.</p>
	<p>What next, you ask? For the moment, it is simply a matter of awaiting the final approval of the GMs. Thanks to the requisite ten player approvals, the request for guild-hood has been submitted. Now, we must wait for word from MacShield, who is waiting to hear from the GM who can give him the very first Northern Elite guild tag. From there, MacShield will be able to distribute the tag to the other guild members, and we shall truly be official.</p></td>

	<p>Hail! An unsuspecting Norrath will soon hear a mighty roar from the generally quiet and unassuming northland of Halas. The best of the best of the frozen city's daughters and sons are grouping, gathering force, and in the coming days will begin to unleash their Barbarian power upon the world under the name of the Northern Elite.</p>
	<p>Until now, Halas has been seriously lacking in terms of a coherent, Barbarian only guild. The aim of the Northern Elite is to bring honor and glory back to the mother land of the Barbarians, regaining necessary emphasis on the Barbarian culture, language and traditions.  To find out more about the Northern Elite, visit the <a href="about-basics.html">About</a> scrolls here. If you are a Barbarian of the Firiona Vie server with at least fifteen seasons of training and would like to join the force, please read the <a href="membership.html">Membership</a> scrolls for guidelines and to learn what you may expect, and what the guild may expect of you.</p>
	<p>As the Northern Elite is a new guild, there are things we will all be learning as we go along. The scrolls here, as well, will grow and change to fit the needs of the Elite. Links that go nowhere and annoying popup ads on the forums, for example, will all go away soon and be replaced with far more useful material. Once the login form is functional, members will be assigned a password and the Elite only area will be filled and fully protected. Members will also soon be able to upload screen shots to add to the <a href="screenies.html">gallery</a>, although for now if you have shots to contribute, please e-mail them (or, er, um, send them via carrier swallow) directly to the <a href="mailto:gisela@northernelite.com">Webmistress</a>. One screen shot will be chosen weekly to be featured as the freeze frame of the week on the home scroll.</p>
	<p>If any guild member has Northern Elite related news to share and would like it featured as a headline here, please send your release to the Webmistress via the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>.</p>
