	Candidates of the appropriate race, class, and alignment who have at least 15 seasons of training may apply for membership in Northern Elite. The applicant must be recommended for membership by at least two current members who have fought alongside the applicant.  The applicant’s name, sponsors, and written recommendations will be posted for members only - current members will be allowed to post comments about the candidate on the membership discussion board before a decision is made to invite the applicant to join Northern Elite as a probationary member with a guild tag. Admission will ultimately be determined by a vote among the officers of the Northern Elite.
