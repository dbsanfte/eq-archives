	<p>A ceremony to welcome rogue officer Sumatai as the new Chieftan of the Northern Elite, and to commemorate the founding Chieftan Anguss MacShield, will be held on Saturday, August 3, starting at 11:30pm EST. A location of the ceremony has yet to be determined, though (and the Webmistress is guessing here) it is likely to take place on the Halas ramp in EverFrost.</p>
	<p>The change in leadership has been long in arriving, as MacShield has been hesitant to let his beloved guild family go though RL priorities have called him away. On Monday, June 29th however, the course was set as he made the journey to Luclin in order to pass the leadership torch to officer Shabay Icebreaker until she may in turn hand it off to Sumatai.</p>
	<p>Sumatai, a founding member of the Elite and reigning rogue class officer, is highly skilled and trusted by his fellow Elites, and will undoubtedly make the transition to guild leader with unprecedented grace and ease. Between his recent drive to secure the Northern Elite a place in the Fellowship of Guilds and his understanding of the founding priciples of NE, Suma is a wonderful choice to lead the Elite both in battle and in politics, and will make a fatastic Chieftan, carrying Anguss's legacy onward and upward.</p>
