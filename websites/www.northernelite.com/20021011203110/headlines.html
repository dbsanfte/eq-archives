	<td align="left" class="text">Once upon a time, BraveNet was a happy place. Small, hip and unassuming, they provided well-built applications, free of charge and reliable, to overworked webmistresses everywhere. Alas, BraveNet has grown. And while they still provide the same services (plus some) with the same no-fee ease (if you don't mind the omni-present advertising), they have become anything but reliable. Servers down, applications not functioning properly and a whole host of other issues, if you didn't notice, began causing communication gaps and long, frustrating delays in information flow that do a guild no good at all.</td>

<tr>
	<td align="left" class="text">So one day, in the midst of yet another attempt at revamping the existing forums, the Webmistress gets a note from Sumatai, reading simply: "Right now I am building an EZBoard Forum for us because a few members have been having problems viewing the boards.  Plus, I like the EZBoard layout as well.  You can take a look at it...it is still in it's VERY early stages." And the Webmistress looked, and was pleased. VERY pleased. Kudos, Suma! Your proactivity and dilligence have proven, yet again, to be a huge asset to the guild.</td>

<tr>
	<td align="left" class="text">As for your posts and memories of old, they still reside on the BraveNet servers but are inactive, so that you might keep track of things said, old ideas, etcetera, while enjoying the better functionality and so on of Suma's brilliant EZBoard. The old BraveNet forums will be linked as archives off the main forum entry page of the scrolls.</td>

	<p>A ceremony to welcome rogue officer Sumatai as the new Chieftan of the Northern Elite, and to commemorate the founding Chieftan Anguss MacShield, will be held on Saturday, August 3, starting at 11:30pm EST. A location of the ceremony has yet to be determined, though (and the Webmistress is guessing here) it is likely to take place on the Halas ramp in EverFrost.</p>
	<p>The change in leadership has been long in arriving, as MacShield has been hesitant to let his beloved guild family go though RL priorities have called him away. On Monday, June 29th however, the course was set as he made the journey to Luclin in order to pass the leadership torch to officer Shabay Icebreaker until she may in turn hand it off to Sumatai.</p>
	<p>Sumatai, a founding member of the Elite and reigning rogue class officer, is highly skilled and trusted by his fellow Elites, and will undoubtedly make the transition to guild leader with unprecedented grace and ease. Between his recent drive to secure the Northern Elite a place in the Fellowship of Guilds and his understanding of the founding priciples of NE, Suma is a wonderful choice to lead the Elite both in battle and in politics, and will make a fatastic Chieftan, carrying Anguss's legacy onward and upward.</p>
