        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">The greatest question
        that we ever ask ourselves in this life is &#147;Who am I?&#146;
        Some of us seek to find the answers in the words of gods,
        others in the workings of nature. Yet many more never
        stop to even ask this question, so great is their fear
        that they might find an answer, and that that answer
        would destroy what little security they have in this
        world. </font></p>

        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">Who am I? I am Vaelle
        Pixiebane, ranger of Kithcor, mistress of the whip and
        Ogre therapist. But there is a more banal truth to my
        existence than that. I am a creature that was born, and a
        creature that will die. Eventually, the world will not
        remember that I existed. That is the great horrible truth
        that we all face in our lives. I have chosen to accept it
        not with the fatality displayed by so many of my kindred,
        but with a loving embrace of that truth. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">Now, don&#146;t
        misunderstand, I am no worshiper of Innoruk who sees
        death as a blessing, rather, I use my acceptance of my
        mortality to drive me to greater deeds while I am still
        alive. Truth be told though, life is not always easy to
        live. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">As a child, I was
        plagued by pixies in my birth city of Kelethin. The vile
        misfits would berate me at all hours of the day, pouring
        honey into my hair, putting pine needles into my pillow
        and mattress and other minor yet maddening annoyances. I
        never understood then why they hated me so much, that
        knowledge came much later. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">When I was but five
        summers old, several pixies kidnapped me from my bed and
        tied me down to the top of the wizard&#146;s pyramid on
        the road between Felwithe and the Butcherblock mountains.
        I was trapped up there for nearly two days before the
        search party of rangers found and rescued me. My parents
        took me home then, but I was much changed. I neither
        spoke nor slept, ever fearful that the pixies would
        return as soon as I shut my eyes. Several times, in my
        madness, I insisted that I could fly away and tried to
        hurl myself off of the platforms of the City. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">There was nothing that
        the Druids could do for me, the sickness was not in my
        body but in my mind, and so they counciled my parents to
        send me to the far away island of Odus, where hopefully
        the learned clerics there could save me from myself. That
        same night, a great spell was cast on my mother and me,
        and we were instantaneously transported into Toxxulia
        Forest. We were brought before the clerics of Prexus and
        Quellious, who examined me carefully before bearing any
        news to my mother. They could cure me, yes, but it may
        take years. If the job were to be done right, it would be
        best for her to leave me in their care until I was fit to
        return home. With a heavy heart, my mother agreed, and
        began the long journey home to Kelethin. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">My years in Erudin
        where hard, the clerics trained me as they would one of
        their own children, expecting nothing less than
        perfection in a variety of disciplines. By the time I
        left the hallowed halls of the great Erudin Library
        nearly a decade later, I spoke dozens of languages, and
        had a great understanding of the nature of the world. I
        adored the cold civilized walls of that city, and part of
        me yearns for them still, but times goes by and life must
        be lived. I long for the fireside debates of philosophy
        that I participated in during my youth there. It was in
        the homes of these stern yet loving clerics that I found
        my purpose of life.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">I heard tales of truly
        uncivilized races that knew only bloodshed and fury. The
        Erudites often debated if it was by birth or by the
        society that such creatures were raised in that they
        became so twisted. There was never any doubt in my mind
        though, and my own life among the people of Odus was
        proof enough for me. Through their nurture, I had become
        vastly different than any wood elf of Norrath. I used
        science and not faith to make life work for me. The Ogres
        of Norrath could be changed through this path as well, I
        decided and I was just the lass to do it. I read
        everything I could on their history and culture, and
        explaining my plan to my masters, I set off to prove my
        theory correct. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">Most Ogres, I have
        found, actually want to be good people. They do bad
        things simply because that is all that they have ever
        known. Through great kindness, and much discussion (using
        small words of course) they can come to understand the
        error of their ways. The most difficult task, however, is
        convincing the rest of the world that this change is
        possible. But I help do it, one ogre at a time. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">I never made it back to
        Kelethin, and I now call Rivervale and its Kithcor Forest
        home. The great ranger, Morin Shadowbane, taught me to
        use the skills of my birth as well as the ones attained
        in my years on Odus to become a master ranger and find a
        greater sense of peace with my two lives. Nature is very
        comforting, but it still is lackluster in comparison to
        the walls of Erudin for me. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">It was in the woods of
        Kithcor that I learned of my talent with the whip. An odd
        weapon for a ranger, but I found its subtleties perfectly
        suited to my inner desire to act as a tamer of the world.
        I soon displayed a great prowess for it, and it is still
        my favored hunting weapon, when I seek to relax from the
        day&#146;s work with the Ogres of Norrath. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">I still bear a great
        hatred for the pixies. No amount of reasoning with my
        erudite masters could cure me of that. In letters from my
        mother, I learned finally why the pixies plagued me so in
        my youth. My father was not my father by birth, it seems.
        Rather, my mother had been led astray of her marriage
        vows by a wooing pixie man, and soon fell into his arms.
        I was the issue of that tryst. I am a changeling child,
        born not of one race, but two. When the mistress of that
        pixie man learned of his indiscretion and of my birth,
        she made it her goal to destroy me and the sin that I
        represented. So far, she has failed. I thrive, I live and
        I learn. That is the nature of the person that I am. It
        is all that I know how to do, and it is more than enough
        to keep me busy until my dying day. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">And until that day
        comes, I plan to live my life to its greatest potential,
        my masters would expect nothing less of me. And I expect
        nothing less of myself. </font></p>
