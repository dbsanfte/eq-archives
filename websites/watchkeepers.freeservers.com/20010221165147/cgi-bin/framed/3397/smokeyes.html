        </p>
        <p align="left">After a long journey across the
        Commonlands of Antonica and risking the dangers of the
        patrols of Nektulos Forest you come to the gates of the
        underground city known as Neriak, home of the Teir'Dal,
        the Dark Elves. The guards at the gate seem to be on
        their toes so you bide your time hiding in the shadows. </p>
        <p align="left">As you sit there and wait you think to
        yourself, &quot;I wonder if she is here&#133; I wonder if
        she is as they say she is?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">The person you seek is said to frequent a
        bar in the Commons Quarter called &quot;The Blind Fish&quot;
        in the city proper. You hope that the map you took off
        that orc courier is correct about the hidden tunnels to
        the bar and that the gnome you spoke to on your way here
        didn't lie about the patrols in that area. You feel the
        hair on the back of your neck stand&#133;</p>
        <p align="left">A rustle of bushes to the side draws your
        attention. A young Teir'Dal female stumbles out of the
        under brush and staggers to the gate. Blood covers her
        robes and a score or more gashes cover her body, she
        falls to the floor as the dagger slips from her grasp. In
        a weak voice she calls out &quot;Sargtlin! Ogglin tir
        elgg!&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">As the last word escapes her lips three
        zombies burst from the tree line and with ravenous claws
        tear the spark of light from the young elfs' eyes and rob
        her of her final breath. The creatures flesh dangle from
        decaying bones as the feast upon their fallen prey.</p>
        <p align="left">The guards seem to delight in the show as
        the step forward to engage the undead, weapons glowing in
        the moonlight. Two of the zombies cease their feasting
        and move slowly towards the guards and the third
        continues dining upon the now dead elf.</p>
        <p align="left">Now is your chance&#133; You move with
        the speed and grace of a hunting cat towards the gate as
        the sounds of battle come from behind you. You enter into
        the realm of the Teir'Dal, the realm of death and hate.</p>
        <p align="left">Seems your information was correct, you
        make it to &quot;The Blind Fish&quot; with only a brief
        encounter with a troll merchant who seemed to only care
        that you didn't try to steal any of his, or was it her,
        wears. Pulling your cloak up you step into the bar.</p>
        <p align="left">Smoke fills the room of both levels of
        the place, the smell of hundred of rare herbs mingle with
        pipe tobacco and incense to create a smell that is very
        soothing and seems to remind you that you need a drink.
        You walk down the small flight of stairs to the lower
        level and gaze around at the windows that cover the north
        wall. Seems the bar is underwater and the view is from
        the windows is that of an underwater landscape. It is
        breath taking and scary at the same time. An impishly
        happy giggle draws your attention to a far corner of the
        room. </p>
        <p align="left">There leaning on a brewing barrel holding
        a large sewing kit is a young female Teir'Dal. She is
        dressed in a rage tag set of armor, most of which seems
        to be some type of metal links. The armor is crafted so
        well that if forms to her body as though it were her own
        skin. Strapped to her hips are two very nasty daggers, a
        glowing rapier and a whip covered in spikes. Her body is
        as if sculpted from fine onyx, ever muscle tight and
        smooth as thought a master craftsman spent his life
        forming a living being from the dark stone. Her hair is
        as white as the pure snow that falls in the cold winter's
        morning and looks as though it might be just as soft. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Are you going to order or take up
        space? Cause if it's space ya be wanting there is plenty
        of room on the other side of the window for your kind.&quot;
        Says the barmaid in a voice that is soft as a flute yet
        with an undertone of a dagger in the night.</p>
        <p align="left">You didn't even hear her walk up on you,
        you didn't think you where there that long looking at the
        young Teir'Dal. You take a second before you ask for a
        white wine and hand over what you know to be double the
        price and hope that the barmaid doesn't call the guards
        about your presents in the city. She returns a moment
        later with the drink and no change smiles and walks away.
        Seems you are safe as long as your coin holds out.</p>
        <p align="left">Pulling the hood of your cloak down more
        and taking a sip of your wine you go back to your
        observation of the lady who held your attention so
        completely before.</p>
        <p align="left">She is smiling at a young female Halfling
        standing before her dressed in what appears to be freshly
        made set studded and reinforced leather armor. Every
        piece unmarred by battle or time, from boots to cap.
        Crafted to fit the halfling almost perfectly, leaving
        some room for hidden equipment it seems.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Thank you Miss Smoke! Tis a grand
        set, how much is it that I owe you?&quot; the young
        halfling ask with a smile of gratitude on her face as
        bright as a new day's dawn.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;For you young one, just the cost of
        materials. You have paid enough of a price come'in all
        the way here to get a set. I would have been back in
        young home in a few days, but I do admire your efforts in
        come'in here just to ask for my help. So for that I shall
        only charge you half.&quot; Smoke says in a voice that is
        almost a whispering yet reaches every corner of the room.
        &quot;Besides, you are a sister of the arts and of
        Bristlebane. You should be take'in care of cause no one
        takes care of us so someone has ta. No go before someone
        sees you here, not safe for your folk here about.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Travel safe Miss Smoke, I will
        remember your kindness and generosity.&quot; With that
        the halfing bows and hands Smoke a pouch of coins and
        sneaks off towards the back door.</p>
        <p align="left">With an almost childlike smile and the
        speed of a sprite, Smokes' hand flashes towards the
        halfling and she turns to go. With the expertise that
        must come with hours of practice she does a reverse pick
        pocket and places the pouch back into the halflings
        backpack as she makes her way to the door.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Travel safe and dream well young
        one. May your skill prevail where others fail.&quot;
        Smoke says while holding back a giggle.</p>
        <p align="left">She places the sewing kit back into her
        case and turns to open the panel on the brew cask. With a
        sparkle in her eyes she reaches in and removes five small
        white bottles from the cask and places them into her
        pouch.</p>
        <p align="left">With one single flowing motion she flings
        a sixth white bottle right at you &quot;So, are ya go'in
        ta paint a portrait or just start at me all night friend?&quot;
        Her eyes lock with yours&#133;</p>
        <p align="left">Her eyes&#133; This is the first time you
        have seen them, peering right into your soul and stealing
        a single breath from your body. At least some of the
        tails are true; her eyes are lovely as life, yet dark as
        death. A swirling mass of day and night, a patch of
        darkness that seem to have the light of a thousand
        candles flickering in the breeze of eternity just at it's
        edge. You wonder if you will ever get that breath back,
        yet knows that she has stolen something that can not be
        regained.</p>
        <p align="left">She walks towards your table with the
        grace of a breeze on a spring morning, pulls a chair from
        the next table and sits before you. Her eyes never
        leaving yours. &quot;So what is it I can do for ya young
        friend, why is it ya searched me out in this dark place?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">You find it difficult to speak looking
        into her eyes yet you can not look away. &quot;Are you
        the Teir'Dal rogue known as Smokeyes Dreamnight?&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Yes I am. Now I am sure that you
        didn't sneak past guards and travel halfway from where
        ever to ask me just that.&quot; She says with a smile
        that her eyes also mimic.</p>
        <p align="left">Clearing your throat you say why you are
        here in a quiet whisper. &quot;My guild has charged me
        with a task. We are collectors of history and keepers of
        truths. Your name is known by many, most call you friend.
        You have help many, even at great cost both financial and
        spiritual. You are no ordinary Teir'Dal as most have
        portrayed your kind, nor are you common for one of your
        profession. We would like to know if you wish to share
        your story with history and us?&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">Her eyes&#133; Those eye that seemed to
        hold the mystery of life only a second ago, the eyes that
        held your life with in them are not the same anymore.
        There is no sign of life, no sign of death. They are now
        a void, which seems to devour everything, yet reflects
        all. &quot;It is time&#133;&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My true name is Cy'eti Maiveldrin,
        the name give'in to me by my mother upon my birth. It
        means &quot;Onyx eyes of deaths shadow&quot;. My family
        name is Firreth'Mai'Atria, which means &quot;Deaths dark
        dancers&quot; in the tongue of the common man.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My family are true followers of
        Innoruuk. Necromancers, Shadow Knights and Clerics all.
        Proud and feared for their power and connection to the
        Prince of Hate.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My mother is a High Necromancer
        named Ama'Reth, feared by her apprentices and the family
        for her power. My father is one of Innoruuks' more
        powerful knights named Mal'Thal Ael'Ual, he stands at my
        mothers side out of loyalty, fear and lust. Both to serve
        the will of the God of Hate. Together they sired six
        offspring. I am the second child, yet eldest living child.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My eldest brother, Ty'Rath, was
        sacrificed by my parents hands at Innoruuks will. And
        together they shared his heart in a ceremony of death and
        hate. The last thing my brother saw was that of our
        parents eating of his still warm and beating heart. I
        watched it all; I held the dagger they used.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My younger twin brothers sat and
        watched in glee at the sight and reveled in the blood
        that spilled from the altar, even at the tender age of
        six they knew their place in our realm. My sister didn't
        understand, but sat in awe at the magic power that was
        unleashed by this ritual; I feel that might have damaged
        her for she was only four seasons old. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;He was only sixteen upon his death,
        it was his birthday. His age of ascension to life as a
        full member of our society. This was his gift from my
        parents. It was my thirteenth season of life, but I did
        not want to be part of this life. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Every day I wake with the look my
        brothers eye held upon his death, his and the others that
        followed. Each life my family sacrificed a piece of me
        was lost with them.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My other siblings seemed to flow
        with the power of our dark god. The twins at the age of
        eight seasons were sent to the Lodge of the Dead with my
        father to start they're training. They were to follow in
        my fathers' path and become knights of our dark god. I
        knew I would never see them again for once one became
        part of the lodge they are lost to the world. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My sister never did recover from
        the exposure to the magic unleashed the day of my
        brothers death. At the age of seven seasons she was
        already able to manipulate magic even apprentices only
        dream of. Yet she knew neither what she did nor how she
        did it. My mother, pregnant with my yet unborn sister,
        was very happy with my other siblings&#133; Then there
        was me.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I did not share their blood lust,
        their love for our dark ways. I did not feel the hate
        that was the foundation of Teir'Dal race. It was my
        sixteenth season of life and I had yet to swear my life
        to their god, nor chosen a path to follow, much to my
        parents disdain.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;When one of my kind turns sixteen
        season old there is a ceremony known as Iaire'Lanna, 'Daughters
        chosen day'. A coming of age ceremony. The time of my
        ceremony was near and I felt that I could not take part
        of it&#133;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;For most of my younger years I
        would play hide and sneak with our family guards, they
        always had a hard time catching me. That helped play a
        part in what I knew I had to do. I had to escape, I had
        to find a life, I had to leave these walls and find what
        it was that would make me feel whole. I gathered together
        some thing I thought I would need and climbed down into
        the cellars. Sneaking past a few of the more inept guard
        I went into the 'stalls' my family kept our slaves in and
        that is when I saw something that brought a spark to my
        heart.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;On a recent raid on a wood elf camp,
        my families forces took a few slaves to help in the mines
        and fill in the places left open by the most recent
        ceremony. There were five adult males, three females who
        would no doubt be give to the commanders of the house
        guard and a teenage male about my age. It was his eyes
        that froze me in my tracks. Even in that dark place, with
        death all around, I could feel the light in those eyes.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;He was rather small even for a wood
        elf, a wiry frame with tight muscles. His cloths, even
        though caked with mud and blood, hug loosely from his
        form. Short blond hair was matted to his head, the color
        of hay in the morning sun. His eyes so deep and alive,
        were the color of the morning sky and held a life of
        their own. Even in this place of death there was joy in
        his eyes.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I watched from the shadows as the
        guards move the prisoners into the cells. The young elf
        stood away from the other, it was almost as if they didn't
        want him with them. The guards locked the others into the
        cells leaving the young elf in the middle of two of the
        guards. The leader of the raiding part said 'He is too
        small for anything&#133; Kill him and throw his body to
        the ghouls.' One of the guards drew his sword as the
        other forced the elf to his knees. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Stop!&quot; I yelled as I drew
        myself from the shadows, I do not know why I felt
        compelled to do that, but something inside me wanted to
        save this elf. The guards were startled for a moment,
        once they saw who it was they stayed their actions.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Mistress Cy'eti, this is no place
        for you, a lady of your blood.' He gave pause for a
        moment 'Unless it is you who wishes to kill this decrepit
        thing.' The head guard finished. I could see that he was
        afraid of me, even though I showed no powers they must
        have thought I was hiding what I did have. After all,
        they could never catch me so I guess they thought I had
        the power of shadows. They called me 'Shadow Child' when
        they didn't think I was in earshot.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;No, let him live. I want him for
        myself&#133; I am a lady of the house and my will is law
        is it not.&quot; I told them and took a step forward.
        &quot;Release him to my watch.&quot; They were a bit in
        shock, but agreed to do as I wished. I looked down at the
        elf; he was staring right into my eyes... I could feel
        his fear and something else, he was smiling at me with
        his eyes.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Thank you Lady with the eyes of
        smoke.' He whispered once the guards were not looking. He
        spoke our tongue, it was something I did not expect. Nor
        did I expect such a title.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I took him to the bath house out in
        back of the family house. The guards still watching and
        whispering from the distance. I wonder what they thought
        I was going to do, it did not matter to me. Something
        about this elf had taken a hold on me, what it was I did
        not know, nor did I care. I took him into the house and
        closed the door, at this time of night there was no one
        there. I undressed him and help him into the tub and
        started to wash him.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Something stirred within me as I
        massaged the kinks out of his shoulders. I felt something
        new, something I have never even felt before. A warmth
        where my heart, my soul, was hiding from the horrors
        around me. I looked into his eyes once more, there was
        life. I have seen wood elves before but never felt this.
        This one was more then an ordinary elf, he was part of me.
        A fire I needed to be whole, even in this place where
        nothing but pain existed I found something I needed. I
        took a sponge and rinsed the rest of the dirt from his
        hair. He turned and our eyes locked once again.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Why did you call me that?' I ask
        as I looked deep into his soul. His inner fire mingled
        with my soul. 'You had to have understood what the guards
        called me.'</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Because I saw you in the shadows,
        and when you came up to save me from death. I felt your
        presents and knew who you were.' He reached out and held
        me in his arms. 'When I looked into your eyes I knew
        there was something with in you. Your eyes, your soul has
        the light of joy yet the darkness of a thousand deaths.
        You area a mystery to your own world and your eyes show
        that.'</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;He gently pressed his lips to mine,
        I knew I should have pushed back but something about him,
        he was part of me. I wanted to be whole, I wanted to be
        part of his world. He held me close and pulled me down
        into the bath with him.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'You are one with the shadows, not
        evil but will never be part of good.' He stroked my hair
        and held my face in his hands. 'You are the candle to the
        star, The Ladies favored&#133;' His eyes locked with mine.
        'Your are the mist that surrounds truth, the light that
        covers a lie.' He gently removed my gown and held me,
        eyes never leaving mine. 'You are the loved and hated by
        all&#133;'</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My head started to swim, I was part
        of him, part of his world even for this short time.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Bristlebanes's Lady has chosen
        you my love. The hand for night and shadow, the hands of
        friendship and the wielder of the dagger in the dark. You
        are Eti'firret, 'Death Shadow'. Your path is now chosen
        Lady of Smoke. Embrace your future and know that it is
        your will.' The sound of his voice and the look in his
        eyes told me my life was now chosen, and I welcomed it. I
        gave into my feelings of love, I embraced my destiny and
        knew I would never be.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;My mother watched from the shadows
        and knew what she must do.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;After that night I set the young
        wood elf up as a house boy till I could find some way to
        get him to safety. I did not see him after that night
        knowing that to do so would insure his death. My
        ascension was a week away. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;The night before my formal
        ascension I knew that I had to get away before it was too
        late, before my soul, my now free soul, would be given
        unto the god of Hate. I ready myself for the escape and
        set out to the young wood elf's room. My stealth had
        improved for some reason, it was as if I was smoke
        drifting through the halls, unseen and unheard.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;The door to his chamber was locked
        so I pulled a pin from my hair and set to the lock. With
        a light click the tumblers moved into place and released
        the door. But once I opened it I saw that my elf friend
        wasn't there. But my sister was.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Mother says you are to come with
        me.' Her eyes glowed brightly in the dark room. Due
        imparts to the magic that coursed through her veins. I
        was about to scold her for being in here, for giving
        demands of her elder sister, when she said 'Mother said
        your time is now and you must come.' And she headed out
        the door to the family temple.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I followed, I do not know why I did.
        A feeling started welling deep inside my breast. I do not
        know if it was fear or excitement. I just felt change
        within me. I knew something was about to happen,
        something that would change me completely.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;The door to the temple opened at
        our approach and we entered. The light of thousands of
        candles and incense burners lighted it. The tapestries of
        hate covered the walls and the smell of old blood hung in
        the air. My sister walks up the altar to my mothers' side,
        two hideous ghouls at either side.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Welcome my daughter to Iaire'Lanna.
        Come and become part of your destiny.' She held the
        dagger in her hand and offered it and beckoned me to the
        altar. 'Come my daughter and take this gift and be one
        with your own kind, the true masters of all!' The doors
        to the temple closed behind me. I turned to look and saw
        four rotting corpses putting the bar on the door. They
        were all wood elves.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I was trapped, it seemed that I had
        lost what I had found. But I knew I would not go out
        without facing 'our dark god' and spitting in his face.
        With the fire I had found I marched up the steps to the
        alter and grab the dagger from my mothers hand and look
        down into the face of my 'gift', it was then that I knew
        I was truly lost. I looked down into the eyes of the
        young wood elf. His body was ridged and lifeless but his
        eyes were still alive. I saw fear and something more in
        them.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'Did you think I would not know!'
        my mother cackled at me, I could feel the hate welling
        with in me, I wanted blood. 'Did you think you could ever
        hope to be not of my control!' Rage, pain, and anger&#133;
        The fire within me grew a fire more powerful then I could
        imagine. 'Yes my daughter! Feel the hate! You are ours!
        Now and always!' I thrust the dagger into my mothers'
        heart&#133;</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I felt the hot blood running down
        my hand. Felt the beating of the heart that I impaled my
        dagger in, taste the blood that had sprayed onto my face.
        But something was wrong, I heard laughter? My mothers and
        sisters laughter. I felt a warmth swell inside of me as I
        looked at my hand still clutching the dagger, the dagger
        that was hilt deep in the wood elf's' chest.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'It is your destiny now my love.
        You are the Lady of Smoke, The Ladies Chosen. Neither
        alive nor dead, awake nor asleep' A tear of blood rolled
        down his cheek. ' Dream well, for dreams are your reality.'
        His eyes locked with mine as I watched the fire drain
        from them, they never closed.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'NO!' I turned to my mother, to
        rip her heart from her with my hands. I lunged to my
        mother, but the ghouls had attacked me before I took my
        first step and froze me with the power of their unlife.
        The chill of death grabbed me. 'It was my path to chose!
        Why!?' I screamed at my mother.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot; 'It was your choice my dearest
        daughter. This is what you wanted and what I wanted. This
        was your sisters' ceremony. She was the one who
        controlled your mind, she is one of Innooruuk children
        and the Eldest daughter of our family now. You were her
        gift and now you are no more.' With that she held my
        sisters' hand and walked down the steps, once at the
        bottom she turned to me once more. 'Farewell daughter,
        you are nothing but mist in my presence and smoke in my
        memory.' As they walked to the door the wood elf zombies
        opened it to let the mother and daughter out then turned
        and walk up the steps to where I was frozen by the ghouls'
        touch. I welcomed death for I knew I had no life in me
        anymore. And I never even knew his true name.</p>
