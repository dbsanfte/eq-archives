        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">That is a question
        that I cannot readily answer. I do not know who I was
        born to be or who I was as a child. My mind cannot see
        myself at those times as if it was wiped of those
        precious moments by another's hand. My first memory that
        I have now is awakening to a friendly face in the
        mountains of West Karana. The only thing that I knew at
        that moment was that the other person awakening beside me
        was my brother, my twin Mian. Neither of us remembered
        anything before that moment but we knew and felt each
        other through our hearts. Nothing could ever erase what
        we feel between us, an extension of one another. </font></p>

        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">A ranger named
        Scootle had found us lying there asleep but unharmed. She
        had been scouting the ogre camp and the rumors of a
        werewolf roaming the area. I was immediately in awe of
        her abilities and the pride she showed in her skills. My
        brother was confused and scared and from that moment on
        and has been reclusive. With his more naturally ability
        towards magic I can only guess that he knew what was done
        to us, and that changed him forever. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Scootle took us
        quietly through the woods to a beautiful glade. The
        residents in the area knew it as Surefall Glade. Mian and
        I stared in wonder at the waterfall while Scootle told
        Hagar Sureshot of our plight. We were taken to a cottage
        over the lake and fed, while the elders of the glade held
        a council meeting. It was decided that we could stay in
        the glade as long as we did chores like everyone else and
        that we could be tested for training as a ranger or a
        druid . </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">We stayed in the
        glade for a season before we were both tested, Mian great
        ability for magic was sensed and he was offered a chance
        to become a mighty druid. I was a little more aggressive
        and wished to become a ranger like my friend Scootle.
        Hagar Sure shot and Larsk Juton trained Scootle and
        myself together and we both learned quickly, while Mian
        was still reclusive and was learning his craft at a slow
        pace, luckily the druids had great patience. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">After I had learned
        weapon skills it was decided that I could go with Scootle
        on patrols. It was while scouting and hunting in West
        Karana that Scootle introduced me to another pupil of
        Larsk's. A half elf like myself, named Crispinskyhawke ,
        he was carrying a heavy two hand sword and running slower
        than us due to some older leg injury. We became fast
        friends and we three adventured across the Karanas
        together. I later finished my ranger training and set to
        travel across the lands honing my skills and abilities. </font></p>

        am I. I can only say that I a m kind to strangers, and
        deadly to my enemies, I am faithful to my friends, I am a
        Ranger, but the I can say is I am Chyan. </font></p>
