        <br>
        &#147;Excuse me sir?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        A voice, somewhere close, talking to him?<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Sir?&nbsp; Are you Jerem Elegoth sir?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        A name, was it his?&nbsp; Yes.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;You see, I have a message for Jerem Elegoth, and I
        am wondering if you are him?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem Elegoth.&nbsp; It had been a long time since he had
        been called by his full name; so long he had almost
        forgotten it.&nbsp; He slowly lifted his head from his
        crossed arms, wiping drool from his unruly beard.&nbsp;
        He rubbed his eyes and peered into the darkness of the
        Lion&#146;s Mane tavern.&nbsp; He blinked and tried to
        focus on the voice, tried to understand who was speaking
        to him. He was confused, and reached for his glass trying
        to stall for time so his mind would clear.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;If you could please answer me sir, I am in a bit of
        a hurry, and the message is important.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        The glass was empty, and a quick check of his belt pouch
        revealed that his purse was not far behind.&nbsp; His
        eyes finally cleared and the child standing before him
        came into focus.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Jerem Elegoth.&nbsp; Yes, I suppose that is me.&nbsp;
        What do you want,&#148; his voice was a low growl, his
        words slurred by the drink from the night before.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I have a message from the Church of the Prime
        Healer, from the High Priestess herself.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        The High Priestess?&nbsp; Sobriety came quickly and
        brought a severe headache with it, this was the last
        thing he needed right now.&nbsp; He had been hiding from
        the cursed High Priestess for months and had no desire to
        see her now.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Tell her I have no interest in what she wants to
        say, tell her to leave me alone,&#148; he scowled at the
        child hoping to scare her away.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I do not think she will accept that answer Sir.&nbsp;
        She said it was urgent, she said she must speak to you.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem laughed loudly, his head instantly regretting it,
        &#147;She wants to speak to me, or she wants to speak to
        Him?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I don&#146;t understand sir, she said she wanted to
        speak with Jerem Elegoth and that I would most likely
        find you here.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Of course, there is no way you could understand,
        and I hope you never have to.&nbsp; Tell your blessed
        High Priestess that He will be there as soon as He can,
        she will just have to be patient.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;But she wants to see you&#133;.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;She will understand the message, it is what she
        wants.&nbsp; Now be off.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem watched the child run from the tavern as he waived
        his hand for the serving wench.&nbsp; The High Priestess
        had not specified that he meet with her sober; it was
        time to drink, and drink hard.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        <img src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"><br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        The two paladins deposited their burden at the feet of
        the High Priestess, a low groan escaping from the dirty
        rags that now lay on the floor of the temple.&nbsp; The
        Priestess sighed loudly and kneeled, quietly praying to
        the Prime Healer for strength.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Jerem, I do not understand.&nbsp; Why do you do
        this to yourself?&nbsp; Why after being given such a
        great chance do you harm yourself like this?&nbsp;
        Sometimes I wonder why you were chosen, and then I see
        the sickness within you and I understand.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Why must you continue to try and save me Jahnda?&nbsp;
        Why can you not just leave me alone and let me be?&nbsp;
        I did not ask for help, I did not desire any of this.&nbsp;
        I only wanted to die; I wanted it to be over.&nbsp; The
        pain is to much, the burden to great, please, leave me be.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem looked up through the tears in his eyes and began
        to shake as he saw Jahnda smiling down at him.&nbsp; He
        did not deserve any of this, why did she insist on
        drawing him back to the church.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I help you because you are in need Jerem.&nbsp; I
        help you because He has seen something within you worth
        saving.&nbsp; He has chosen you to help our lands.&nbsp;
        He has chosen you to be his messenger to me.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Why can He not use the fish?&nbsp; You yourself
        said He used to use the fish, that is their purpose on
        this land.&nbsp; Why has He chosen to torment me when the
        blasted fish were created to deliver His message?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I do not know Jerem, He has not told me why, only
        that it must be so.&nbsp; I am sorry if this saddens you
        Jerem, but somewhere inside I know there must be a good
        man, someone worthy of saving.&nbsp; You have lost your
        way and He wishes to help you find it; I wish to help you
        find it.&nbsp; You will understand someday, you will see
        it in yourself eventually.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Bah, you care little for me,&#148; Jerem stumbled
        to his feet, &#147;you only wish to speak to Him, to use
        me to listen to His words.&nbsp; Fine!&nbsp; I give up!&nbsp;
        The sooner this is over the better, the sooner I can
        return to my drink.&nbsp; Come to me Nife!&nbsp; Come to
        me blast you!&nbsp; Speak with your followers, then leave
        me alone!&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem dropped to his knees and gave in.&nbsp; He stopped
        fighting the presence that had lingered on the edges of
        his consciousness for the last week.&nbsp; He had known
        Nife was there all along, waiting for him to give in.&nbsp;
        Jerem bowed<br>
        his head and gave the god free passage, gave him entry
        into his body and his soul.&nbsp; A great feeling of
        peace came over him, a sense of forgiveness and of
        healing; then all went black.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        <img src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"><br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        Jerem squinted into the sunlight passing through the
        window over his bed. His head was clear and his body at
        rest, no signs of the hangover he deserved were present,
        Nife had mended his body once again.&nbsp; He lay back on
        the soft pillow and tried to weep but could not;
        something inside of him was different.&nbsp; Jerem sat up,
        confused, trying to determine what was wrong with<br>
        him, what was different.&nbsp; The door opened and Jahnda
        stepped in, a smile on her face.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Good morning Jerem.&nbsp; How do you feel?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;What have you&#133;..what has He done to me?&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;He has started the healing process my friend.&nbsp;
        He has softened the old memories.&nbsp; He has given your
        body new strength.&nbsp; He has strengthened your mind.&nbsp;
        He has chosen you to be one of his vessels in this land,
        he has chosen you to join the others and help Him heal
        the wounds of Norrath.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;What do you mean?&nbsp; I do not want any of this,
        I just want to&#133;..&#148;, but he was wrong, he felt
        different inside.&nbsp; The memories were no longer
        strong; the pain they had caused him was less.&nbsp; For
        the first time in ages he could almost think clearly,
        could almost focus without the faces of the dead haunting
        his mind.&nbsp; In some strange way he had been healed.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Nife is with you Jerem, you are a new man.&nbsp;
        Through you he spoke to me as he has done before, but
        last night was different.&nbsp; He has chosen you to be
        one of his champions, this time he has not left you, like
        before.&nbsp; This time He is still within you.&nbsp; He
        believes that as he heals you, and others like you, he
        will also heal the lands of Norrath.&nbsp; He has begun
        the process with you Jerem, now you must continue his
        work and end the suffering of Norrath, only then can you
        be truly healed and suffer no longer.&nbsp; You have been
        given a second chance.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem could feel it now, somewhere deep inside, a sense
        of intelligence, a presence within his mind that was not
        his own.&nbsp; Jahnda spoke the truth, Nife was with him.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;But I&#133;..how can I&#133;..I don&#146;t want any
        of&#133;&#133;please I just&#133;&#148;<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Rest Jerem, sleep.&nbsp; When you awake you will
        start your life anew, and leave your past behind.&nbsp;
        Sleep Jerem Elegoth, and heal.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Jerem tried to argue, he tried to fight back, but it was
        impossible.&nbsp; All he wanted to do was sleep.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        <img src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"><br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
        Jerem stepped away from the temple teleporter and turned
        to look at the High Priestess.&nbsp; He reached down and
        smoothed the creases of his new temple garb, adjusting
        the club that now hung from his belt.&nbsp; The first
        words of Nife were now in his head and he was ready to
        begin.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I am proud Jerem Elegoth, I know that you will work
        hard to bring His will to our lands.&nbsp; I know now
        that the healing of Norrath can begin.&nbsp; Find others
        such as yourself to aid you in your quest.&nbsp; May
        Rodcet Nife heal all wounds.&#148;&nbsp; Jahnda bowed
        deeply.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I will do my best Jahnda, and I know Nife will aid
        me when I am in need,&#148; Jerem held a hand to his
        heart and bowed before Jahnda.&nbsp; With that he turned
        and headed into the busy streets of Qeynos, Jahnda waving
        as he left, a look of hope in her eyes.<br>
        <br>
        Jerem turned the corner and looked over his shoulder to
        ensure the temple was out of sight.&nbsp; He reached into
        his pocket and fished out the gold coins Jahnda had given
        him to help him start out.&nbsp; He weighed the coins in
        his hand, three gold pieces, a hefty sum for one used to
        poverty such as he.<br>
        <br>
        Jerem laughed to himself as he walked down the street
        towards the Lion&#146;s Mane tavern.&nbsp; Three gold
        coins was just enough to get him good and drunk.<br>
