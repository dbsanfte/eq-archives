        <p><font face="Century">Well friends, I shall begin at
        the beginning, as any story should, and tell it as it
        should as my grandmother told me as a child.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Century">Many thousands of seasons ago,
        our elven ancestors left their homeland in the Faydark
        spurned by revelations from Tunare that they were to
        spread Her word throughout the known lands and to the new
        race of men, humans. These pioneering wood elves were not
        just simple druids and rangers but bards, rogues,
        warriors too joined them in their journey across the
        Ocean of Tears, as did a select few high elves mostly
        warriors and clerics who found wisdom and strength in the
        Word of Tunare.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Century">Upon landing at a new dingy
        settlement now known as Freeport, the ancient name long
        forgotten as the town was reputedly raised many times by
        orc raiders and other un-natural disasters caused in part
        by the lawlessness of its early citizenry, they were
        dismayed by the dust and clutter of the human settlement.
        Despite the inherent beauty of the surrounding desert and
        sandstone formations and the vibrantness of the deciduous
        forests and rolling hills of what we now call the
        Commonlands, the locals lent not an ear to Tunare&#146;s
        teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Century">At the peak of their doubt
        whether these hu`mans could understand the way of Tunare,
        the leader of the trek, the legendary Ranger Kodiak
        Willowwhisper, had a vision from Karana, that the One
        would be sent to show them the way in this new land. The
        next morning, he woke feeling refreshed, and while
        foraging for their breakfast in the hills someone shouted
        in excitement, &#145;Look, up there, on that hill.&#146;
        Suddenly the fog parted from around the figure on the
        hill and everyone gathered in and gasped at the sight.
        There stood without a doubt a human woman, gowned in free-flowing
        verdant robes, with silver shoulder length hair that
        sparkled in the stars and danced in the wind. In his
        excitement, Kodiak dropped the basket of berries he had
        just picked, and forgetting himself, ran up to her as a
        child would. Kodiak was tall for a wood elf, but had to
        look up to meet her compassionate gaze. She took his hand
        into her hands and simply said, &#145;I am called
        Annapurna. Our new home shall be near the Plains of
        Karana, Surefall, a sacred grove that is waiting for our
        arrival.&#146;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Century">The band of wood elves and high
        elves found that their long voyage west across Antonica
        was free of the dangers of roving bandits, goblins, or
        the hideous creatures that filled the sky that they had
        heard talked about with so much fear in Freeport. All
        arrived safely to the grove. Annapurna never did answer
        when anyone asked about her past or where she came from
        or if she missed her family. She always sweetly smiled
        and said that they were her family. She never spoke of
        the future or the past, always of the present, and never
        was a woman of many words, but she did not need to speak
        as anyone could understand her by just feeling. Sure
        enough, she was family after the marriage with Kodiak was
        consecrated and they were blessed by children. Some
        elders of the band thought it to be impossible, yet there
        they were, bouncing babies who were neither human nor elf
        but both. Finally a semblance of village had formed in
        the grove, and the shouts of half-elf children playing
        could be heard.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Century">The inhabitants of the grove had
        found a friendly ear in the human settlement of Qeynos, a
        simple folk who lived off the bounty of the sea and the
        farm. </font></p>
