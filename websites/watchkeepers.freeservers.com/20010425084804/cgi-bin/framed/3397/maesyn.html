        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born
        to a life of wealth and privilege that most children of
        Freeport could only dream of, Maesyn and her twin sister
        Lini could have been considered by most to be spoiled
        children. Never did they go to bed with pangs of hunger,
        or fear what creature might awaken them in the night. In
        the house of their father, Ruben Shadowdancer, the twins
        grew into fine young ladies. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They
        were educated by tutors from all corners of Norrath, in
        the delicate arts that their father deemed suitable:
        sewing, dancing, cooking, and singing among others. He
        asked only that they never question his word, and that
        when the time came, they marry and give him grandchildren.

        Under the loving iron thumb of their father, Maesyn&#146;s
        mother had no say in the family affairs. When they were
        in their early teens, their father began to bring around
        young men that he deemed suitable for them to marry. The
        lasses bore these visits well, but one young man&#146;s
        wooing words struck a chord in Maesyn&#146;s heart one
        day. The lad went on and on about how he would protect
        her and save her from the trials and tribulations of the
        world. Maesyn was not so deluded that she didn&#146;t
        realize that she was a spoiled merchant&#146;s daughter,
        but at that moment she wondered if there was anything
        more to her shallow existence. She spoke in depth about
        this with her sister, and they sought out the monks of
        the Ashen Order and began to train their bodies. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        years passed easily, and the girls grew into beautiful
        women and their bodies into deadly weapons. The secret
        was kept from their parents until they were brought on a
        mysterious trip to the Tree City of Kelethin. Her mother
        bade her to dress in her finest gown, and Maesyn was led
        into a decorated grove. There was a wedding to occur, and
        it was only as her father led her down the aisle to the
        groom that she realized that the wedding was to be her
        own. Her father released her and she looked into the eyes
        of her intended&#133;. What she saw there was no desire
        to be married, and Maesyn let out a booming laugh of
        relief for it. Her betrothed, a young wood elf named
        Larch smirked back at her, and then they moved in sync to
        vacate the premises.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img

        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Maesyn slept under the stars of Faydwer that night, and
        in her sleep she found what she had been seeking since
        she first doubted her existence, she found some self-respect.
        Lini tracked her down the next day, and the twins
        returned to their parents, informing them of their
        training with the Ashen Order. Their father was
        dumbfounded. He threw down curses upon their heads, and
        ranted about the worthlessness of bearing daughters.
        Maesyn just bore his words with a slight smile. She was
        in another place now, with a new beginning ahead of her.
        And so, with the training of the monks of the Ashen Order,
        and the wisdom of Quellious at their side, the twins
        headed off into the world. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
        how will one find the spoiled merchant&#146;s daughter
        now? Free. But even freedom has its price, and Maesyn has
        paid dearly for it. But those are other stories, for
        other times.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"> </font></p>
