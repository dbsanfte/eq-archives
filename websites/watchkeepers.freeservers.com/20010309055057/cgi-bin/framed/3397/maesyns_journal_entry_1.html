<p>Here begins the journal of Maesyn, sister of the Ashen Order and Officer of
Watchkeepers, concerning her adventures into the land of the Crushbone Orcs.</p>

<p>I arrived in Kelethin late that night, having traveled across half of Antonica and the
Ocean of Tears to bring myself to this place. I had been told by many of the people that I
consider mentors that I would be able to find great adventure here in the home of the
Elves. Tale was told to me in such a way that, well, quite simply, a girl couldn&#146;t
resist it.</p>

<p>&#145;<i>Crushbone Orcs invading the sacred forest of Greater Faydark! Hundreds of
people of all races uniting to save the City of the Trees and the creatures that dwell
below it.</i>&#146; </p>

<p>I had to see such teamwork for myself. As a monk, I learned early on in my training
that for any goal to be achieved, the mind and the body must work together towards the
goal. It was to say the least, enticing to see what kind of synergy so many souls could
bring to this cause of defeating the Orcs.</p>

<p>Allow me to say here as a side note, that growing up in Freeport I had no love for Orcs
of any kind. Many a time the notorious Deathfist clan of Orcs had caused trouble with my
merchant father and his couriers. Whenever we lost a shipment for the store to those
thieves, words would spew from my father&#146;s lips that would make even the most evil
Shadowknight blush.</p>

<p>Once I arrived in Kelethin, I found an inn to stay at for the night, noting that the
prices for a night&#146;s lodging were considerably higher than I would have paid in
either Freeport or my second home of Rivervale. The Innkeeper was so suspicious of me that
he even bit into my platinum coin to assure him that it was real.</p>

<p>Bright and early the following morn, I arose to seek out the lair of these foul beasts.
Upon leaving the lift from Kelethin, I soon saw Crushbone scouting teams of pawns and
centurions in the blessed forest. These Orcs were blue! In fact, many of the local
residents referred to them as &#145;Blue Meanies&#146;. I watched the spectacle for a
while, then made my way into the Camp of the Crushbones.</p>

<p>Screams of agony thundered into my ears as soon as I entered the accursed place. The
battle was continuous and bloody for both sides. I made my way through the war zone
cautiously at first, trying to get the lay of the land, but soon found myself beset upon
by numerous Centurions myself. I defeated 3 of the beasts with ease and thought amusingly
that these poor creatures would never even make it to the rank of Centurion in the
Deathfist clan. They were to say the least, poorly trained. Designed by their leader to
die for his cause, believing that their death held some greater honor in the beyond. </p>

<p>I crossed a nearby bridge and crawled up and over a hilltop. What I saw there shocked
and sickened me to no end. Citizens of all the races of Faydwer were being worked to death
as slaves. Many times their captors beat them to death merely for the sport of it.
Legionnaires and Slave Masters (or slavers as the locals called them) of the Crushbone
Orcs rumbled through the slave camps and mines. Many brave souls were down below with
them, fighting the Orcs off to free their fellows. As quick as I could, I scrambled to the
ground, seeking to assist these poor slaves and free them as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>I landed near a young gnome fellow who was battling an Orc slaver and losing badly. I
asked the man if he needed assistance and he gladly accepted it. As soon as my feet flew
into the face of the blue meanie, a High Elf woman and two of her wood elf companions
started to tell me NOT to assist this poor fellow who was at death&#146;s door. I
continued to fight, but managed to find the time to ask why. The woman then stated that
the gnome had &quot;stolen their kill&quot;. My jaw dropped about the same time as the
Slaver's corpse did. I conversed with these people a few minutes more and learned what I
feared to be true. Many in this land cared more for the glory and honor (not to mention
the loot) of making a kill for themselves and teammates than they did for protecting the
forest. It was not uncommon to see half a dozen denizens of the Greater Fay stand by and
do nothing as one of their own died. Only upon the poor soul&#146;s death would anyone
else move in for the kill.</p>

<p>Such egotism made me sick. Where were the gods to leave such prayers of the dying
unanswered? What greed had infested this land so thoroughly that a person&#146;s life
meant so little? Were these people so hardened by years of conflict that the savagery of
death and the screams of those in agony fell on blind eyes and deaf ears?</p>

<p>Disgusted, I moved toward my goal, to free the slaves. I was able to set three of them
free before dire injuries from battling their captors forced me to find a quiet place to
rest. That in itself is not an easy task in the land of the Crushbones. Soon enough, I was
embroiled in battle again. Afterwards, I was able to explore a bit more of the territory,
and soon found myself atop a place dubbed &#145;Trainer Hill&#146; near the entrance to
Greater Faydark. I found my jaw on the floor yet again as I reached the top. Ten people
sat on the hill, while the battle continued below them. I asked one what they were all
doing there, and the young man replied that they were waiting for the next watch-shift of
Orc Trainers to arrive. I found out in short notice that these particular Orcs often
carried shiny brass shields, and that these people were waiting atop the hill to kill them
for it. Seems the shields fetched a pretty price back in Kelethin during the auctions. I
had to choke back my words of anger and dismay for fear of these mercenaries would forget
about their upcoming battle with the Orc Trainer and turn on me.</p>

<p>I am normally not quiet when it comes to my opinions; those that know me either love me
or hate me for that quality. However, in this case, I held my tongue. It was obvious to me
that people that cared more about money than defending their homeland would have no
problem in dispatching a traveling monk with a wagging tongue.</p>

<p>Soon enough though, the loudness of the screams from the fight below us increased
dramatically. I turned and looked below. I saw no less than fifteen Orcs scrambling after
a group of people that were fleeing for their lives. Spells flew out against them from
with in the pack of Orcs. I even saw a Dark Elf male in there midst, assisting them with
all his magical might. Dvinn was his name. I pondered what the advantage was for the Dark
Elves to team with the Crushbones&#133;. Did they seek to reclaim a section of Faydwer as
their own? </p>

<p>I had little time to continue my musings into Dvinn&#146;s scheme, as the slaughter
below died down and the mob of bloodthirsty Orcs sought more souls to claim for their own.
I was barely able to escape with my body and my wits intact, and when I found myself in
safety, I sat down to rest. I listened to the ranting of those others that had been lucky
enough to escape the brutality. They were enraged that so many Orcs had been allowed out
into the open, that the number of them was allowed to swell so high. They had no pity for
the dead, saying that they deserved to die several times over for disrupting the
day&#146;s hunt. A hunt, I wondered to myself, that&#146;s all they see it as. Glory in
the kill, money from the loot, anger at the dead who made the mistake of being too brave,
that is all that matter to these people, if one can even deem to call them that. No
thought for the preservation of the sacred, ancient forest of Greater Faydark that so many
of them called home. I was nauseous beyond reckoning. </p>

<p>I would not find the great uniting battle that I had traveled so far to see. Nothing
could unite these people against their own greed. I cried a bit as I boarded the boat from
Kaladim to return to Freeport that night. I cried for the dead, I cried for the sacred
forest, and yes, I even cried for the lost souls that couldn&#146;t see beyond their
greed. Call me innocent and naive of the world&#146;s workings if you wish, but friend, I
still believe that we can all unite as one against a great evil in Norrath. I just pray
that I live long enough to see it.</font><font FACE="Bangle,Courier New"></p>
