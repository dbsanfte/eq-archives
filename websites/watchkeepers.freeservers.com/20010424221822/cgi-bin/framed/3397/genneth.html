        A cute half-elf bard, Genneth's cheerful expression
        belies a troubled past. When her mother died of plague,
        she was raised by her adopted brother's family in the
        Karanas. She and Crispinskyhawke were later orphaned when
        gnolls attacked and killed his parents. Because of this,
        both Crispinskyhawke and Genneth vowed revenge on all
        gnolls. Brother and sister are very close. You will
        usually see them together.Genneth's main fault is her
        warrior tendancies. Her bardic teachers are forever
        faulting her lack of advancements in the bardic arts on
        her too warrior-like habits. But, Genneth is sure that
        being a warrior-bard is better than just being a straight
        bard. Her brother just shakes his =head at her and tries
        to keep her out of trouble. Genneth has many friends who
        all do the same. She feels she is fortunate in her luck
        and&nbsp; blesses Bristlebane each day for it.</p>
