<body background="back2l03.gif">

<p align="left">&quot;I awoke in an icy pool of sludge. I do not
know how much time had past, but I was alive and in a lot of pain.
I felt as though I was very weak and I did not feel whole anymore.
If anything I knew of the hole in my soul, even more now that I
knew what it was I was missing.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I looked around at my surroundings and
heard movement in the darkness. It was a large chamber shin deep
in sludge and the only light was from a small trap high above.
The smell was strong and I retched even though my stomach was
empty.</p>

<p align="left">&quot; 'Well, well now. Seems our new mask is
awake.' There was a glint of steel and splash ahead of me. 'Before
we get into the whole 'who, what, when and where's I will tell
you now, you were give to the Ebon Mask because you display
skills that we can use. And the Firreth'Mai'Atria family gave you
to us as a new toy. Now, if you are still alive in one year, you
will be part of us.' And with that the hatch closed and there was
a loud click. The light was now more and the shadows came alive.</p>

<p align="left">&quot; For weeks on end I fought my unseen foes.
Even with my races superb night sight it was black as pitch. But
something inside me kept me alive, kept me going. I felt the hole
was filling as though that part that I had lost, the part I had
killed, was coming back to me. I was with child, in this small
place of evil that I now wandered there was a small bit of light
with in me. Part of that elf was with me and it gave me strength
to move on. I knew not what it was that attacked me from the
shadows, only that I had a reason to go on. Reason to fight&#133;</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I had lost all track of time. But I could
feel my time was near, I found a place that was dry and away from
the things that wandered the dark. And I rested, this was it.
Time for great weakness and sorrow for I knew I would not be able
to protect myself and a child in this heart of death. But I knew
I had to, I had to regain that part of me that I had lost.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;It was at that moment I felt a presents,
someone&#133; Something was there with me. I grabbed the dagger
that had seen me through all this and looked into the darkness. I
would not let anything take this from me.</p>

<p align="left">&quot; 'Fear not child, we are here to help.' A
voice as sweet as a wind chime said and a form of a wood elf
female came to me from the darkness. 'You are not alone for a
time. We shall help you.' Two more beings came from the shadows,
a halfling and a half-elf. With those words I was taken to a
place far from the horror I had been in. To a meadow at twilight,
they dressed my wounds and took care of me, I felt peace. The
three of them stay with me, for a long time, for what seemed like
hours. Yet it always seemed to be twilight and I was not sure if
it was almost morning or almost night. 'Time has come child, time
for the dreams to be reality once more.' </p>

<p align="left">&quot;I had never felt such pain or such joy at
one time. I was being torn both in spirit and in body. Death and
life were now as one with me&#133; And then it was gone. 'Your
path is far from over child' the halfling said as she laid my
head to rest on her lap. 'Love and hate, life and death, they are
part of you.' The half-elf said as she handed me our daughter, my
daughter. 'You shall be whole one day child' said the wood elf as
I looked into my child's' eyes. They were gray like mine and held
the same spark that held life and death as mine did yet the joy
that her fathers' face did. 'Rest now, the dream is not over.'</p>

<p align="left">&quot;I awoke in the pits, the smell of decay
strong in the air. I felt well and awake, but I no longer felt
whole, a part of me was missing. The three visitors had gone and
so was my child. Yet I knew she was with her family and was still
was part of me. I knew she was in a better place. I also knew I
would never see her again.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;At that moment one of the creatures lunged
at me from the shadows, growling, fangs gleaming from blood and
drool. Its breath was hot and wet as it lunged forward, I quickly
stepped to the side and left it hit the floor. My eyes grew hot
as I saw where it was and I thrust at its back with my dagger,
shattering it's spine, killing it instantly.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;It was at this point I started to giggle, I
don't know why. It just overwhelmed me, all my emotions just
exploded at that moment. Hate, love, joy, pain, anger and
compassion. A part of me was lost and it was at that moment I
understood the events of the past year. I wasn't evil&#133; Yet I
wasn't good. But I was both at the same moment.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Another creature came at me from the shadow
fangs and claws dripping with blood. With a smile I let my blade
draw quickly across it's neck. It's head rolled to one side as it
dropped to the floor, blood spraying over my body. Two more came
rushing out, the smell of fresh blood heavy in the air. I dodged
to the right letting one of them fly past but the other hit me
hard in the chest. It's teeth digging hard into my breast. I dug
my fingers into it eyes and ripped it from my chest, my blood and
it's mingling in our dance of death. I threw it against the wall
and turn to face the other that had regained it's footing. With a
quick kick to its head I stunned it long enough to plant my
dagger into its skull, gray matter and blood covered my hand. It
was then I heard a voice whisper to me and it was all clear&#133;
My eyes, my heart glowed with a renewed fire!</p>

<p align="left">&quot; 'I am insanity and clarity!' I shouted,
blood rolling from my lips, I shifted my weight ready to attack.
'I am love and hate!' The shadows lunged forth claws ripping at
my flesh. 'I am the hand of friends and the dagger in the night!'
I grabbed the dagger and the fangs from the beast I had just
dispatched. And set into the combat that was both my sorrow and
now my joy. 'Death and life are within me!' I drove my weapons
into the beasts that besieged me form all sides.</p>

<p align="left">The hatch to the chamber above opened, my
bloodlust and terror had become one. The rage and anger guided my
strikes with the fury of deaths dark angle, yet the tears
streaming down my face betrayed the horror I felt at the loss of
each life. I don't know who or what it was I was fighting, or how
many I had killed, all I knew was it was over. A rope ladder was
lowered into the pits and I climb to the light with my last bit
of strength.</p>

<p align="left">&quot; 'Well now, no one has ever survived the
pit.' Said one of the male Teir'Dal standing before me. 'We
normally just throw the trash down there and see if we might get
lucky. Seems we did this time, your training will now start&#133;
What shall we call you?'</p>

<p align="left">I stood, blood covering my body, the creatures
and mine. I was weak yet my fire kept me standing, I saw clearly
the figures standing around me, they seemed shocked that I was
sanding in front of them, but also seemed pleased. I stared at
them, and felt something burn inside me.</p>

<p align="left">&quot; 'I am neither friend nor foe. I am neither
life nor death. I am gray, I stand between the candle and the
star. I am what the Lady wants me to be, a member in the Ladies
forces of luck. I go where I must to insure the balance. I am
smoke neither light nor dark. I am Smokeyes Dreamnight.</p>

<p align="left">You sit there stunned, it doesn't seem to make
sense the story you were just told. It's contradiction and fact
all at once. You take a sip of the drink Smokeyes has given you.
You look deep into her eyes, there is life they're once again,
that same look of life and death.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Now do you understand? If not don't worry I
am not sure I do yet either.&quot; She giggles impishly and gets
up and walks to your side. Resting her hand on your shoulders she
continues. &quot;Welp, I am a member of the Watchkeepers now as I
am sure you know, I just hope that they don't become part of my
pain. And I think I have found a part of my soul in a very close
friend. I help others, make sure that there is balance if I can.
Help those who need to be help as luck demands.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">Your head starts to feel heavy, you failed to
notice something it seems. The poison seems to have made you very
weak and seems to have slowed everything down. You can't believe
she did this to you. You feel the heat of a blade enter your back
and slump forward to the table. She is good in something's it
seems, your not dead&#133; Yet.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;But as with my life it seems I will never
be whole. But I will fight as long as I can to keep my friends&#133;
My family whole. If I fail it is my Ladies will, but I will not.
Not this time&#133;&quot; She cradles you into her arms. &quot;Rest
now. Yours will be a long journey.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">You awaken in your guild in Kelethin, the clerics
healing seems to have put you back together and you don't seem to
have suffered any real harm. </p>

<p align="left">&quot;He is well now, and back on his feet Master.&quot;
The healer says as he helps you to your feet.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Well, what did you learn of the Dark elf
name Smokeyes young scout?&quot; your guild leader ask wanting
intently.</p>

<p align="left">You wonder why she didn't kill you. Or why she
even did what she did. Or how she even brought you back to your
home even though you never said where you were from.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Sorry M'Lords and Ladies, but there is
nothing to tell it seems. She is not evil, yet she is not good.
She is as her name initials. Smoke, light and dark at once. She
is contradiction incarnate I guess I would call her. I fear I
have no explanation and I am sorry I have failed.&quot; You look
over at your backpack on the floor. It looks fuller then you
remember it being, you open it up and can't seem to hold you
laughter in.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;She poisons you, stabs you in the back and
dumps you on our own steps yet you find humor in this!?&quot; One
of the female rogues in the room bellows at the sight of your
giddiness.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Well yes M'lady, she has left me with a
parting gift.&quot; There is a case of Elven Wine in your
backpack. You offer it to your nearest guild mate to check for
poison, yes it is clean. And a very good year it seems. &quot;I
guess there is still more to this Teir'Dal then it seems.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">As you talked to your guild masters about your
encounter drinking the wine left my your friend you wonder if
Smokeyes will ever find the heart she is looking for, find the
piece of her soul that she is looking for yet knows she will
never find.</p>
