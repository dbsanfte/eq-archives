        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        young half elf&#146;s eyes open slowly. Yet again it is
        time to find a new profession! Only yesterday he was a
        tailor, and due to an oversizing mishap for a grumpy
        dwarven warrior, he is now a retired tailor. Rooksarii
        could not understand his misfortune. Out of all the
        residents of Freeport, Rooks seemed to be the best at
        jumping from trade to trade. But what else was there for
        him? He had no mother or father to guide him into a
        profession. Indeed, the only parents he has known were
        the priests and priestesses of Erollisi Marr, and the
        goddess herself. Despite his never-ending admiration,
        friendship, loyalty and, of course, love for them all, he
        could not stomach the life of a priest. Rooksarii was a
        fellow of action. Though he would gladly spread the word
        of Erollisi to all he met, he could not handle the
        countless hours of prayer and meditation. Thus, the half
        elf with the purple eyes prepared himself for another
        trade........he heard that the O&#146;donnars where
        looking for an apprentice brewer..........</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Although his life sounded pretty clear and unfettered,
        Rooksarii was troubled by a great deal of sorrow which he
        always kept inside himself. There were only two keepsakes
        that were left with him at the Temple of Marr all those
        years ago. One was a mask, divided into four sections, 2
        black and 2 white, arranged in a checkered pattern. The
        other was a medallion depicting that same mask with a
        falcon perched upon it, clutching a rose in one talon and
        a saber in the other. This was all he knew of his parents.
        Though the priests and priestesses of Marr were the
        kindest foster parents he could have asked for, he had no
        brothers and sisters to call his own. The truth was that
        the Erollisi order had mostly human orphans, and no elven
        or half elven ones. Furthermore, few if any of the
        priests could tell him what life was like having the
        blood of an elf and a human course through him. And then
        there were the rumors.......</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon
        reaching the age of 10, Rooks was allowed to go into the
        market place to help one of the Brothers of Erollisi
        fetch some reagents for the incantations of the head
        priests and priestesses. He was filled with joy, for this
        was his first trip outside of the temple courtyard. The
        day drew on quite well until one of the Freeport Militia
        caught a glimpse of his deep violet eyes. &quot; Time to
        die scum!!&quot; barked the guardsman, blade raised and
        ready to end the young half elf&#146;s life. Petrified
        with fear Rooks stood there, the color of his eyes
        blurred by the tears that began to fall from his eyes out
        of sheer fright. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hold your ground guardsman!&quot;, the brother
        yelled</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Are you mad?!?! That is a dark elf! Enemy to all of
        Freeport!&quot;, screamed the guardsman, eager for the
        kill and the bounty it would bring him.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do you not see that the boy&#146;s skin is of the
        color of human flesh? Not the deep hues of the dark elves!&quot;
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But those eyes!!!!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A miracle of Erlollisi!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A damnation Cazek Thul!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Heathen!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;His days are numbered!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
        silence.............................</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Rooksarii awoke in his room at the temple. As he opened
        his eyes he saw an Wood elven woman standing above him.
        Brother Draden, the one who defended him, entered the
        room and softly said, &quot;Rooks, in light of what
        happened, we are sending you to the Sister isle until the
        guards can be tamed, this is not your fault, people can
        be cruel sometimes.....&quot; The woman spoke, &quot;Hello
        there young Rooksarii, I am Shorana, I shall take you to
        the Isle of Erollisi. You will be able to train in
        whatever you wish, or you can simply play about the
        island, you are young so there is no need to worry about
        any real training!&quot; By nightfall, Rooksarii was fast
        asleep in one of the huts upon the Isle of Erollisi.
        During his one month stay there Rooks actually found
        pleasure in studying and training in daggers and rapier.
        When the time came to return to the city, Rooks could
        never really feel comfortable walking past the members of
        the Freeport Militia, not even to this day.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What
        am I? Who am I? Countless thoughts raged through his head.
        On his walk home after being fired from the O&#146;donnor&#146;s
        ( one mead, two meads, twenty meads, whats the difference?)
        Rooksarii recalled all those questions that have troubled
        him since that day. It didn&#146;t help that his skin
        seemed to darken a bit with age, almost a bluish color.......but
        that may have been his paranoia kicking in. The fact
        remained that he had a past, but no history. The mask and
        the medallion rested in a small box beneath his bed at
        the inn, holding all the secrets to his past and yet
        never sharing any of them. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
        he began to open the door to the inn, Rooks heard the
        sound of confrontation coming from the Southgate commons.
        Quickly and quietly he made his way to the gate and
        looked around the corner to the west. There he saw 3 of
        the Militiamen brutally kicking and beating a man one
        third the size of just one of them. Rooksarii felt he had
        to do something, to save a fellow being and to simply
        enrage the Militia.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Rooksarii made his way to stand in front of one of the
        cactuses on the grounds, and once he knew all was set, he
        made his move.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Now look at what we have here. Three hulkish brutes
        proving to all the world that they can injure a smaller
        being. My hat goes off to you!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Who goes there?&quot; exclaimed the one of the
        guardsmen,&quot; Show yourself and I&#146;ll let ye die
        quickly!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ahhh, more eloquent speech could not even be heard
        in Erudine! Tell me, was one of your parents an ogre and
        the other a troll?&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It was with that statement that the all three of
        the guardsmen began a steady trot towards Rooks with
        their weapons drawn. Seeing that they were on their way,
        Rooks set his plan into action.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
        Rooksarii loved having the blood of elves running through
        him. This allowed him a certain degree of night vision
        not possessed by the Human guardsmen. As they charged him,
        he deftly moved the south, leaving the cactus he was
        standing in front of to the guards. Rooksarii circled
        around in an arch to the place where the fallen man lay,
        scooped him up and drug his powerless frame into the wall!
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
        was several minutes before the beaten man came to, his
        wounds bandaged thanks to Rooks and his two day
        employment at an infirmary (a foot of bandage, a yard of
        bandage, what was the big deal?) When the man finally
        awoke, the first thing he did, without question, was draw
        a dagger and hold it tightly against Rooksarii&#146;s
        throat. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;First question, how do you know of these tunnels:
        Second, who are you and third why have you kept me alive?
        ANSWER!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, second first, my name is Rooksarii, I used to
        play around in Freeport and I found these tunnels. Lastly,
        I didn&#146;t much like to watch three men beat another
        being to a bloody pulp...ruins my day ya know.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hmmm, by the looks of ya you couldn&#146;t have
        fended them of with battle prowess, and I don&#146;t feel
        magic running through your bones, so it must have been
        through trickery. Though you seem by no means the master
        of such arts, I feel with training you may just lift you
        to that level. Interested in a job?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
        that day forth, Rooksarii was employed as a rogue. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
        seemed amazing to Rooks that here he was trying to make
        ends meet with every profession out there, and his one
        true calling was that of a rogue. To the amazement of all
        the guild members, Rooksarii flew through all the
        initiation stages not only faster than ever before seen,
        but with flying colors to boot. Within no time at all,
        Rooks was smuggling, picking pockets and &quot;Liberating
        Treasure&quot; with the best of them. Rooksarii did not
        consider what he did theft, for he never took a job
        unless the target was a stolen or illegally gained item
        itself, and he was to return it to the rightful owner.
        After some time, Rooks did not ask for money for such
        jobs, the thrill was all it took to repay him.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
        when on like gnomish clockwork for Rooks (occasionally
        there was a disturbance, but after much cursing and such,
        it worked just as good as it did before). There came a
        day however that would greatly impact his life. While
        wandering through the Freeport tunnel system trying to
        figure out if his map was accurate, a gust of wind from
        far down the tunnel blew his map into the water and the
        past forever. Now, being the calm fellow he was,
        Rooksarii proceeded to systematically try and find a way
        out of the tunnels........</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
        called up every drainage pipe he could find. It was many
        hours until he finally heard a reply. The voice on the
        other end urged him to tell it where he was, or at least
        what the area around him looked like. Within minutes,
        before Rooksarii stood a fellow by the name of Drubone.
        Little did Rooks know, he had not only found a life long
        friend, but he had also found a mentor, teacher and a
        brother at arms and in spirit. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
        the way from the tunnels to the tavern, Drubone and Rooks
        traded joking banter of how Rooks had become trapped in
        the tunnels, and of life and professions. Drubone was
        full of not only useful and helpful hints regarding the
        life of a rogue, but his stories of far off lands and
        strange and bizarre creatures lit a fire within Rooksarii.
        As the night wore on, so grew this fire. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
        Rooks said his good-byes to Drubone and rested
        comfortably upon his bed, his inner being was ablaze with
        wanderlust. Why am I just sitting here, wallowing in my
        lack of knowledge of the world and myself? All these
        years have gone by and all I have to answer them with is
        more questions. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
        any where in that room at that time, they may have
        mistook Rooksarii&#146;s eyes for two blazing purple
        flames. With not another thought, Rooksarii leaped from
        his bed and drew forth his old tailoring kit, still
        scratch from where that dwarf threw it at him. He found
        all the loose clippings of puma and lion skin he had
        collected off the tailoring shop floor and within the
        hour, he had himself a full leather armor suit! Quite
        good he thought! Why should he stay in the same town
        wondering where he is from when he can go out into the
        world and find out! He picked up the snake fang Drubone
        gave to him out of friendship, slung a backpack over his
        shoulder and left his inn room. All that would serve as
        an indication that the room once belonged to Rooksarii
        was the empty box under the bed. That night, there was a
        large coin purse left upon the steps of the Temple of
        Marr with a note that simply said &quot;Thank you all&quot;.
        An innkeep received 3 months of back payments and an
        extra one for putting up with a half elf more than he
        should have. And the guards at Southgate related a story
        of how they slew an insolent whelp defending a rogue many
        years ago. All were unaware of the shadowed figure
        slipping out of the city wearing a black and white
        checkered mask, and adorned with a pendant depicting the
        mask, the falcon, the rose and the blade..........</font></p>
