        Anselm is a bit mysterious. Found in a natural cavern
        which drawven miners broke into he was cared for by the
        clerics of Brell Serilis until able to function in
        dwarven society. </font></p>

        It was never ascertained how Anselm came to be in that
        cavern or for how long he had been there as he was full
        grown when found. No natural entrance to that cave was
        ever found other than a small stream that flowed from
        underground and disappeared again. Other than the
        unmentionable cave creatures Anselm had apparently lived
        on the only other thing found in that cave was a hatched
        dragon egg. </font></p>

        Anselm is dedicate to proving the honor of the Underfoot
        by his total commitment to the well being of his
        companions always will to sacrifice himself for them.
        While in one of his many frequent trance states, Anselm
        was visited by the avatar of the great father of all
        dragons. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img

        He was told that was old must be undone in order for all
        to be made one in the new. That to do this he must
        dedicate himslef completely to the support of a half elf
        brother and sister, a ranger and a bard and they, though
        they did not know it, would some day be the means by
        which he learned the secret of his relationship with the
        dragons<br>
