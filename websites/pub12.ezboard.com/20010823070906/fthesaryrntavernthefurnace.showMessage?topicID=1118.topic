Once again, I find no satisfaction. Once again, I find that Order of the Phoenix confuses entertainment with learning. Let me begin by citing a range of examples from the public sphere. For starters, I like to face facts. I like to look reality right in the eye and not pretend it's something else. And the reality of our present situation is this: Order of the Phoenix periodically puts up a facade of reform. However, underneath the pretty surface, it's always business as usual. Order of the Phoenix's formula for sesquipedalianism is more short-sighted than ever. Am I saying that Order of the Phoenix uses a rather ignorant definition of "labyrinthibranchiate"? Yes. That Order of the Phoenix is controlling and demanding? Maybe. That Order of the Phoenix has a deficiency of real goals? Definitely. <br>
<br>
In order to teach obtuse dunderheads about tolerance, we must shelter initially unpopular truths from suppression, enabling them to ultimately win out through competition in the marketplace of ideas. And that's just the first step. Remember, Order of the Phoenix is utterly gung-ho about Comstockism because it lacks more pressing soapbox issues. What I just said is a very important point, but I'm afraid a lot of readers might miss it, so I'll say a few more words on the subject. I definitely hope that humanity will rid this earth of refractory lugs with the greatest dispatch, since otherwise, the earth might well become rid of humanity. Before Order of the Phoenix spews any more psychoanalytical drivel, let me assure it that the first lies that it told us were relatively benign. Still, they have been progressing. And they will continue to progress until there is no more truth; Order of the Phoenix's lies will grow until they blot out the sun. Someone has to be willing to stop Order of the Phoenix's encroachments on our heritage. Even if it's not polite to do so. Even if it hurts a lot of people's feelings. Even if everyone else is pretending that Order of the Phoenix has mystical powers of divination and prophecy. <br>
<br>
So, Order of the Phoenix, maybe the problem is not with crotchety blusterers, but with you. What this underlines, I think, is that Order of the Phoenix refuses to come to terms with reality. It prefers instead to live in a fantasy world of rationalization and hallucination. I could accept, perhaps, vituperations backed by the forces of logic and powerful reasoning. Sophistries marked with hypocrisy and contradiction, however, merit none of my respect. Lest I seem like a hypocrite, I should tell you that a central fault line runs through each of Order of the Phoenix's ploys. Specifically, Order of the Phoenix's ability to violate strongly held principles regarding deferral of current satisfaction for long-term gains is astounding. No joke. <br>
<br>
Order of the Phoenix has been deluding people into believing that its views are Right with a capital R. Don't let it delude you, too. Isn't it true that Order of the Phoenix has never been accused of objectivity? If that's not true, tell me why not. For those who need very specific examples in order to grasp the significance of Order of the Phoenix's slogans, I'll give a very specific example: Think for a moment about the way that when Order of the Phoenix tells us that we should all bear the brunt of its actions, it somehow fails to mention that I am burning to know what types of vengeful twisted reasons exist in the heads of those who incite pogroms, purges, and other mayhem. It fails to mention that I am not suggesting government censorship of Order of the Phoenix's judgemental analects. And it fails to mention that if we let it let phlegmatic provocateurs run rampant through the streets, all we'll have to look forward to in the future is a public realm devoid of culture and a narrow and routinized professional life untouched by the highest creations of civilization. Considering the corruption and foolishness that characterize callow vandals, in a recent essay, Order of the Phoenix stated that my bitterness at it is merely the latent projection of libidinal energy stemming from self-induced anguish. Since the arguments it made in the rest of its essay are based in part on that assumption, it should be aware that it just isn't true. Not only that, but there is a simple answer to the question of what to do about its protests. The difficult part is in implementing the answer. The answer is that we must lend a helping hand. <br>
<br>
Do you really think Order of the Phoenix will ever learn from its mistakes? Think about this: Order of the Phoenix thinks it would be a great idea to turn the trickle of fetishism into a tidal wave. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such an idea, the underlying premise is still flawed. Order of the Phoenix does not desire to benefit humanity, but rather to distort and trivialize the debate surrounding mandarinism. The facts as I see them simply do not support the false, but widely accepted, notion that the Universe belongs to Order of the Phoenix by right. Order of the Phoenix likes utterances that rewrite history to reflect or magnify an imaginary "victimhood". Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that it uses the word "heterochromatization" without ever having taken the time to look it up in the dictionary. Organizations that are too lazy to get their basic terms right should be ignored, not debated. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that letting Order of the Phoenix cripple its enemies politically, economically, socially, morally, and psychologically is a recipe for disaster. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would move lackadaisical, destructive Pyrrhonism from the testy fringe into a realm of respectability. I am referring, of course, to the likes of Order of the Phoenix.<br>

The fun of the game is developing those tactics/killing those mobs/getting that loot yourself. While I absolutely DO admire our largest guilds for their ability to tackle areas/mobs which have no time-tested formula and seem all but impossible, I do NOT admire their tendency to quickly mobilize and graze their way through much easier targets which the rest of the world might find challenging and satisfying to do.<br>
<br>
As for the economical aspects of the uber guilds farming, well if obtaining wonderful new equipment in NF is yer idea of fun, then why waste time in EQ?....the Home Shopping Channel has it all! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Anyway...I'm not really brooding over any of this. Might-makes-right on this sever, as I'm sure it does on the rest. I just got a chuckle out of someone suggesting uber-guild behavior was &quot;admirable&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . If this was RL, then sure, I'd admire someone who blazed trails, or provided wonderful new merchandice; but since it's a game, the gestalt manifests more closely to the big kid with a roll of quarters parked at the only Asteroids game in the drugstore rather than the Intrepid Explorer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey kid, gimme a quarter, and I'll show ya how to win da game&quot;<br>

A organization big enuff to corrupt and manipulate an online world.<br>
If it was me and ME being Kinda Me.<br>
I would abuse and use certain markets of items to make profits for my guild.<br>
I'd ruin others playing experience but MINE Would be greatly increased and the others would profit in my guild.<br>
I would make moves to destroy opponent guilds.And even grab the new rising guilds and let them merge with conditions.MAKE AN EVIL GUILD AND CONTROL THIS SHIT.<br>
Pretty soon the world would turn and become OOP's Saryrn server.<br>
You can do it if you start to manipulate certain markets.<br>
If you control 1 market and monopolize the prizes you can buy the world.<br>
2nd plan is to get in friendly with the 3rd or 5th runners up to the biggest guilds on the server.<br>
Create a merger but make it VERY VERY Clear who is freggin in charge.After thats established.<br>
You begin your riegn of terror.<br>
