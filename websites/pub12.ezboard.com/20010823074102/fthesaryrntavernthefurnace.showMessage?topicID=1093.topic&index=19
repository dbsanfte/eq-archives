I guess lashing out makes u feel better.  I think you named yourself after a cat because you are a fucking PUSSY.  howling stones..yes i was there too, we were doing a cr from a 5person group,,had a necro summoning and a chanter had the mobs mezzed..if i remember correctly you came in and attacked the mezzed mobs ,, then after we shouted for you not to attack them b/c they were mezzed you left and made some smartass comments..along the lines of we not gonna CR you..which was very clever seeing as how we were finishing up and leaving...to me yes starburst has been a bitch through comments she has made..i guess to impress her &quot;uber&quot; strike force friends..saybr you insulted my guild and my friend, so to me you are shit as well even thouigh i dont know you...as to you insulting chaotic horde..well we didnt have the privelage of having members coming from blood reign,etc that had been playing for 2 years..we forged a new guild and learned things the hard way..we did learn and you can /w all chaotic 3-4 times a week and check out where we are.<br>
in closing,,is starburst a bitch..to me,,aye<br>
did sayber subconsciencly name himself after a cat b/c he is a flaming pussy...prolly in game..in RL im sure he is<br>

<br>
First off the name of the afore mentionned anon gimp is Arizmo.<br>
<br>
Second a good guy doesnt cuss at a lady the way your friend did. I also might add that a good guy doesnt insult people with no apparent reason. You may read his noobie flame again and notice that aside from calling star alot of nasty name he never said why which is pretty stupid. I suggest he enlist for the flame 101 course as soon as possible or grow a brain and some balls while he is at it.<br>
<br>
Third clerics are in no obligation to rez anyone and everyone that die in the same zone that they currently are in. In case you havent notice in sabyr post they were pretty busy trying to stay ahead of the spwan in order to pull their monk corpse out of phinny lair. Which mean no mana available to rez your sorry ass. And in case you havent notice yet star is a chanter not a cleric and no they dont get the rez spell. So why go off on her anyway? And with the kind of language your friend displayed here who do you think started to insult whom first? Safe money is on your anon gimp of a friend arizmo, oops he aint anon anymore is he? Well not to worry he is still a gimp.<br>
<br>
Fourth i highly doubt any of my guys would attack mezzed mob. So next time if you are going to lie please do a better job of it otherwise you will just look stupid.<br>
<br>
Fifth no one ever dragged your guild into this. Quite frankly i dont care about your guild one way or another. What i do care about is when one lame no so anon anymore gimp is insulting one of my friends who is nothing but sweet and helpfull to everyone.<br>
<br>
Finnaly even if what you said was 100% accurate and 100% true resorting to calling someone name out of the blue with no context whatsoever is just plain immature and lame. So no your friend arizmo isnt a good guy, he is some punk ass kid throwing a fit over the world not revolving around himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uaristocrataris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aristocrat Aris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/13/01 1:12:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most gayest player on Saryrn</span><hr size=1>    Its funny to read these posts of lonely guys sucking up to star in hopes they they will get some...

<br>
&quot;Come on dude, I would do it for you with my high level cleric!&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah whatever.  You weren't in phinny's room with 6 (one dead that you are trying to CR/ress) so you don't really know what their situation was.  If you ask in a nice way and the cleric says no that's it.  Don't freaking whine, bitch, moan and cuss because it just makes it worse on yourself.  She (the cleric not Star) might have done it at a later time but no freaking way if you act like a bunch of idiots.  Guess you learned a lesson from this all this crap ... no wait you probably didn't learn a damn thing.<br>
<br>
One day you might, just might, learn what honor is.  Ressing someone because they ask you too does not make you honorable.  It makes you a nice person for that one instant. <p>Panth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soldarislamerchant>Soldaris LaMerChant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/13/01 2:34:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Nalice_LM/SOLD2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Most gayest player on Saryrn</span><hr size=1> palys are gay....why is this thread still going on.....?....it was already discussed in game....sheesh let it die <p><img src="http://members.theglobe.com/Nalice_LM/CAT.JPG">
