Its yourselfs and the raid leader that was leading the raid fooken fault. Damn what was his name Solicities or some shit like that. If your gonna fooken lead a raid ...you are responsible for every fooken person that is on your raid even if your raid fooks up. You are responsible to get there corpse and clean up your cr. Evildoer was doing his thing on getting his mate out of there. His mate ask him for help and he was there simple as that. ED has his hands full with his guild. Im sure he didnt have time to SC all your asses out of there. Or take his guild to clear mobs to get your corpse all scattered about. <br>
<br>
People well plane newbies i should say. If you dont know how to break a plane or run a raid you shouldnt be doing it. Yes i know ya want your decent loot from PoF or PoH. But if you know nothing about the fooken zone why the fook ya go. You people who go on raids with these server wide raids where ya got 5 to 6 really no named guilds, gotta realize who is leading the raid and does he know wtf he is doing?<br>
Cause if not be ready for a long frustrating night of people. <br>
<br>
For ya people flaming H&amp;E ya all need to realize.....he gots a guild to run and he takes care of it. So if he didnt help ya out dont take it personal. It wasnt his responsibility to take care of your all in that raid was it? He was just taking care of his mate. Sure he could have had the courtesy to offer to help, but i believe he was doing Velketor and Vindicator that night, he has a guild of his own to satisfy..<br>

Especially with 1 death running from west wall to north wall and then cring.<br>
<br>
I don't think 3 people could have even cleared fast enough to do a full cr, especially with out a monk present. I agree with kiddo its the raid leaders job to plan/beg a cr stratigy and not another guild who happen to be there on a fast hit and flee mission.<br>
<br>
It would have been nice for the cleric to camp out and wait for bodies to be dragged there. I assume the cleric in question had to be on another raid or he would have waited a few before leaving, especially when he isnt sure if the people in question can even hold the camp from the few wanderers that will show, a minor risk but understandable he didn't want to take it.<br>
<br>
I remember when yurian died 20 times in the good old days while doing north wall cr before level 51 existed and before we bought a clue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

First, u lead a damn raid, u fook ppl up cause others dont have enough time and men power to clean the shet up behind u?<br>
Second, i was the one who got Ghandelf kill and i m sure that i wasnt in ne raid when his butt was slained by 6 spiders and 3 shiverbacks.<br>
Third, i believe all major guilds in Saryrn will love to help out newbies on some differcult CR when they fooked themselves up in some nasty places.  BUT, dont expect people will always behind your back especially we only have 3 ppl in a full pop Fear.<br>
Fourth, maybe Mooshu was a bad boy when he was young, but after he joined HaE, i never see anything bad about him AT ALL.  He was not even in the CR action and you keep putting him down.  Think bout what you talking bout before you throwing bombs all over the world.  Look at what you said and edit it so you dont look like an senseless idiot.<br>
Fifth, why dont you post your real name there when you think you doing the right thing?  Being a coward and bark in the dark, what kind of dog is that and ill make sure i wont buy one of those puppy in my life time.<br>
Sixth, totally agree with Kiddo *and thx for sharing your opinion here*.<br>
Seventh, Evildoer has been repected by me, all HaE, and i believe many other ppl in the server.  However, he is playing for his own enjoyment.  He is not someone that born to help and bless the five thousand ppl in Saryrn.  Don't look him as a good and will be on your side when u stuck your head in your own butt.<br>
Now boy, look at what u said and use your mulfunction brain to think bout the whole thing.  <br>
BTW, the moron who post bout the OoP/HaE sharing spawn thing, look at the topic before you type something here.  You are free to express your feeling but hope in the right topic.  The only thing i see from your post is intension to throwing flames between HnE and OoP.  I don't really know what you want, but whatever you are doing is childish.  You can post a new topic bout it and i will happy enough to reply their and tell u the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Thats it, show your wisdom.<br>
