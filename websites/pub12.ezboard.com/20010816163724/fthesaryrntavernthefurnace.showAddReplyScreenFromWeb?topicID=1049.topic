<br>
It doens't really piss me off or anything, but it's just a pet peeve of mine.  I'm sittin here readin threads while being pissed off that new maching wont fucking run anything because the direct3d isnt working, so I'll take this opportunity for a little venting on a close to meaningless annoyace of mine.<br>
<br>
Ok, I am a complete message board whore.  I have probably spent 5 times as much time reading message boards as i have spent playing eq.  That's not to say that I have a catastrophic number of /days played.....but my /days reading message boards is pretty obscene.  <br>
<br>
Some message boards are merely a wasteland of idiots.  Others are filled by mostly intelligent people.  Most are in the middle somewhere.  One thing is common though.  Nearly everyone hates anon posters.  Now, I completely understand why.  The vast majority of anon postings  would be complimented be being called a flame troll.  They are almost always very bad.  This naturally gives anon posters a bad name over all.<br>
<br>
What I would like to point out to everyone is that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with posting anon.  This board has a pretty high percentage of intelligent posters from what i have seen, but yet nearly all of you fall into the exact same trap.  I expect it from some people, but so many times I see people i KNOW to be intelligent and levelheaded people do the exact same thing......<br>
<br>
You can call anon posters spineless, you can not give their opinions any respect, you can flame them till your blue in the face, <br>
<br>
BUT......there is one thing that you cannot do.....<br>
<br>
you cannot say someone's arguement is invalid simply because they are anon.  To correctly counter an arguement, you must attack the arguement itself, NOT ITS SOURCE.  By attacking the source insetad you are actually giving them credit by completely avoiding their arguement.  If someone's arguement is completely unfounded, just point that out.....point out the reasons why it is wrong.  <br>
<br>
To attack someone directly as a means of dispatching their arguement is called an "ad hominim" logical fallacy.  If a known habitual liar makes an arguement about something, you may be able to dispute the truths of his premises on his past history, but disputing premises has nothing to do with invalidating an arguement.  The funny thing is, when you have an anon poster, you dont even have any info to work with.  You have nothing to deal with other than the arguement itself, and yet you still feel the need to tear the poster to shreds instead.<br>
<br>
I don't typically post anon myself (did on only one occasion).  It really doesn't matter to me whether ot not people know what i think.  I can see circumstances in which it would be beneficial to bring something up though.  To protect one's own reputation is the simplest reason and is very valid, but the more pressing reason is the protection of others.  What if you needed to bring something to light, but your association to the topic could cause problems to people you are associated?<br>
<br>
For instance, the one time I posted anon was on veeshan when a member of RoS (my guild at the time) was accused of hacking Elderan's account.  Furor went on his typical rampage against people who piss him off and started bashing our entire guild.  I felt this was uncalled for so i popped over to their board to lay down a bit of logical smak.  I posted anon so as not to draw any more heat on my guild.  Did that make my arguement invalid in any way?  No.  In fact, that was the only time I've ever read Furor admit he was wrong.<br>
<br>
Ok, time to take a deep breath and hit my computer with a hammer until direct3d work.<br>
<br>
So, you have done well grasshopper.  Take your newly found insight and and post as the intelligent being that you are.<br>

However, if you cannot back up your words with your identity, perhaps you should not utter it in the first place.<br>
<br>
Even in the example you described. Make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not your guild, but say who you are. 'I am speaking for myself and not for my guild when I say that I have proof that Eldaran was not hacked by anyone in my guild.'<br>
<br>
On message boards, you are measured by what you have posted before. People judge you on that basis. People can take me seriously when I post, because I try very hard not to post about things not in my realm of knowledge. With an anon poster, there is no context to take the argument in. If there is indeed an argument... most anon posters in my experience do not formulate arguments in their posts, resorting usually to a 'nyaa nyaa you suck' type of thing.<br>
<br>
Your reputation in this context is based upon your work to date, attached to a certain 'identity', as well as your in-game actions. When I see an anon poster, my first thought is, 'why are they posting anonymously? Is it to avoid the reputation that they developed themselves?' I really have not seen any 'arguments' to perform an Ad Hominem attack on, to be honest.<br>

<br>
You can say that all you want, but you are a representative of your guild no matter what.<br>
<br>
<br>
"People judge you on that basis"<br>
<br>
Judge posters all you want, but if you don't judge their arguements seperately and independently, you aren't any better than they are.<br>
<br>
"most anon posters in my experience do not formulate arguments in their posts, resorting usually to a 'nyaa nyaa you suck' type of thing"<br>
<br>
I admitted that fact in my first post when i said, "The vast majority of anon postings would be complimented be being called a flame troll. They are almost always very bad."  In those cases, why is there even a need to acknowledge what they say?  And if you must attack them, attack them because they are idiots, not because they are anon.<br>

"Hey I noticed you play AO - how is it working?"<br>
<br>
I got it about a week ago and havent had too much time to play, but i first loaded it up on a celeron 700, with a voodoo3, 196m ram.  When i got to the chr creation area, the controls took a bit to get used to, but I was struck by the sound.  I've played EQ all this time and never played with sound because i thought it was ass.  <br>
<br>
When I went to kill stuff in the noob zone, it was night.  VERY dark.  The music was great though.  It felt really immersive.  I was walking around in the dark and catching glimpses of the tall grass passing my head, and i was just like, "wow."  Once I moved into the city area, the lag was just stupid.  Stupid I say.  Later i found that turning the fog down helped tremendously.  It was still pretty laggy though, and I crashed every 10 mins while exploring the city.  No disconnects while out of the city zones though.  <br>
<br>
They just made a huge patch a couple of days ago that was supposed to address a TON of issues, but I've been trying to get a new maching up and going so I havent had much of a chance to test it out.  I got it to run on my new machine (1.2athlon, 512ddr, geforce3) for about 5 mins last night (machine problems not ao), and running through the city with all of the graphics options on full, i was getting almost no lag at all.<br>
<br>
I'm only lv 8, so I haven't really experienced much of the game yet, but so far it seems way more solid than people give it credit for.  There are still problems, but if you can learn the "doc, it hurts when i do this, well, then, dont do that" thing, then it should be ok for you.  Another thing is, once you can afford health and mana recharge kits, there is almost zero downtime.<br>

Anon posters don't really bother me unless they are spewing forth a river of ignorance only matched by someone from the deep bayou =P. <br>

The one thing that does bother me however, is people who are wishy washy when it comes to their own opinions and thought processes. If you can't stand by your word, what can you stand by? A man's word is his bond. <br>
