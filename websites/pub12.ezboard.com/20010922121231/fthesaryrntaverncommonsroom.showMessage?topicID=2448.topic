Need to get it off my chest....<br>
<br>
Was running along through a relatively uninhabited forest on my way to Queynos when I see... &quot;A spectre begins to cast a spell.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, I have never pulled or fought a spectre in my life. All I know about them is that people ran like hell in Oasis when someone dragged them to the dox. (They did kill me twice, I never got the chance to fight back)<br>
<br>
Old instincts kicked in, and I feigned death as soon as I saw the spell message. Luckily, apparently the spell was not directed at me. Whenever a hostile spell lands on me, feign breaks. Always.<br>
<br>
Wanting to check the situation out, I popped into 3rd person view to make sure it was safe before I stood up, and saw a spec fighting 2 other players a little ways off. <br>
<br>
Ah! I think, someone is fighting them, it's not after me. I broke feign and continued on my way. Thean I get the tell: <br>
<br>
&quot;A**hole.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; I ask.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pulled Specs&quot; He says.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think I pulled anything...&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
&quot;F. U.&quot; He says.<br>
<br>
I tried to figure out what happened, but he stopped returning my tells. <br>
<br>
Well, I still don't think I pulled any specs... I didnt go near any spec camps, and if they were on me, their spells would have connected. Or I would have resisted. But no spells were directed at me, period.<br>
<br>
I assume either the guy agroed the specs or someone brought them to the zone and they were on their way back and agroed him. He saw me, a feigned monk, and assumed I was the one that pulled them. (Admitted... monks are known for doing this I am sorry to say)<br>
<br>
Well, in case I am wrong, I apologize deeply. I go way out of my way not to train mobs on people when I feign or die. Yes, I have died trying NOT to train people. <br>
<br>
I try to bring honor to my class. I tried to offer to pay for a rez if anyone had died, wether it was my mistake or not, but you did not reply.<br>
<br>
Allrighty, be well everyone!<br>

Don't sweat it.  You can't please everyone, and there are enough grade-A morons playing to ensure that you wouldn't want to, anyway.<br>

There are what 10 or so Giants up at any one time?  You know how hard it is to see people engaged with giants too especially the little druids who leave them rooted so it looks like they arent engaged.  Well, we see a giant standing on the hill so He casts a second before his spell lands another spell lands..the giant comes for us, we begin to kill it as it is stuck on aggro and is not goin back.  <br>
<br>
Immediatly after we get zone shouts...KS'ing group on the giant hill... i get tells /asshole you ks'd my giant bla bla... this went on for a good 10 minutes with me getting tells on how we were KS'ing assholes blabla...Jesus man, we never saw you and i think there were about three giants roaming around right near were this was...what the hell does it matter just go get another one and shut the hell up.  <br>
<br>
I really dont understand people sometime... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessage?topicID=2442.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessage?topicID=2380.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.emailToFriend?topicID=2448.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.threadControl?topicID=2448.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2448.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2448.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntavernfrm14">Attack on America<option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#DDA0DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom>Commons Room</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
