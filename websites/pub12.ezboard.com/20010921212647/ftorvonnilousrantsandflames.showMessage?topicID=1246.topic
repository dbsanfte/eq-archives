<br>
Who is using a guilt Trip??<br>
<br>
It was never the Palestinians, they never had claim to the land. The Jews were in that land for many year before it was made an official state by the UN in 1948!!<br>
<br>
And the the Palestinians go and shoot innocent ppl just for being Jewish??? What kind of crap is that? They blow up large centers of towns Tel-Aviv, main centers in Jerusalem, for what? <br>
<br>
No, I have no doubt the Palestinians do not belong there. And for arguments sake lets say they did at one time have a claim to the Jerusalem, they now forfeited it by everything they have done. They have not done anything they have agreed to in the Oslo agreements. While the Israelis did everything word for word. The UN requests a cease fire, Israelis had no problem doing this, since they were doing that much firing to begin with. Yet, the Palestinians continue to kill innocent Jews and Americans who are visiting Israel, for no other reason then they are Jewish.<br>

What claim do the Arabs have to this being their homeland? What exactly is their claim? <br>
<br>
Israelis shooting kids?? How many Childreen and teenagers were shot by Arab shootings? How many kids on their way to school were shot? How many busses of children are shot at everyday?? <br>
<br>
The Arabs take their children and put them in the line of fire. Do you know why? Arab family are being payed $500 for every one of their children that gets wounded and $2500 for every kid that gets killed!! So they take the children and put them in front of soldiers and use them as shields. IMO that is one of the most disgusting things you can do. These kids are tought to hate jew, when they are in school!!<br>
<br>
Let me ask you a question. Should America give the land we have back to the Native americans, and British and other ppl we took the land from? Why Not? <p><center><A HREF='http://www.uniquity-torv.com'><img src='http://www.uniquity-torv.com/sigs/xannsig2.jpg' border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/btorvonnilous.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=toris>Toris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1068<br> <font color=#122950>(6/24/01 11:06:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who owns Israel?</span><hr size=1> I think america should back the hell out of the conflict and let the arabs take what is theirs.

<br>
FACT: &quot;Aggressor&quot; implies that Israel is somehow responsible for initiating the violence. In fact, the Palestinians have created the climate of violence. <br>
<br>
Within months of the Oslo agreement of 1993, Arafat gave a speech in South Africa promising jihad for Jerusalem, a call he has consistently repeated in the Arabic press. Today, the Palestine Authority's official maps and children's textbooks treat Israel as nonexistent -- and show the Palestinian state stretching all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. The PLO Charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel.<br>
<br>
The Palestinian violence is fueled in part by Islamic doctrine. The Koran calls for &quot;eviction by the sword&quot; of any non-Moslem entity holding sovereignty over land in the Arabian Peninsula. In other words, annihilation of the Jews is an Islamic religious obligation, hence the term jihad-- &quot;holy war.'<br>
<br>
In fact, official Palestinian TV, radio and newspapers have urged people to blood and martyrdom. The day before an Israeli soldier was dragged through the streets of Ramallah tied to the back of an automobile, official Palestinian TV depicted the scene of a mannequin tied and dragged by an automobile. <br>
<br>
Following is excerpt of a sermon broadcast live on October 13, 2000 by the official Palestinian Authority television. The speaker is Dr. Ahmad Abu Halabiya, Member of the PA appointed &quot;Fatwa Council&quot; and former acting Rector of the Islamic University in Gaza:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;O brother believers, the criminals, the terrorists are the Jews, who have butchered our children, orphaned them, widowed our women and desecrated our holy places and sacred sites. They are the terrorists. They are the ones who must be butchered and killed, as Allah the Almighty said: Fight them: Allah will torture them at your hands...<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the truth, O Brothers in belief. From here, Allah the almighty has called upon us not to ally with the Jews or the Christians, not to like them, not to become their partners, not to support them, and not to sign agreements with them...<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if an agreement for Gaza is signed, we shall not forget Haifa, and Acre, and the Galilee, and Jaffa, and the Triangle and the Negev, and the rest of our cities and villages. It is only a matter of time...<br>
<br>
&quot;Have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country. Fight them, wherever you are. Wherever you meet them, kill them. Wherever you are, kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
VIOLATION OF ACCORDS<br>
<br>
Throughout the current wave of violence, Arafat has refused to call on his people to stop the rioting, shooting and firebombing. This is in direct violation of the Oslo Accords and other signed agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. For example:<br>
<br>
<br>
- Commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and that outstanding permanent status issues will be resolved through negotiations (Arafat's Letter to Rabin, September 9, 1993). <br>
<br>
- Abstention from incitement, including hostile propaganda and adoption of legal measures to prevent such incitement (Interim Agreement, Article XXII). <br>
<br>
- Adoption of all necessary measures to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities and taking of legal measures against offenders (Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Article XVIII; Interim Agreement, Article XV). <br>
<br>
- The Palestinian Police will act systematically against all expressions of violence and terror (Interim Agreement, Annex I, Article 11.1). <br>
<br>
- Palestinian side will make known its policy of zero tolerance for terror and violence against both sides (Wye River Memorandum, Article II.A. la).<br>

&quot;It was never the Palestinians, they never had claim to the land. The Jews were in that land for many year before it was made an official state by the UN in 1948!!&quot;<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
The last Jewish rule(ie jewish king) was when Kingdom of Judea was conquered by the Babylonians in 597 B.C. The muslims have occouppied it since the time of Mohamed (638 A.D.)(with various rules and colony periods) until the creation of the Modern State of Israel (1948 A.D.). <br>
<br>
The proplem with the peace process is that neither side with negotiate in honest good faith. The Palestinians are not willing to except that Israel as a country has a right to exist(though most of the  peace agreements have tried to get past this). The Israel are not willing  to except that the Palestinians have the a right to exist as country and not be subject to Israel's security needs.<br>
<br>
There are no easy solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East. The best thing both sides could do is to acknowledge they both should exsist and try and deal with each other fairly.<br>

The Arabs leave the Palestinians in makeshift tent camps. The Israelis begin to build cheap ugly concrete apartment blocks for all the Jews from Arab countries. <br>

1956: Egyptian Colonel Nasser seizes Suez Canal from Anglo-French stockholders. The Canal and Straits of Tiran are closed to Israeli or Israel-bound ships. This prompts an invasion of the Sinai by French, British, and Israeli forces. The armies are forced to retreat under pressure from the Soviet Union and United States. This underscores a humiliating loss of influence and power for the English. <br>

Final thought, they're both to pompus and pridefull to ever agree on who should live where.  My solution: build a huge fense around Israel, arm EVERYONE (like they aren't already), give them a week and kill whoever walks out.  Then Egypt, Jordan, Seria, and Lebanon would have more parking spaces. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Crystalys Doomspire<BR>
