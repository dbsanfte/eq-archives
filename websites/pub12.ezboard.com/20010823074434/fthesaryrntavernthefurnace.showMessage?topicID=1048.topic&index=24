Fuck it here is another clue when Moobay and I was in the same guild once he pulled that same fucking stunt. Only difference he is just another band of idiots he is taking advantage of.

This is what Qelin posted.. cause I know its going to bring back memories for him.<br>
<br>

Qelin:<br>

I agree.....I mean the story about switching servers never did make any sense. and if they did switch him why would they switch him back? why did we powerlevel this guy a new monk to play and probably sell too? why do we keep giving stuff to an account that has 3 people all trying to take it. I honestly don't see any way that the &quot;buyer&quot; mooshu could have gotten mooshu's posting info unless rick/mike gave it to him. I.E. <br>
1)Mooshu makes up a bunch of crap about switching servers because someone reported him. and uses it as an Excuse to E-Bay his account<br>
2) The buyer sends mooshu his money. <br>
3) Back on saryrn after he was &quot;moved&quot; Mooshu asks to get powerleveled on a new account.<br>
4) Mooshu Mysteriously apears back on saryrn. (did he ever leave?) <br>
5) Mooshu gets his now mostly sold inventory built back up by the guild.<br>
6) The guy who bought the account starts playing mooshu.<br>
7) Mooshu starts getting online and on the message boards Claiming that he is &quot;being hacked&quot; and everytime he gets online someone is &quot;trying to hack him&quot; or trying to &quot;hack his friends&quot; <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  BTW at this point mooshu has given the &quot;buyer&quot; all of his passwords includeing the messageboard one. HOW ELSE COULD HE HAVE GOTTEN IT????????? I mean you don't just give out your messageboard password. He sold it with the account. And was trying to dupe the whole guild so they wouldn't notice.<br>
9) Mike Recieves his money. He then decides he wants to get mooshu back so he logs on and off while this other guy is and then he calls up verant with the original CD keys and gets the account back.<br>
Winner: Mike<br>
Loser:The Buyer,The Guild <br>
I know mooshu was a good guy and fun to play with but he's just a character in a role playing game and you have to realize that. Hell even I can pretend to be nice on occasion. before you go off on me just a few things I want to ask: <br>
<br>
1)Was the account on E-BAy?<br>
2)How did &quot;the buyer&quot; get the webpage password?<br>
3)Does half of mooshus story make any sense at all? &quot;I was warned by the GM's for shareing an account&quot;(who has ever heard of this happening) then all of the sudden his story changes to &quot; I was switched servers by the GM's for the same offense&quot; Verant has no evidence of whose playing what account. Why would they just ban someone on someone elses word? &quot;The Guide made a mistake and the GM's moved me back&quot; Only a lead GM has the power to move someone to a different server and it's not something they just do for kicks. Besides how the hell would moving you to a different server change whether or not more than one person played your account?<br>
It takes a hell of a lot of faith to believe all that shit, and quite frankly thats more faith than I have. <br>
<br>
I think all involved parties should be removed from the guild <br>

Try asking him yourself.  Ask the following questions and hold out for a FIRM STRAIGHT answer.  Don't let him beat around the bush.  Get a yes/no response.<br>
<br>
- Did Mooshu ever put his account on ebay?  yes/no<br>
<br>
- Did Mooshu ever sell a red dragonscale that he was awarded as guild loot for the warrior FA?  yes/no<br>
<br>
- Did Mooshu ever sell an Edge of the Nightwalker sword that he was awarded as guild loot (back when the sword was actually quite good compared to other weapons available)?  yes/no<br>
<br>
Mooshu has answered all these questions in the past with a YES.  Ask him yourself.  I doubt he will lie.  I saw the account on ebay myself.  So did the rest of the guild.  When asked, point blank, if he sold the red dragon scale and Edge of the Nightwalker Mooshu tried to avoid the question.  He would answer something like &quot;I'm going to get them back&quot;.  Or &quot;my friend on the other server has them.&quot;  Fact is, he sold them, and if you pry hard enough he will most likely admit it.  I kept pressuring him and asking over and over, and he did finally admit to me that &quot;his friend that has them&quot; is actually the person he SOLD them to.<br>
<br>
He most likely sold other stuff as well, but the 2 items mentioned above were the only ones I ever actually got him to admit to.<br>

So, if you are intelligent enough you ask yourself where this problem is coming from and what is carrying this flame.  Hrmmm seems the main people who have a problem with Mooshu are in OoP.

<br>
Seani.. when it comes to Moosh and TWC he did not get a lot from us I guess. He did contribut to a lot of arguments and namecalling though. And he had somebody in the guild pay for his accounts to be reactivated when they "ran out" and he did not have a CC to renew them.<br>
<br>
I also find it funny that he claims he was never hacked here yet he admitted to it while guilded with us..<br>
