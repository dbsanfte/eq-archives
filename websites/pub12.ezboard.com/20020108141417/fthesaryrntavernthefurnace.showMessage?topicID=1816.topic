Do yourself a favor. Stop playing Everquest, take the 10 bucks a month you spend on it, and attempt to develop a real life.<br>
<br>
I know EQ can become addictive, as can the internet in general to some people, and I know I've been prone to it myself, but seriously. You are taking this to a new, highly annoying level. <br>
<br>
People get hacked all the time. It does suck. But any hacker with half a brain wont leave evidence behind, and the people you are accusing either a) arent talented enough to hack or b) seem to have enough intelligence to remain uncaught.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand seem to be the sort of person to be shocked by all the pop ups after clicking on a porn link.<br>
<br>
The more you post, the stupider (more stupid?) you sound. You are the reason Verant put the server transfer thing into effect.  You are also the reason I dread hitting 50+. I don't want to deal with all the high level fucktards wandering saryrn.<br>

They didn't hack your computer.  Why on earth would they begin to care about you enough to go and hack your PC, even if they could actually do so, which is likely to be damn hard, just locating the relevant IP address would be a nightmare.<br>
<br>
I have been friends with Bethene on EQ for nearly two years, and trust me he has better things to do than waste time trying to drop a trojan on some kiddies PC.. For pities sake he is a grown adult. <br>
<br>
Put briefly - unless you are a 70 year old man who has stolen away their daughters, noone is going to want to spend this much time 'getting back at you'<br>
<br>
You have probably got your PC infected with a virus/trojan/hostile activex object or something, possibly by doubleclicking a virus infected spam e-mail with a .pif extension.  Backup any stuff you need, format your harddisk and reinstall windows and quit whining about it.  PCs suck, they crash often for indeterminate reasons, the least likely reason being that someone has hacked them.  Oh and download Zonealarm and some anti-virus software and use them.  <br>
<br>
Oh - And quit slandering innocent people on line based on spurious assertions which only serve to prove you know absolutely nothing about internet security.<br>
<br>
Does your e-mail address end with hotmail.com or aol.com?  If so, it explains a lot.<br>

<br>
Look, I know you and Aurelle got &quot;in game&quot; married... then things didnt work out. Once you got divorced and she was offline handling her own RL buisness, you were sending tells to every Fam member online, asking her whereabouts and what she was doing. I know this for a fact becuase it was mentioned in guild chat more than once. People saying that Teuen was asking about Aurelle again. So I am more inclined to believe the members of my family, than you as far as this whole sordid story about you being hacked by familjen members. If anyone was joking about hacking your computer well, sorry, but it was just that! A joke.<br>
<br>
As I told you in the other thread, the names that you mentioned are good people, Kiddo, Bethene, and Devon all lead busy lives in game and out. Kiddo works HELLA hours, so I doubt he is spending all his freetime hacking your &quot;shit&quot; (as you so lovingly call it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Devon is too busy doing raids and working tactics to sit around delving into l33t haxxor plans for your pc. And Bethene, well as she said she has been in guild for all of about 3 or 4 days, and she just too nice of a person. <br>
<br>
Now, I suggest that you dont let your fingers play around on your keyboard anymore, whilst you go and try and figure out the difference between Real Life and In Game, because I think the two are a bit cloudy in your mind.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you, and please stop dragging my guildname and guildmates through the mud. we are good people and all we want to do is play a GAME.<br>

Guys, come on, the initial thread got locked for a reason. Teuen, please stop posting. I have a massive headache from trying to figure out what you are saying. But I think it boils down to your relationship with Aurelle.  I think you owe Familijen, Mihceal, Bethene and myself an apology but I won't expect one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   History files tell you which posts you were reading, so when your webpage &quot;exploded&quot; you must have been reading a thread with replies from us.  I have been cruising this board for a year (look at my bio) and I can't recall seeing any thread where people said they were out to get you. <br>

Apparently someone speaks 'crackhead' better than I, and has some good stuff. I have withheld his or her in-game name because I didn't want yet another person sucked into this insanity. I will refer to this person as Deep Trout.<br>

Someone was nice enough to send Teuen a particularly insidious virus named BadTrans. Some may have heard of this virus already. Here is a link for more details on this virus.<br>

From clues, I infer that the second form was used, but perhaps not.<br>
<br>
This virus has indeed a Trojan payload, so I was right. Additionaly, it installs a keystroke logger, the results of which are sent to a particular email address. So, like most mad rantings, there is an element of truth. This virus is indeed an excellent way to get password information from someone.<br>
<br>
Here is what the keylogger looks like. <br>
<br>

<br>
BadTrans presents itself using a common trick of hiding its extension to appear as a more innocuous file. For example, 'stuff.DOC.scr' may be the name of the attachment.  This sometimes fools mail clients into displaying the icon for a word document, depending on how the user has set up the mail client and operating system.  It infects your system when you execute this file, usually by double-clicking it. It cannot infect your system through the reading of a message board thread, for instance. You must execute the file yourself.<br>
<br>
BadTrans apparently replicates by responding to unanswered emails in the inbox. Therefore not only does it make it seem like the email is coming from a friend, the email is recognizable as one you sent the friend yourself! Very insidious. <br>
<br>
So it is not only possible, but likely, that Teuen was sent this file by someone who was unaware that they were sending the virus. I know from experience that whenever a virus report goes out, I will have about 30 of the suckers in my inbox at work, as we use one of the stupider mail servers, and my co-workers seem to have the intelligence of a block of wood, and randomly open all attachments sent to them. Did they meant to send me a virus? No. Did they send me 10 copies each? Sure did.<br>
<br>
Moving on to the password issue. It is indeed possible that someone grabbed Teuen's password from the keylogger,and changed his online account. I asked Deep Trout if Teuen's character has been altered in any way that he knew about. (i.e. deleveled, stuff traded/stolen/destroyed) and to Deep's knowledge nothing nefarious was done. Only the password had changed, and that just took a call to SOE to resolve. So if someone did do all this in order to hack his account, they didn't do much to take advantage of the situation.<br>
<br>
I didn't bring up the porn issue with Deep Trout. TMI, as far as I am concerned. T...M...I.<br>
<br>
So, unless someone has the ability to modify the original source code of BadTrans so that the keylogger payload sends the data files to their email account rather than the original creator of the virus, I stand by my first assumption of Teuen being a crack-addled paranoid. Deep Trout was of the opinion that if you send the virus 'on purpose', you would get the information sent to you- however, I find no indication that the information ever gets sent to anywhere but the original address created by the unknown originator of the worm. I don't know nor care to know anything about the inner workings of such programs, so I won't say I am right and Deep Trout is wrong, but from the literature, it looks like it always gets sent to the same address. <br>
<br>
BadTrans in and of itself does not appear to be destructive to the user's system, instead, its destructiveness seems to be based on the fact that it can inadvertantly create mail loops which could bring down mail servers. It does not appear to delete any files on the user's hard drive.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps to clear up the issue. Some, if not all of my assumptions may be wrong, but this is my best theory based on the admittedly spotty evidence I have.<br>
<br>
I am now waiting for an apology to myself, the other people mentioned by name, and my new guild.<br>

OK, Teuen. I understand you think you were hacked... maybe you were. If so, I'm sorry. Do you still have your characters/equip/experiece?? Sounds like you do. That's a good thing, yes? Teuen, the other thread was not locked because this board is some sort of Familjen safehouse. I locked it because A.) an unknown person was attempting to trash the reputations of good players and a great guild - and B.) the thread was becoming more of a mockery than anything else. Yeah, I know this is The Blast Furnace... sue me. When push comes to shove, this is my board... and I will lock threads that are nonsense and borderline maniacal. <br>
<br>
I'm fairly certain that most the people you accused of being hackers couldn't hack if their lives depended on it... it's a bitch trying to get answers in /gu about anything technical.<br>
<br>
So, I'm going to leave this thread open... hell, I'm even gonna stick it so that everyone who comes to the furnace can see how stupid this has become.<br>

<br>
The he repost and get a sticky and his new thread, also a first on the blast furnace. <br>
<br>
The reason why i love this board so much was the way they were moderated. It didnt matter which guild the moderator belong too or who there friends were everybody got the same treatment. Thread were locked only rarely, i think beside the warrior thread which had become a spamm thread only one other thread had been locked because it dealt with real life threath.<br>
<br>
Now we get a lock on a thread just to spare someone feeling? Since when do we do that here anyway? And to add insult to injury that same person repost more of the same bullshit and get a sticky on his thread. I dont agree with this speacial treatment it compromise the freedom we enjoy here for so long.<br>
<br>
For those feeling sorry for teuen remember that he is the one who made unfounded accusation. The victims here isnt him, its the people whose reputation he is trying to screw up for no better reason than he is upset over getting a virus on his computer. <br>
<br>
He deserve all the flames he is getting and more if you ask me so stop with the special treatment allready. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ugallaorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallaorn</A> at: 12/20/01 2:27:59 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1816.topic&start=161&stop=176>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1811.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1847.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=1816.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=1816.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1816.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1816.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntavernfrm14">Attack on America<option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Shadows of Luclin<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
