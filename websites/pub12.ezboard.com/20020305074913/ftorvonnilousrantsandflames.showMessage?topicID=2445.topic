By going FCFS, you substitute raw desire AND/or ability for cumbersome and inefficient "lists".<br><br>In this instance, a younger guild, raiding IN ZONE, has a better chance of getting their Epic SOONER than if on a list.  How?  Simple.<br><br>You claim that lists are what allows smaller guilds to get their epics at all.  In fact, the adherence to the list, artificially retards your ability to get your epic upon being Rage ready.  So really, by having a list, you make each and every cleric wait MONTHS for their epic.<br><br>Your ultimate fear, is that a guild such as Sacro, BoW, IR, or NoF will by sheer ability screw you out of your chance to get your epic.  Fear based on their ability to mobilize quickly, and dispose of what is to them an easy spawn.  But these guilds typically don't have that URGENT need to mobilize the instant Rage is up.  They have epic wielding clerics of their own.  You think they will up and leave a NToV raid just to gank Rage from a young guild?  Not that likely.  Possible, but not likely.<br><br>Instead, you collectively, and submissively, screw yourselves over by deferring to a vast list once you are ready for Rage.<br><br>In any event, a guild such as HA, with NO epic clerics (AFAIK), and easily capable of dropping Rage quickly would HUGELY benefit from this scenario.  HA needs an epic cleric VERY badly.  I suspect that if Rage was FCFS, HA would spend this entire week doing nothing but Skyfire raiding, and would have an epic cleric within a week of their first cleric becoming Rage ready.  You know this is almost a certainty.  I don't know if you have rage ready clerics in guild.  If so, ask yourself how long have they been ready?  How long would they still have to wait for their epic under the current list?  <br><br>Your biggest competition over a FCFS Ragefire, is going to be from other guilds in YOUR league.  Other guilds that need that first or second clicky stick cleric.<br><br>There is no way in hell that FCFS leaves more Rage's up than reservations.  FCFS rewards people for TWO reasons.  One is ability (which frightens all younger guilds).  Second, is desire.  The guilds most desparate for the Epic, will get their epic soonest.  The only time you will be KSed by an "uber" guild, is when their desire for a stick begins to approach yours, and they can trump you in ability.<br><br>And even should that happen once or twice.  It's still better than submitting to "claim" the 22nd spawn from the date you are ready.  Basically you are conceding 21 spawns to be "KSed" from you by agreement.  Not all clerics (well, more appropriately: GUILDS) on this list have the same level of pure need.  There is currently no way for a guild or cleric to do anything proactive, to address this.<br><br>I can see the value of a reservation system, when there are a large number of epic ready guilds all desparate for their first or second rez stick.  There aren't that many dragon capable guilds that have that same desparation anymore.  The pure NEED for a list has long since passed now that the server population has matured.  <br><br>The time where a Rage rotation is needed to avoid bad blood amongst guilds has long passed.  In fact, the inflexible rotation now only serves to promote bad blood between those that really need their epics, and many of the others that do not.<br><br><br> <p>Emmalythe 29th lvl teabagger armswoman (retired)<br>Iron Fist guild - Palomides<br><br>Attyla the Unguilded<br>43rd Troll Shadowknight<br>Torvonnilous</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usojo1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sojo1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#122950>(2/1/02 11:16:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ftorvonnilousrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2445.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, FCFS or Rotation?</span><hr size=1> FcFs = ) <p>-Soj <br> Court of Pain</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uxeroband.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xeroband</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#122950>(2/1/02 11:22:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ftorvonnilousrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2445.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://staff.washington.edu/toughguy/bruce.gif width=78 height=59></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, FCFS or Rotation?</span><hr size=1> If I cared anymore I'd say fcfs. <p><center><image src="http://staff.washington.edu/toughguy/xerosig1.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3795">Groovy</a><br><i>"Even though a man may have more hairs on his head than there are stars in the sky, that doesn't mean that he can plan a successful party that movie stars will attend and enjoy."</i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usirakova.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sirakova</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Original Disco Barb<br>The revolution will not be televised<br>Queen of Halas</span><br>  Posts: 1082<br> <font color=#122950>(2/2/02 12:59:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ftorvonnilousrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2445.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ratm.com/new2/gallery...dn0018.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, FCFS or Rotation?</span><hr size=1> Atylla puts it in a way that is unbiased and not immediately dismissed and flamed because of my guild.<br><br>Sirakova Winterwolf<br>Warlord of Sacrosanct <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/utamria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 644<br> <font color=#122950>(2/2/02 1:00:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ftorvonnilousrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2445.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, FCFS or Rotation?</span><hr size=1> Why should VS be treated any differently to Ragefire?<br><br>I've always supported a rotation on Ragefire simply because it gives you a predictable and plannable time to kill him.

If we want to change it, we, as a server, need to have a new system to put into place.<br><br>The two threads that I am attempting to moderate in hopes of a cure are not designed to change anything.  They are designed to 1. Come up with a system that would represent a fair rage rotation (&quot;Complete healing Torvonnilous in 10 seconds...&quot;) and 2. To canvas opinions, thoughts, and ramifications of FCFS vs. Rotation (this thread.)<br><br>Ul, I appreciate you jumping in, however, you didn't add any content to the thread, what are your thoughts concerning rotation vs fcfs?<br><br>With a modified rotation system, such as has been discussed on the other thread (top cleric gets a short time, top three get a bit more time, then fcfs the whole list) I feel that rage will be brought down in a hurry, plus, the system will still be fair to those folks that need the advance planning that a rotation system allows. <p>Jhonno Urso, Templar of the 57th Truth<br><IMG SRC="http://home.adelphia.net/~monolith/HAjhogen.jpg" ALT="Big Siggy"><br><strong>"Mark, why are there airholes in this crate?"</strong></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uuinael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uinael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/misc/bandit.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 1094<br> <font color=#122950>(2/2/02 12:44:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ftorvonnilousrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2445.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire, FCFS or Rotation?</span><hr size=1> hehe no thanks.
