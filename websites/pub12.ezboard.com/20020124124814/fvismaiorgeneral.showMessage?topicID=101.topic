Vis tried it best to minimize the pull of unnecesary mobs so that the guild that reserved Fear could still get as many mobs as possible.  In the beginning we didnt even loot any mobs but they asked us to shout what dropped.  After than all armor dropped were shouted out loud and left on corpse for them to decide who got em.  Even some of Vis could use particular pieces were repeatedly reminded not to loot any armor or weapons.<br>
<br>
  So Vis tried to minimize its interference with Fear such that we pulled CT when the zone was almost full knowing we would die.  We did pulled and we did die to train of mobs.  All we're interested in were epic quest items nothing more.<br>
<br>
  It's really a joke if anyone reserved the plane for just Gods.  First there is no knowing if gods would spawn at the date of reserved dates.  Just for the sake of argument Vis reserve fear and no God spawn, what we're gonna do with the zone when 90% of us have better than what may drop.  Abandon the zone? that would break QQ rules and we would be denied to reserve planes in the future.  So having gods in the zone with QQ current system is merely pure luck and added bonus.  Nothing more.  If Vis or any highend guild takes the gods away, simply meant they take away the added bonus.<br>
<br>
  Number of times, I asked to join fear raids so I can have a shot on my epic quest item.  I was denied to all but one so far.  I even throw in some interesting offer such as Vis would help clearing the zone at rapid pace and we would not roll on anything but God's items and epic items.  A roll not even a default, but such offer is refused.  I personaly could not think of anything better to offer.<br>
<br>
  We all agree that current system is filled with abuse and we did monitor fear somewhat closely prior to the incident and noticed how some group managed to stay in fear for a bit while.  That is abuse of the system that been for a while now.  Vis dont like the abuse nor anyone else but the abuser.  It is my sincere hope that the fear incident make the community even more realize of the problem and start solving them.  Enough talking and let see some work done.<br>
<br>
  My personal opinion is that the incident doesnt change Vis reputation nor my own much.  The haters remain as they are, the friendly faces most of em remain.  If anyone can come up with a solution, I am all ears. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> dreamsinger silverstaff</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(1/26/01 1:21:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fvismaiorgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> KS</span><hr size=1> Crowx,<br>

Time and time again, you and your guildmates come up with the same recurring theme. &quot;we were only going to take the loot we needed for the epics, and leave everything else to the raiders&quot;. Let me try to explain this rationally. There are many of us that are not privy to belonging to a guild with a group of accomplished lvl 60+ players that can kill whatever at a drop of a dime. My guild has ZERO leve 60 players. I have to work within a reservation system, just like anyone else, to even have a CHANCE to roll on an item that I need for my epic. I am willing to work within a reservation system, despite all its flaws, because I have seen the alternative on other servers. You know what would have happened to you guys on Tallon Zek? The opposing guild would have brought in all their allies, trained every mob on you, and player killed as many of you as humanly possible to re-exert zone control. Many xp deaths later, either you or they would be trying to do a corpse recovery for your guild surrounded by lvl 50+ buffed planar mobs. Now I do not agree with ANY attempts to train, etc, but I am using this as a point to why I would rather work with a flawed reservation system where I might get to go on a planes raid twice a year, than free for all.<br>
<br>
Ok, lets say I finally get my shot. I bust my butt for a couple of days, the god mob spawns, and I get excited that just MAYBE I can get this needed piece for my epic. Then along comes uber guild 0001, who declares they are going to be generous and only kill it for the epic item, and proceed to do so. My next shot at this may come in 6 months now if I am lucky, uber guild's next shot since they now choose to KS the spawns can come in a week.<br>
<br>
Here is the deal. That small time guy is trying to work within the system to accomplish his task. Vis is working outside of the sytem. Whether you like the sytem or not, its the system that the majority of Quellious players have chosen to work with. Those players and guilds that insist on working outside of the system are eventually outlawed and blacklisted for their behavior. Its getting so bad that my GOOD friend Oogobuk, who I have played with since his Ogre warrior days, who has the best heart I know, gets slammed and told they would rather not have him around because his guild might show up and Ninja something.<br>
<br>
So I ask you Crowx, old friend. IS THIS THE IMAGE YOU, AND YOUR GUILD WISH TO PORTRAY TO QUELLIOUS?<br>

So I ask you Crowx, old friend. IS THIS THE IMAGE YOU, AND YOUR GUILD WISH TO PORTRAY TO QUELLIOUS? I hope not individually I know you are a great bunch of people. You, Ooogobuk, Koggrog, Biffins, Occy, have all been great people and were highly respected on this server. But all this push to be the best, and do the best, seems to have metamorphosed you guys when you get together into the collective entity called VM into Frankenstein's monster on the rampage. Why don't you get that monster back in the box, and start shedding some goodwill to the community? A lot of damage has been done, and now IMHO its getting to the point where I am not sure how much repair can be done. Remember the loathing and disgust we used to have for Dragons of Asia? All the problems people used to have with them? I hate to say it, but you guys are the DoA of the present. But there is always hope, and always the chance to change. I just hope you are willing to take on that project and make Quellious a better server for it.<br>

<br>
Seriously 1 word : LOL<br>
you think anyone gonna belive you tryed to be nice even if you have done that lol make me laff............<br>
Sure QQ system is not aprouve by verant... but hum i could name several of you posting for reserving plane and dragon before.... lol you guys make no sense in what you are saying. You said its take you months to have a chance to get a try to ct or inno well its just same for whole server..... so dunno what ur point is but dont worth @#%$.<br>
<br>
Crownx : Number of times, I asked to join fear raids so I can have a shot on my epic quest item. I was denied to all but one so far.

A roll not even a default, but such offer is refused. I personaly could not think of anything better to offer.<br>
<br>
Lol well you guys get what you asked for by ksing people raid so live with it now!<br>
<br>
What i can say if this : FEW of people in vis have showed that they can lead thing and get people for it even tough the way you done it wasnt maybe a good a way but you still have done so its great. For the others you are just a @#%$ bunch of followers Newbies ass kissers. Was it clear enought??? i think it was.... I used to talked and have some of you has friends but geez you guys have acted like freaking homo that all and now you get what you deserve. Clarissa keep hunting YOUR ZOL KNIGHT at seb entrance its probably the only thing you can do alone. No realy what do you except by saying to people go die to trak again and leave my spawn alone, like i told you Shut up the hell up you never done anything your just a other child with too much egos. Also i remeber you occy and talisen in seb shouting trakanon ding when a raid fail... very mature and you have blamed sadre for shouting wave 1 gogogo just like some you have done already. Realy growth up. Some of you guys have realy some egos problems and i wounder how can you look at ur self in a mirror... You guys are maybe trying to become the best guild ( not blamming that cool you guys getting thing done ) but you did it the wrong way.... and anyway you are probably the best guild on quellious its true no one can saying ur not but for sure your not even close to Alterlife or FoH. I used to liked some of you but it seem when few of you joined Vis u lost ur minds and became Jackass. <br>
<br>
Dunno why you try to act like victim: Ho i have to wait 2 months to have a try to ct... blahblahblah bullshit its same for everyone if you had any respect for anyone you would respect it. I mean what kind of guild offer rbg to people for them to join a guild.... Realy that stupid.<br>
<br>
NOw do your thing i dont give a @#%$ like most of people, i can respect what Vis have done but i cant respect any of you cause you been retard.<br>
<br>
And if you think you guys are realy the best i wounder why you guys to powerlvl some of your people in vox cave cause they cant lvl and sucks. Its come to what i said few of you have skills and showed leadership no doubt for the others like clarissa who are ass kisser and newbies YOU CAN KISS MY OGRE ASS!!!<br>
<br>
Last thing: Realy you guys saying ur not ksing no one sure sure ill belive it the day you wont go all anonymous to ksing a spawn.<br>
<br>
for the few i still talk in game that cause i dont have anything agaisnt ya but for the rest see what i said about<br>
<br>
Enought said stop hiding and live with what you asked for!<br>
<br>
YEAH ITS A FLAMMING POST !!!<br>
Wanna flame me ? go for it ill awnser to it and be sure of it!<br>

Asking to join raids when the gods spawned and helping the reserving guild clearing the plane was trying to work on the system.  Reserving fear would only break QQ owns rules since we do not need anything off mobs. well almost nothing unless killing the whole zone and let armors rot and hoping for carmine robe I never have.  But that would be a waste of resources.  We knew we're gonna die when we engaged CT for the zone was almost pulled.  We only cleared mobs that are in the way of his path to pull him.  There's no way to fight 30 temple mobs after killing CT.  We did it this way to minimize our interference of ongoing fear raid, at our expense of course.  So it makes no difference if we were on red server, well we could have killed 2 casters blasting on CT that are not in our party if Quel was a red server.<br>
<br>
Karshan:  You just proved my point.  Haters remain as they are.  your heart would still darkened with hatred even if it were soaked with Tunare's blessed melted snow with Divine Bleach of love of Mith Marr.  Heh maybe now Innoruk himself would feel challenge with his title &quot;Prince of Hate.&quot;  I could just simply play your own game, &quot;LOL you deserve it.&quot;  I could have said &quot; LOL, you deserve it QQ for trying to block our advancement&quot;  but of course it doesnt do any better.  I dont care if you believe we're trying to be nice to them.  Those raiders who were there know that we shouted all pieces dropped for them to assign the winners.<br>
<br>
  Like I said if you can come up with some solution I am all ears.  But if you are to flame, you dont make anything better.  To people like Karshan, should I worry what you think of me?  I dont see why since your already hate my gut inside and outside.<br>
<br>
  All I can say is that what the incident was even hard for us to swallow in making the decision.  BUt the system and its cousins along with its minions have shunned us to hell and back.  To D'void: if your a part of 7 day stay in fear, you know you already abused the system.  If your not, my personal apology for our small interference and your minor inconvenience.<br>

PS&gt; I bet there are many people out there that have been rejected from more raids then you all have. We do not see them pulling this same schoolyard bully @#%$ as you do. Why do you not come out and say what you really think. You do not respect the rest of Quellious communty, and you will continue to take what you want from those that are weaker for as long as you can.<br>

Not that they are forced to FFA because VIS is doing it.  It's just that they have the same view as VIS...reserve system is only working for those who abuse it.  VIS is going FFA earlier than them just because we are ready to take the bash.  Just in case you havnt notice, my view have switched from trying to work out a reserve system with QQ to 'why the hell i should care? you dont want to accept us? so? this is a game, not like i am going to die w/o being accepted.'  Keep bashing/flaming us/me, i keep log in everyday to Quellious, see if any raid up, see if anyone need me, see if i can get a pick up group in Seb, etc, etc.  This is a game to me, you dont accept me, fine, i go on with my way.  I have enough rules to deal with in RL already.  When I am playing a game, I only do what I think is fun and fair [hehe..you all are lucky that i am not evil enough to screw everyone else for fun. if you are old enough, you should know who(couple of them) i am talking about.  If you dont know, you are not old enough or have forgotten already =P]. <br>

Both sides need to back off.<br>
<br>
If Vis are determined to better themselves at the expense of others, they will.  They will have the reputations and acceptance they build for themselves.  If they don't care, well, so be it.<br>
<br>
Vis trying to make themselves seem like a victim is silly.  Just silly.  You haven't TRIED to reserve at all.  I've stated an alternative 3 times.   If ppl don't want to work with you, ask why?  <br>
<br>
If WE aren't going to work with you, why is that? This isn't a question to Vis, but to US... we gotta work with them in return.  If they've screwed YOU over fine, understood...if you heard from your friend or something, or if a FRIEND of yours who wears &lt;Vis Major&gt; needs something, needs help... help him!<br>

It was simply events that lead to the Fear incident.  I am not even using it to justify the action, but simply giving a bird eye view of the incident instead of a very localized viewpoint as one might easily see.<br>
<br>
Sure some of us did ask to join fear/hate raid for a shot of epic item(s).  That we are being denied can be for any reasons.  It's possible as some of you think that people shun us cause our actions.  But I could think of some other reasons.  one of them is need/greed or whatever you want to call them.  Here goes a short story.<br>
<br>
I never claim to be an oldschool though I am 50 way earlier than some of you and in some cases way before you even started your current character.  Before Naggy/VS incidents, there's nothing that can tarnish my reputation.  Yet, when asked to join fear raids, I usually would get a &quot;no.&quot;  Simply because some other wizzies want carmine pieces.  And they dont want competition.  and no surprise, I was asked to go to hate cause people need my porting up there and there are no highly possible drop there for wizzies. (unless you count rod of anihilation off innoruk which is super rare)  So even to this point I still have no carmine robe.  So I can imply the same reason  why Vis members constantly being denied to planes for their epic item(s).<br>
<br>
The fact is, in general, Vis do not need the planes.  Our members need those epic item(s).  In case of fear, it's off CT himself.  Now there is no way thru QQ system that we could even reserve CT.  So even if we reserve Fear, there's no way in knowing if CT would spawn on the booking period, especially if you have to book 6 months in advanced.  I am not a QQ rule expert, but I think there would be penalty if one party reserved a plane and not doing it.  What would Vis do if they get Fear the zone and no CT.  Just kill mobs for the heck of it so Vis wont be penalized for leaving the zone unraided?<br>
<br>
So we tried to get into those zones and being denied.  Reserving fear would ask us to wait month before we will get a chance at it.  And we still dunno if CT would spawn on that day 6 months from now.  What is the alternative?  One we did is to get CT when he spawned last time while trying our best to minimize common mobs killing.  It's not something that we enjoy doing but something that we have to take care the needs of our members.  D'void just happened to be there, a victiom of the wrong place at a wrong time.  funny thing is, none of these posters on Vis board are any d'void's.  How ironic is that?<br>
<br>
Everquest is very dynamic, yet from my observation, QQ is very close if not totally static.  As of now, I havent seen any changes made by QQ to accomodate Epic situation.  I am sure I dont have to remind you what happened to dinasours that refused or failed to accomodate change. so /shrug.<br>
<br>
It's getting late now and I am sleepy, I will try to continue typing my thought when I get up lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukarsh58.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karsh58</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#939393>(1/28/01 3:13:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fvismaiorgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> Well crowx what you seem to dont get is that  VIS is not the only one that only need ct for their epic or innoruk...<br>
There are many people that ask people to join raid and get denied so no in no way your are a victims its just the damn same thing for everyone. Now what happen you guys pop up and ksing spawn that all. Your not the only one that is close to the epics and you are not the only one that only need 1 piece left from ct... others people have to wait that 6 months.... but why you would not ?? cause you can ksing it?? hum...........<br>

I got no RBG..i got no single piece of berzerk armor...no major cobalt item..and not even an indicolite BP which i tried to get in more than a year now. oh yes i am looking badly for a haste item like a RBG or RBB or a cof or berzerk cloak...but i cannot afford to trade for it nor HAS my guild NO EXTRA RBGs rotting around who could be given away to some dumbass lvl 60 who thinks he is special and needs to say such a @#%$.<br>
<br>
else, the majority of us got never Pled in permafrost...THEY GROUPED up there of 3 person groups and hunted normally , nada else. sometimes there was one of our lvl 60s to pull for them...and the last time i hunted there i grouped with a 52 ranger and an 48 cleric ( good friends of mine ) ..noone else was there..and i dont call this Powerlvling.<br>
<br>
and hey ....you are right..like 500 players of those 3000 active players on the quellious server are close to finish their epics...and there are many ways to finish it, but all are doing it in the way they are able to...LOL , but sorry all this reserving system takes a lot of fun out of the game....especially those nice flame posts would become less and i enjoy them so much ...<br>
<br>
sorry , but this is all sad, QQ should be a player forum , trading place ..just everything but a reservation system.<br>

Fear incident is never about being a victim, but merely a way out.  Just like your posting here, will it solve anything w/ dragon breath flaming of yours? Of course not, but it's your way out.  You werent even there to remotely claim to be a victim yourself.  Did members of D'void hire you in pp or items to be their attorney?  I dont even want to speculate that.  Your not on RC to claim to be a victim for having QQ rules broken in any case anyway.<br>
<br>
  Are we special that our needs has to come first instead of waiting many months of planning doing CT and have no guarantee of having him spawn should we reserve Fear? No, we are not, but we are not just gonna sit and not doing anything about it.<br>
<br>
  Fine, if your gonna use old history against us, same rules can be applied for us.  You know we dont acknowledge the authority of QQ on Quel.  You claimed we burned so many bridges already.  Now why would we come back and start acknowledging QQ authority. Is it possible that Vis havent  started marching in planes since VS incident simply out of courtesy and waiting for something to change in the system.  But the system never change, if any it seemed that Vis actions that catalyze any QQ adaptation of the dynamic part of the game.<br>
<br>
One more thing, your saying Vis offering RBG is totally off base.  First of all, Vis isnt very newly founded guild that needs all those 60s. 2nd, we dont have RBGs stored to be offered to some prospectives.  3rd, it's not easy to get into Vis as you might think.  Ask any newer members of Vis how long it took them to join the guild since they express their interest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukarsh58.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karsh58</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#939393>(1/28/01 12:35:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fvismaiorgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> No its true i wasnt victims of the ct events but since you have a msg board and asked people to come talk here that what i have done.

<br>
You see me saying anywhere its easy to get in vis atm???no..<br>
For the rgb thing lets go in the past its was around the time biffins just had joined vis and when nineveh and those people were still in wraith, when vis invited all the 60 or so...and not blamming for the inviting blamming for the rbg thing......Ya could be just a other rumor spalter but by seeing all you guys have done would not surprise me at all.<br>
<br>
For the powerlvl thing once again i didnt said  all none lvl 60 got powerlvled, But on this im sure at 150 percent that some pally powerlvled some ranger and a few others now i think its hard to find who lol....=)Ho yeah the same pally that claimed to roll on a druid shaman staff too... got a clue? lmao.<br>
<br>
Spalter : but all are doing it in the way they are able to...LOL  wow first time you guys actully admit ur are ksing! Now you can stop going annonymous to do it =)<br>
<br>
And if you think saying to a raid leader if you dont kill innoruk tonite VIS will come take it. How gay is this realy? Now tell me its not about an egos problem you guys have. When people on those raid probably need em for epic also. For some newbies doing inno and CT is the thing to do just like it used to be for you long time ago. I mean how you guys would have feel when you first go in fear and that just some other come up and ksing CT......<br>
<br>
You dont belive in qq system its fine nothing can be perfect but the point is not about respecting QQ policy its about respecting the others players in the game but guess you didnt got that yet.It just show how big ur egos is and how stupid you been acting. <br>
