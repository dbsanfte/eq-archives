As to getting people together to kill Ragefire, Fire elemental, Chardok raid.  I think it's definitely doable, however you need to have a network of good friends online that would be willing to team up together to help you out with this endeavor.  Chances are if you know enough of these high level people well enough, you're probably in one of those guilds you mentioned.  It depends I guess on how much you want the epic, if you know what you need to finish the quest, before you start randomly asking people to do a raid or posting on the Saryrn Tavern for volunteers, what &quot;I&quot; would do is work on building associations with people that are in the higher level bracket, help them out with things they need, get to know them well and perhaps after a while they would be willing to lend you a hand.  This is a very time consuming method of accomplishing your epic, no doubt about it.  But I think it is very possible to achieve the quest in this fashion.<br>
<br>
Hope it helps,<br>
<br>
(PS.  If you need a hand doing chardok, fire elmental dude, Ragefire, you can always send me a tell and if i'm not busy I'd be glad to help)<br>

In any case, it's all about luck, and hoping you have alot of friends willing to help you.  Nothing else really.<br>
<br>
Aside from ragefire camp, cleric epic is relatively easy, so I guess the bottleneck is to compensate for that?<br>
<br>
Most guilds will kill Ixiblat for you if they can have any item loot he has (Cof, sculpture of Ixiblat (or something like that), etc). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/urazonlittlefoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RazonLittlefoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/6/01 11:13:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it possible to get your Cleric Epic weapon </span><hr size=1> Dont forget GOL<br>

Its upto the individual trying for them to get the support needed for the various stages.<br>
<br>
Inevitabley the larger guilds will have an easier time at it because they have the support required and the knowledge of how best to tackle these difficult encounters. Its a lot easier doing any particular encounter once you've done it once and everytime after just gets easier, saying that it can be done without being in a guild and I've seen some individuals muster the support required to complete their quests, this has involved a lot of work on their part and a lot of waiting but after all, it is an epic quest and was never meant to be a walk in the park<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for joining a guild just to get your epic well that can see you waiting just as long as most will have others waiting their turn and if that particular guild has a lot of that epic then your quest could be given a very low priority. <p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/kryten.smeghead//"target="web"><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/kryten.smeghead/sig.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uagarthibeornegar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agarthi Beornegar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/7/01 1:39:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/chriscrouse2/wooo!.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it possible to get your Cleric Epic weapon </span><hr size=1> Thats because the people who are organizing the nag raids are the people that intend to camp the 70+ hour camp for ragefire.<br>

<br>
But regarding guilds hogging RF, yes I do think this happens, but usually only for one week at a time, ie, if a guild gets RF camp, they would be wise to hold the camp for as many RF pops as they can before Naggy is due to pop again.<br>
<br>
This is the way most guilds work regarding RF.<br>
<br>
Ancient Council has around 4 clerics waiting for RF spawn, hopefully we can get 2 at a sitting on the camp, I personally dont see anything wrong with this, its been a LONG time since AC did RF around 6 months +, I belive, so no one can really begrudge us getting a further 2/3 inside 6 months.<br>
<br>
Regarding H&amp;E and OOP hogging the camps, I dont think this is true either, they have clerics that have waited a long time to get RF just as other guilds clerics have, they just have more of them thats all.<br>
<br>
As has already been said, getting RF camp is a matter of perserverance, luck, and having good friends whom are on at all times of the day, and a guild that is willing to put things on hold just to help you out.<br>
<br>
I dont think any one guild or group of guilds do hog RF, ToN prolly has more epic weilding clerics in it that AC does, good for you guys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but you need to understand that, as time goes on, and as Saryrn gets older, there will be more and more younger guilds, younger clerics all competing with the older guilds and older clerics, for the coveted RF spawn.<br>
<br>
Of late the guilds whom IMO seem to have had most crack at RF spawn have been Dark Earth, ToN and GoL.<br>
<br>
Seems to me the best way to get RF camp is to either have your guild run a Naggy raid, or find out who is running the latest Naggy raid, and help buff up for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  then attempt to claim the camp after Naggy dies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Maybe Verant could make it so that only 55+ clerics can obtain the epic, that would perhaps relieve some of the competition, and force younger clerics to lvl, rather than compete with older clerics for their epic.... after all.... it only really comes into its own during raids, and lets face it, there are a LOT more 55 + clerics doing raids in a LOT more dangerous places, facing a MUCH greater chance of wipe out, than pre 55 clerics.<br>
<br>
GL clerics <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  its a.... relief, when you finally get it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

although ragefire isn't that hard to kill, its probably the most difficult bit due to the random spawning and that can spell disaster if you've been spending 2 days without sleep and it pops at a time when you can only get 2 of your friends to help<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you look at a lot of the larger guilds there's times duering the day when they have only a few members on and this is the time you pray rage doesn't spawn<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is where guild co-operation plays a big part and on many occasion i'm happy to say I've seen ragefire being killed by people from many guilds.  respect of the person who's spent that time staying there without sleep in the hope they can get the support when it does pop is whats needed, I'm glad i won't ever have to sit there contemplating what i'd do if it spawns when i don't feel i could muster the support required.<br>
<br>
Glad your quest is finally at an end Falla, Your the only cleric I've known who had the camp and gave up the kill to let others bypass you in this terrible quest.  Still think you where foolish to do so but I know that the stick wasn't as important to you as helping others.  Something that is dearly needed in the lands of Norrath.  /cheer Falla<br>

Its all about having the time and co-operation to do it. King is not the hardest mob in 'Dok, Queen is. As for RF, well, you either organise/run or try to get the camp after Naggy's death or hope that no one takes the camp after Naggy goes down. Of course some will say you cant claim the camp less your their in force for the duration but the majority on this server do respect the cleric/guild that manages to get a force there in time to take RF down once he pops.<br>
<br>
Of course, you have to have a guild/grp of friends capable of taking RF down becasue once you spawn him, if you fail, RF will de-pop, as soon as he regens to full health, as we found out in Celtica. That almost made one cleric quit the game, but thanks to another clerics unbelievable generosity ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Falla) the afore mentioned Cleric got his Epic a couple of days later.<br>
<br>
On Saryrn you will find many people and guilds willing to help any Cleric with the RF pop, just holler and many will come, as a shot at red scale, CoF etc is well worth it for them as a sweetener <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That said, if you ever need me or me Warrior for a RF pop, just holler and i will help if not otherwise occupied.<br>
<br>
I personaly think, VI should put a RF in Permafrost, call him ColdFire and have him pop same, once Vox goes down. Hell not many take her down these days and it will get more people into the zone and allow us Shaman to make a killing with potion of the frost <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  just a wild thought of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Oh BTW, big HUGS and GRATZ Falla, the most deserving Cleric to get Epic i personaly know, grtaz hun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><b><u><font color=#0000ff>Alvar Coldraven</font></u></b>
