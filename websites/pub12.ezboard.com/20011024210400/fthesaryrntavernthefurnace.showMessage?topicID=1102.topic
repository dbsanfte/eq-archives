Heres the Log of what happened in Tells when i asked them why they could not respect the boards and the posts about raiding the planes...<br>
<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:52:31 2001] You told naldar, 'whos your raid leader?'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:52:47 2001] Naldar tells you, 'Skyla she is LD, talk to Dikidoo'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:53:10 2001] You told dikidoo, 'thanks for not resepecting the boards'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:53:32 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'excuse me ?'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:53:55 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'i had a raid planned for 2 weeks for others and you guys just blew right up there  One of your members even posted that they were coming'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:55:52 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'oh, well, number one, i dont know what boards your talking about.... I dont check any boards or pay attention to any boards other than the CH boards. Number two, since when did saryrn become a reserved guild raid server ?  '<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:56:09 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'its called resepect and YOUR members knew abou tit'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:57:42 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'now just wait one minute - dont talk to me about respect,  My guild has been walked over by OOP, GoL, H&amp;E, just for the fact they can mobolize better than we can and beat us to planes or other areas - and the fact is - so be it - thats the w'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:58:13 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'the way it is, '<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:59:02 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'oh so it makes it ok to do it to other guilds?'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:59:10 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'how dare you even accuse me of being disrespectful to another guild - If i saw another guild mobolizing at SRO - we wouldnt even attempted coming up'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 16:59:45 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'appartently one of your members seen the ppl in SRO and said they dont give a F about Saryrn Tavern and you were going up'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:00:44 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'if they said that - thats wrong - but bottom line is - i dont pay attention to Saryrn Tavern Either, it holds no weight on this server- you know that as well as I do'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:01:00 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'you cant reserve a raid'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:03:07 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'and to tell ya the truth, Im completely offende by your accusations of me disrespecting anything - ive done nothing for the past 3 months but volunteer my help to other guilds for pulling there raids, CR, etc, etc'<br>

[Sat Aug 11 17:05:08 2001] Dikidoo tells you, 'dosent matter to me what they think - i dont look at the boards - and if you start a slandering campaign, I will petition a GM for harresment on your part'<br>
Sat Aug 11 17:05:27 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'heh its your own words that i will post'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:05:36 2001] You told Dikidoo, 'have a fine day and enjoy'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:05:41 2001] You have added Dikidoo to your IGNORE list.<br>

<br>
<br>
Now here is i suppose the guild leader/Real raid leader<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:23:41 2001] Skyla tells you, 'if you have a prob with us being here then so be it...you all can be mad if you want for us all not knowing you were even coming and having it on ST means nuthin if  no one even checks commons room....only kinrea even knew about it too late'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:24:50 2001] You told skyla, 'heh ok whatever conversation is over  believe me you have proved yourself as a guild and you cant say no one in your guild knew about this as i had two posts that some of your guild was coming'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:28:15 2001] Skyla tells you, 'i mean no disrespect i even hate when shit like this happens to us....i never go to commons room...if i know about multi i would have came as my rogue and had fun shit i d rather be in kael'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:30:01 2001] You told Skyla, 'well whoever Dikko is screwed alot of CHs rep with me what he said will be posted i am sorry but i am sick of getting blamed for others guilds mistakes  '<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:31:13 2001] Skyla tells you, '&quot;other guilds mistakes&quot;,....whateva you post what you want and be sure as long as its on blast furnace il be there to see it'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:31:59 2001] You told Skyla, 'oh it will be  its gunna be strait from my Log  your member hung himself'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:36:01 2001] You told Skyla, 'you have that right to defend your guild but umm i dont think i will be the first to post this to be honest not only i was affected'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:36:56 2001] Skyla tells you, 'i dont care....if they are posting about a raid that everyone didnt know about i could care less..im only posting about whateva diki said'<br>
[Sat Aug 11 17:38:01 2001] You told Skyla, 'well that the point at least two from your guild knew and apparently when you ported up there were some in SRO stating that someone had a raid planned... this is all hear say so i dont know excatly'<br>
<br>
<br>
After this no more replies no more tells i suppose that CH had a blast in hate when this was something that was well planned.<br>
<br>
Skyla just a word of advice... start reading the Commons room my post was just as it was up there and i posted that a week and a half in advance.<br>
<br>
When Dikidoo brought Up OOP and HnE... ya know what... both times we had a fear raid... before HnE and OoP entered they sent a tell asking if it was ok.. they didnt just barge into a plane and take over... This raid was well planned out... TWO of your members posted that they would be there on this raid... so you cant say that you didnt know about it.<br>
<br>
I really hope that you are satisfied that you ruined alot of peoples night and i once had respect for your guild... Now i only have respect for a certian Few.<br>
<br>
Have fun time for me to take a break and get the hell away from all the greed that goes  in and the guild battles that ppl PRETEND exsist.!<br>

Skyla/Soldaris said that our raid (CH) had been planned for a week, but I didn't know that - only saw it on MOTD last night. I even cut and pasted your post on our website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://ch.gamerznexus.com">ch.gamerznexus.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> LAST NIGHT so others in my guild would know, but where I am not guild leader I couldn't call it off. Then when I logged on this afternoon and saw that we were still planning on going to Hate today, I even went so far as to send a tell to your highest guildmember that was online, a 50+ Iksar in SolB, and told him that CH was planning on going there. That was aproximately 2 1/2 hours before our scheduled 5pm raid, so that was 4 1/2 hours before you planned on being there. So please DO NOT bring me into this, I did everything in my power to stop the conflict in the short period of time that I had. And I'm pretty embarrassed over it. Had I intended on being malicious I sure as hell never would've replied to your original thread. <p><html><body><font face="arial" color=CC0033 size=2><b>Kinrea Keres</b><br>

anyways like i said i didnt know myself till day b4...when i logged on all materials were purchashed by diki and they were already gathering....and after spending 8k on stones and peridots i doubt anyone will turn back when in sro....<br>
<br>
<br>
and dont try to make what diki said about oop/hne into anything more than it is seeing thats what your good at....<br>
he simply ment that we to have had plans that end up crahsed when another guild goes into the plane a hour or even 30 mins b4 us if not sooner...it happens..deal with it...grow the fuck up..(dam this language)....<br>
<br>
anyways to all whos raid was messed up cuz it i do apologize like ive told others that contacted me about it...but aurelle can shove her hate stones up her ass...and no i wont start going to god dam common room you can drop a line on our webpage if you have the least intrest in what we doing...we have bumped heads with DE many times and i jes learned to /tell reiaku and that works fine but if you want to bitch whine and go on about a lost cause than by all means do so...anyways i have a raid to get back to /wave<br>
<br>
(this by no means is mean to disrepect anyone but HER...non of the peeps that were supposed to go on the raid and no SFoL members..)...latez<br>

Always been like that.<br>
<br>
So i think it is kind of silly to start a flame over it.<br>
<br>
It has happened to all on the server and all engage in it, knowing it or unknown.<br>
<br>
The server has no raid schedule and so it is impossible to know who has which plans and then to take all those plan into account on your own raiding roster. The guild that does that would have no raids left to do :-P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usybr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sybr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/12/01 2:33:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> First in force controls the game.  If your not there... you're not raiding the place... If you have 50 people in sro... 0 in hate... its not being 'raided'.  If your not there you cant claim it sad to say.  Thats the way the server and most have molded.  Back in the day when i was in ToE and we regularly raided planes we ran into the same problem.  It became basically a race if you want to raid.<br>
<br>
I recall a particular occasion especially... where 3 guilds were mobilizing for hate... we all knew about it... but we prepped 2-3 groups up fast and zoned in asap... and 'claimed' it so to speak.  And left 50 people from other guilds sitting in the dust with no raid to go to.  Then after rest could mobilize they came in... sometimes its only and best thing you can do.  It can be shitty but with their popularity thats what we have to deal with =/.<br>

And a guildleader at that. Would realize that just becouse you post a raid thats gives you zero rights to it when your planned time comes. The only things that matter are numbers and location. If you do not have the people in place first you got absolutely no claim to the plane or mob or whatever. CH was totally in the right to goto a empty Hate and start raiding it. And should not be catching flack becouse you posted you wanted to do a open raid on said day and time.  <p>Wyrmwood B'Dynn 60 Grave Lord <BR>

We even got one of our Pallys a nice 23dmg 27 dly 1hs .. whatever its called Dark metal something.<br>
  <br>
    but as to the original post... You cant claim a dungeon on a board. There have been MANY times when CH was going to raid something only to see that it was taken. Its no big deal when this happens... You just move on.. see what IS open, and shit you CAN take.<br>
    <br>
     I dont know what your veliosu faction is, but i can almost bet that a place like Kael was open for you to raid. <br>
     There isnt anything wrong when some one else beats you out to a dungeon or spawn... It can be a little frustrating but it happens. <br>
     To be honest i didnt even know about hate today until i logged on lol... it wasnt this thing that was planned out weeks in advance like you make it sound like it was.. Unless Dikidoo and some other officers are tactical super computers that are able to some how calculate who will be on and when.. to plan out raids weeks in advace. That would own, but i really doubt that.<br>
     <br>
       This is what i run through my head when i want to raid something.. and maybe this can help you out..  What man power is avalible? ... What will be open? .. Are we able to do this? .. How much time will this take?..<br>
       A while ago kinrea suggested that we have raids on a set date, but not a set dungeon because that never works. That seems like a decent idea as well. <br>
        My point is that there are always options... And i do not see in anyway how CH was in the wrong here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soldarislamerchant>Soldaris LaMerChant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/12/01 3:31:45 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Nalice_LM/SOLD2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> sorry hoe no had one wipeout and that was at 4am est....umm...and that was on 2nd floor doing it with 3 clerics and 30 peeps...kiss off....<br>

<br>
<br>
I know that a great deal of people knew about hate on Saturday.  I heard it come up in several conversations, and many friends I have in smaller guilds were excited to get the chance to go up to hate.<br>
<br>
I was preparing to leave Kael to go join Aurelle when I got a tell form my brother.<br>
<br>
Niliamann:  DAMMIT!<br>
Me:  ???<br>
Niliamann:  Chaotic Horde went up to hate!!!<br>
Me:  LOL that's gonna piss off alot of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
I sent a tell to Aurelle, and she said they ported up 45 minutes before the open raid was going to.<br>
<br>
<br>
I won't make an argument over whether or not Chaotic Horde had the right to jump ahead to hate.  Of course they did.  First in force as always.  I don't think anyone will deny them that right.<br>
<br>
<br>
What I will argue is that it was a shitty thing to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
If anyone in Chaotic Horde says that the guild was unknowledgable as to the open raid, they're full of shit.  Your own member posted here stating that the matter was discussed.  Additionally, I see a fair number of Chaotic Horde posting here regularly.  To have missed out on seeing the raid post could only come from complete ingorance.  It's been up in the commons section for over a week, at the top of the board usually.  40+ responses.<br>
<br>
And as I stated before, there were several people talking about it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there was a very large number of people in sro ready to attend the raid.  You cannot aruge that it was a case of misscommunication.<br>
<br>
<br>
Organizing open raids takes a shitload of work.  Not exhibiting the decency to respect that time shows bad taste.<br>
<br>
Again, not arguing that Chaotic Horde doesn't have the right to go up.  By all means they did.<br>
<br>
But you just trampled over something that you shouldn't have.<br>
<br>
 |<br>
 |<br>
 |<br>
 |<br>
 |<br>
\|/<br>
<br>
<br>
If it shows up correctly that was a down arrow.  I know that Chaotic Horde shut-down a large-scale raid which had been highly publicized for many people today.  That's where you fell in my eyesight, as well as in the sight of many other people.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I feel that whoever lead the Chaotic Horde raid owes a great deal of people an apology for the lack of judgement shown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And how does anyone die to the corruptor of life? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ufiedlerisking.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiedlerisking</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/12/01 7:23:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yeah</span><hr size=1> Everyone is right.

Why? I run the chaotic horde website myself and even I dont check our own message boards every day.. Sometimes I dont check it for 2-3 days. I checked our message board the day before the raid. I saw that one post kinrea had but I didnt even read the whole thing. I just skimmed threw the post not even noticeing a date or anything because I wasn't interested. So im going to tell you I did know about the raid but I didn't know when it was and I didn't care, I can tell you now that half of Chaotic Horde doesnt even know the address to our own website. So if you say im full of shit so be it.<br>
If anybody is interested there is a huge list of all the things that dropped, who got what and what rotted. You wouldn't belive how many things rotted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udruidkin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>druidkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/12/01 9:51:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> Last time I checked, we play the game. We dont spend it reading message boards for hours on end (atleast most of us.) To think that a simple post, on a message board that half the server doesnt even traffic on a consistent bases, gives your raid validity or a reservation or what not is ridiculous. If you want to reserve something, go call a restaurant. There are enough issues in this game to deal with to have added to it the point you need to skim a message board every so many minutes to make sure so-and-so hasn't made a reservation at Cafe del Hate. <br>
<br>
Fact is you may have been in S Ro, but S Ro isnt Hate. And unless your raiding S Ro, you don't have much of a raid do you. Chaotic Horde mobilized and you didn't, you snooze you lose.  One phrase you should always keep in mind when raiding - First in Force. This isn't a phrase reserved for &quot;uber&quot; guilds. Your no more special than anyone else who claws and scratches for a raid. <br>
<br>
And cut out the entire throwing around of &quot;We're not HnE or OoP or &lt;insert guild&gt;.&quot; You are not excluded from the rules that all servers abide by just because you are not one of the servers &quot;uber&quot; guilds. We fight for our raids just as Chaotic Horde does just as GoL etc do. You are and should be no different, because fact is, your just another guild. So stop spending so much time posting your raid intentions and more time mobilizing to them.<br>

<br>
You can't reserve a plane.  I would have loved to go up with you and was looking forward to joining in late but when I saw it was cancelled I was like 'oh well, maybe next time' and went on a SG run with my guild instead.  <br>
<br>
It's not the end of the world and you have to remember that not everyone reads the boards.  Expecting them to actually monitor these boards, and, on top of that, cancel their own plans isn't reasonable.<br>
<br>
Plan for the worst and hope for the best.  Anytime you schedule a raid ALWAYS have a backup plan in place.  It's also a good idea to let everyone know what the backup plan is ahead of time to minimize confusion if your primary objective is taken already.<br>
<br>
Sorry you didn't get to go to hate but flaming Chaotic Horde is kinda silly and pointless.<br>
