<br>
 You have to be Level 59 to even use any of your Class related skills. Seems rather pointless to me, since by 59 you're most likely bored to tears with the character you're playing, and there's really not a whole lot of game left to play.<br>
Which doesnt' do the nerfboy classes, like Shadowknight, etc, any good, since they take a royal ass screwing all the way through the 50's as is.<br>
<br>
Then VI posts about 'fixing a bug that was allowing players that used to have the exp penalty more adv skill points'<br>
Seems to me like they deserve it.<br>
Take the ShadowKnights and Paladins that labored through 45 back during the hybrid penalty days, all the while screaming that they didn't deserve the penalty, that they weren't wicked enough (or even remotely powerful enough) to warrant an experience penalty, and finally Verant agrees, and removes the penalty. <br>
For the hybrids that did labor past 50 under that penalty (me being one of them), being told that we had been right all along, but no recourse given, was rather shitty.<br>
<br>
With these advanced skills I was hoping the hybrid would have it a little better off, since their two piddly disciplines at 55 and 60 are utterly fucking useless, but now I see that their Archetype skills can't be used until 55 and their Class skills can't be used until 59. <br>
Pointless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ubethene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bethene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 716<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/12/01 11:38:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> level 59 chanter... not bored, and lots of game left to play.

For goodness sake stop bitching about the SK class, it is a very nice class and one of the most fun to play. Hell ask some of the higher level and better SKs on the server, like Wyrmwood, Zarovich (purple troll!) etc. <br>
<br>
And the advancements points are a way for VI to keep 60s in game. A further way to advance your character since you can no longer advance in levels. <p><Center><a href = "mailto:andvari@thewarcouncil.com">Andvari Shadowmist</a><BR>

Bethene, you have no clue what lvl 45 shadow knights had to deal with grouped or solo during the hybrid penalty days. It was a royal pain in the ass beyond belief. I hated it personally.<br>
<br>
And yes, Shadow Knight's suck in the endgame <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe you didn't notice Numnayan's list, one of them being 'Useless Shadowknight'..cause that's exactly what they are.<br>
I'd take a roge/ranger/monk/warrior over a SK any day of the week for dmg ouptut.<br>

I have been lvl 60 longer than garb so more than a year i guess and i still have things i want to do for me and my friends, lvl 60 isnt a dead end its more the start of a new kind of game.<br>
<br>
More than ever now i feel that my character is powerfull, never before in the almost 3 years i played have i enjoyed this much relative power in comparison to other class. The 2 handed dmg calculation fix is a big part of this but also cel heal is incredebly powerfull and now we have a self buff 25% speed with the new expansion as well as a group 600 pts heal. More than ever now we are able to solo and contribute to a raid.<br>
<br>
By the way i leveled all the way to 60 WITH the xp penalty, hell i level almost all the way to 50 back when the penalty for death was double than what it is now and there simply were no lvl 49 cleric to rez your ass when you died. I liked it that way, when things get to you easy you dont appreciate them.<br>
<br>
It is hybrid like you that make us all look bad you complain when there is absolutly no reason to complain. If you are that disatified with the sk class go play something else, you wouldnt be the first player to go thru class change and all the ppl that did it were happier for it.<br>
<br>
And on your main subject, the new skill just kick ass. Running speed, mental clarity, damage avoidance and mitigation, improve natural hp. Hell i really dont know where you think you are justtified in complaining. Personnally i would have made it so only lvl 60 can do skill so i dont think there were out of line to make class skill lvl 59+.<br>
<br>
Your just one of those who want thing easy on a silver plater. You want all your skill now, your epic now, lvl 60 now and with minimal effort. What you are missing it that it is not the destination that matter so much as the journey itself. Enjoy the damm journey and stop bitching allready. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ugallaorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallaorn</A> at: 12/12/01 3:01:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/unandarie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 1166<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/12/01 2:34:54 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mwscomp.com/movies/grail/jpgs/timencha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> If you don't like your class make a new one.<br>

The exp penalty didn't mean that much. I had it myself as a hybrid. If you soloed alot then yes, if you grouped not really.<br>
<br>
I would take a decently equiped SK over a Warrior any day in a normal exp grind group. Why? Because they taunt way better, have similar AC and HPs and are better pullers. Oh and comparing a Warrior to Monk and Rogue for damage output is just silly.<br>
<br>
Anyway, seems to me like you don't really know your class that well if you consider it to be so horrible. I've seen SKs pull and tank ToV mobs (not NToV) just fine.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw before you accuse me of not knowing SKs.. I have a 50 SK myself and haev also had the pleasure of being grouped and guilded with some of he server's best. <p><Center><a href = "mailto:andvari@thewarcouncil.com">Andvari Shadowmist</a><BR>

B: &quot;If you don't like it play something else.&quot; Hey there's some resounding logic. How many years of education did it take for you to come up with that?<br>
<br>
C: Yes the skills are good. I didnt' knock the skills at all, for those of you that obviously can't read. I said that *I felt* that not being able to use them until lvl 59 takes some of their fun and usefulness away.<br>
<br>
D: Some of you need to learn how to interpret what you read before flying off on your tangents.<br>
<br>
C: Yes, 54 is considered part of the 'endgame'. Instead of whining about my complaints and telling me how good hybrids have it, take a look at some people's concerns. Not everyone's concern is damage output, but that has always been my concern when dealing with characters. In the end, damage output is the end all be all of the game.<br>
Shadow Knights, and Paladins, relying solely on Double Attack and weak versions of their parent classes spells, have negligible damage output, UNLESS they are lucky enough to possess some kick ass weapons. Regardless of the fact that a warrior with the same or like weapon could do far more dmg than they could. <br>
<br>
I understand that, at least the majority of those that have posted to this thread, are merely jumping in to start an argument for whatever reason, following the large trend of the vast majority of the posters in the Blast Furnace. <br>
Besides that, the post wasn't a complaint about hybrids being weak, it was a complaint about the skills, and their impact on the game coming a little too late. *Especially* for hybrids.<br>

Next time if you dont wanna discuss how hybrid are weak how about you dont mention in your post okay? You open the door by blasting pally and sk so dont be surprised when we slam it on your finger. <br>
<br>
Hybrid are fine (you were there when they adjust 2h damage right or were you smoking weed again?), level requirement for skill are fine too considering that their main purpose was to allowed lvl 60 char to continue their advancement. VI clearly stated that instead of opening more lvl (which you wouldnt have been able to acess untill you were lvl 60) they decided to go with a skill tree, so of course this skill tree will only be open for the higher lvl.<br>

<br>
Verant has made it painfully clear on numerous occasions that knight classes aren't meant to be damage dealers.  We're the tank hybrid.  We take hits.  If you want a damage dealing hybrid, try a ranger or beastmaster.  <br>
<br>
SKs can tank great as long as they know what they're doing and keep up to date with their gear(just as warrior have to.)<br>
Use a 2h weapon if you want damage dealing, it's the closest you can get to competing with a warrior.<br>
<br>
Honestly, penalty for being a hybrid was removed and I didn't noticed a damn thing.  Why is this game a job to you anyways?  How do you 'labor' through 45?  Call me crazy, but just playing is usually the enjoyable part of the game.  I had the ogre / SK penalty for 45, I didn't bitch about it.  I just exp'ed in Lguk for 3 days and it was done with.  What were you doing wrong that you 'labored' through it?  <br>
<br>
59, skills being useless then?  Hmmm... For someone that's never been 59 all you can do is assume, because you honestly don't know shit about what's useful or what's done at those levels.  Wonder if you think you ding 60 and just quit the game then or something...  Eitherway you're an idiot and an embarassment to Shadow Knights.  Please just sell off your Dark Forge and MoSS, twink a beastmaster, and delete your Shadow Knight.  You won't be missed.  <br>
<br>
2 very whiny SKs in the same week about not being uber enough and claiming to know the game in and out...  Next thing you know Wyrmwood or Vendric are gonna come in here complaining about they should be 60 in full Malevolent because they pay their $10 a month...  Wait, damn it, they worked and got that stuff already.  Damned SKs.<br>
<br>
(oh, Zarovich is an OGRE!!! WE'RE NOT TROLLS!  ARRGGHH!)<br>

<br>
Once again I have to say I don't agree with most of your posts in this thread.<br>
<br>
To begin with, just because we voice our disapproval on how things are working, doesn't mean that we don't still like the class we chose.  If it wasn't for us speaking up, your sorry ass would still be getting the XP penalty and there would be no 2h bonus increase.<br>
<br>
Secondly, just because Verant gives us new spells or abilities, doesn't mean I have to be grateful for them.  For the Paladins especially on the SoL release, we got royally screwed.<br>
<br>
- A new HP buff at level 39 that does the same damn thing as our level 52 HP buff and costs less mana and doesn't stack.<br>
<br>
- A new silence spell that got nerfed into a useless Mana Sieve with a horrible mana ratio.  Drains 100 mana at a cost of 75 mana with an 18 second recast time.  For those that can't comprehend how useless this is, I stood in Mistmore and drained my mana and couldn't run a Drow outta mana.<br>
<br>
- A new stun spell that is Higher in level, costs more mana, stuns for less duration, has a longer recast time and does less damage than our old Stun spells.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
- An upgraded self only regeneration spell that has a worse mana to hp ratio than our Celestial Cleansing spell.<br>
<br>
Granted, they gave us some other nice ones, Cease (Desist is kinda of redundant), Undead proc buff, and self only haste.  That doesn't mean I don't have to be mad that they screwed up the other 4 spells.<br>

<br>
Again i'm defeated by your astounding powers of logical argument.<br>
<br>
Yes, I have a 54 Shadow Knight, yes I am able to play him, very well imho. That aside, Hareq has the most valid point that the 'flamers' don't seem to get.<br>
If people hadn't complained about the xp penalty, it would still be enforced. And the 2h dmg bonus, even though, at 54 my sk is still hitting for the same amount with a 33 dmg sword that he was hitting for six months ago.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think the skills suck, whichever moron repeated my title for me, because their use is *restricted* to 59 and above for the classes. Again, I thank you for taking the time to read the posts before revealing your lack of general interpetation and intelligence.<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter how often you non hybrid playing classes spout about how good the hybrids have it, the simple fact is that they don't have it all that good. The spells aren't bad, for the most part. I feel that their combat ability in the 50+ game is sorely lacking.<br>
<br>
Again, I say that the skill use being restricted to 59+ for Class specific skills is too little too late. That goes for all classes, not just hybrids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 744<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/12/01 9:51:56 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/geek/melanierooster/edbox.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the simple fact is that they(hybrids) don't have it all that good.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I guess that's a matter of opinion.  I think sometimes that I have it too good compared to classes like warriors rogues and clerics, probably what you see as having it good.<br>
<br>
-My class is interesting to play, unlike the mind numbing I go through when playing a cleric up to L50<br>
-I can travel with ease.  Our spells give us the ability to invis from all but summoned creatures, how often do you come across them(or high enough level to worry for that matter) anyways?  Also if we do f*** up, we can feign death.  Bobbing corpse gives levi and EB too, making travel incredibly easy.<br>
-We can summon corpses, invis, have HP, and FD, which makes us great for CRs, behind monks/rogues.  Specially if the SK has a CoS<br>
-Taps, debuffs, puller, CR, snare, scout, tank, stuns, or 2h dmg dealing... We're extremely versatile and can fill a ton of roles and do a million jobs in groups.<br>
-We look bad ass<br>
-We can solo blues in open area's, ESPECIALLY undead(Burning woods and the grey make for wonderful exp at 54).<br>
-Farm is easy for us(not easiest, but still a lot easier than rogues warriors clerics etc).  I solo'd the Frenzied Ghoul with all that section of Lguk popped and I'm only 54.<br>
<br>
Think the only things SKs cant do are SoW, port, rez and quad kite...<br>
<br>
Oh, stop saying you lifed the exp penalty you saved our lives blah blah blah.  Hybrids were able to ding 60 when it was there in the same time other classes were, so obviously it wasn't that bad of a pain.  As for the 2h issue, well... You said it yourself, it did shit for a difference.  Please fucking shut up already.<br>
