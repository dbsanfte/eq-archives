And Knee as I said in my post I could care less if I was on your list or not.

You are one Bitter person. I'm feel sorry for someone that holds that much bitterness inside themselves. I hope to god that noone holds a grudge against you for anything you have done &quot;wrong&quot; in the past.

<br>
The watched me die thing goes like this... <br>
<br>
Player X.(ME) finds out that AM room isn't camped, player X moves his group to the AM room. The AM is up. Another group player Y( the person in question) moves his group to the AM room also, at about the same time.<br>
<br>
Now since this is a contested spawn only because one group just showed up about 2 mins before the other one. Both groups seem to claim the spawn. This is OK.. This happens alot and typicaly both groups just work it out after the mob is dead. <br>
<br>
Well player X's group had 2LD's and the cleric gets waxed early. The fight with the AM has already begun and the 2 remaining people in the group, are fighting to stay alive. <br>
<br>
Now Player Y's group shows up and dicides they want the AM, but it is already ingaged with Player X. <br>
<br>
Well ... Do you help kill the mob and risk the possibly that Player X will not share and give Player Y a roll?? <br>
<br>
No.. you simply type neat little things like... &quot; Just die&quot; or &quot;bye bye&quot; .. the entire time player X is sitting there YELLING AT THEM for some sort of heal to stay alive and didn't recieve it. <br>
(true story)<br>
<br>
Thats my defenition of Watched me die. The only problem is, who is guilty of this? The entire group? Just the healer? Or just the very clever person that typed the message &quot;bye bye&quot;?.. I say Ever single one of them.<br>
<br>
I understand if your LD or Not paying attention.. but if you walk over to someones camp and sit down.. and WATCH ME DIE. thats a bit repulsive..... I am a very forgiving person but some stuff needs to be remebered. <p>Main, Kneesnapa Zek 54 Ogre Warrior of the Order of the Phoenix<BR>Hydra, Jeckle Darkhealer 54 Darkelf Cleric of the Celestial Councel<BR>Hydra, Pecito Snackling 45 druid of the Celestial Councel</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukaizerevolaruali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaizer Evolaruali</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(2/5/01 1:37:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/davidiannucci/Graphics/morbidshot.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The List</span><hr size=1> Last I heard Shyness = Annabele = same ksing bitch.   <p>Kaizer Evolaruali<BR>

Your going to make me crazy Fantasy... I come in contact with so many people every day there is no possible way with my small brain that I could remeber every single absure name i come across.. I mean for gods sake .. I didn't remeber my GF's last name for the first 8 months I dated her. I still don't know her address and we have been dating for 4 years. My memory SUX... <br>

There is a huge diffrence in making a mistake and Intentionaly doing harmful acts toward your fellow players. <br>
<br>
If you do things harm other people in RL and then tell the judge... &quot;Whupsee... I didn't know that was bad, it was just a mistake&quot; Do you honestly think that will get you off the hook?<br>
<br>
 The people on my list had NO remorse whatso ever after they did the things I accused them of doing, and fully knew what was going on. This was NO mistake. This was a harmful act that the knew there would be No repercutions from.... <br>

<br>
First of all anyone who keeps a list of all the players who supposedly done some form of &quot;wrong doing&quot; from day one has some serious social issues. Big fucking deal if someone KSed your dervish cutthroat or trained you a skeleton on you. WAAA WAAA WAAA.... cry me a fucking river. WAAA WAAA WAAA you inpsected me nows you petitioned. You still hate the kid who pushed you off the monkey bars in elementary school, the guy at McDonald's who forgot to supersize your order when you payed for it or the person who beat you to the parking spot in Wal-mart parking lot? I bet you got a list for them also. You have to be one of those kids in school who use to ride the yellow short bus licking the windows.<br>
<br>
I'm soooo sorry BR totally runied your whole EQ gaming experience forever. Well I have some good news for you. All the ex BR members have been Ebaying items to make money in order to help pay for your conseling. You sound like one of those typical you stole my moss snake and now I'm going to shoot up my school. I know BR really hurted you. Here is a /hug. <br>
<br>
What a fucking pussy you are Knee. The sad part there are members in OOP who has you on ignore. Take a look in the mirror sometimes before you judge others. Obviously you did not play on Veeshan and dealt with FoH. Then you would at least have something really to /bitch, /cry, /whine about. Deal with a guild after 3 hours when the servers went up Naggy and Vox was dead and they were just breaking Fear. So what that leaves the other 8 billion guild on Veeshan to do? Not a fucking thing to do. Oh yeah we can do the Ghoul Lord in L Guk to get some phat yaks.<br>
<br>
You still have some resentment about BR even though we broke up. Can you say some serious issues? Mmmmmmmmmmmkay.... Heh in a way I'm kinda flattered honestly. Just because OOP was rude to me or stole my fire beetle am I going to hate all OOP? Nope. I don't dislike OOP in any manner but yes I dislike certain members. That goes with any guild. I recall a while back you made a post stating how you changed your views blah blah blah. Just blowing hot air as usual. Same shit but different toilet if you ask me.<br>
<br>
One more thing... By me leaving OOP makes me a guild hopper? Here is a little FYI... *get closer please* Your &quot;one&quot; of the few reasons why I left OOP. Last time I checked I still had a TWC tag over my head. Now add me to your fucking list and not just under BR in general.<br>

Thats between you and the guild. All I know is, one day your in.. and its the greatest place in the world and the next your giving us some crap about how you're not ready for a full time guild and you miss your friends... WAHhhh WAHHH .... Sound familar? CALL ME A WHINNER??  Your one to talk.. <br>
<br>
You know what, I think you left when you found out no one actualy liked you and you where never going to get any PHAT LOOTZ.<br>
<br>
The only time I have grouped with you is when we camped the guardian together.. A CSS droped and you instantly thought it was yours, when we both needed it. I won the roll and you got all pissy and left... I offed you my old off hand weopon(FOR FREE) because it was better than what you currently had. Nonoonon..You wouldn't take it... you had to have the UBER GEAR. After crying about it to anyone that listened(yes I heard about it) few days later you de-guiled. So even after lossing the ROll you still whinned about not getting the PHAT LOOTZ.<br>
<br>
I'm fully aware that some people in my guild don't like me, I found that out with what happened with my Hate legs.<br>
<br>
 All I can say is..it isn't a popularity contest. &quot;Well damn I don't like my grandpa... but I still stick up for him, because he is family&quot;. In our guild we are all famialy and we all make sacrafices for eachother, but occationaly we make bad calls and Invite loot whore, whinny little b!chtes like yourself on accident. But they soon find out that the pickings are rather slim and BUGGER OFF much the same way YOU DID. <br>
<br>
*waves* DON&quot;T LET THE DOOR HIT YA IN THE ASS ON THE WAY OUT!!&quot; <br>

WTF is wrong with your abiltiy to READ .. I know I don't spell too good.. but HONESTLY STOP WITH THE BRINGING UP BR EVERY 50 FRIGGEN SECONDS!!!

Quit your whining and STFU.  If you don't like what this post says, then whaaaaaa.  Tell mommy you need a new bottle whaaaaaaa.  If you don't like what you see on this list, THEN DON'T READ IT!!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's that simple.  <br>
<br>
No one asked for your simple-minded, past-dwelling, retarded-ass opinion.  If you don't like it, find the closest shi**y toilet and dunk your head in it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   All I've seen from you in these posts is garbage.  Most times you have no other point except to try and slam someone because they don't share the same opinion you do.  Big deal, I bet most of the people on this board don't share the same opinions you do.  This was something that Knee posted because other people asked him to, not because he wanted to be a dick and say &quot;haha, no rez for you and you aaaaand you.&quot;  If he keeps a list of people that piss him off...SO WHAT!  What does it matter to you.  I'm sure you've got a whole database dedicated to such a thing.  Big deal if you're on it.  Really, if you didn't like Knee in the first place, then why would you want to ask him to rez you anyway?  Youre obviously trying to pick a fight because you have nothing better to do.  Come on, admit it...yeah, I knew it.<br>
<br>
By the way, Knee didn't have issues with the whole guild, just a couple of people in the guild.  Does a few bad apples ruin a barrell?  Probably not, but you will think twice before biting into one, am I right?  <br>
<br>
So, if anyone is a pu**y around here, it's you dude.  Crying about spilled milk that happened SOOOO far back, most people (except BR members), forgot that BR even existed.  You need to get a life and quit worrying about what other people think about you.  If anyone has serious issues, I would say it's you, clown.<br>

Talk about bitching and moaning.  <br>
<br>
YES its alright to hate people<br>
YES its alright to remember people that treat you horrid<br>
YES its alright to make a list of people that deserve nothing more than what they gave you<br>
and YES its alright to bitch...<br>
but keep in mind your just gonna sound ignorant when you think it's that unheard of to remember who screwed you over.<br>

Btw knee you are entitled to think whatever you like about anyone, but posting this list was a misstake imo.<br>

Its basicaly trying to get others to &quot;hate&quot; the same people for reasons you hardly remember yourself.<br>

Anyways...<br>

Zandrama, knee. I will be in San Jose on the 24th, but i think we are going to Santa Clara immediately after arriving to my Uncle's place there.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can all schedule a day where we can all get together and hang out and talk about eq(NOT) or maybe actually get to know the people behind the keyboard.<br>
<br>
I will be on contact with you both about it..and perhaps Spyryt, i know his gimp ass lives nearby too =P <p><b>

Wong-- 1st time I meet you, You corpse camped me in the CA &amp;BR war. Not only where a huge bumm nugget to me and my buddys but we asked you to stop.. and you continiued ..saying every manor of obcentities you could think of. Even after the entire battle was over you kept on YAPPING, and taking cheap shots. That was the major one.. <br>
<br>
There where other smaller things that I saw and heard about you doing. Things that where totaly unacceptable. Not only that, but your other char MattFoley... pissed me off on more than one occation also. Every Dire and evil thing that happened on saryrn some how had your name mixed in with it or thats just the impression I got. If you wern't mixed into some kind of Item duping or Hacking scandal... you name always seemed to appear.<br>
<br>
I took your name off because you did something very nice to a group of lower lvl people with out them asking. You went out of your way to show kindness toward them and that racks up big points with me. Call me retarded if you will, but stupid junk like that makes me feel good.<br>
<br>
And btw ... my post said.. &quot;It took alot of white out to remove your name&quot; not &quot;there is not enuff of white out in the world to remove you from the list&quot;<br>
<br>
And I don't &quot;Hate/Hated&quot; you ... I mean ... darth vader was even a cool guy, when he wasn't choking people every 20 mins. .... you can't change the fact that your Thewong, anymore than Darth Vador can change the fact that he is the dark lord. <br>
