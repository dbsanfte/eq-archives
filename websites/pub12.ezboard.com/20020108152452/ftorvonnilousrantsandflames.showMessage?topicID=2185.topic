<br>
<br>
Look folks, this isn't that hard.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Step 1: People</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
To kill big things like dragons, you need people. Not only do you need people, but you need the right kind of people - specifically those who play raid-friendly classes and are level 48-52. (Raid-friendly classes are warriors, monks, rogues, bards, clerics, wizards.) You also need a buff team - if you can get level 60s great, if not, don't sweat it. On your buff team you'll want 2 clerics, a shaman, an enchanter, a magician, and someone to cast junk (i.e. a druid or a ranger).<br>
<br>
These people need 3 things:<br>
1) A set of resistance gear that can push Magic Resistance (MR) and Fire Resistance (FR) to at least 75 unbuffed, regardless of how far this drops AC, INT, WIS, or any other stat that is normally important. Appendix A lists items that provide both of the needed resistances. See Appendix B for magic resistance and Appendix C for fire resistance.<br>
2) The ability to comprehend and follow instructions. The most twinked uber character, if unable to follow instructions and work as part of a team, is useless. Take instead a first-timer who is scared enough to pay attention, if you can.<br>
3) Confidence. Believing you can win is an important element needed to execute properly. If you think you're a loser, chances are you will be.<br>
<br>
So the first part of Step 1 is knowing what you want. Aim for 36 people in the fight, with at least half of those being the core classes listed above. Get the best buffers that you can.<br>
<br>
How do I find these people, you may ask? Well there are several tools at your disposal. First, ask in your guildchat to see who is interested and what characters they can provide. Next, check your friends list. Third, post on the boards here to get names of people interested. If you need to scrape up a few extras around raid time, you can always resort to /who all 48 52 &lt;class&gt; or something along those lines. Try not to shout for extras in Sol B or Lavastorm as this tends to undermine the confidence of your raiding party.<br>
<br>
Finding buffers should not be difficult. Run down the list of guilds who want Ragefires and ask for specific contributions (i.e., 'I need a high level enchanter for some good haste for my Naggy raid, can you send somebody?'). Don't bother people in raid zones, but anyone else is fair game. Even in the worst case situation, you can do just fine buffing with the folks you have already on the raid - it's not ideal, but will work - after all, we killed Naggy plenty even when the level cap was 50 and the best weapon available was a SSoY (8/24 procs ykesha, FYI for you spoiled post-Kunark EQers). Primals are great, ask Dagga to lend you his. (Professionals only - do not try this at home!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Step 2: Getting there</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Well, great! You've passed the first hurdle and raised an army to slay this dragon. Send out your druids and wizards to bring your army together at the druid ring in Lavastorm. Kiss the hindquarters of your CotHer should you be fortunate enough to have one along.<br>
<br>
Once assembled, or mostly assembled, it's time to make the march to the lair. Have everybody zone into Sol B (a few at a time so you don't crash the zone). Pair experienced people with the clueless so you don't lose too many folks on the difficult trek through the zone. Feel free to kill anything in your path... others may be hunting there, but you're going to slay a dragon, so they'll just have to deal with it while you pass through. Their convenience is not worth wasting the time of the 40ish people who are going to say hi to Nags. From the lavastorm entrance, it's through the center tunnel, make a left, go past the rock coming down from the ceiling, and make a right. This takes you to the place affectionately known as 'bat 1'. Go left out of this room. The next room is 'bat 2', and again you take the left exit. At the fork, head right and continue down the hall, killing any spiders you see, until you reach the edge of the lava.<br>
<br>
At this point it's wise to take some folks who know which way is up to wipe out the first set of fire giants, lest you lose a noob in the excitement. (Then again, if you have too many people, you might just want to decide to leave behind anyone dumb enough to get killed in the next room, so it can serve as a weeding-out process.) Screw levitation, just swim through the lava and place yourself on the ledge. Have your puller start grabbing giants and slaughter them. If you can't figure out how to kill the giants safely, cancel your account and learn golf.<br>
<br>

<br>
Finally you have reached the lair. Don't forget to pull the giants out of the lair (hint: send a monk) before you set up for the final battle. You now have about 8 hours before respawn, but probably a good deal less before everyone falls asleep, so don't waste time.<br>
<br>
First thing to do is make groups. Make melee groups starting with bards and clerics, then add your warriors, monks, and rogues to those groups. Group the highest levels together - being equalitarian doesn't help your chances, so make the strongest groups you can then group up the weaker characters afterwards. If someone's feelings are hurt that you group them among the weaker characters, well that's just too damn bad, you're a raid leader not a social worker. While you are making groups, issue the order to don resistance gear. My melee groups look like this: bard cleric &lt;melee&gt;&lt;melee&gt;&lt;melee&gt;&lt;melee or alt healer&gt;. Bards are great but don't put more than one in a group. More than 1 cleric in a heavy melee group is OK if you have plenty of clerics (unlikely, as Naggy doesn't drop much cleric loot, and most clerics don't give a sh|t about Naggy until they're closing in on Ragefire). Try to have all melee with a cleric if possible, or with 2 druids/shamans.<br>
<br>
Once groups are made, it's buff time. This can be the most confusing and complex part of the process for beginners, so remind people to follow instructions closely and be patient. You will set up a buff line and call the groups one by one. Each person is to start at the beginning of the line and receive their buffs in the order designated. Once a person is fully buffed they are to camp out to a chat room - the first person whose buffs are complete is to make the room! Call it Nagafen-Torv for simplicity.<br>
<br>
The basic idea behind buffing for Naggy is to expect him to dispel you. Naggy dispels 3 buffs each time he releases his AE, so you don't want the good ones at the top. You set up the buffing order based on this concept.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Buffing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
First, you have the dispeller - his role is to make sure each person who presents himself for buffing starts out with an empty buff list. Remind people that they will die a horrible and premature death if they do not get properly buffed.<br>
<br>
Next is one or more junk-buffers. 3-5 junk buffs per person is fine. Good junk buffs are see invisible, DMF, resist cold/poison/disease.<br>
<br>
After the junk buffs come shaman buffs. People can choose their own as they wish but no more than 3 per person. STA is the best choice, DEX is also good, and STR and AGI can be OK.<br>
<br>
Next will be cleric #1, who will cast the best Symbol available (but not Aegolism!).<br>
<br>
After that, the enchanter(s) will cast INT/WIS buffs if neccessary and either haste or clarity as appropriate.<br>
<br>
Then, cleric #2 casts Heroism, then an AC buff. Ideally you'll want the best AC buff available, but in the interests of time Armor of Faith is often the best overall choice. Incidentally, if you do choose AoF, a paladin can sit in as buffer for AC.<br>
<br>
Next in the list is resistances - order doesn't really matter, but you'll want fire and magic. If you have a spare 54+ druid around for Circle of Winter, and a spare 49+ enchanter for Group Resist Magic, those are best; if not, any resist magic and fire will do.<br>
<br>
Finally, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> as the person is camping out</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the mage should cast his longest-lasting damage shield on the player.<br>
<br>
Each character should submit to this process until all players have been buffed and sent to chat.<br>
<br>

Log out to the chat room yourself and clear your virtual throat to issue the final instructions and answer any last-minute questions. Keep confusion to a minimum. Make each group leader responsible for knowing who is in their group, and for assembling their group as quickly as possible once the call to log in is made. Clean up the clumps of hair around your keyboard, and after a stiff drink or five, give the call to log in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Step 4: The Battle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Who knew you'd reach the final battle? As a raid leader, chances are pretty good you've committed suicide already, but on the off chance that you still live you'll now be ready to face the dragon.<br>
<br>
While people are logging in, have the groups assemble. Don't wait more than 5 minutes total from the call to log in until you are ready... if someone goes LD or doesn't make it back in, that's just too bad for them. Once enough people are there to make it happen, get it going. Everyone on the stairs, melee in front, casters in back.<br>
<br>
The first group you send in should be the heaviest melee group. Their job is to eat the first AE and get the dragon's attention. Give them 5 seconds then send in the rest of the melee, and pets. When he's down to half life, send in the casters to nuke, nuke, nuke till he's dead. If you haven't made too many mistakes up to this point, the battle itself will be pretty quick - if it's not over in the first 60 seconds, you'll probably lose.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Roles</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Warrior: Deal damage, take hits. Pretty simple.<br>
Monk: Deal damage, take hits only if you must.<br>
Rogue: Backstab, try not to get hit<br>
Ranger: Deal damage, don't pretend to be a tank unless all the real ones are dead.<br>
SK: Just like warrior, and don't forget to unleash a HT so you can get resisted.<br>
Paladin: You're a HEALER first and foremost. Your melee sucks, get used to it. Play the tank when you're out of LoH and mana.<br>
Bard: Resist songs. Don't worry about anything else, just play.<br>
Cleric: Don't let your tanks or bard die while you have mana left. Use /assist on Naggy and heal whoever he is attacking - these overlapping heals can keep people alive a long time if done right.<br>
Shaman: You're a healer for the most part... you can try to stick in a malo after tash, but you can count on having your slows resisted.<br>
Druid: Heal heal heal... you can also cast Ice when the nukes are called, if you still have mana<br>
Wizard: Stay out of combat until nukes are called then ice comet your heart out<br>
Magician: Fire pets, mmm mmm good... damage shields also good, don't bother with nukes<br>
Necromancer: Pets, heals, taps... maybe some mana feed to healers or nukers as you deem appropriate<br>
Enchanter: Pet tash and rune, nothing else you can do<br>

u can try to stick .. hmm Malo is unresistable ...so after tash, before or maybe after a cup of tea there is no difference ...<br>
<br>
well anyways Malo is lvl 60 spell so not a problem for a shaman in a naggy raid<br>

I really believe that one thing is an absolute:<br>
HEAL NOBODY BESIDES MA, SA, third Assist and 4th Assist.<br>
Nobody else get s a heal.<br>
Get your druids and shammies spam healing their designated tank non stop. You clerics ahould be CHealing those 4 tanks (assign them each a tank to watch, redundancy would help).<br>
<br>
I was actually on one naggy raid at level 48 where I got a cheal. Why? Let me die. Let the non main taunts die. Keep the main tanks alive and you WILL win. (that raid failed btw). <p>~Avezes Oscuridad
