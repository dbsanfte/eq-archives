<br>
1. I am a cleric with the coveted 90% xp rezz spell.<br>
<br>
2. I NEVER go anon because I personally find it annoying, not gonna go into it, but let's just say I'm one of those people who will never go anon out of the principal of the thing...<br>
<br>
3. I NEVER have and NEVER WILL take any money/items in exchange for rezzes. No, I have not become one cp richer from rezzing, even though I've had alot of people try to donate 100s of plat or some nice items after having rezzed them. I simply do not believe in rezzing people for material profit.<br>
<br>
I'll gladly rezz anybody that asks IF I am not &quot;busy.&quot; Busy could mean that I am: grouped at the time, powerleveling a friend, pharming a camp, in a hurry to meet somebody somewhere, etc. Busy means that I'm either doing something that is taking up my mana/time, or requires me to be/stay at a certain location. When I am &quot;busy,&quot; you simply will not be able to get a rezz from me. <br>
<br>
If I just logged on, about to log off, just hanging out, waiting for a group, or travelling somewhere and not rushed, I will most likely rezz you.<br>
<br>
I don't mind if you ask me for a rezz, but if I say no, then I mean no, and it ain't gonna happen. What is starting to really get on my nerves are the people out there that just will not accept no for an answer. Some people will ask repeatedly even after I have answered them, start cussing at me, insulting me, or even try to put a guilt trip on me. Why? I don't owe them anything. The way I see it, if a player is willing to give up some of their time and mana to rezz you, then great, but if they won't, so be it, it is not to be assumed... your time isn't anymore important than my time.<br>
<br>
Some people just cannot understand how a cleric could &quot;be so cold&quot; as to not rezz somebody that died. One time, I was power leveling my wife's character in the Dreadlands. A guy was standing right next to me with his corpse and the corpse of a friend. He politely asked if I could rezz him and his friend. I replied I was sorry, but all my mana was needed at the time for power leveling. He then proceeded to get an attitude, and started saying sarcastic things like &quot;I'm glad to see people are willing to help people&quot; and some other trash. Now this may sound rude, not able to stop power leveling for a few minutes to rezz some guy and his friend (who was bound far away btw), but the truth of the matter is, simultaneously while he was asking for rezzes, i was recieving tells from 2 others in the zone that also needed rezzes. Why should I rezz this guy and his friend, but not the others asking for rezzes, too? And if I rezz the other people as well, when could I stop rezzing people and start doing my own thing? NEVER.<br>
<br>
My point is this, if I rezz everybody that asks, I will never get around to power leveling my wife's character, never get to join a group, never get where I'm headed, etc etc etc. Clerics HAVE to draw the line somewhere or else we'd never get to really play, once we reached 49 we'd be continually rezzing people. If a cleric refuses to rezz you, there is no need to take it personally. Now every once in awhile I'll set aside some time just to do rezzes or help people out, or whatever, but there is no way I'm gonna do that every second that I'm logged in. If you feel that clerics should rezz everybody that asks, feel free to make a cleric character and do just that. People may think I'm being selfish for not rezzing somebody cuz I'm holding a camp or power leveling a friend, but I cannot rezz everybody all the time. I don't have a rezz stick, an even with my 200 wis and mana items, 90% xp rezz still costs almost 40% mana a pop, which is ALOT of mana/medding time.<br>
<br>
If you ask a cleric for a rezz and they say no, please do NOT:<br>
<br>
1. go on and on about how you really need this rezz, everybody else &quot;really needs a rezz,&quot; too.<br>
<br>
2. play a guilt trip talking about how far away you are bound. IMHO, if you aren't thoughtful enough to get a bind on the same continent before going into some dungeon, then you probably could use the walking lesson, and yes, I've played a melee class before, and no, I never went to a dungeon without first remembering to get a bind, and yes I know that getting a bind can be very difficult at times, you're melee, that is just part of the job description. Casters really have nobody but themselves to blame (after they get bind of course) if they die far from their bind spot. <br>
<br>
3. get rude/curse/annoy/spam/insult the cleric. Nothing is owed to you. Rezzes are a priviledge, not a right. The first ammendment doesn't guarantee you the right to a rezz, it guarantees the cleric's right to say no.<br>
<br>
4. lay on a guilt trip about how you were in a penalty level and/or lost a level, you gained the xp/level before, so we know you can do it again...<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I think this sums up my little rant, just wanted to reiterate something:<br>
<br>
no = no<br>
<br>
This may sound harsh to some, and you may think I'm a real jerk after reading this post, but I am fed up with people harassing me because I choose not to drop everything I'm doing so I can do a rezz everytime I'm asked for one.<br>

Well... I understand that the dead players were upset: you don't have to rez someone but if the corpses are in front of you and you are only pling a char, it's pretty obvious for me.<br>
<br>
You asked for others' opinion: That's just mine and I won't judge your choice: I would have rezzed the two corpses in front of me directly in this specific case.<br>

I also power level character alts of mine and friends.  If someone asked me to rez them...and they are right in front of me.  I would certainly do that.  It would cost me a few mins medding on each of the rezzes and save them hours of getting back to their bodies and gaining the exp back.  I do understand that you cannot go around zone to zone helping everyone that asks.  But, wow....right in front of you?<br>
<br>
     The power leveled person has to wait for you to re-med.  If this is your concern....they can practice their skills that they aren't going to have maxed since they are a Power leveled Character.  They would have to do this anyway, since there is no way you can max all the skills out on a plvld player until you have down time.<br>
<br>
    The exp you are helping that alt get with the power level is zipping up.   a few mins of your time to re-med the 2 bubs of blue used,  (even on the two, that maybe is 6 mins total)  isn't going to make that much difference to the person you are power leveling. <br>
<br>
     You will feel better to just take the time on the corpse someone dragged to you, than having to rant on about how they wouldn't take no for an answer.  They came to you in the hopes of saving hours of time.  Of course they would be upset.  <br>
<br>
    When I say no to someone too far and I am busy, that is where I agree with you.  I get the tells trying to guilt me into it.  I feel sorry for them, but I am not the only Cleric and or Druid on that can help so I try and let them know that.<br>

I would bet a few clerics might even support this.  While I NEVER expect a res, I appreciate it.  I can PL a character (I only PL my own) and still spare some mana.  I ask for a res from nearby non anon clerics when catastrophe strikes and I don't already have one in group that can help me.  If they tell me no, so be it.  If you told me no, so be it, even if I was standing next to you with the corpse.  The thing is, I bet your wifes char needs a little down time here and there, PL or not.  I bet it wouldn't hurt you to spend an extra 5-10 mins to med a little more.  Now, needing to do that 4 times, yeah that can be asking a bit much but you are PLing a char...  Claiming if you did all the res's you are asked that you would never get to do anything you wanted, possibly true.  If it were me, though, I would have res'd both those at me and told the other 2 that IF they got their corpses to me I would res them also but they would have to be patient as I was busy doing something else as well.  I don't expect that from others, in fact because of many incidents I don't expect it from many on this server.  This is simply my way of thinking.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself this, and before you bust out a_flamethrower_00 on me remember this is a simple comparison.  I know that the 2 are of far different magnitudes.  I am PLing one of my characters.  You walk up and say, Hey Liam, can I get a SoW?  I reply &quot;Nope, sorry, need all my mana to PL a_ficitious_char_00, can't help you&quot;.  Would you be hot?  Oh, heck yeah!  Sure, a res may be 800 mana vs my meager 40 for a sow, but so what?  It's the same arguement.  Time is a valuable commodity in EQ, but helping those in need is also.  Had you denied me a res in the same situation, I would have been very disappointed in you, simple as that.  You are welcome to your feelings and opinion to how you take that.  If you had offered but given some stipulation as to you have to wait a few til I have spare mana, I would have totally understood and been really pleased.  Had you been in a group and busy, I would have understood completely, but your reason of PLing a char just doesn't seem good enough to deny helping another.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion...  Take if for what it's worth. <p><img src =http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/92/1874792.jpg><br>

<br>
Sorry, even if you pull corpses to the cleric you shouldn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EXPECT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that a cleric must rez you.  Personally, I don't care what the reason is....they are powerleveling a friend, they don't like Iksar, I said &quot;plz&quot; instead of &quot;please&quot; (which I never do, but anyway), they don't have the spell memed, they just don't feel like it....whatever.  No one OWES you anything.  You and they are here to game....to play in your free time....<br>
<br>
Now, if I were the cleric, I probably would have done it assuming that the person didn't say, &quot;res plz&quot;, but I still respect the right of the cleric to say &quot;no&quot; and have that be the end of it.<br>
<br>
BTW, I have never played a resing class.<br>

I was in Lake rathe, starting my epic, my group got wiped out (all except me) and I was running around the lake, trying to gather the corpses before my enduring breath gave out.<br>
<br>
Some dude sent me a tell telling me he'd pay 50pp for a rez.  I said, &quot;No, sorry, I'm in the middle of a corpse run, my party got wiped out.  He said, &quot;But I'll give you 50pp.&quot;  I said, &quot;I'm really busy, I can't help you right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
He kept sending me tells, not being able to understand that I was too busy to help him.  I placed him on ignore.  He had his buddy start sending me tells.  I put the buddy on ignore.  He then had a guild mate send me a tell.  I told the guild mate what was going on, and he said, oh, ok, and left me alone.<br>
<br>
I to have never been anon or roleplay, but I was tempted that day.

<br>
If you are refering to Sira's post, there was nothing about smearing anyone's rep.  Her point was that if you can't take a moment to help someone else in the game even if it causes you a few minutes of inconvenience, then don't get all shocked when you need help someday and that person doesn't help you.<br>
<br>
In principle, it's no different form a cleric's &quot;no rez&quot; list.<br>
<br>
The fact is Sira and I have been partners for quite a while and she has seen me many times go out of my way and sometimes break our camp because someone needed a res.  Someone I didn't know.  And I have *never* taken money for a res.  Anytime it was forced on me, I distributed it to someone else in thier group or gave the money to some lucky n00b.<br>
<br>
As a cleric, I personallly find the idea of not ressing someone that has brought thier corpse to you and are willing to wait to be pretty offensive.  But then I consider myself to be a good cleric.<br>

That because I don't rez everbody that asks it, that I will no longer have friends cuz of all the bad karma built up, or whatever...<br>
<br>
FYI:<br>
<br>
I go out of my way all the time to rezz people *for free*, even when they try to insist on paying me  or whatever. I could go on about the times I grabbed a port to Velious and travelled 3 zones to rezz somebody I never heard of before in my life that sent me a random tell, or all the times I was running somewhere, just happened to see a corpse, do a /who to see if they are online, and rezz them if they were. Perhaps you would like more examples, I dunno, but yes, I think my karma is just fine. If people hate my gutts cuz I didn't rezz them just because they died, then fine, they're the kind of person I probably wouldn't want to mess with anyway.<br>
<br>
People seem to think that as long as the corpses are in the same zone, there shouldn't be a question if you should rezz them or not. Lemme give you a few examples.<br>
<br>
I was in LGuk one day, I had just logged on to power level my wife's character. I really don't care to hear all the BS about power leveling because we normally play together, except one of our computers had been in the shop for about 3 months (seriously, long story) so my character was *alot* higher than hers, so now that we just got it  back, I am taking a break from leveling to get hers caught up so we can play together, so sue me. As soon as I log into LGuk, I get a tell asking for a rezz. Seeing how I hadn't gotten started yet, I said sure, I'll rezz you. It turns out, she really doesn't know where she died at. Well, knowing LGuk pretty well, I said I could probably find it, no biggie. I eventually find it, and start dragging it to the zone where she was at. While dragging it, my ITU drops at the most inopportune time, and while hauling it to the zone, it stopped dragging the corpse somewhere. While hauling the angry mobs to the zone (I didn't train anybody, it was early and few were online at the time) I recevieved about 3 more rezz tells from elsewhere in LGuk, I'm not really sure, at this point I was too concerned with saving my life and being spammed by mob attack messages to be able to read all the tells. At this point I realized I had just entered &quot;rezz tell hell.&quot;I zone to clear aggro, then I head back to start looking for the corpse because I suddenly realized the corpse didn't make it, and could be anywhere along the path. I retrace my steps 3 times before finally seeing the corpse (it was in a kind of funny spot), and finally manage to drag it back to the zone and rezz her. When I rezz her, she accidentally clicks on something and the rezz is lost... all that mana is now blown. At this point, I'm thinking, sure, I could now go and rezz everybody else that was asking, but how long am I supposed to do rezz duty before I can finally get around to what I came here to do and why I decided to play today?!<br>
<br>
Another good example while in LGuk, somebody asks me if they can get &quot;a rezz&quot; in the safe hall. I say sure. I get to the safe hall and come to find out &quot;a rezz&quot; really means rezz my entire group. My point is, even if it seems to be a simple rezz request, even if someone brought the corpses to a cleric's feet, it doesn't always necessarily mean it is a simple rezz matter, and to be honest, when I'm looking forward to leveling my wife's character out of a hell level finally, I just don't feel like pausing to rezz somebody, and take a chance that it turn into another wild goose chase. It happens ALL the time, trust me.<br>
<br>
And about the person that said they wouldn't sow me, that rezzing and sow were the same thing, /shrug, if you think sow and rezz are equivalent spells, that is your opinion, but not mine. I played a shaman to level 41, and I cast sow on anybody that ever asked me, and alot of people that didn't. That was because past say level 30, sow's mana cost was insignicant. You can barely see your mana bar change after casting a sow. I could sow an entire party and it wouldn't take but mebbe a couple of ticks of med time to replace. Rezzing takes FORTY PERCENT of your mana PER PERSON, IF you have that much mana to begin with. Not the same same. Just because I am not always willing to rezz somebody doesn't mean I don't cast less costly spells on people all the time. People ask me all the time for a heal. Unless I'm in a really bad situation (life threatening) I'll cast a celestial heal on them. That spell is only around half a bub if not less, so it is not a big deal. I feel that a heal is more comparable to a sow than a rezz, and rarely turn down giving heals when asked (unless somebody soloing is continaully asking for heals, then I tell them to either get a group or suffer the downtime of soloing, I'm not here to power level every stranger that wants it.)<br>
<br>
And as far as everybody hating me or never helping me or whatever, ======&gt;I never EXPECT people to help me&lt;=========. If they do decide to help me, I am overjoyed and thankful, if not, I go on about my bizniz, no hard feelings. If somebody doesn't want to give me a TP, then I either catch the boat (which I do all the time) or I wait until somebody does come around that is willing to TP me. I don't give wizzies and druids grief about not TPing me, even when they are right next to me! Though I have never had a character that could TP, I  imagine that it is pretty comparable to a rezz, it saves people alot of time at the price of a high amount of mana from the caster. If they don't want to TP because they consider themselves to be too busy, do I add them to my &quot;no group/no rezz/no help&quot; list? No (and no, I don't even have any rez/help black lists, though there are some people that I refuse to group with, I'll still rezz them though if I am available for rezzing). How childish can you be?! Lil baby is upset cuz they don't always get what they want when they want it, and takes their ball and goes home, awww, PUH-LEASE.<br>
<br>
If people read this and make up their minds to never group/sow/TP/help me, then that is their choice. I get asked to join groups all the time even when I am not LFG, get invited to raids alot, and average about 1 invite per day from various guilds. I'd like to think that not all of this is JUST because I'm a cleric, but rather that some of it is because I am a pretty darn good cleric and cuz of all the people I have helped in the past. I am not perfect, sometimes I make mistakes, sometimes group members die, etc, but over all, I think I do a fairly good job, and I have been alot of help to alot of people. I'm the kind of person that counts on their reputation to get into groups and asked to do things since currently I am not even in a guild. A cleric that can't get a group is stuck!<br>
<br>
Blah blah blah, my point is this, if a cleric turns down your request to rezz you, it is their choice, and they don't deserve your grief/black listing. Just because they can doesn't mean they are obligated to rezz you, we all have our reasons.<br>
