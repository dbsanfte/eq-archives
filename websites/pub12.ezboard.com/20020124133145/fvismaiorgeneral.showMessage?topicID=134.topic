<br>
   First off I'd like to say that this isn't a post for everyone. Its a post for those of you who I consider friends on Quellious that aren't in my guild ( Vis Maior ), and who have problems with what we do and wonder why I am in this guild.<br>
  Now I get tells in game allday, everyday from people asking me questions like  &quot; Why is a guy like you in VM? You're nothing like them &quot;, or  &quot; How can you stand to be in a guild like that? &quot; or &quot; VM will change you sooner or later&quot;.....<br>
  To answer the first question  &quot; Why is a guy like me in VM? &quot;....    Well, simple fact is that I'm no different than any of my guild brothers or sisters.-  There are alot of peeps in VM just like me. Of course none of them are as well rounded as I, and not nearly as cute, but for the most part I'm like everyone else in the guild. I am an EQ player that wants to do more than log on everyday and camp the crypt in Sebilis for 8 hours.  I started this game a long time ago, like most of you have. I invested alot of time into this game and I went through all the phases, evolved if you will - From N00b to socialist, to power leveler, to where am I today. I'm in the &quot; I wanna get sh-t done phase of my EQ evolution &quot;.  I want to kill the things that Verant INTENDED players of our level to kill. I want new challenges, no, let me rephrase that. I &quot;CRAVE&quot; new challenges. I'm tired of sittin around and I feel that I don't have alot of time to waste. I wanna get sh-t done, and the simple fact is, VM is the only guild out there right now that is doing the things that I want to do, and although we may not be the best players on an individual basis,  Vis Maior is however, the best  &quot; collection &quot; of players that I have seen in my time here, that work toward a common goal. We are motivated, strong willed and organized. That is our strength. Im not here to sit around. I'm here to accomplish things.<br>
  The second question -  &quot; How can you stand to be in a guild like that? &quot; -  Well, what can I say. As stated above, I share the same &quot; goal &quot; as each of my guildmates. We wanna get sh-t done. But above and beyond that, I've known alot of my guildmates for a long time. I've grown to love each of them, and even though this is &quot;just a game&quot;, I view each member as a RL friend. Face it, we spend hours a day working together. We see eachother through all the emotions. Frustration to jubilation. We laugh and cry together. We fail and succeed together. We've built &quot;real&quot; friendships here in Norrath. Thats the true joy of this game to me. The teamwork and strategy involved in doing the things we do. Its special to me. They are my friends. I respect each one of them, and I will fight with them until Helratos hangs up his eyepatch. I'm proud to say that some of the funniest and most level headed people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing are in my guild, and likewise there are many of you, who are not in my guild that have had the same impact on me, you people are the reason I am writing this. I want to salvage as many friendships as I can.<br>
  The third statement  &quot; VM will change you sooner or later &quot;......  Guys, come on. Helratos has always been Helratos. I help my friends, I am respectful to those who respect me, I love to make people laugh and love to flirt. That will never change. VM doesn't make me who I am. I am who I am, with or without VM. Those of you who know me, will see this if you take the time to. Basically all I'm trying to say to you all is that, If you're going to hate me, hate me for who I am and not for the &quot;tag&quot; I wear. In the meantime I'm gonna continue to remain with the guild I have grown to love, and I'm gonna continue to have many friendships outside my guild as well. I hope I can keep yours. But Im not gonna leave VM to do so. Im where I want to be. Plain and simple. Accept me for that, or please by all means don't ever say a word to me again, cause you're not worth my time. Just my 2cents.<br>
<br>
                                      Sincerely yours,<br>

<br>
Verant made a game that doesn't have clear-cut goals or a way to &quot;win.&quot;  so you have to figure out your own way to &quot;win&quot; in EQ.  the competitive gamer wins by taking on all the challenges that EQ presents us with - be it gods, dragons, epic quests, or whatever.  it's the only means of competition there exists in EQ, so it's what the competitive EQ gamer gravitates to, sooner or later.<br>
<br>
VM rises to take on the challenges presented to them by the game.  for that, i say kudos to VM, and good luck on the rest.  people that use this game as a social outlet or whatever it is to them don't understand that, and we all know that fear lies in the unknown, and that anger frequently rises from fear.<br>
<br>
it's just 1's and 0's on a hard drive in california.  it's a video game.  like pac man.  wokka wokka wokka wokka.  get out there and have fun, and try to clear the board and eat all the monsters   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do read it but not every day or even every other day; I leave it up to Koggrog to fill me in, hehe. After that question though, I decided to come and read if anything new has been posted. (Besides the negative). I am so happy that this post was on top and the first thing I read. It has given me a new resolve and a renewed appreciation of the game and our friends in it. I must admit, all the arguing and conflicting opinions on every MB was getting to me, and I haven't been playing as often as I had been before. But now, I look forward to the next &quot;first&quot; VM accomplishes and will be there with my guildmates/friends when it happens.<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful post, Helratos <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
