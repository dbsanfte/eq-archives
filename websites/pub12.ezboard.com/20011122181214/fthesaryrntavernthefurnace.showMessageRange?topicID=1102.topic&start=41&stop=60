<br>
for the &quot;normal&quot; hate fist floor i think you need around 2 groups o be called to be in force, except whn the groups are pretty much 50 and below, in which case you will need around 3 groups<br>
<br>
Now i don't know if som eof the big well established guilds like OOP will do that area with one group of 60's or not, you better ask them that question :-)<br>
<br>
seems to me that they probably will consider one lvl 60-ish group enough of a force to claim the plan as they can probably clear the ground floor as is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule of thumb on raids, the higher the level ombined with raiding experience will make the need for bigger groups progressively smaller--note the raiding experience-- You still need to operate as a team to do it :-)<br>

<br>
I won't argue that Chaotic Horde had every right to hit Hate as long as no other raid was there. I do think it's pretty shitty if they knew an open raid was going to happen and used that information to get a jump on it. Frankly, I'm sure they did know as several of the CH members that have replied to this thread do in fact read this message board (take a look at their post counts). But that's not really the point. They were there first and more power to them.<br>
<br>
What really is pathetic is their attempt to justify themselves in such a childish and immature manner. It's no wonder when I do a /w all &quot;chaotic horde&quot; the return comes up looking a lot like my ignore list. If the kind of behavior displayed in this thread is indicative of your behavior in-game (and in my personal experience, it is), then it's no wonder you've bumped heads with other guilds in the past.<br>
<br>
As for asking for your help? With any luck God will strike me down before I need assistance from some overgrown newb guild. <br>

What number exactly is needed for FiF?  I am guessing 12 max for guilds like OoP and H&amp;E, but maybe smaller guilds need 18-24 before they can call it.  I really dunno.  I cant remember the last time H&amp;E went to Hate.<br>
<br>
As for reserving the planes/mob, it has never flown.  We, as a community, felt we would never be able to hold a calender together.  My suggestion to you is not to ask for no one to go to the plane of your choice on the day you choose, rather, send tells to each possible guild and talk with someone about it.  Tell them your intentions and see what theirs are.  If you get someone from H&amp;E telling you we arent doing Hate and the day comes and we are, then come to the boards and flame, you have that right, but dont expect that every player on Saryrn reads this board.<br>

huh? i have only done ONE &quot;open hate raid&quot;  don't even start with that shit... the one i did DE jumped us and we found out after we already ported up... so instead of wasting the stone we stayed... got wiped out and ever RECOVERED DE on their wipe out.<br>
<br>
As i also recall CH was up there as well... and when we went to move away from DE as they were causing all kinds of havoc, we got wiped out and they did help us on a CR, but heh whoa thats when i had some respect for them... and to the ones who were up there i still have ALOT of respect for.. just a few that i wouldnt res/help if my life depended on it.<br>

Working out differences is what needs to happen at this point... SOOO! Skyla or whoever your alt is... Shoot me a tell in game and we will see what we can come up with.<br>

We have been around and around with this issue of reserving a plane by posting in the common room with the SGA/Samurai epic flame fest. Here whats wrong with doing what you did:<br>
<br>
1. If we did actually respect every raid posted in the common it would just turn into a race to see who post his raids first. Thats silly and dumb therefore we dont do it.<br>
<br>
2. Not everyone read the boards and most everyone that do read them will skip over/forget these open raid post. I have a hard time having my guys remember OUR raid schedule dont expect us to memorize yours.<br>
<br>
Two things that works on this server: one be their first and two talk to your possible competition and get a rotation agreement in place. I know that the list of hate capable guild is hudge and it may not be practical to contact every single one of them so my advice is simply be there first.<br>

Don't compare guilds to OOP/H&amp;E ... should be a general rule such as 12+ is FiF for any guild in Hate/Fear.  Shouldn't be guilda needs 12 but guildb needs 18.  That kind of crap is what pisses people off.<br>

Seriously though, it's a pretty important question if we really wanna get a definition of &quot;first in force&quot;  Especially when you can port up from anywhere in the world for hate and/or Air.  My leaning would be 12 people actively in the zone and/or performing CR because it's damn near impossible to tell who's about to gate up. <p><TABLE Width=650 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

I saw NOBODY that was not CH in the area of the SRO wiz spire when I went up.  Neither did I see anyone other than CH around when my two hydras went up during the next several ports up.  After about 20 minutes of sitting in hate reforming groups, picking up stragglers and getting organized, I hear something about SFoL complaning about us stealing the Plane.  Seems a bit late to complain at that point - I didnt think you could 'steal' anything unless there was contention (you can't rape the willing).  I apologise for the stepped on toes.  It was NOT done with malice or any knowledge beforehand.  Please let it drop already - who knows, you may beat us up there next time, I doubt we'll bring it to the blast furnace.<br>

SoFL ran past the SW corner and started to organize something. Dikidoo was pulling and warned them several times that we where pulling. Dikidoo pulls several things and toggels them while our tagger tags singles. SoFL got in our way and ended up getting anywhere from 5-10 mobs (somewhere in their) Instead of stopping and dieing half their members ran to us and yelled for help. Lucky for us none of the mobs argoed onto us. Dikdioo was extreamly pissed that he warned them and they still didnt move. They where all dead and we didnt have to help them (I know I didnt want to at the time) but who told me to rez Aurelle?? Dikidoo did. So stop giving him shit Aurelle.. He was extreamly nice to you about the whole thing and you went ahead and and bitched at him. We'll still help you if you guys get wiped sometime when you are in hate, it's the right thing to do. We dont get our jollies off because you had to ask us for help so dont think you cant ask us for help.. All we want in return is for you to stop bitching at us.. I think thats a fair request. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1102.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1102.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1102.topic&start=61&stop=77>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1104.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=955.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=1102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=1102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1102.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1102.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntavernfrm14">Attack on America<option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://clicks.about.com/157/spkcpa.asp?PM=485_d_ezboard_spcpa&rURL=https%3A//sprinks.about.com/userforms/create_user.htm%3Fpc%3Dd_ezboard" target="_blank">
