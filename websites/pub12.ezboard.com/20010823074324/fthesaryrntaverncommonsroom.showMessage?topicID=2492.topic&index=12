<br>
This game used to be fun. I am beginning to think it isn't anymore.<br>
<br>
My guild is growing up now, and grown up guilds get to do what?<br>
<br>
Argue with other grown up guilds about camps and spawns and loots...<br>
<br>
Arrrrggghhh it does my head in completely.... but there is no solution to basic human selfishness, don't slate Giggy for stating what is probably true..<br>
<br>
Why don't raid calendars work? Because someone will use them to determine a time they can turn up before the raid and farm away..<br>
<br>
I don't think there are any solutions, to give Verant credit they have tried.<br>
<br>
e.g. The Warrens for newbies, and the changes to Vox/Naggy for people over 52, but the latter doesn't work (except with nodrop loot) because most level 60s have at least 1 46-52 alternate which they can use to raid em..<br>
<br>
I hope they keep trying until they find a solution that actually works... for a start moving that item on Vox for the Pally epic on to some non level specific mob would be sensible...<br>
<br>
Some interesting possibilities for solutions would be '1 character' servers... ie no ALTS, this would remove the farming for twinks problems.. (though the lack of mules for bank space would be a major pain)<br>
<br>
Introduce a new loot type called USABLEDROP that is completely unlootable by anyone other than a class/race designed to use it.. <br>
<br>
More item level restrictions (a la Primal Velium) to discourage farming...<br>
<br>
Make it impossible for higher levels to zone into certain zones.. (making sure no serious quests impacted)<br>
<br>
Verant enforced raid calendars<br>
<br>
Verant also need to do so something to encourage higher level players to play for fun, not just cash..<br>
<br>
i.e. fun quests a la PoM that don't involve time based camps, but randomised puzzles. <br>
<br>
Level expansion beyond level 60 available based on accepting some new terms and conditions designed to prevent exploitation of powers... (ie to stop level 80 necros from soloing Planes... make mobs in old zones immune to level 60+ players and vice versa - the exception being trade skill dropping mobs)<br>
<br>
I don't know if any of these would work, but there must be some way to resurrect the game, besides even with all the camp stealing, KSing, Ninjalooting, swearing and demands for clarity/sow/ports/buffs/cash/items  - i'll prolly still play because my guild are cool to chat too, and the graphics are nicer than ICQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Good luck with your fear/hate raid, I'd come but my guild has plans to go someplace else that night, and taking Giggy's advice - I ain't saying where ;P<br>

Whilst your example is absurd - 4 months??? Fear repops every 24 hours, admittedly Big Ol' Cazic only shows his ugly face once per week but how many guilds on the server can actually take a full repop?<br>
<br>
OOP<br>
AOTS<br>
HNE<br>
TWC<br>
The SGA<br>
Titans of Saryrn/Celtica<br>
Ted Club<br>
<br>
Possibly a couple more alliances/guilds could do it, but still that would give each group 1 Cazic every 2 months and you can get a non full pop every friggin evening... If you think this is an unfair way to organise things then you are implying that your guildmembers deserve more than their equitable share of spawns... this is exactly the problem, humans are greedy, they don't believe in sharing.... If the system was run fairly with allocations based on the number of members of that raid capable level in a guild then it might be possible to work it, but it would require people to have sufficient intelligence to realise that statistics can be made 'nearly fair'<br>
<br>
Anyway, Garbage, the purpose of this post was not to argue in favour of a raid calendar for Saryrn, your first point at least was pertinent, calendars would never work across overly disparate time zones...<br>
<br>
I wish they would put some servers in Europe.. it would result in much less latency for some of us Euro types... and we could have some nice civilised European raid calendar where we are free to abide by such alien concepts as 'waiting our turn'<br>

<br>
Actually most of the people I know above 52 got above 52 secondaries.. and the Vox/Naggy thing made sure both dragons were not killed for ages back when the change was done. Plus they also fucked over those of us who were too high to attend these then for our epics.<br>

Nah hydraing people would still be there having fun their own  way. Plus I quite enjoy logging on to different chars.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Whilst your example is absurd - 4 months??? Fear repops every 24 hours, admittedly Big Ol' Cazic only shows his ugly face once per week but how many guilds on the server can actually take a full repop?"<br>
<br>
Far from absurd. Most of the higher level guilds don't give a crap about  Hate/Fear except for epic pieces and CT. As of right now there are 2 (3?) guilds capable of killing CT on the server. So if guild 1 goes in and fails, how long before guild 2 can go in? Or do they have to wait their 2 weeks for their scheduled attempt? Not to mention that there are guilds that don't give a shit about a calendar and will go take what they want.<br>
<br>
And why should someone share anyway? If you got the power to be there first, do so. That is how the game works. It has nothing to do with intelligence (thx lame attempt at insult), but rather pure facts.<br>
<br>
The raid calendar issue is dead on this server. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
Btw I am Norwegian. A huge number of OoPs are Swedes. So much for your "nice civilised European raid calendar" crap.<br>

*scratches head* OOP ate my hamster, AoTS sat on my whopee cushion, HnE drank my Heineken, TWC mixed up the colours in my Playdoh....<br>
<br>
Come on - this board is filled with flames over mob encounters that were *stolen* even tho acceptable use policy was not actually broken. <br>
<br>
It's interesting to see your thoughts on might makes right. I am level 60 - you are level 20. I can kill that mob now even if you are buffing up for the fight because I am stronger than you...  I fail to see how if you can assemble a group of level 60s at a moment's notice that gives you priority over a small guild preparing intensely for what is, for them, a major encounter. Other than in the Captain Caveman, &quot;me gor beeg klubb&quot;  mentality, that is.<br>
<br>
It does require some intelligence to see that a raid calendar is a useful tool. (other servers with boards *do* have problems but then they have a hell of a lot more big guilds too). As you say there a few guilds at this moment in time who can do these encounters - and look at the mess you are making of it with only those few <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I'd bump posts but is it really worthwhile?).<br>
<br>
You are right about one thing tho Andvari, I do have to confess that if a European server was set up I'd hate to be on it with you if these are truly how you regard big mob encounters. Perhaps a better idea would be an uber-server, where all those who believe in might-is-right can tank dragons in a version of EC where orc pawns are Gorenaire status in power and Captain Slate a level 99 harmtouching necro with decent AI <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That way there would be no fighting over loot because there would be enough dragons around for everyone and those who wish to play the game for enjoyment can get a crack at monsters on existing servers without having to look over their shoulders for the *We have 89 level 60s on our rosters nanananah* guild to come charging in on a might-is-right policy.<br>
<br>

Only OOP and HaE can even take him. And we don't always win on the first try. You sure will not find us going to Fear unless he is spawned. If others could take them then I would argue those same other groups would be killing Innoruuk. But since he seems to never be killed I find it unlikely any of them could kill Cazic since he is quite a bit more of a fight than Innoruuk is now. <br>
<br>
Everyone else bitching about (Uber guilds)<br>
As to us Uber guilds hogging all encounters crap. We kill Trakanon only maybe when we need teeth for newer members to get there keys to Veeshans Peak. And a few BPs to sell to fund all our other raids. Such as killing Dain, Tormax,Yalnick, Vinidicator, Satue of Rallos Zek, Sontalak,Keeper,Zlandicar,Klandicar,Warders in ST, or hitting north wing of ToV. None of these having any affect on the smaller guilds on the server. If we ever do anything besides these its for a member needing a epic item. We hardly sit around plotting how to run the fun for all the smaller guilds on the server. There is plenty for small guilds to do. Fear 6 days a week,Hate,Vox,Nagafen,Goranare,Talandar,Woushi,Sevilious,CoM for the Reavers,Chardok,Trakanon,Vanril Sathir,Plane of Air, Howling Stones for Drazila Sathir, Kedge Keep for Phinny,Hole for Master Yael. Just because the small guild are not willing to go out and try new things and utilize the resources they have at there disposal don't blame large guilds for it. There is no way OOP and HaE can do everything out there every week. We have enough trouble covering the big things we do now that small guilds cannot do. This hardly leaves the small guilds with a game devoid of options for raids.  <p>Wyrmwood B'Dynn 60 Grave Lord <BR>

<br>
And I don't really think calendars would work, so I am not in favour.. my main problem is with guilds like CH disrespecting open raids they know are going to go off.. I don't want to dwell on these points here.. they are fairly tired and probably irresolvable..<br>
<br>
My original post was a list of possible ideas, of which Gharbad selected one (which I now wish I had not included) to respond to.. I didn't think through any of them, I just wrote them down...<br>
<br>
I actually thought the USABLEDROP one was a good idea, but noone seemed to bother noticing that one (<br>
<br>
Anyway I have no wish to go to fear and have Cazic up - getting DT'd when FD after a pull due to agro transfer sucks.. I don't have time to play up to a level where I could go on Cazic capable raids.. What sucks most is that Verant buffed Cazic in the first place.. If 6 group raids of 50s used to be able to take him down then its kind of unfair on us now that we can't anymore.. I understand that killing Gods shouldn't be easy, but the loot he drops used to be available to weaker raids - and now it isn't - which is not fair at all.  Verant did this why? Because Cazic was being farmed... but making him harder didn't solve the problem, it just changed it into a different one and put the loots forever beyond the reach of anyone except members of three guilds on the server.<br>

And you also seem to be lacking a bit of info on the changes made to Fear so I will detail them here for you. First Cazic was changed he has more than 100,000 hps now. Quads for something like 600 a hit. Does AE knock back and snares you on top of that as well as dispelling 1 buff. His loot table is all new. He drops none of the old Cazic loots. The old Cazic loots where moved to the 3 goloms and they where also buffed up. They now have DT and Cazic Thule does not. They made changes to agro so you do not have the problems with passed on agro causing mass DTs. Draco also now has a new loot table and goloms have his old loot table. He also was buffed up to about 75,000 hps. The goloms are a bit tuffer than they use to be. 1 also has Vox AE cold breath in addition to his normal melee DT attacks.  <br>
<br>
As to your usable drop idea its kinda already in effect but its called NODROP. Since if a item is NODROP only people that will use it have a reason to kill for it. Due to this fact we often invite a few people from smaller guilds along when we clear Fear to have any armor that would otherwise rot. NODROP also discourages the farming of items.  When EQ first came out it was only attached to some quest items if at all. They later made these changes making most items Lore and NODROP to prevent the farming of items. <p>Wyrmwood B'Dynn 60 Grave Lord <BR>

Seems excessive to buff on old world zone to that extent but I guess Verant had their reasons. <br>
