<br>
    I logged in my level 20 warrior last night, and in order to help with my NFP faction, I headed out to WC for some good old fashioned Orc hunting. The camp was already taken, so I logged out for a while and played another character I have. I logged back in, and it was empty, so I was hunting there for a little while when a druid and her friend came up to the camp. Her name was Alphy SilverSun from the clan Dragonmarked.<br>
<br>
    She proceeded to pull an orc out from under me, so I politely told her that I had been here for a while ( Her answer: &quot;So?&quot; )<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , and that I would be leaving soon, and I could give a shout when I moved on from the camp. Then she said to me that since I was level 20 and not getting any XP, then I should forfeit the camp to someone who could use the XP ( Keep in mind that she is level 42 ). To which I just as politely explained that there are orc camps all over, including EC and Ro area. She told me that she wanted *this* one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    This is where it gets ugly: She then proceeds to threaten to kill every orc in the camp unless I give her and her ONE friend this camp that I waited 2 hours for. She was trying her best, but I found rather humorous the fact that by the time she could get a spell off, I already had the mob down to less than half health ( in most cases ), and all her nukes really did was finish the mob off for me and make my job easier. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I still can't understand the logic in KSing a camp out from under someone (who was 22 levels under her) to show them they are wrong for taking that camp after waiting their turn for it.<br>
<br>
    So I talked to my guild leader about it, and he tried to make sense to her, but she went on and on about the &quot;right of the lower levels to get the XP&quot;, etc etc, all the while neglecting to mention the fact that I told her I would have gladly shared the camp had i been asked to, instead of her attempting to KS the camp out from under me. She would hear none of it, telling him she didn't care what other players thought of her ( She will once she goes on planes raids ), and that I was in the wrong.<br>
<br>
    I took a quick poll of the zone, and sure enough, everyone that responded said that, in their opinion, it was my camp since I was the one who was there first( I know, I know, there is no such thing as &quot;owning&quot; a camp, but this is what *they* said), and her KSing me was definitely wrong. Then she relented, and stopped KSing me, and instead just sat and hurled sporadic (sp?) insults at me, mostly when she was about to leave.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    Another interesting side note: underlying her overwhelming concern for &quot; ppl who could use the XP&quot; getting the camp was the fact that there in fact *was* no group waiting for the camp, merely the fact that she wanted to P-level her level 12 friend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Again, there are plenty of places for a druid to P-level someone, she just wanted the camp *I* happened to be at, and HOW DARE I not give it up to her was her general overall attitude.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    Was I in the wrong for not giving up a camp I waited my turn for? Was I out of line for asking her politely to wait her turn, and telling her that I would not be very long, even offering to shout out wheen the camp was free so she and her friend could have it? To top it all off, she petitioned ME ( /boggle ), saying that a GM would have seen it her way. Who was at fault here? I value the opinions of those who read these boards, and that is why I am posting this now. <br>
<br>
    Let me know what you guys think... Later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/useraphofhacedama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SeraphofHacedama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cradle of Darkness<br>King of Speedposting</span><br>  Posts: 656<br> <font color=#122950>(5/29/01 2:22:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT: Poll time - Who is in the wrong here?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Thats not a good idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But anyways, as far as the incident is concerned I know Alphy, I grouped with her frequently at the WW giant fort a long time ago, and back then she was rather nice usually. However from what I heard recently some friends of mine seemed to have some problems with her, but those only concern them so I wont bring those here. She may have changed, she may have been a fake back then, I dont know. But I know that her behavious on that day sucked big time. She may have had a bad day, she may have been running around all the time, I dont know but I know that she should have handled it better. Since you were only there for faction there would have been NO harm done if you had just shot an arrow in the face of every orc to get the faction while her friend killed them. <br>
So in the end IF that is how it occured (sry but there is always 2 sides to the story) you were not wrong, I guess you could have asked her to do the camp while you just hit the orcs once but wtf she should learn how to behave because like that she isnt going very far and she WAS a very nice person to group with once.  <p><I>Borbarad Delduwath,<BR>

Also keep in mind I would have gladly shared the camp with her (Something I made clear to my guild leader while he was trying to sort this out in a civil manner *before* it got stupidly out of hand) had she simply *asked* instead of trying to walk in and decide who gets what camp simply because she said so.<br>
<br>
In any case, thanks for the input. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uginslunger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ginslunger</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#122950>(5/29/01 3:06:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT: Poll time - Who is in the wrong here?</span><hr size=1> I find it much easier to find a group by contacting people directly by tell and asking them directly for a group rather than say, ooc or shout.<br>
<br>
Zone in, do a camp check, find out who the leaders of the groups are and send them a tell.  I don't usually find many people who will ignore you in that case.  If they don't have room, get put on a list, If I don't find a group immediately, I can usually have one in less than 30 min. if I can get put on 3 or 4 lists.  Hope this helps. <p>Zabrina <br>

<br>
I usually dont post in this section of boards, but since Alphy is a very close friend of me i will, and i might be a bit coloured by it.<br>
<br>
I have been one of the people Alphy have PL at the orc camp now and then and usually when someone have come and ask to get in she have said we move away in a moment and then continued other place. Thats why im supprised about this.<br>
<br>
I sure agree that if xx was there first its his or hers and its wrong doing to take over like that no matter if exp is needed or not.<br>
<br>
I will try get a talk with Alphy about this when i see her since she is still for me one of the kindest people on the server and hear her side.<br>
<br>
But i bet she have had a very lousy day if she have done this but not an excuse.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry about this incident no matter what is wrong or right.<br>
<br>
Take care and lets go have some fun ingame :-)<br>

If your story is accurate, you are in the right.  All in all the above posts have answered your question.  Aside from getting belts if you wanted them, one arrow per pulled orc would have given you faction hits.<br>

[Tue May 29 03:17:16 2001] Alphy tells you, 'He decided not to let him camp it because he can t get belts anyother way.'<br>

[Tue May 29 03:32:27 2001] You told Alphy, 'Let me ask you this, if you were camping an area, and i walked up and said I'm going to share your camp with you, and theoretically we both get exp out of it, what would you think of me?'<br>
[Tue May 29 03:32:58 2001] Alphy tells you, 'Well since EQ rules say i HABVE to share i would let you.'<br>

[Tue May 29 03:43:21 2001] You told Alphy, 'Do you just walk from camp to camp, telling people to leave?'<br>
[Tue May 29 03:43:36 2001] Alphy tells you, 'I get along with everyone but idiots who think they know the rules. I have had them Explained to me by GM s so i am explaining them to you but you just don't want to understand.'<br>

<br>
Your reasons for monopolizing a camp that was green to you don't make you a pharmer.  You were planning to use the belts for yourself and building faction. You were not starting a belt selling business during prime playing time.  I doubt you'd have tried to own the camp exclusively and prevent others from gaining experience perpetually.<br>
<br>
You used good player etiquette (based on what you wrote).  You waited your turn for the camp.  Sounds like you might have been willing to share the camp had the powerleveling team been more polite.<br>
<br>
Sounds like the attempted camp stealer was fed up/having a bad day. Y'all rubbed each other wrong.  Yes her friend had more of a right to share the camp with you since her friend would have gained experience.  You don't know that her friend did not need the faction as well or that they had been to other camps already and were tired of searching for hunting grounds.  But it was not handled too well.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, had a level 12 showed up to hunt in that camp without a high level babysitter that could port them elsewhere, you'd have been a bit rude to not share the camp.  Personally I hate camping green things and would much rather babysit/help strangers gain experience in a camp while I wait for an item to drop.  <br>
<br>
On the flipside, I cannot imagine going up to someone and forcing them to share a camp.  That is rude too.  There have been times when I saw a high level camping an area that I wanted to gain experience/or an item that the camper might not use.  I talk to them.  Work it out. If you get invited to share the camp, well funfun and cooperation. If not, ask them to give you a tell and wait your turn and go elsewhere or do something else or play an alt or whatever.  That is also common respect.  If I was powerleveling a younger friend for experience, I'd want to find the least populated area that I could for the maximum action.  <br>
<br>
The only thing that could justify forcing you to share the camp would be if that level 12 needed both the faction AND the experience from that particular camp.  In which case....they *could* and prolly *should* wait their turn just like you or anyone else that holds the camp has.<br>
<br>
My final thought is that it is rude to try and farm an easily accessible experience camp during prime time playing.  A level 12 player/group is not very mobile (if not being powerleveled by a porting class) compared to a level 20.  It is not very fair for a high level to tie up a camp that a group could gain experience on unless you are willing to share. You could kill orc pawns for faction and have enough cash as a level 20 to buy the belts off those level 12's if they were a legitimate group.<br>
<br>
Take a deep breath, know you were mostly in the right.  Blow off the player that made you so mad, on a different day s/he might not be so bad.  Peace.<br>
<br>
(edit) p.s. this post was talking about a low level orc camp, but the same problems occur and the same principles apply even in much higher level areas and with higher level characters. this kind of thing seems to happen when players get sick of the crowds during their playing times and develop a me-first attitude and quit playing with the honor/respect that makes the game enjoyable for all.  it also seems to happen when enough rude players are allowed to ruin our gameplay that nice players quit being tolerant of even slight irritations. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ucrowgirlnamelessone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crowgirl NamelessOne</A> at: 5/30/01 8:05:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uaalek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aalek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#122950>(5/30/01 8:11:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RANT: Poll time - Who is in the wrong here?</span><hr size=1> My guild member would have shared the camp with this person if she had been more polite about it, he told me so.<br>
<br>
I was mostly bothered by the attitude Alphy displayed and the statements she made to me.  Starting off the conversation I was optimistic we could work out some sort of solution or compromise, but she quickly proved me wrong.<br>
<br>
In my opinion she was acting like a child in a sandbox full of toys, walking up to another child and trying to grab the toy someone else was playing with, saying no other toy would do, that it should be *her* toy to play with.<br>
<br>
Bottom line for me, I personally don't want to associate with someone who couldn't care less what other players think.<br>

How sad. Faction? I may be wrong but I believe the faction is much better off of the orcs in S Ro that nobody ever bothers with, but then they don't drop the belts, so I don't really buy that &quot;just for the faction&quot; bit. In S Ro, there are ALOT more orc spawns (so you can kill alot more in the same amount of time).<br>
<br>
Another thing that is sad is arguing over something as petty as an orc camp. I can understand arguing over other things/places/camps/spawns because you are talking about things that have the consequence of many real life hours, but an orc camp?! You know what I do when there is a persistant argument about something so trivial? I walk away (unless you just caught me on the wrong day).<br>
<br>
The thing that is really sad is when people try to power level in a common/popular area, or forcing out other people so you can power level. One time I was at Unrest with my level 18 monk, with a small group, pulling from the first floor. Then in comes a couple of characters that are anon in wolf form (if you are going to power level, and I don't believe there is anything wrong with power leveling as long as you are considerate of others, why do they always go anon like people aren't gonna know what you are doing anyways? LOL). A couple of minutes later there are NO mobs left on the first floor. And there continue to be no mobs left for my monk to pull for my group.<br>
<br>
At this point I /ooc something to the effect &quot;Hmmm, do you mind leaving a few mobs for the rest of us please?&quot; half sarcastically. The power levelers then tell me &quot;Why don't you go someplace else?&quot; LOL. MAYBE if they had been there first it might have carried some weight, and MAYBE if I could teleport anywhere in an instant and could handle any mob I chose to, I WOULD go someplace else... someplace where I wouldn't be taking the mobs from others that were already there.<br>
<br>
Bah, what I'm trying to say is shame on both of you. Shame on you for farming the orc belts and shame on the other for trying to take somebody else's camp to power level.<br>
