There she is! Get her!" The Giant shouts out order after order to his legions. "Halt, I command you! In the name of the Kromzek!" He warns as he points his men into action. "I've been seen!" Young Jayla thinks as she glances at the army of Giants storming in her direction. "You will not escape the Kromzek! Kill her and return me her head!" He orders his men. Quick to notice the danger surrounding her Jayla darts in the opposite direction looking franticaly for an escape, but her surroundings while being of great beauty gave no hope in her attempts.. "These trees.. They all look the same! Where do I go?!" She panics, keeping an eye over her shoulder.. "I got her!" one giant shouts as his blade slices through the air "ARRRRYAHHH!!" but the agile Wood Elf quickly dodges to the right as the ground shakes from the force of the steel. Jayla letting loose quick words summons from the earth beneath the towering Giants feet a storm of roots. "ARHG! There is no escape! the giant confirms young Jayla's fears, but being the playfull one she is well known to be she smirks at the giant as she darts off with the speed of a wolf. She continues her fleeing efforts through the thick of the forest lost and not knowing any ways of breaking free from this nightmare, finaly running short of breath and even more will she drops to her knees. Looking left and right nervously, sure to the fact she had lost her followers by now Jayla crawled to the closest tree slumping down beneath the protection of her bark covered friend. "Surely there is a way out of here.." panting and grasping for breath she assures herself as she reaches into her pack for rations. "Tunare.. please guid me...." she pleads as her tired eyes drift shut.<br>
<br>
"Hmph.. What is this?! Do my eyes decieve me? A Wood Elf, in my forest? How does one of such small stature evade the Kromzek?" A man in rusty silver armor towers over young Jayla as she sleeps, pondering her presence.. He lightly kicks her in the leg with his mud covered boots "Wake up.. Let the forest of Wakening know of your name!" He stares down at her rubbing his chin.. "Come on child, speak up.. Who is it that dare walk the same lands as myself? Why does one such as you leave your protected home in the trees? Is it adventure you quest? Does thou come alone, or should we expect more intrudors?" His voice stern but falling on unhearing ears.. He removes his sword from the holder strapped to his waist.. "Wake up!" he demands as he drives the flat side of his sword with little force to the top of Jaylas head. Her eyes pop open as she attempts to catch her balance and pull herself to her feet, but the man quickly shoves her back to the ground pointing the sharpened tip of his blade toward her chest. "So your attention I have now? Tell me your name and what you want here!" He orders from her. "J-Jayla Spiritwalker.." She answers hesitantly.. "I don't want anything here.. Sir, if you'll let me pass I shall not return" She pleads with the man.. "Let you pass?" He laughs at the suggestion.. "So you can go back and tell others of my home? Then what? More like yourself come to hunt my land? I'll have none of that!" He says bluntly as he raises his sword high above his head. With no escape possible Jayla closes her eyes, grinding her teeth as she awaits her demise.. "Argh! What is this?!" The mans sword drops firmly on the ground before Jayla, she looks up keeping one eye closed as a swarm of drixies surround the man.. He fights valiently struggling, swinging his fists trying to break free of the cluster.. Jayla realizing that she may not have another chance gathers herself calling once again on the spirits of the wolf, her feet tingle as the powers she summons feel stronger and more viable in this land.. She quickly releases herself in the other direction fleeing deeper into the forest...<br>
<br>
With the danger well behind her but still no end in sight Jayla stops for a moment to rest, she sighs as she opens her book and begins to read a passage from the testament. One she had read many times in moments of need, it often made her feel a little better with her current situation. As the sun once again begins to set she peers out over the thick forest letting go a slight shiver.. "What now?" she asks herself. Just as all hope was fading the most beautifull creature Jayla had ever laid eyes on appeared in the near distance.. The white coat, the horn pointing toward the stars of the night sky. If ever young Jayla had been taking in by such a sight like this it surely had escaped her memory in such dire times. She approached the creature slowely but timid the it pulled away from her touch. "I won't hurt you." She assured the Unicorn as it pranced off into the trees.. She followed it for a moment before giving up on catching it. Just as she attempted to take a seat it circled back, stopping short of her current location. She stood up again and reached her hand out, the Unicorn less timid and almost playfull licked her hand then dance out ahead of her. Jayla followed once again, everytime the Unicorn got too far ahead it would circle back almost in an asking manner to be sure that Jayla was still following.. "Where are we going?" she asked, not forgetting the danger she had left behind. The Unicorn let out a soft magical sound and continued ahead of her. This continued for some time as Jayla refused to run too fast and instead cautiosly paced herself keeping an eye on her surroundings. "RAAAWWWRRR!" the sound startled Jay as she quickly jumped behind a tree, peeking out to see what kind of creature could let loose such a horrifying sound.. A short moment of silence followed and interupted by the claws of a raptor tearing into the bark of the tree she had taken cover behind, it's fur decorated like a tiger but teeth more furious then any tiger she had seen before. The Unicorn charged in jabbing it once in the side with it's horn, this stunned the creature long enough for young Jay to make an escape still being lead by the Unicorn that she had only moments ago befriended and now trusted with her life..<br>
<br>
The path the Unicorn took Jayla was one she could never have imagined in all her journies, and what lied before not even the wisest of the Kelethin Elders could have prepared her for what she would soon be witniss to. As the Unicorn came to a stop in front of some sort of outpost, young Jayla's curiosity led her ahead of her friend. She stared in awe at the creatures guarding the bridge, gathering her sences just long enough to turn and look back to the Unicorn that had saved her and brought her to such a place of history. but to her dismay it was gone, just as it came it left. A little sad that she couldn't thank it or tell it goodbye she wandered closer to her final destination. The guards seemed to like her so she slowely crossed the bridge keeping her guard up at every step she took. What lay inside was more intriguing then anything Kelethin had to offer. No sooner then she had taken step into the lobby she was welcomed by a comforting voice "Hail there young Wood Elf." the man said "What brings you to me on this fine day child?" The words flowed, soothing all the troubles she had faced on her journey. For the first time in days she felt safe, she let her guard down and conversed with what she later learned was her lost ancestors. Confused by much of what was said through out the conversation, Jayla was still very shocked that they seemed just as excited to meet her as she was to meet them. After sharing stories with Shamus Aghllsews and Eysa Florawhisper she made her way to the top of the tower, a beatifull view, she stood amazed and entranced as she peered out over the lush forest.. So taken by the sight and everything she had witnessed she failed to notice the tree standing in the middle of the tower until it was too late. Turning quickly attention not where it needed to be Jayla found a branch acrost her head and darkness filled her vision....<br>
