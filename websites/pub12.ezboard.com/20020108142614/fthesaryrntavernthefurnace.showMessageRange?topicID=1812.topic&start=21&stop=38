Now I personally dont know Punk, but I'm sure you're a popular person on the server.  Still, you're a liar and you knows it.  You were at 80% (at least) health and you knew Minah was gonna disband BEFORE you pulled.  Still, you pulled another mob with the intent of keeping Minah in your group.  The truth is Minah stayed just in case to heal you if you needed it.  The truth is you were bummed about losing the group after an hour of good times.  The truth is you were upset about losing such a great cleric and you had to whine about it here.  My wife is not a shitty person; you should consider yourself lucky to be in her presence.  So the next time you let your emotions cloud your judgement, sniff yourself; shit comes from the inside.    <br>
<br>
As for Multanis, why don't you get a life.  Over 1700 posts I bet 99% of them have been in this forum.  You're a jackass that just likes to add fuel to the fire.  If you have a problem with Dark Rain members because of specific incidents, then fine, we should talk about it in game.  But if you're just jumping on the first bandwagon you see, then buy yourself a fuckin' clue: NOBODY CARES.  You are a nobody; you're just a name, and a guy that needs to get laid.<br>

<br>
First....  I love when husband and wife cover each others backs.  Love it even more when their stories don't match.  <br>
<br>
Minah-<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and when the message went through to the group, Punk was pulling.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Kenidin-<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You were at 80% (at least) health and you knew Minah was gonna disband BEFORE you pulled. Still, you pulled another mob with the intent of keeping Minah in your group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, there wasn't a message.  The enchanter/wizard in the group didn't recall seeing it either when we were talking about how bitch-like that was to disband mid-fight without warning.  They're your own guildmates, talk to them about it if you don't believe me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And it seems funny to me that the ranger was AFK, because I remember watching him attack the incoming mob as I was leaving the group, because I distinctly remember switching targets between Punk and the ranger to make sure that both were ok on heals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yeah, trust me, he was AFK.  He said he was going to eat dinner, and he's a RL friend so when he's there we're in tells.  So once again, he was very AFK.  I had to explain to him when he got back why we had no monk and cleric.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But what really made me laugh was the part about you considering the ranger a melee. You seemed to spend the majority of the time calling him a &quot;pansy&quot; and a &quot;fag&quot; while we were grouped. But I guess if it fits in with your exaggeration to call him a melee, then by all means, go ahead. I'd hate for you to have to ruin your embellishment of the story.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, RL friend.  Elves are feminine with Luclin models on, calling him Peterpan and fairy were appropriate jests.  Never said he was a fag.  Still, wether you believe it or not(which you obviously do if you check his heath to heal him), he's a melee class.  Not a tank, but definitely a melee.<br>
<br>
Cool that you wanted to hang with your friend and cheer him up and all, would be a lot cooler if you managed to communicate with us on the part of you ditching us or atleast giving an explanation why instead of just disappearing.  Just running off with a hand group is sorta shady seeming with no explanation, obvious thoughts of 'oh god, another sell out' come to mind.  <br>

E-mailed you Meann, and gonna track ya down Bemeni.  <br>
<br>
Later folks... Oh, and Euda... All those times you called me Punky I thought it was cuz you loved me... *sniffs a tear*   Didn't know you couldn't remember my name.  Makes sens why you just call me love-muffin and Billy a lot I guess...<br>

I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of &quot;guys, I'm really sorry, but I need to go take care of kreig, something's wrong with him and I'm worried&quot;.  If you didn't see it, sorry, but I said it, and I have no reason to lie to you about it.  I'm the first person to admit that yes, it sucked that I left the group on such short notice.  But I did tell you that I was leaving, and as I was leaving you pulled, so I stuck with you until the mob was dead, even though I wasn't grouped.  Don't believe me?  Ask Katho, he's the chanter that was leading the group I went to.  After I disbanded from your group and he invited me, I sent him a tell saying that I wasn't going to join until you were finished with your fight and I knew that you were ok.  <br>
<br>
If you'd like I can go back to see if I was logging that day, and I can pull logs out, but I really don't think there's a point.  All this is is a he-said she-said thing, it's bullshit, and it's completely pointless.  Yeah, I left your group, and whether you saw it or not, I told you that I was leaving.  Not sure what the big deal is really, it's not like you really even need a cleric when all you're doing is clearing out the trash mobs in the front of KC, which is all we had been doing for an hour.<br>
<br>
And isn't it funny how you claim you never saw me say I was leaving the group, and I never saw the ranger say he was going afk?  Wierd, isn't it?<br>

No, you're a fucking dillusional moron.  The ranger, Girenz, my RL friend, went AFK to eat dinner.  He told the group he was going AFK to enhale some food really quick.  For someone with such sharp memory on everything else(including the changing story of you sent the group message after I pulled becoming you told the group then I pulled to keep you), it's funny how you're unsure of what you told the group, just know that you did.  Maybe we could ask your husband who was watching over your shoulder and marking every action down?  <br>
<br>
As for clearing trash for an hour, it was hardly that, my harm touch didn't pop back for another 30 minutes after I finished the mob you ditched me on and I used it on the first mob we fought.  Sorry if you can't count time in standard hours, but 60 minutes = hour.  Regardless, all camps were tooken aside from hands and you proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that you couldn't handle it.  Lets see, slow exp, or negative exp... Hmmmmmm... THIS ONE'S A THINKER.<br>
<br>
Oh, as for your 'we didn't train anyone' BS.  You trained 1 group on the way out, as well as everyone at the zone, and then the mobs returning to the camp took out another 2.  Yes, that's about 15 people that you set back.  Not sure if you care, seeing is you're a lying selfish greedy bitch, but that is what happened.<br>
<br>
Oh, you have plenty of reason to lie too.  You're reputation is being slammed in this post, and if you didn't care you wouldn't of bothered to reply.  <br>
<br>
Looking at all this new info on how incredibly thick your skull is, it's amazing you were able to keep me alive at the zone in...  Suppose you gotta get lucky in your life sometime, eh?<br>

I'm not saying that I don't believe you when you say there was a train -- just that I didn't see anyone.  You have my apology for the train.<br>
<br>
Punk - I never changed my story.  I sent the group message saying that I was leaving, and as I was disbanding, I saw your INC message.  Keniden is the one who said that you kept pulling to keep me in the group, not me.  Call me names, do whatever, it doesn't really matter to me.  I've explained to you my side of the story, and you've explained to me yours, and we just ain't gonna mesh here.  I'm sure that there are more constructive ways to resolve this situation, but if you feel that calling me a greedy selfish bitch and a liar and a delusional moron is the mature approach to this, then perhaps I have something to learn from you, because it was my understanding that two people talking rationally to each other was the best way to resolve conflict.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I apologize for leaving your group on such short notice.  And I apologize if you didn't see my message telling the group that I was leaving, because I promise you, I typed it, and I saw it pop up on my screen after I did.  And believe me when I say that I stayed on you and healed you after I left the group, or don't believe me, it doesn't really matter to me.<br>

My name is Grimmis and I was the lvl 50 Wiz that day in KC and I thought I should tell my side of the story.  I had been soloing in Skyfire for a few days and I was tired of the whole kill, then sit for 10 minutes rinse and repeat thing.  Anyway I wanted to do something social so I asked my guild if anyone had a spot for me in their group and Minah told me to come to KC.  So I port to DL and make the long walk to KC.<br>
<br>
When I first zone in I see Minah and her group fighting at the zone.  I get my invite and everything is going smoothly.  Next thing ya know the Ranger goes afk.  Ok well thats not so bad everything is still going smoothly.  Next thing ya know the Monk leaves.  Ok things are still going ok from my point of view, mobs are dead and we are still standing.  Next thing ya know, when Punk is off pulling* (note that I did not see a mob with him at this time) Minah says she is very sorry but has to leave the group, next thing ya know (not even half a second) Minah disbands.  Very next line is Punk's INC message /sigh.  At this point im feeling kinda pissed at Minah for acting like Zack did that day in Velks when he went afk with a 3 mob pull(yes I was also there for the whole Velks Fiasco /sigh)...but thats a whole nuther story.<br>
<br>
Ok here is where I got pissed off reading the posts<br>
<br>
1)  Punk, dude, don't bitch cause you used your HT, you did what you thought was necessary.  I probly do more damage in one nuke than you do in 3 HTs (don't flame me for this I know it is an exaggeration :P).  Even if the cleric left we still had a chanter that coulda mezzed the SINGLE mob like we had to the day we were grouped with Zack in Velks.  My point is, You used HT cause you thought it was the right thing to do then you complained that you did it.<br>
<br>
2)  Punk, and Minah, you both said you didn't see the messages.  Oh I didn't see you say you were leaving, or oh I didn't see the afk message.  Guys, I saw em both there should be no arguing about that.<br>
<br>
Now I did not come post this to stand up for a guildie, hell I didn't even know there was a post on here involving me...better yet I didn't even know there was a forum for our server till lastnight, I posted this cause I didn't think the whole story was said in the 2 one sided points of view.  This is gonna be my only post on this topic cause this is all I gotta say.  if you want to debate something I said with me, thats fine, send me a tell.<br>

Being the puller and socialization addict I am, I read everything that flies across my screen, especially group talk. <br>
<br>
Anyways, just meant to post about the HT thing.  Wasn't saying I wasted it, I just use it as a timer when I'm in groups.  I use it, then when it refreshes, 73 minutes has passed.  Usually use that to judge the rate the exp is coming in.  Was making note of it because Aaminah's handle on time sucked, or she just felt like exaggerating to strengthen her side.<br>
<br>
Heh, right now HT is 821, next level it's gonna be 1200-something.  Just a little FYI. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uagion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agion</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Patron</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/31/01 12:32:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Hehe, then HT catches a wizzie single nuke.... nice ! <p><font size=4 face=courier new color=green>Sisarius Balefyre <BR> <font size=4 face=courier new color=blue>Agion Hymntosser <BR><font size=4 face=courier new color=green>Allegiance of Faith<BR><font size=2 face=courier new color=yellow><I>     ...People who live in glass trailers should'nt throw 40s...
