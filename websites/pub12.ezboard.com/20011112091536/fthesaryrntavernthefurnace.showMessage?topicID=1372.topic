<br>
gotta find this stuff out, gut insticts here are not very accurate way to determin pregnacy, and if she is, there are options, abortion, i beleve that with in the first monthish there is a pill you can take that will abort the child.<br>
<br>
Next time be smart, at min use the colitus interuptus method, ie pull it out before you, well yeah, condoms are a god send in this day and age, if you are sexually active, there should never be a time when you dont have one close at hand.<br>

I doubt she is sure if she is pregnant.  In the first month there IS a pill she can take.. she should talk to her doc about getting it ASAP.  It's possible this will all come out to nothing.. if it does, have a talk with her about considering abortion/adoption options.<br>

Next time you wake up with a girl on you and no condom, push her off and just 69 it if you don't have a condom.. just say no to unsafe sex =\<br>

Yeah its hell at first, parents will get mad (maybe), but later on they'll be happy with the little bugger. You will be too (hopefully).  So after that you got a few options, adoption, or keep it. Keeping it being the better  of the two, in my opinion at least.  Also, go get a test, if its been only a week and a half it may be too early to come to any conclusions.  So get one to make sure, it's worth it.  Within all reason, she may not be and you could get off lucky.  Anyhow, best of luck to you.<br>

I got laid, had no condom (by choice-very stupid one).   <br>
<br>
my advice is to talk to her. tell her that you are concerned about the situation and that you would like to go get it checked out. there are a ton of free services to young adults that offer free testing and consultation... (my advice is a free womens clinic)<br>
<br>
the best thing you can do is try to resolve this with her, mainly by getting her to the clinic and getting a REAL test.<br>
and I mean rationally. the worst thing you can do is act like a dick to her and THEN find out that you are a father... you dont need to get married or nothin but at least stay friendly with her. (at least till you find out the outcome)<br>
<br>
thankfully for me SHE(myfirst) wasnt pregnant. I was able to go on with my life. (safer-sorta) funny how the stupid things you do in life sometimes just get stupider as you go on.... live and learn....<br>
<br>
(on a side note: go get tested yourself for STD's remember not having a condom? 1 said it was a stupid choice? well take it from me it IS!)<br>
<br>
hopefully she isnt tryin to scam you either but lets leave that for another conversation...<br>
<br>
just my advice (based on  true story)<br>

<br>
rofl seriously, if you think she might be pregnant, tell her to go with you to a clinic and they can do tests. The home tests aren't always that accurate. <br>
<br>
If she is, then well you have a couple of options. Your first option is abortion. I know alot of people are against it, but it's a viable option so long as you aren't condemned by your religion.<br>
<br>
Second option, is for her to have the kid and then give it up for adoption.<br>
<br>
3rd, marry the girl and take the kid as your own. This is by far the most unpopular choice as I am sure you all have plans set up for you to follow.<br>
<br>
4th option, see the first part of the post =P<br>

Most of the people who read these boards are pretty smart and well-travelled people irl, even though it's not always apparent.  So stfu and stop insulting us.  Some people don't have understanding, supportive parents, a religion to fall back on, or other various avenues open to them for such discussion.  Sad, but true.  Also, even if they did, this isn't a necessarily easy matter to discuss if true.  Sometimes the internet can be a medium of communication that lets one maintain their dignity and respect on the outside, while still having intelligent discussion online, especially for people who may have trouble hashing things out face to face.  Unhealthy in some ways perhaps, but infinitely better than keeping everything to oneself, if no other choice is available.<br>
<br>
Besides, calling on the advice of total and complete strangers can sometimes offer some insight that might have been lost or overlooked compared to discussing something with people you know who are, thus, biased. <p>Warlace Bloodmaker - 59th Myrmidon of Strike Force<BR>

As far as her being pregnant after just 1 1/2 weeks, I would question the validity of her remark.  Yes it could be true that she tested positive, but highly unlikely after that short of time.  I would also check to make sure that if she is pregnant that it is yours.  These days some women, not all, but some, will go out and get laid after knowing they are already pregnant from some other person.<br>

<br>
In my opinion if you don't want the child adoption is the best way out.  You have to go through 9 months of agony but that's better than 20 years.  There are a lot of childless couples out there  who do want children so you should have no problems finding a good home for the child. <p><a href="http://www.col.dk/"target="GoL"><img src="http://members.home.net/mike.lawrence2000/Signatures/kynneth_03.jpg" border="0">

step 1 ) ok so what you do is go to some kinda free clinic. i got a free one at my college so it makes this process easier. you go in and tell the doctor you need a morning after pill. every doctor will know what you are talking about. say you need em for your girl because shes too scared to come get em herself, or your sister or grandma or whatever. <br>
step 2) dont lose that mofo. because you dont want that clinic hassle again, do ya?<br>
step 3) Ahhh! Drunk girl in my bed! <br>
   substep 3a) mr.honest- baby, im not ready for a kid, this is a morning after pill. blah blah blah.<br>
   substep 3b) mr. liar- here take this tylenol.<br>
step 4) as soon as she leaves, get on your knees and PRAY!<br>
step 5) put a goddamn condom in your wallet<br>
<br>
this isnt like the abortion pill, its like birth control x5, it stops that shit while its still like cells or something. i dunno, im a psych major... <br>

Too bad you were not around when sorcerer/celesta/garbhad were born.<br>
1. Get a test done bro FAST.<br>
2. If she was riding you when you woke up then one of 2 things. A. She does it often  B. Your built like Tommy Lee.<br>
3. Make sure when she DOes get the test done that you are there so she cant come back and say yup its yours when it may not be.<br>
4.If it is yours you are stuck wih what ever she wants to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
5. MOST IMPORTANT ONE<br>
