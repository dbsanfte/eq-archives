Neither uof nor Isen, it appears.  So you are chiming in why?  Nevermind, I dont care what you think.<br>
<br>
Kidnee?  Do you play on Saryrn?  Didnt think so.  Dont ever fucking threaten me again.  You cant ruin my EQ career.  You may be able to cry yourself to sleep at night trying.  Did I suspect you would stay Isengard?  No.  Do I care what tag your once a month cameo appearance char wears?  Not really.<br>
<br>
Lumadil?  This is not about you.  Not at all.  Check origional post date.  Was long before you left.  Good luck in your endeavers.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, is Rafe the guild leader or not?  If so, Rafe, step the fuck forward man, I want your email so we might have a chat.  Feel free to find me in game, you know where to find me.<br>
<br>
Tact, I care not for tact in these dealings.  I will respond and react in the manner that uof officers do.<br>
<br>
Get me an email, and I wont have to bring it here.  No, Teff, I dont want to email you.  Unless, you are the guild leader.  Are you?<br>
<br>
Say hey to Raevan.  He ninja loot anything lately?  Oh, thats right... some of the uof officers are masters at looking away or blinking between loot messages.<br>
<br>
--Raevan has looted a (some belt that drops from lozidal).<br>
Aolani says to guild &quot;Belt dropped&quot;<br>
Raevan says to group &quot;map piece here, is no drop&quot;<br>
Aolani says to guild &quot;Map piece dropped&quot;<br>
Lazz says to guild &quot;send tells, who needs map piece for eyepatch of plunder&quot;<br>
Lazz says to guild &quot;congrats Raevan on map piece, last piece needed for eyepatch&quot;<br>
--Raevan loots map piece.<br>
--Raevan loots shell of lozidal.<br>
Rafekiel diverts eyes.<br>
Aolani diverts eyes.<br>
--Raevan loots club of ice ocean (or some item.. forget what)<br>
Aolani says to guild &quot;club dropped&quot;<br>
<br>
2 days later Raeven and Aolani are wearing guildtag uof, whom Rafekiel is the leader of.  Now, Aolani is made an officer.<br>
<br>
Later, we got some people to come around and say it was looted.  GM Ashlanne confirmed it was there.  Ashlanned told me that when she questioned Raevan he said he did not know he looted it.  Everyone else had excuses about 'battle spam'  (whoa... how much battle spam you get after the mob is DEAD?)  Raevan left guild uof (it the right thing to do when you try to hide and let things blow over) for a time being.  Do a guildstatus today.. he wears the uof tag.<br>
<br>
Question one.  How does the looter, and the group member caling loots to guild both miss the fact that a 125k pp item was looted?  Oh wait.. battle spam.<br>
<br>
Question two (provided the above was not battle spam, but a thoughtful, full group ninja looting incedent).  Was this a targeted attack against your guildmates at the time?  Or is this something you instill in officers of uof and have founded your very guild upon?<br>
<br>
My regrets, there are some people that left the guild before I could kick them the fuck out.<br>
<br>
Want my take on uof?  The officer core are corupt, they are thieves and liars.  They manipulate, create gossip and rumors to get their way.  There are also members, who I feel bad for being caught up in this.<br>
<br>
Teffeny, I like you.  I feel bad that you are caught up in all this.  I believe your character is above that of your peers and do NOT think you would lie, backstab or steal with no caring about those whom you call friend or guildmate.  Your peers, however, are hyenas, whining and squealling and vieing for position on what piece of meat they might grab from their family to satiate their own personal hunger.<br>
<br>
So, who is the uof guildleader?  Cuz I got a lot more to get off my chest.  I am told it is Rafekiel.  Where are you, coward.  I am calling you out, contact me or leave me an email to contact you.  I am sure you can come up with a hotmail account if you need to hide some more.<br>
<br>
Miniloc, I think uof is recruiting, they have need of your kind.<br>
