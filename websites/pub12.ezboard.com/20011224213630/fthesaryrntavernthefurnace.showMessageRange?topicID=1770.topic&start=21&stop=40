<br>
Am I the only one who picked up on this?  His entire whine, in multiple posts, is that skills are only 59+.  In game.. I count 17 that can be learned at 51 (including faster run!).  7 at 55, including mana regen!  Only 8 for my class are restricted to 59+.  This is far from all- ask any melee, an 8/32 ratio is very poor. <p>-Xen</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 748<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/12/01 10:30:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/geek/melanierooster/edbox.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> Sorry to get off topic...<br>

Class based skills, for perhaps the fifth time. Class based skills are what I'm talking about. And Punk, if you'll skip back, you'll see that I did indeed say that the hybrid spells are pretty decent, which you based your argument against me on entirely. I'm not knocking the spells. Read the posts people, before you criticize.<br>
<br>
Class based skills are 59 +, not Archetype, not General Skills.<br>
Hybrid spells are great and godly, hallelujah..again, I stressed the combat ability of the hybrids, mentioning only the Shadow Knight and the Paladin. <br>
<br>
As far as disagreeing with me, that's all fine and good. I have no problem with that. However, if your'e going to disagree, at least read the posts and comprehend what your eyes are filtering back to your brain before you start ranting.<br>
<br>
I'll lay it out again, for those of you that have trouble with simple reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
My Opinion, in this matter, is that the Advanced |Class Specific| Skills are lame for the fact that they aren't useable until level 59.<br>
I also stated, in My Opinion, that Shadow Knights and Paladins (using hybrids as a generalization) have poor damage output in the endgame, that being level 51+.<br>

Some of the abilities you gain make leveling a snap.  That's why you don't get them until a point in the game when you've already reached the max level.<br>
<br>
That and you don't deserve to have the cool abilities till you have reached your maximum potential.  I'd be damned if a 51 cleric got the 100% rez skill.<br>
<br>
Then there's this issue.  You get EXP from easier mobs.  Think how easily druids and wizards could gain alt exp points if the mobs in CS still conned blue and they quad kited them all day long.<br>
<br>
If a druid or wizard wants their class based points, it's going to come from killing tougher mobs.  Otherwise it would be too easy.<br>

Good thing my hard earned tax dollars are being well spent on education.<br>
<br>
There's no need for me to save face. I haven't lost any. I've kept my arguments intelligent, and reasonable, unlike yourself. <br>
Resorting to base name calling when someone disagrees with your point of view is acceptable in gradeschool, I imagine. <br>
I don't feel the need to resort to swearing at you and calling you names if you disagree with me. Or telling you to go and die.<br>
But if you feel that need, then that's fine with me. Perhaps discussing hybrids and skill advances shouldn't be the issue for you. You have your own issues to work out.<br>
<br>
And yes, Nandarie, I agree that some skills would be best reserved until level 59. I never said that before, in this post, but I believe you're right. Some, but not all Class Specific Skills. You mention a 51 cleric giving 100% res. True, shouldn't be allowable. But there are others, such as AE fear for necro's, or pet mastery, etc, that shouldn't require such a high level tag, IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 760<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/13/01 3:44:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/geek/melanierooster/edbox.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> My opinions have nothing to do with education.

<br>
this bitching from SK's is weird. why are all the sub 54's bitchin, and all the 60's jumpin for joy? Trust me, pre-54 you are a newbie. You havent seen anything. Shit, you can still do vox/naggy. You realize there is a 45 beastlord on the server RIGHT NOW? <br>

as for suffering the horrible xp penalty...<br>
who remembers the patch where cleric CH aggro was &quot;fixed&quot;? where 1 point healed equaled one point aggro? that sucked. still, what is bitchin about something that was changed gonna do?<br>
<br>
ok so, to sum up. i disagree. i got an sk twink. hes a thug, and i cant wait to get him some alt xp. hes 49 with i think 10 game days played. it was cool to hate verant a while ago. man everything they did, people would bitch. but verant is undergoin a change i think a lot of the old timers are seeing. they are makin shit FUN again. there is a reason to carry on. so all you yougens bashing shit that almost everyone agrees is good is gonna get you nowhere.<br>

Again, as I stated earlier, it was changed because people stood up and complained to Verant about how utterly stupid it was to have the Cleric die every time they cast CH.  Do you think Verant would have changed it if everyone would have just accepted it as status quo and went on about the game.  Hell no.  It was the thousands of emails, and posts that they received that got them to change it.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the abilities aren't cool, or that hybrids are in anyway underpowered.  I'm saying Paladins got 4 spells in SOL that are basically filler spells.  Someone dropped the ball at Verant, and I'm just pointing it out to them.<br>
<br>
How many of you wouldn't be complaining if you got a level 39 spell that did the SAME EXACT thing as your level 52 spell ?<br>
<br>
How many of you wouldn't be complaining if you got a new version of a spell that costs more mana, longer cast time, longer recast time, yet did less damage and whose effect was shorter ?<br>

Enchanter spell umbra - lvl 57 ac buff rare spell.  Gives the EXACT SAME ac as the lvl 49 one (vendor bought), lasts the same time, costs 5 more mana, and cannot be cast or people under 44 or so (unlike 49 one).  UMBRA SUCKS yet Verant won't fix it /cry <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 768<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/13/01 8:40:52 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/geek/melanierooster/edbox.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> Uh, Hareq, you're not the only paladin on the server ya know...  If they added a spell that does the same thing 13 levels earlier, it just means the kids growing up after you get it easier.  Now they don't have to wait until 52 for it.   Hell, explain this to me.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights get a spell at 22, vampiric embrace.<br>
With Luclin we get a spell at 39, Scream of Death.<br>
Both are a self buff that procs an HP tap at random.  Vampiric embrace does 28hp taps, scream of death does 25hp taps.  It's 17 levels higher, costs more mana..... But yet taps for less HP.<br>
<br>
Hows that for a filler spell?  <br>
<br>
anyways...<br>
<br>
There is a difference between bitching and arguing.  BITCHING is what was displayed through out this thread.  It's complaining about something to people that have no control over it with a tone of selfishness('but I was gonna go into the tashi station to pick up some power converters!').  Arguing to Verant about stuff with legitamit reasons behind something is positive.  Comparing 'why can't I use the skills now??' to 'we're balanced to be equal why do we suffer exp penalty' is absurd.  I think the originator of this thread shut up because he realized his bitchings were pointless and unpopular.  I'm a big fan of balance, sorry if you have trouble comprehending what that is whoever you are mr. whiny fuck 54 SK.<br>

First of all you need to choose and pick your battle. If we complain about anything and everything it will become noise. Just like that moron who started this thread he has no valid point. Skill are damm nice and they are achieve at the correct level.<br>
<br>
When the move for 2h damage was spearheaded by kreugen you didnt see me flame him or anyone for it. The xp penalty removal was a bad move imo, it cheapen the hybrid that did get to lvl 60 under it but it had a point since all class were supposed to be balanced at 60.<br>
<br>
But now to complain that hybrids just generally suck because they dont deal as much damage than monks and rogue? Skill suck because you need to be lvl 59 to get the class skill? Thats pure BS, this isnt a valid design issue like 2h damage or xp penalty for classes that are suppose to be balance with every other class.<br>
<br>
Also to just go about and say we got screwed in sol because a few spell arent that usefull. Hmmm hello do you even know how to play your class? We are more powerfull than ever, so what if 3 of our spells arent really usefull. <br>
<br>
And they are not useless like you said, the new stun allow you to keep a mob permenatly stunned, before that there was a small gap where the mob would wake up for a few second. Combine that and divine stun and do you have any idea how easy it will be to kill the queen in chardok? <br>
<br>
The new self regen spell in combination with mental clarity and the 7 level of regenation plus a fungi tunic will give you a very interesting hp regen, probably enough to solo low blue and light blue with minimal mana usage. <br>
<br>
The silence spell got nerfed, booo hoo you are actually one of those who tought it was ok for paladin to trivialize any dragon encounter? I knew you never had everything quite in order up there but damm i didnt think it was that bad. And fyi the state of the spell is in currently is TEMPORARY so stop whinning allready.<br>
<br>
In my experience hybrid that bitch about their class just dont have any clue how to play them. I never been part of a group who would have rather have a warrior or a ranger or any other class than me. But then again i dont spend my time bitching that my class suck and i just play it to my full ability, you ought to try that sometime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ugarbhad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garbhad</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Resident</span><br>  Posts: 3504<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/13/01 10:13:16 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advanced Skills</span><hr size=1> Nandarie, I have brought up that issue with Gordon.
