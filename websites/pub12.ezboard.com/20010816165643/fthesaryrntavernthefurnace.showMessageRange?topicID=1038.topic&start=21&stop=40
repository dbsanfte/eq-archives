I mean come on... 12pp per symbol they go through a LOT of 'dots on a raid.  Anyone who doesn't reimburse the cleric on a raid doesn't deserve to have clerics attend.  <br>
<br>
Even in pickup groups I try to make sure the group cleric gets reimbursed for his/her symbol costs.  Usually they get what they spend pluss a even split of the group loot.  To say that they're on their own on a raid is just assinine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Edit:<br>
However, keeping dropped items, no matter how uber (or not) they are is lame.   Especially when someone at the raid needs it.  If nobody needs it?  Then it's up to the raid leader if it can be handed out as a cash loot to a cleric.  But to just take a dropped item is kind of unreal.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><TABLE Width=650 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

As for paying for Rezes so what?  I pay 200, 500, and 800 pp willingly.  Sometimes more if its in a bad place.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it make a cleric twink on a second account and buy another PC.<br>
<br>
Rez yourself then.<br>

<br>
/auction WTS Somldering Brand, 500pp<br>
<br>
But, he refused.. i cant cut and past the converstation as the log file is much to big for my computer to open and handle... but i really dont care at this point.<br>
<br>
And and all are welcome on raids that i offer, even the 60 warrior who looted the other offered to give him hers.. but he rejected that as well.<br>
<br>
What is norrath coming to?  heh oh well... <br>
<br>
And yes Ridaas  i did talk to Bin in game when i read this post.. its pretty immature... if anything i figured that your guild leader would at least be able to help you understand the cost of Regents.<br>
<br>
I do apologize if you have never been on a raid where it requires more than one group to go in... this would usually be a two cleric thing but i was the only one.  I took a pally revive versus having an SK or Necro summon my corpse to the zone so that i could get the hell outta there.. <br>

I think that i have read enough on this issue but am gonna put in my two cents... First of all i think it was stated in the very first post that SFOL did a hell of a job at the raid and that Ridaas had a good time .. He didnt know what to expect and he didnt ask about the loot rules.. I do agree that clerics should get some reimbursement fer the regents in which they use to cast the symbols or whatever.. I have spent at least 1 k on regents and im a damn ranger.. Let it be known that i have seen 1 K in my bank account on this game one time in my history of the game... All the regents i have bought went to the clerics of not only my guild but others as well and half the time i wasnt even at the raid but knew my people were gonna be there... I am a Nice person and im not immature and im not selfish  i have sat back and watch this get blown way the #$@&amp; out of proportion.... He had a hard time with the fact that someoen who didnt get back with him after asking a damn question and also that he didnt get a chance to roll on an item... he wouldve given money fer regents if it had been asked of him.. He is one person and couldnt have used 700 pp of regents.. I will pay the friggen cost of the regents if that is the matter... He was not allowed the chance was the point...  He isnt saying give me the damn thing he was asking if he could get an opportunity to roll on somthing fairly!!!!<br>
<br>
I will speak highly of the people in my guild knowing that they abide by the same rules that i do otherwise i dont think they would be apart of the Rain Kings... I have definately heard enough of this friggen guild war shit though.. The [past is in the friggen past and Ridaas had no idea of anything that had happend between the SFOL and us .... For u to bring it up shows to me that u are still feeding into it...  We are good honest people that have always been need b4 greed... he shouldve asked about the raid loot rules or asked to give some pp to cover the cost of regents if this was a big issue as i see it was... As i said b4 i have spent much money on regents much money and i have prolly seen 2 symbols casted on me in this time.... I have never complained i have never asked fer buffs Nor do i ever frigen loot .... I am not selfish and i try and make sure everyone gets what they come for in a raid or an event whatever....  So i dont feel that i shouldve been callled immature or selfish of anything of that nature...  <br>
<br>
I will say that i have had some very negative dealings with SFOL and never said a damn word... They have been rude to me more than once and i let it slide not taking anything to heart.. I was not around in the past i know somewhat of the dealings but will not be accused of carrying on with that..<br>
<br>
This is a damn game people and some of us are taking it a lil too seriously.. It stresses me out at times.. I dont think that this was taken care of in the best mannor and i hope that it stops here.... If this is the deal then dont worry we wont have relations anymore ...   I am not against SFOL i do not agree with their politics at times or how i have been held accountable fer past events though and i dont appreciate the leader of the guild telling my husband to suck his own dick or fuck off or any of that either... That is another issue!!!  I have had some good dealing with u guys Aurelle and was hoping that i would have more but i cant deal with the past DROP IT!!!!! We are past that and if you arent u should be... Ill pay fer the damn cost of regents and i will continue to chip in for the cost of regents on any events i attend with other guilds and work out things with their clerics.. My people will do the same.. As fer loot we have always been fair... We ALWAYS and i strss ALWAYS give everyone an opportunity to loot items when they join us on raids ... WE random them off or we discuss it and figure out another way to deal with it ... I always make sure to thank them and let them know that we appreciate them coming or them asking us to join them... If there are issues then i ask if there is anything that u think we should have done better so that issue is cleared up and things run smoother on the next event.....  I think that anyone that has dealings with me can honestly say that i have done things fairly and if that is not the case then maybe they should send me a message in the game and talk to me about it... MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN... I am here not only to better MY GUILD but to better Our relations with our friends across Norrath... <br>
<br>
I wont let people call me names or look down on my people without a good reason though ... I do believe that this thing was blown way out of proportion and ya it shouldnt have gotten on this board maybe but it was more of a misunderstanding than anything else i do believe.....<br>
<br>
Thank You <br>

Ridaas said there were two groups there... it's been stated that peridots were 12pp a piece... if I remember correctly, symbols aren't a &quot;short&quot; buff... last near a half hour (I think)... how long were you there that it cost you 700 pp? And who all was getting symbols?<br>
<br>
Clerics should be reimbursed for regents though, and I try my best to make sure cash loot goes to clerics... but at a point, a line should be drawn... cleric_00 /tells groupleader &quot;I can really use that FBSS to cover regents while I've been camping here&quot;<br>

We were in there about 3-4 Hrs.  I personally only got a &quot;Good&quot; symbol casted on me once.  Our group was buffed to hell and back by the high level shammy in the main group and I have no idea if those cost anything but since we were assisting correctly I don't think any in my group even lost a bubble per fight of health 95% of the time.  We were kept up mainly with regrowth of the curve something.  Near the end I was told to stand infront of Aurelle as we were gonna do a &quot;Dash&quot; for some tunnel and I was given a Symbol then but we were all dead 20min later.  <br>
<br>
She never asked me to help her cover her costs before the raid or after.  She wanted me to cover the whole cost of the raid since I wanted a drop..  <br>
<br>
    As far as player economies go I think Monks have the shaft way worse the anyone  Only reason warriors are so rich is we let them loot all the heavy stuff uncontested.  Heck we even ask for /split to be turned off (Warriors love that I am sure) hehe fat bastards taking falling damage as they just run on a flat surface you know their pockets are stuffed!<br>

<br>
<br>
What excatly is this suppose to mean?  i did not ask anyone for payment on the regents as i knew the brand would cover it.<br>
<br>
As far as why who what when on regents.. there were Tons of deaths to our puller and i had to cast Symbol, plus a chanter and the other tanks... the only one i did not buffwas my self... my buffs are intended for other mot myself as far as i am concerned unless we are in Chardok or some other Really high risk dungen.<br>
<br>
I just dont get half of this.  My point is clerics do need to be reimbursed for regent costs period... Just cause a cleric is higher lvl doesnt mean that we re rich, i am sure that you seen the posts about clerics getting loots and what not.. <br>
<br>
But this matter is over... Ridaas as i said find me the damn brand is yours it not worth fighting over and its pretty sad that this has come to this.<br>
<br>
Bin, i only brought this to your attention as you a gulid leader...<br>
<br>
As far as loot being the whole point of a game.. heh i disagree... being able to beat the game and kill mobs that are 5-10 lvls ahead of you is what i think EQ is about... and the most important is the socialization... Some people have it some dont.<br>
<br>
Have fun in the land of Norrath...<br>
<br>
As far as the war between RK and SFoL... just seems everytime that we do something with a member of RK a blast comes up about it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the compliment about the raid... and umm i dunno what to say... guess i just give and and stop the bitching... tired of it i want the game to be fun again!<br>

LOL.<br>
<br>
The "raid":  Was some core SFOL, and some pickups (me included) who were asked to go to the hole to help with shaman epic.  If you expected loot of some kind, best to ask about that up front if that's a condition of your attendance.  "Most" of us were there for one thing only:  To help the shaman.  *IF* someone were to get a piece of loot out of it, then it's just a little bonus, but to flame the leader for keeping it for dots, instead of rolling on it.. sheesh.  /tell xxx I think we should roll on that FS Mace, I need another 1hb!<br>
<br>
Peridots:  Perhaps there are clerics out there, that overall, given a week's average loots, make a profit from getting items/gems/etc. in compensation for dots, but this was not one of those cases.  Nobody thought much about the brands, hell, the couple people who had them for a while were playing with them on the mobs.  I was in the "xp" group so to speak, and believe me, it was typical "Hole" loot:  i.e., CRAP.<br>
<br>
To come here and bash her over wanting to keep that for compensation is just not right.  Then later, after Galana offers one of them to you, to say give it away, I don't really need it?  What did you need it for then, to sell?<br>
<br>
The first deaths, including the cleric, were unfortunate.  The golems were 54 (con even to a 54), and while we had discussed the fact some would be unmezzable, things happened too fast.  By the time I "parked" one, cleric was down.  (thanks Aurelle for continuing to try, taking that revive so we could keep going)  Then later, the wipe-out was unfortunate, just way too many agro's (including buildings), and too many people had to leave after the recovery.<br>
<br>
The SFOL vs RK:  Please, let that die, that was a long time ago, and I can't possibly see why some people let what at the time was a simple difference of policy between some members with their guild (i.e., RK) which resulted in them leaving, seem like some permanant vendetta against them from those former members (who are now SFOL).  (Gar, sing us that Days of Our Lives tune please, because this is a RE-RUN)<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, Ridaas, the people that were there did their best to help someone out with no thought to being compensated for it, but at least all most people "wasted" was a little of their time, and hopefully, at the least, people also will chalk it up to some learned experiences for those that it was their first time in that far.  Cleric making their money by charging for rezzes.  LMAO.   /auction 56 cleric will rez you, only 200p for a limited time!  If the ONLY way a monk could get money, or break even (*shrug*, I guess ya need food/water and port money anyway), was to hang out and /auction 51 monk will pull for you, only 200p, send tell!  ...  how would you like it?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun, I'd be glad to go back any time.<br>

<br>
Personally I don't think Clerics should keep items needed by other people to cover their costs from raids like this. You were not clear about loot issues in advance and now it comes back to bite you in the ass.<br>
<br>
Clerics whine way too much heh but that has been covered in another thread already :)<br>

<br>
Difference between a group and a raid i am sure i dont have to go into details over this.<br>
<br>
This was an Epic raid and loot was not on my mind it was gettin to where we needed to be and getting what the shaman needed.  <br>
<br>
The brand was given to RK GL last night to give to whom ever needed it... as i said war/fighting needs to stop.<br>
<br>
When i am on a raid i expect to be reimbursed for peridots that i use.  Hell i even give peridots to the chanters and other clerics that are on the raid... but the point is... i was the only cleric there... and the cash loot was about 200pp total with selling the small shit that i got there.. and i used three stacks of peridots.<br>
<br>
I have seen everything from FS to an FBSS brought up... the Smoldering brand is not &quot;uber&quot; loot as far as i am concerned... thats petty... on the other hand i have declined a roll MANY time... well hell everytime i have been to Frenzy who ever needed it got it... because i am not greedy...<br>
<br>
but this is over... i no longer have the brand... i gave it to the guild that needed it for their lower characters i can always go back and get another if need one... i mean the Hole isnt that hard to get through... tho the Epic mobs are a bitch to get to... (Damn bank area)<br>
<br>
But... all in all i have learned one thing about this and that is to make sure everyone is happy on a raid... i mean the sad part is... heh i didnt realize that it was THAT big of a deal.<br>
<br>
But it wont stop me from offering raids... and it wont stop me from the expectations that i usually have and will keep.<br>
<br>
BUT! time to have fun in school!  be safe all and umm stop the blast on this subject, i believe that matters have been handled. <p><b><i>Aurelle Angelisque</i></b><br>

<br>
1) did aurelle get cash loot?<br>
2) did she get anything before this?<br>
3) did she mention needing help to pay off her peridots?<br>
<br>
basically, i can understand a smoldering brand, especially if nobody asked up front.. but if it were some loam armor.. yeah i'm sure clerics spend 4-5k on reagents normally ;)<br>
<br>
a_cleric01 /tells raidleader 'i could use those worked dragonhide boots to pay for *cough* peridots' <p>yep. i don't have a signature yet... but i assure you, when i do, it will be original, tasteful, ironic, perplexing, laughable, interesting, 'cool', eye-catching, droll, and otherwise funny. </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ushiningforcesoflight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shining Forces of Light</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/2/01 12:14:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.shiningforcesoflight.20m.com/Angel.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boy did I just get a rude awaking.</span><hr size=1> Again, heres the deal it was a SMOLDERING BRAND... not Loam not FBSS not any of that shit... Gah read the post ya damn chanter!<br>
<br>
but no seriously when i am on guild raids i do not usually worry about regents as i usually get the plat back in Cashe items... Dunno if you ever faught there.. BUT the one that that drops in &quot;cash&quot; loot that even gives ya 40ish pp is an Opal braclet... and that doesnt even sale for much... I made sure that any loot that was gotten was pretty much given to the enchanter and myself... needless to say it was NOT much.<br>
<br>
But all in all the Hole is a sorry ass place to raid and look for loot unless you are a caster... but again no caster gear dropped and umm *sigh* it sucked all the way around... Hoping that the next one will go better and we will get to this Kurn guy and keel him like hes supose to be keeled and get the hell outta there... then turn around and do it again and again...<br>
<br>
BUT no Aurelle does not loot class items... Brand = All/All thats why i kept it... Greedy mabbe... but hell regents are soooo damn expensive and clerics SHOULD NOT eat the cost!<br>
<br>
Armatus is a great guild... i hit a raid with them and usually turn about 150ish over what i spent in regents in cash loots... so i guess they spoiled tha hell outta me... <br>

<br>
First of all what does it matter what item it is? now it's Smoldering brand how uber or unuber it is, next will be ancient tarnished bp to sell for MQ because there was 7 hour raid in ToV.<br>
<br>
Also why do you have to pay clerics for their regeants. There was a reason Verant put regeants for certain classes for certain types of spell, and i'm pretty sure that paying all cleric expenses wasn't the original point.<br>
If clerics deserves reimbursment for regenants, why doesn't anybody pay warrior for taunting or maybe buying that fbss so he could kill the mob faster? After all cleric life w/o regenats isn't the most expensive (armor, etc) compared to other classes.<br>
<br>
Or take monks for example, the poor bastards :-) have only 14 stones for armor and everything before their stats will go down, and i'm pretty sure not a lot of monks are able to take cash / loot from the raid because of the weight restriction and I don't seem them asking for items and cash after the raid.<br>
<br>
And after all clerics can just go rez some people for cash anyway, and there are only 3 classes who can just make money like that, Wizzies, Druids and Clerics (pallies later on) that can just go out waste some mana and make some money w/o any danger. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=speeder>Speeder</A> at: 8/2/01 1:53:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ureiaku.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reiaku</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/2/01 5:24:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: umm</span><hr size=1> All i can recommend you all doing is, as soon as you enter the game.<br>

If you wanted compensation for your regeants... I am sure that folks would have come ready.. I am a firm believer in paying clerics for this... BUT with that being said... there is no reason to withold drops... no matter  how uber or unuber they are when there are folks who CAN USE. If it was something that no one could use...well that would be one thing. Aurelle hun I think ya should start asking folks for compensation instead of taking it upon yourself to decide that you want to keep drops after the fact. Unfortunately when you have other folks along on a raid, its not all about a single guild anymore... and If the loot rules are &quot;aurelle loots and the loots go toward regeants&quot; well then that needs to be stated ahead of time. that will make things alot clearer in the end.<br>
