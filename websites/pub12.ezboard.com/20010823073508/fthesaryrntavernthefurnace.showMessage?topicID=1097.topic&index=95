He changed the meaning of what a person said initially into something else, and then suggested this to the person he was arguing against, and just because what he said made sense, he treated that as a defeat of what his opponent had initially proposed. He talks in circles and doesnt much refute or affirm anything. He did have a knack for letting people think that they had been the ones to come to the &quot;right&quot; conclusion in the end, it was a nice work of chicanery. Or maybe I am just not bright enuf to catch it.<br>
<br>
On the method that God does not exist. I hope you are right for your sake, but I greatly pity this waste of time for you that is your life. With no faith to uphold you, regardless of what that faith is in, you are an empty entity. I am &quot;religious&quot; if you want to call it that, but I hate religion. Dogma is bullshit, and that is all religion is really about. But if you have come to argue against a persons faith, well... you are wasting your breath. <br>
<br>
The beauty of faith is that those of us who believe will not be swayed. And the belief that we have inherently gives the ideals we believe in substance and power. I will pit a man's faith against any science that you choose. You will never find a person who truly believes in what they are doing to consider themselves wrong. This is both a boon and a bane as concepts such as right and wrong are completely subjective. <br>
<br>
Some may call the bible fairy tales. I wont argue that point, as my personal belief was that it came about to teach a group of very ignorant, mostly illiterate people some very complex ideals and lessons. It has for the most part served its purpose. Within every religion you will find those who believe in the bible as a verbatim and literal thing, and those who believe that it was just as the parables Jesus used, meant to convey a deeper meaning than just the progression of words indicates. I dont believe that either is right or wrong, I believe that if it is right for you, then that is what is important. Dont worry about me, thankyouverymuch. I have a relationship with my higher power and we are getting on famously. <br>
<br>
I believe in God. I am not interested in whether it is the same God that others believe in. I dont think that my God is the only one out there that can offer salvation, or I should say that I dont believe that my God has only one face or form. Christianity can be a very ignorant thing, and I like to try to stay true to the &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged&quot; aspects. I will not pretend that others are going to hell because they dont worship the Christian God. In knowing limited things about the Muslims, Hindu's and other eastern religions, I cant see a single reason that God would try to damn these people when they lead peaceful and devoted lives of servitude to each other. <br>
<br>
Apart from that, how does one &quot;damn another person to Hell&quot; if that person has absolutely no concept of the place? If you dont believe in Hell, and you were sent there, would you not think that you had been reincarnated as a cricket? If you died and went to heaven, and had no concept of heaven, perhaps you would believe yourself to be one of the holy cows. <br>
<br>
I believe that heaven and hell are much more personal things than can be lumped into one description of brimstone and hellfire or pearly gates and eternal light.  Hell to me would be stuck in a repeat of certain life events that I wish I had never allowed to happen. Heaven would be stuck in a state of bliss from times in my life I am grateful for. <br>
<br>
At any rate, I am going to cease this dribble now, the post has exceeded what I had intended for it to be, but such is the way of things. <p>Maday Maday <BR>

LOKI<br>
<br>
Leaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely<br>
<br>
at 'Through the Looking Glass' - particularly 'The<br>
<br>
Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the<br>
<br>
metaphorical meaning?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
NUN<br>
<br>
I wasn't aware there was one.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
LOKI<br>
<br>
Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham<br>
<br>
that is organized religion. The Walrus - with his<br>
<br>
girth and good-nature - obviously refers to either<br>
<br>
the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable<br>
<br>
Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. This takes care<br>
<br>
of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an<br>
<br>
Obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was<br>
<br>
purportedly raised the son of a carpenter. He<br>
<br>
represents the Western religions. And in the poem,<br>
<br>
what do they do? They dupe all the oysters into<br>
<br>
following them. Then, when the oysters collective<br>
<br>
guard is down, the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck<br>
<br>
and devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I<br>
<br>
don't know what that says to you, but to me it<br>
<br>
says that following faiths based on these<br>
<br>
mythological figures insures the destruction of<br>
<br>
one's inner-being.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats popcorn and stares at... <br>
<br>
A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting loved ones, family. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
OC LOKI<br>
<br>
Organized religion destroys who we are or who we<br>
<br>
can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out<br>
<br>
of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes<br>
<br>
a finger at us from thousands of years ago and<br>
<br>
says &quot;No, no!&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him, kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
LOKI<br>
<br>
'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale?<br>
<br>
I think not.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
NUN<br>
<br>
(really dazed)<br>
<br>
I've... I've never really thought about it like<br>
<br>
that...<br>
<br>
(beat; shocked; off her cassock)<br>
<br>
What have I been doing with my life...?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
LOKI<br>
<br>
Don't look back. Just get out there and taste<br>
<br>
life.<br>
<br>
(off donation can)<br>
<br>
Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for<br>
<br>
the gullible - it's another way the church is<br>
<br>
trying to control you. You take that money you've<br>
<br>
been collecting for your parish reconstruction and<br>
<br>
go get yourself a nice piece of ass. You deserve<br>
<br>
it.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something. A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the still-transfixed Bartleby. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BARTLEBY<br>
<br>
(looking OC)<br>
<br>
Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a<br>
<br>
fact that there is a God. You've been in his<br>
<br>
presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I<br>
<br>
just heard you claim to be an atheist.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
LOKI<br>
<br>
C'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that<br>
<br>
shit I was telling her. I just like to fuck with<br>
<br>
the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head<br>
<br>
stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the<br>
<br>
Just again. But oh. will she have a bunch to<br>
<br>
confess.<br>
