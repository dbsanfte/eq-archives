My skills and my job are advocating for them, not judging them... there are other avenues for that.<br>
<br>
As far as your remark that you minored in Law, I find that hard to beleive.  Actually it is quite impossible.  Why you ask? Simpy because  there is no such thing as a recognized Pre-law degree in this country and there is no such thing as a Law minor. Now, if some correspondence school offers some un-accredited &quot;law minor&quot;, let me know what school it is.<br>
<br>
There are of course some elementary and topical law classes offered in undergraduate schools, but they are typically offered through the Philosophy department or History department.  Folks who want to be lawyers just have to go to a 4 year degree program, take the LSAT and apply to law schools.  At the continuing decline of law schools in this country, just about anyone can get into some law school.<br>
<br>
Also, there is no such thing as a &quot;Corporate Lawyer.&quot;  There are many lawyers that work for corporations as in house counsel, and outside lawyers that service the various needs of corporations though. Basically, if you have a client that is a Corporation, you do some corporate work.<br>
<br>
Anyway, of course you knew that I was joking about my grandfather.  Have to get up pretty early to fool old Garbhad I guess.  Still, you swallowed hook line and sinker.  Yet, if you knew you were biting at a loss leader, and made your foolish posts anyway, that in itself speaks tremendous amounts as to your personae.<br>
<br>
You now have made three or more posts talking about another area you wish to comment on -- Law and Lawyers.  In short, the limited statements that you have already made are just plain false, so maybe when it comes to the legal profession, and what I may or may not do, you should do what is in your own best interests. STAY IN THE SHALLOW END OF THE POOL.  And make it a small small pool ... like your gene pool.  It will be easier that way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as your posts about the actual game, which are less and less and less now, they occassionally tend to show some marginal value.  Sticking to the game might be a bit more your cup of tea.  Well, that is if you wish to post a post with substance.<br>
<br>
As far as arguments, your statement that I cannot refuse to get into one is quite humorous.  I would say that you argue with anything and everything on these boards. But then I would be making a false statement. You see Garbhad, you are incapable of argument -- the simple concept of argument is too elusive to you.  So as such, it cannot be logically said that any post responding to yours is argument.  <br>
<br>
But hey, that will certainly not stop you from yet another shot at making a defensive, meritless post.  Dont forget, one part contradiction to every two parts of inflammatory garbage.  Then finish it off with a little self-buttressing and pontification.<br>
