I'm sure many people that were kind enough to donate their time to try and help me drop Naggy last night have ideas about where we goofed on both attempts.<br>
<br>
Since I spent most of the time zoning (being banished and gating back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), I did not see a lot of what went down. However, there are a few things I did notice, realize, or deduce via the outcome...<br>
<br>
1. No 52- Enchanter. That's right, not a single Enchanter was there that was 52 or under. What's that mean? No Tashania. As we all know, this has a trickle down affect much like an avalanche. This also means we had no Rune, or at least, no chain runing.<br>
<br>
2. No Slow. With no Enchanter to Tash, Shamans could not get a slow to stick. Non-slowed Nagafen makes frozen baby Belmonte cry.<br>
<br>
3. Mis-timed healing. I do want to thank all the clerics that attended, and I don't want to put anyone on the defensive, but I received several tells last night from melee that said that they were not getting heals on time, or at all. We can't kill Nagafen if all our melees are dead. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
4. Mis-used healing. This is my fault. After thinking about it last night - I didn't get much sleep last night - I asked the group Clerics to use the wrong heal. The group clerics should have stuck to Word of Healing, casting as necessary (read: not necessarily spamming). It's all well and good that the clerics kept their groups main tank alive, but by doing that, sacrificed the remaining 5 members, including themselves. A group heal every Dragon Roar or two woulda kept <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> everyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> alive... not just the group's main tank.<br>
<br>
5. Buffing. This seems to be the proverbial thorn in a raid leader's side. Buffing can get confused so badly that they start wearing off. People start complaining that buffs are fading/faded, adding to the mess and confusion. It's a fun experience! /sarc off. Next time, I will have the buffing organized and in an order that will expedite the process and keep people happy.<br>
<br>
6. Resist Gear. I think a lot of people didn't have sufficient FR/MR gear, thus took a heap of AoE damage and were Feared a lot. For everyone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> except</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the MA and maybe SA, the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> important stats for you are your HPs, FR, and MR. AC means squat, WIS and INT, to an extent, mean squat. You can't melee/nuke/heal if you're dead (from the AoE).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> --WHAT WENT RIGHT--</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. The experiment was a complete success. A 53+ Cleric can in fact CHeal the MA, get banished to LS and gate back to the buff room to rinse and repeat as necessary!<br>
<br>
2. /sigh. I don't think there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a 2. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even though it is considered &quot;outdated&quot; with the new /targetgroupbuff switch, I'm thinking maybe camping to chat isn't such a bad idea. There are still a lot of necessary buffs that have no group equivalent, which just means more time and mana (time and mana being fairly synonymous in this respect).<br>
<br>
Throwing buffs on groups one at a time, and sending them to chat when finished would make sure that all groups had all buffs, which wouldn't fade out 5 seconds before engaging Nagafen.<br>
<br>

I just want to again thank <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all of you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who helped last night.

Not that I think they're wrong, just wonder why things are done that way:<br>
<br>
Waves -- What causes the need for players to attack in waves?  I understand trying to get aggro on one person, but having people attack seperately seems like it would slow down the fight.<br>
<br>
Nuking -- Would there be any problem caused to the raid if wizzies just went in shooting, get summoned and killed, and pop up shooting again?  Assuming they were willing to take one for the team?<br>
<br>
Shaman -- Someone had said that a high level slow can be landed before banishment.  Anyone try this?<br>

Be sure to tell your Healers to make hotkeys:<br>
/target MA<br>
/target SA<br>
/target 3a<br>
/target 4a<br>
and that dshould be it. Assign which clerics to which tanks.<br>
Nobody else should get any heals.<br>
Have your druids start casting spam heal right before aggro and dont stop through whole fight. Have the clerics start CHEAL immediately and do not stop threough whole fight. Necro to manna dump to clerics. Nobody else should be getting healed at all. If even 2 of those tanks live, you will win period.  <p>~Avezes Oscuridad

- camp outs are always a good idea on naggy/vox runs.<br>
<br>
- healers, work together by targeting Nagafen and /assisting him to see who he is hitting. Keeping that person alive should be your first priority.

Waves:<br>
For the most part, waves are done for aggro management, so the right people have aggro, and the wrong people don't. I think that's pretty much it. There's also a trade-off with damage taken to damage done, not sure if it's 'equal' or lopsided, haven't been to enough Naggy raids to test it.<br>
 <br>
Nuking<br>
Caster's are extremely low on HPs. Were they to go in a blazing from the get go, get summoned, and die...their chances of getting back in and landing another nuke are slim to none. Considering they'd be going back in naked (read: no AC, no WIS/INT, no resists) the chances are they'd be dead before their DragonNuke01 got off.<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
Karaln tried to slow Nagafen, but since there was no Tash or Malo on Naggy, it didnt stick.<br>
<br>
-Avezes-<br>
Only problem with just healing those 4 tanks.. is all the rest die, which = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> far</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> less damage.<br>
<br>
The 52- group Clerics should only be healing AoE damage, since the banish Clerics will be CHealing the MA, who should have aggro the entire time and be the only one taking melee damage.<br>
<br>
Since AoE damage should hit all the group members fairly equally - barring resists n such - it makes more sense to use an AoE heal.<br>
<br>
Dragon Roar does 500 damage.<br>
Word of Healing does 500-600 healing.<br>
<br>
Tit for tat, ya know?<br>
<br>
-Sielle- <br>
Yes, that was a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MAJOR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> issue with both of last night's attempts.<br>
<br>
Attempt 1, Sielle kept getting banished for runing/hasting/claritying people who apparently, were still friends with Nagafen.<br>
<br>
Attempt 2, Deniko also kept getting banished. This was slightly less of a pain for Deni, since he bound himself in the buff room. Regardless, I think he was banished about 8 times before we gave up on it and made our last charge on Nagafen.<br>
<br>
This is my fault, the first time this happened while buffing for the two attempts, I should have had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> everyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camp out and come back to clear aggro. <p><i>

<br>
I have never ran a Naggy raid, and only been on one.. but killed a few other dragons, so going by them. <br>
1. Have someone aggro Naggy and run out the door (This will cause Naggy to run around his lair going nuts)<br>
2. Have everyone up the first set of stairs from the pit waiting for engage. <br>
3. Main tank runs up the 2nd set of steps and sits at naggy's door waiting for Naggy to make the lap to the door. <br>
4. When Naggy is inc, he engages and starts getting healed. (Key is to keep him alive)<br>
5. After 3-4 seconds have the rest of the raid charge, but keep him at the door.<br>
<br>
 Why door?  AE does not go around walls inside, so when you have 2 healers per group, they only have to heal 4 people instead of 6 (themselves) Almost doubling your chance to win.   It also allows wizzies to hide, wait for AE, run around corner, nuke, and hide again. Sometimes never getting hit by AE. <br>
<br>
 To speed up buffs, get rid of those Shammie buffs, except the HP ones.  Tanks should only get Focus (or altuna?), and STA from SHammies, the rest are just fluff and make buffing longer and more confusing. If Shammie is bored, he can toss the fluff buffs on the first 2 tanks, but no need to get all melee with that.<br>
<br>
 Buffing everything else is really hard to get right on Naggy raids as far as time goes. Hell, guilds who raid together all the time will always have issues with buffing, so I cant' really help ya there except just say, form groups, then buff. Group buffs with /target make it much easier.  Small tips:<br>
1. Have buffers /shout send me /tell for xxx buff - Melee (or caster) only. <br>
2. When buffers start getting lom, make sure necros and mages are feeding them. <br>
3. For group buffs (circles), make sure only group leaders send druids /tells for them.  Nothing, I mean *nothing* is more annoying to a buffer to get a /tell for a group buff from 2 different people in the same group. <br>
<br>

Is killing Nag worth the risk? Maybe for the clerics on Rage rotation but I doubt it is to those there just to kill Nag.<br>

<br>
&gt;1. No 52- Enchanter. That's right, not a single Enchanter &gt;was there that was 52 or under. What's that mean? No &gt;Tashania. As we all know, this has a trickle down affect &gt;much like an avalanche. This also means we had no Rune, or &gt;at least, no chain runing.<br>
<br>
On most of the Vox/Naggy raids I've been on (hereafter referred to as dragon raids), The dragon has not been slowed. It's WONDERFUL if it happens, but it's quite rare. If you're counting on it, you're in trouble. The dragon usually resists every cast, Tashania or no Tashania. I don't know if I've ever seen anyone bother chain-runing, but it certainly couldn't hurt. What else is the sacrificial enchanter going to do after Tash anyway?<br>
<br>
&gt;2. No Slow. With no Enchanter to Tash, Shamans could not &gt;get a slow to stick. Non-slowed Nagafen makes frozen baby &gt;Belmonte cry.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, the dragons usually resist all the slows, Tash or no Tash. It's great if you can slow him - if he's slowed and you still lose your raid had SERIOUS issues. But usually he will NOT be slowed no matter what. So don't make it a critical part of your strategy. <br>
<br>
&gt;3. Mis-timed healing. I do want to thank all the clerics that &gt;attended, and I don't want to put anyone on the defensive, &gt;but I received several tells last night from melee that said &gt;that they were not getting heals on time, or at all. We can't &gt;kill Nagafen if all our melees are dead.  <br>
<br>
That can certainly be a problem. CH in particular is often too slow if someone has serious aggro. But it could be much more a resist gear issue than a healing timing issue. If the cleric is feared he's not healing. If the melee is sucking up full damage from every AE he's not WORTH healing - the cleric doesn't have enough mana if resists are too low. It's hard to get people with good resist gear since they're mostly inexperienced, but try to emphasize it as much as you can. <br>
<br>
&gt;4. Mis-used healing. This is my fault. After thinking about it &gt;last night - I didn't get much sleep last night - I asked the &gt;group Clerics to use the wrong heal. The group clerics &gt;should have stuck to Word of Healing, casting as necessary &gt;(read: not necessarily spamming). It's all well and good that &gt;the clerics kept their groups main tank alive, but by doing &gt;that, sacrificed the remaining 5 members, including &gt;themselves. A group heal every Dragon Roar or two woulda &gt;kept everyone alive... not just the group's main tank.<br>
<br>
You can try it that way if you want, but it's very risky. The cleric MUST have excellent resist gear to use that strategy - or he's going to be feared or dead himself. Secondly, it generates WAY more aggro than tossing around Celestial Healing. Most of the clerics I've seen try to use group heals, especially repeated casts of them, ended up tanking (ie dead). Again it could be a level /resist gear issue - a 50-52 melee with adequate resists should only need a Celestial healing or two to survive the first, unless they end up tanking. Bards help a lot with making that happen. <br>
<br>
&gt;5. Buffing. This seems to be the proverbial thorn in a raid &gt;leader's side. Buffing can get confused so badly that they &gt;start wearing off. People start complaining that buffs are &gt;fading/faded, adding to the mess and confusion. It's a fun &gt;experience! /sarc off. Next time, I will have the buffing &gt;organized and in an order that will expedite the process and &gt;keep people happy.<br>
<br>
God I hated buffing for those things. I'd definitely have people camp to chat when they are fully buffed - why not? Try to get buffing as organized as possible, and done as fast as possible. But if people are going to be just sitting around waiting for buffing to finish, they can do it in chat as easily as in the buff hall - and without their buff timers running. <br>
<br>
&gt;6. Resist Gear. I think a lot of people didn't have sufficient &gt;FR/MR gear, thus took a heap of AoE damage and were &gt;Feared a lot. For everyone except the MA and maybe SA, &gt;the only important stats for you are your HPs, FR, and MR. &gt;AC means squat, WIS and INT, to an extent, mean squat. &gt;You can't melee/nuke/heal if you're dead (from the AoE).<br>
<br>
Resists are certainly critical. It's so hard to get good resist gear on everyone when you're scrambling for people in the first place. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;--WHAT WENT RIGHT--<br>
&gt;1. The experiment was a complete success. A 53+ Cleric can &gt;in fact CHeal the MA, get banished to LS and gate back to &gt;the buff room to rinse and repeat as necessary!<br>
<br>
How long does this take? If there's time to do it more than once or maybe twice I suspect the raid is taking too long and won't win. <br>
<br>
&gt;--BATTLE--<br>
&gt;1. MA charges in on Nagafen, soloing him in his lair.<br>
&gt;2. 53+ Cleric01 Complete heals MA (is banished to &gt;Lavastorm, gates back to buff room)<br>
&gt;3. Tashania on Nagafen. (Enchanters then chain Rune MA)<br>
&gt;4. Groups 1 and 2 engage Nagafen.<br>
&gt;5. Slow on Nagafen.<br>
&gt;6. 53+ Cleric02 Complete heals MA (is banished to &gt;Lavastorm, gates back to buff room)<br>
&gt;7. Groups 3 and 4 engage Nagafen<br>
&gt;8. 53+ Cleric03 Complete Heals MA (is banished to &gt;Lavastorm, gates back to buff room)<br>
&gt;9. Repeat 53+ Cleric rotation as necessary.<br>
&gt;10. At &quot;Lord&quot;, casters engage and burn Nagafen down.<br>
<br>
Why so many waves? I've seen many raid leaders have the melee groups go in in waves like that. But other than only sending in one group for the initial rush to position the dragon and suck up the first AE, why hold the melee's back? What is actually gained? <br>
<br>
Also, I'd send in the casters a lot sooner than &quot;Lord&quot;. A good wizard can do several thousand damage with Ice Comet - the tanks need to get some solid aggro first, but as soon as they do, unleash any 49+ wizards you have. I remember one Naggy raid Tuvus did 5k+ damage (L 51 wiz) - If you wait until &quot;Lord&quot;, Naggy only has that many hp left before you even call for the nukes. <br>
<br>
&gt;--HEALING--<br>
&gt;1. 53+ Clerics CHeal MA (rotation).<br>
&gt;2. 52- Group Clerics Group Heal (Word of Healing) as &gt;necessary.<br>
<br>
I realize it's natural for you to focus on what a 53+ cleric can do to help, but, honestly, if you're needed the raid has serious problems. You will be zoning in and out, only get off a couple heals - and you won't be there when one is really needed. <br>
<br>
I like your suggested group makeups, with one suggestion: If you have enough clerics to at ALL be able to manage it, I'd suggest a group like this:<br>
<br>
3 L 50-52 warriors, L 50-52 bard, two L 50-52 clerics. If these people all have good resists (pick ones who do), the group is extremely tough. At those levels, the warriors don't even have to max out on resist gear, since the bard will likely be there for resists (they should still have at least some of the better resist gear on - froggy crowns and such). The beauty of this group is that the dragon has an extremely hard time killing anyone in the group - a cleric with aggro can DA or be healed by the other cleric, one can heal the group while the other heals the main tank. I've been in groups like this on dragon raids where the dragon really couldn't kill anyone in the group, even if it wasn't slowed. Leave a caster or misc melee group without a cleric to form a group like this, if you have to. If they have bad resist gear they're not worth a cleric anyway. <br>
<br>
I hope there's something you find useful in that mess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

For the most part, waves are done for aggro management, so the right people have aggro, and the wrong people don't. I think that's pretty much it. There's also a trade-off with damage taken to damage done, not sure if it's 'equal' or lopsided, haven't been to enough Naggy raids to test it.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm, it might be worth something for the aggro management reason, but it most definitely is NOT as far as a damage done/taken tradeoff. Think about it this way: what's a better tradeoff: 12 people attacking Nag, or 24? With 12, you have 12 hitting him, and twelve taking his AE plus one taking his melee. With 24, you have 24 hitting him, with 24 taking his AE and one taking his melee. <br>
<br>
More people give you the advantage - more people are doing damage to him, but he's still only doing his melee damage to one person. Relatively speaking, Naggy is doing AE + melee/(number of people fighting him) in average damage to each person. The more people in the fight, the less damage he is doing compared to the damage he is taking. If not, get rid of some of the low level/low resist people who don't belong in the fight. Or just don't heal them and be glad of the 500 or so damage they do before getting killed. <br>

I'm pretty sure it applies to any resistable spell. Tash isn't resistable, so I doubt the enchanter would have to be in melee range. But the slow likely has to be from melee range. If in doubt, have a shaman conduct some tests on the fire giants on the way in. I think you also have to be in melee range to cast on them? If the shaman can't slow them from across the room, it's unlikely he can do it to Naggy either. <br>

There are 100000 ways to kill naggy, all of them work, any combination of the many good ideas above will kill naggy BUT 22 people just not gona happen. Some more suport, 4 wiz 5 tanks and 4 rogs one more healer? Dead dragon.<br>
<br>
On the last attempt I went to, I think we had 34 people and lost by 1K hp, any one nuker/rog/melee/cleric we would have won. Sounds like you lost a battle not from lack of thought or skill, just lack of #'s. With 70 people, no skill needed, zerg em. With 36 you need skills as example yours, and Catmanders, but you still need 36. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23280" target="_blank">

I was tied up last night but next attempt I will try to get my shamen there to lend hand with buffs, Health and kragg are mana expensive but offer a nice increase of hp.  And as I have done on a vox raid if I have a bard in the group and a necro or 2 to feed me I can usually buff the whole raid uncluding none melee.<br>
<br>
Tips<br>
<br>
Lvl is greater than resists but still unbuffed aim for a min 80 fire 80 magic.  Preferably 100 + in each unbuffed.<br>
<br>
In buffing, get the list set out previous and have buffing lines.  If you forsee having buffs fade before they are all finished have ppl camp out when fully buffed.  If you are having ppl camp out when buffed, buff them on a group by group basis and make sure they remember who is in whos group.<br>

<br>
I would say 3 50+ echanters minimum.  Though I have seen it lead sucessfull with less several times. <p>Tilian Down <BR>

The addition of 53+ clerics to the mix was...in theory...a fail safe. It didnt work out that way unfortunately.<br>
<br>
On the two dragon raids I was on when 52- (1 Vox, 1 Nagafen), I was cleric in group 1. It was my job to CHeal the MA. The second I did, bam! summoned and wiped out in short order.<br>
<br>
The addition of the 53+ clerics is to get Cheals on the MA, and not sacrifice any clerics that can actually engage him. I thought this alone, 3 un-touchable Cheals, would help the MA gain/maintain aggro, and keep the raid clerics alive. I think the AoE group heals will work since, by the time they are cast, the MA has built up sufficient hate (he will have soloed Nagafen for a good 10-15 seconds) for Nagafen to disregard anyone else.<br>
<br>
For some unknown reason(s), it didn't work out as planned. It had Careden, Cresendia, and myself stupified as to how and why it wasn't working like a charm. /sigh<br>
<br>
That 10-step process was just an initial thought running through my head.. I'm sure I'll tweak and condense it. Maybe like...<br>
<br>
1. MA charges in on Nagafen, soloing him in his lair.<br>
2. 53+ Cleric01 Complete heals MA (is banished to Lavastorm, gates back to buff room)<br>
3. Tashania on Nagafen. (Enchanters then chain Rune MA)<br>
4. Slow Nagafen<br>
5. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 (melee) engage Nagafen.<br>
6. Repeat 53+ Cleric rotation as necessary.<br>
7. At &quot;Lord Na&quot; (that's about 50% neh?), casters engage and burn Nagafen down.<br>
<br>
This would suck it down to three waves (MA for intitial aggro, melees, casters)... might take some of the confusion out.<br>

We had 3 rogues (51, 49, 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  on the first attempt, 2 (49, 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  on the second. Alas, uber BS damage did not prevail this day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Give or take I recall the raid had (between the two, some left after first, some showed up for second):<br>
2 bards<br>
4 clerics<br>
3 druids<br>
0 enchanters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
1 mage<br>
2 monks<br>
2 paladins<br>
2 rangers<br>
3 rogues<br>
0 shadow knights<br>
2 shamen<br>
6 warriors<br>
3 wizards<br>
<br>
I'm off by (missing) a few, cause we had 5 full groups both pulls, with about 5 substitutions between them.<br>
<br>
On top of that, for buffing it had:<br>
60 cleric (both attempts)<br>
55 cleric (second)<br>
54 cleric (both)<br>
57 enchanter (first)<br>
60 enchanter (second)<br>
60 shaman (first)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately.. I cannot be there tonight to help with Nagafen, I am going out of town for the holidays. Someone else (avezes? dracsoul?) please take this PoS down tonight. And when he's about to hit the dirt, make him call me Daddy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><i>

Next my sexy De darling.. give me a tell... I was just camping a dumb dagger... could have easily come down to help buff up and even tried to land a slow on Ole Naggy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But seriously... when it come to buffing... have each group that has been finished being buffed camp out to a room! Then when everyone is done.. have them come back in for the fight. That way the buffs are still fresh til they die! Ok... Im not entirely sure that was clear so Ill list what was done on the last Naggy raid I was a participant. (Twas a successfull raid too!)<br>
<br>
1) Groups made in buff room<br>
<br>
2) Buffers placed in separate locations for buffing of groups.<br>
<br>
3) Call in Group #1 for buffs i.e. they go to shaman(s) first...<br>
<br>
When they are done getting them...<br>
<br>
4) Call in Group #2 for buffs from first buffer and send Group #1 to second buffer i.e. Cleric(s) &amp;/or Druid(s)<br>
<br>
When they are done...<br>
<br>
5) Call in Group #3 for buff from first buffer Group #2 goes to 2nd buffer Group #1 goes to 3rd buffer i.e. mage(s) &amp;/or echanter(s)<br>
<br>
Now you just wash/rinse/repeat for the remaining groups til everyone that needs to be buffed is done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
OH and once EACH group is done being buffed HAVE THEM CAMP and go to a chat room to wait for fight. This way buffs are fresh still everyone has them and the fight can have a better chance of working right!<br>
