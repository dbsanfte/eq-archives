By the way, you're a fucking idiot.  You honestly have the intelligence of an 11 year old, and with every post you prove it moreso.  Believe it or not, that many spelling mistakes, not typos, do make you look like a complete fool.<br>
<br>
There was a lot more in my reply than just pointing out your spelling mistakes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see everyone on this board knows fully well that I can not spell. But you see there is a great many that have the inteligence(sorry i miss spelled it) to understand my intent.&quot;<br>
<br>
The people who talk to your friends, the sign language chimps, also have the intelligence to understand their intent.<br>

<br>
You two are the first people ever that couldn't figure out that no self-respecting raghead would name themselves ygyptian camelrider.  Seriously, would someone who named their character that be offended by calling dunecrawlers names? *note the use of offensive names towards these people, and it's not the first time I've used them on this thread*<br>
<br>
As for not knowing BR is dead, long dead, etc etc... is that what you think my motivation for posting here is?  I obviously know BR is gone, I'm not the one posting that I still hate them.  Bygzalf, you're an idiot.  The anti arab stuff is remotely humorous though, and considering the amount of dotheads that live around here I may use your material.  <br>
<br>
Back to THE POINT, which get's so easily lost when people just blurt random garbage out, or don't read anything, see BR in a post, and say BR IS DEAD MAN, THEY'RE DEAD IN WAYS THAT THEY'RE DEAD.  THEY'RE JUST REALLY DEAD.  Yes, that's bygzalf's post paraphrased, minus his baseless shots at me because of my former eq character's name.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;IMPORTANT PARAGRAPH, possibly the first one since page 1&gt;&gt;<br>
I've never given an old innocent couple the finger.  I do completely random things, but usually not like that.  I understand that this is a flame board, that doesn't mean it has to be a board of retardedness.  Somehow not letting BR go away got turned on me, by an idiot who thinks he's funny (other than kneesnapa).  I apologize for spelling your name incorrectly, I was thinking of &quot;kneesnapper&quot; which was the cause of my mistake.  Perhaps trying to hold yourself to a standard is a fault.  Maybe I should purposely insert errors into what I write, so I can fit in.  I'm just an elitest who got a 1600 on my SAT (Bygzalf that's not really true, don't respond to something like that again) and all I want to do is go around berating EVERYONE, because EVERYONE is less intelligent than me!  <br>
<br>
Dude, don't read into things that aren't there.  I responded in a really sarcastic way because someone actually keeping a list of people they hate bothers me.  It bothered me enough to post my dislike for it.  Sure, I enjoyed being in BR, and there a lot of people on that list who I know.  Here's what this shit has turned into, from not much.<br>
<br>
I posted a small insult, preceeded by the word &quot;ph33r.&quot;  How can you take that seriously, I mean even you wouldn't legitimately type that.  You responded with something about fuckstarting my skull (I honestly don't know what that means... unless it's just another way to say skullfucking), making fun of dotheads, telling me to commit suicide, then more dothead bashing.  None of this bothered me... however, being called a stupid monkey and such by someone typing in the manner which you do.  I followed this up by dissecting your post, pointing out spelling errors, explaining I'm not a dothead (which is obvious), and most of all LOOKING AT THE LOGIC OF THE POST.  I followed this with a statement that I'm NOT an elitest and more flaming.  You ask if my only comeback is your spelling.  Honestly, read the post again, very little of it had to do with spelling.  Call me a tool, etc.  I point that out, and mock your intelligence.  Byzgalf proves his idiocy at this point (kneesnapa, I admit you have far better reading comprehension than him, for sure).  Once again, in your mind somehow I am only out to correct your spelling.  Also someone below me (by the way, I already said I hold no one below me, only certain individuals who prove it) will kick the crap out of me, or something to that effect.  I start getting irritated and basically BEG you to actually read the post, and continue with name calling.  You explain that indeed you are a spontaneous (that's the good way of saying it, I'm making an effort) individual.  I can respect that.  <br>
<br>
Just wanted to point out how easily stupid things just keep going in some unknown completely irrelivant direction until we're just slinging mud pointlessly.  <br>

Hey Cameljockey, end it.  Anyone that's read this post since the 2nd page knows that this has gone for way too long.  I really don't need some shallow, high and mighty, wannabe-intellect to tell me that it needs to end.  I KNOW THAT!!!!  However, I for one, enjoy reading some of the things that are said after the point has been lost and forgotten anyway.  <br>
<br>
Does it really matter to anyone?  Probably not.  Don't like the fact that there are 100 replies to 1 post, fine.  Don't read them.  Who cares!!!  Wait, obviously you do.  Dwelling on something that has no basis or impact on anything in the first place.  Big deal.  If you don't like the fact that a post carries on for so long, don't read it.  Simple, to the point, no muss, no fuss.  By the way, unlike Knee (no offence buddy), I hardly ever make spelling mistakes.  Want to play Dr. Laura and tell everyone how smart you are?  Get a call-in radio show somewhere in Antarctica and dazzle the penquins at how obsessed you are with a Flame Board.<br>
<br>
If you don't like posts with a lot of replies, why read them?  Killing time between the Porn videos rewinding would be my guess.  You don't like it, tough, move on.  &quot;We're movin' on up...Movin' on up...To where WE DON&quot;T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY!!!!!!  <br>
<br>
Another question.  Really, why are you so obsessed?  Oh yeah, that's it, like 5 year olds who don't get things their way.<br>
<br>
Last question, I promise.  You really don't like the fact that someone keeps a list?  Sounds to me like you keep the longest list of all.<br>
<br>
Got a problem, take it up with the monkey in the corner, banging his head on the wall...he's your supervisor isn't he?  (oops, used another question, Camelsucker's gonna flame me about it)<br>
<br>
Later...Nerd.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Give it up though Ygyptian and Kneesnapa, you have lost your point and are just insulting each other's intelligence which isn't doing much.   It also scares the hell out of me that you keep a list Kneesnapa.   I don't know either of you in game and only know Kneesnapa from his hmmm ...I will say interesting email.   If you don't know what I mean read your email(if youu still have it) about your threat if I scammed you on Fuggun.   Either way both this post and my email were great laughs.   Please keep up the great laughs. <p>Kiccka
