Zmentd, Lilyana, and Riaw are currently the only FOUNDING members I have any respect or compassion for, and it's in a great ammount for them.  The rest of the members, you are all my friends and I'll help you whenever you want, but you're guild is NOT what it claims to be.<br>
<br>
Ya know, I was Ancient Council for a LONG time, and continue to support them when they ask.  I was told the guild was founded basically by friends, for friends, and that it wasn't an uber-wannabe guild.  That frienship was first and most important in AC...  Then they got cocky...<br>
<br>
Zmentd has stepped out due to RL, I'm sure, and I hold nothing against him for putting RL first.  I am though, ashamed of how Utendar is carrying on the guild in his absence.  Wether it's him directly, or if he's letting others take control when he should be, I leave him in blame of not establishing a communications between the members of the guild and &quot;the elders&quot;.<br>
<br>
People like Baragon have decided that what they speak, their opinions and beliefs, reflect the entire guilds and inform me of THEIR personal decisions and claiming it to be the entire guild's opinion.  He's a dick.  He's tried to defend Ancient Council's actions, wether bogus or true, that's for you to decide(on taking my BEBP, the only drop I ever recieved from Ancient Council, other than occasions(the few) where no one else wanted/could use it, even after I've helped several others achieve things personally to help strenghten the guild, as well as a few occasions where I was there for the guild as a whole).  He's changed his defenses from starting off saying &quot;this is the way we do things&quot; to &quot;This is the way all uber guilds do things&quot; to &quot;This is what uber guilds do with uber loot&quot; to &quot;Whats uber to us isnt to them, this is the way we do it, not them&quot;...  Doing a complete circle and being a huge ass in the process, everytime making assumptions of the way others do  things, when I'd find out the facts on the issue.  He's fucking stubborn, and he's a cold hearted, selfish asshole.<br>
<br>
And Utendar, who I'm assuming is in control of, being the leader of Ancient Council and he should have full control over what is and isn't done, has decided they'd block me from their Forums... Private(which I posted helpful information and my support for them... As well as people said they missed my humor, so I left a post for them) and public forums.  So, my response to that, grow some fucking balls, mature a little, or go fuck yourself.  You could of easily asked me &quot;please don't post there, Punkrawk.&quot;.  Instead you have a little secret meeting(as well as for everything that you decide and never inform or allow the guild members of Ancient Council to voice their concerns on until AFTER it's already been set in stone) talking amoungst each other about banning me from the boards, instead of just changing the password, or just simply doing the civil thing of asking your friend to not post in their private forum.  Really fucking mature of you.<br>
<br>
Fangarr... You're a cock, you always have been a cock, and seem as though you wish to always remain a cock.  With your snide remarks and witty sarcastic comments, too cool to blow up on someone because you've got this ego trip.  Why the ego trip?  Probably because you were once a GM yourself and wish you still were?  Because you maintain the site(shittily) so you feel as if the guild should love you endlessly? I don't know, and I really don't care anymore.  You're an asshole for having NO human compassion, as does none of the elders aside from Lilyana, Zmentd, and Riaw(who are outstanding people, and a fine example of what the guild USED to represent).  You said to me in tells that there's no way for you to keep concern for all 130+ guild members in Ancient Council...  That doesn't mean you shouldn't fucking try.  <br>
<br>
And now Ancient Council is as anti-friendship based as it can get.  They're striving to be uber, and by accomplishing that they use people.  &quot;How the hell do you use guild members?&quot;  Easy, you let them join, but don't do anything for them for a month, and refuse to help them until they helped you.  Call me crazy, but isn't that a pyramid?  The little men on the bottom supporting the top few, getting nothing in return?  I don't understand the logic of &quot;we need you to help us kill Velketor, but in return you must raid with us 19 more times and be with us for 3 months before we'll consider helping you.&quot;.  The deciding leaders of Ancient Council are truly fucked in their systems.  If I help you get something, you're damn right I want something in return.  If it wasn't for the members of Ancient Council, you guys wouldn't accomplish anything.  You wouldn't have your uber trak-BPs that mean more to you to keep tagged as &quot;guild property&quot; then to help a friend, your precious Temple of Veeshan raids resulting in your sweet Kael gear.  You show little or no respect or concern for your members, the members have to fend for themselves... Perfect proof.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're 55+ now, we don't want to do any planar raids anymore, just ToV... Unless a golem is up in a plane, then we'll go because we get something out of it... Even though we're sick of going...&quot;  You straight up TOLD the members sub-55 that they have to fend for themselves, that they get no help from you, and that they'd have to find their own raid leaders.  Where the hell is the friendship or support that Ancient Council was supposedly founded on?  You're completely hipocritical with &quot;we need your help, the guild is a whole, we don't want to make Ancient Council 2 different sub-guilds&quot;...  That's BS, you're defining the line between the 2 factions in Ancient Council with a fucking ocean.  Either you're 55+, or you're nothing.  No raid support.  No epic support.  You fend for yourself(meaning they govern theirselves and you govern your half).<br>
<br>
I'm sad that I left all of my friends in Ancient Council, but I don't regret leaving Ancient Counci.  I regret being foolish enough to give back the Blood Ember Breastplate, believing that I was maintaining a friendship.  I regret helping you guys for 5 hours at a raid in which the people getting benefit(the clerics got their epic piece from Ixiblat and then logged for 5 minutes, then went to Sebilis and slapped on an LFG tag)... Then just so happens that a 5 day process of forming a guild ended during that day and Ashlanne gave me my guildtag, because of that I get told in more or less words that I'm an asshole and that I slapped Ancient Council in the face with that by Baragon.  Well fuck you too, Baragon.  I'm sorry for helping out Ancient Council and doing my own thing at the same time.  I'm sorry you're a fucking closet-case homosexual with a mad ego thinking you're the Queen of Ancient Council.<br>
<br>
In the end... I would reccomend you fine members of Ancient Council, you know you are all my friends, and I know that you all deserve better than what &quot;the elders&quot; are giving you, to do something about it.  Voice your beliefs to them, don't be scared that you'll lose your &quot;uber guild tag&quot; or miss a chance at loot.  I know a lot of you are unhappy with the way things are, and a lot of you found it unfair and bullshit that they took my BEBP , but you didn't say a word about it in the open, and because of that they treated me like shit and felt it was justified, and it may happen to you next.  Put an end to the stupid bullshit Ancient Council is turning into.  PLEASE DON'T JUST STAY IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S AN UBER GUILD AND YOU GET SWEET LOOT OUT OF IT.  Don't turn into another one of &quot;the elders&quot;.  Feel free to express yourself, it's not a crime to want things better for yourself.  It's up to you.<br>
<br>
Utendar, if you aren't responsible for all the shit going wrong in Ancient Council, fucking wake up and fix them.  Killing uber mobs doesn't define your guild, it's the people in it that do.  Stop chasing after greater mobs to slay and take a long look at what your's and Zmentd's guild has become.  Greed before need(if you weren't so worried about setting yourselves up, the sub55 wouldn't be in the place their at), Loot before friendship(on the case of me and anyone you're denying help to for not attending 20+ raids or being in the guild 3 months)<br>
Establish some contact between &quot;the elders&quot;(who are still fucking anonymous to everyone, but assuming Baragon, Fangarr, and yourself as of right now, actively) and the members, because they've all talked to me, and a good majority of them feel they're being shit on by the guild, only staying around because they know if they suck you off long enough that you'll do something for them.  Shame on you for being so selfishly blind and not helping others because you shut them out.<br>

NOTE: Once again, ALL of Ancient Council's members are great people, Lilyana, Zmentd, and Riaw of the original founders are as well.  I feel sorry that the dream of what they had for Ancient Council has turned into nothing more but another uber guild raising up to be the best at all costs, even frienship, fairness, and equality for it's members.  If it wasn't for the members of Ancient Council, I would of left quite some time ago.  <br>
EDIT: If you wonder why I posted here,(really because im just a little ree-tar-did and can't realize &gt;=)) it's because you left me with no other choice.  Banning me from your boards completely, and ignoring me in game when I try to talk to you in game.  I really didn't want to bring it to posting here, but you insisted by shutting me out. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/upunkrawkbbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkrawk Bbob</A> at: 10/10/01 4:00:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/unandarie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nandarie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(9/23/01 7:32:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Basically...

On Ancient Council's side.  The one thing that caught my eye that you were upset about was the waiting before you got loot.  Some guilds feel that way because some people guild hop for loot.  They want to eliminate that from happening and to make sure that they are taking care of their core members first.  That's generally the way it should be considering it's those members that make the guild run.  The fear/hate thing, I can hear ya on that a bit.  They should try to take a day or two out of the month and raid those areas after the guild member has been around for awhile... but they are again taking care of the members that have been there awhile first. <br>
<br>
As for you being banned from their private boards, ummm the way you're talking now, I would have banned you too.  You are letting your anger get the best of you.  The post seems like you don't know who you should be angry at or even if you have justification to be.  Seems to me the whole thing is over a loot issue and your pissy that you didn't get any? Other than a hand me down bp? Correct me if I'm wrong =)  Seriously tho, if you've created havoc on the boards I could see why they've banned you.  Most guilds will ban you if you leave the guild for their private boards.

I, in no way what-so-ever, have a problem with guilds running the way they do, EXCEPT, when they lie about the way things are.  A guild of brotherhood?  A guild founded and based on friendship?  Nay.  They have become nothing more than another uber guild, one that limits your friends to highest rank of levels.  A friend would borrow another friend $15 if he needed it, it's called trust.  Something that others seem wary to share on EverQuest because of a few bad eggs.<br>
<br>
On the boards, I wasn't upset or anything...  I posted a long humorous post of my day in EQ, which I'm sure a few chuckled out, as well as supplied the guild with some faction hit information in which they were wondering about.  Didn't post once about how harsly I've been treated by the supposed officers of Ancient Council, or how wronged I felt I was.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it bugs me that I don't have my BEBP(so not a hand-me-down, I have an Umbral BP now), but it went to a good friend in Ancient Council(as I said, still love them all).  It's the only thing they ever gave me that wasn't shit, so of course I'm gonna miss it.  They took back the only good thing they gave me.  But I'm not pissed about it.  I just think it's sorta janky. <br>
<br>
Also started this thread because I've had several people talk to me saying that they'd leave Ancient Council, but they wanna be around now that they're an uber guild, or asking why I left them in such a god awful guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rhaynae and Utendar,<br>
But overall, I'm not pissed off.  I'm just tired of being pushed to the side, regardless of how nice I tried being.  Utendar must of been letting someone else run his guild for him behind his back or something.  I've expressed my unhappiness to officers a few times, INCLUDING YOURSELF.  Started talking with me, and then you just sort of ignored me, then signed off.  That's called being disrespectful.  <br>
Then it happened again Friday night, when I found out I was banned from the Ancient Council boards.  If I can't access the boards, told I'm unwanted by Ancient Council's officers speaking on behalf of Ancient Council, and you don't return my tells when you're in game, how the hell else am I gonna get ahold of you?  <br>
<br>
And yeah, once again, GREAT MOVE on silencing your members opinions.  Don't let them have a voice, I'm sure they appreciate it... If you know how to run things best, I doubt myself, as well as many other Ancient Council members would be unhappy.  You rule with fear man, and intolerance, of course they aren't gonna tell you what they're unhappy with.  You'd kick them out of your guild or give them a black mark or something of the like.  <br>
<br>
Tell you what, since I've tried, SEVERAL TIMES, to get ahold of you and you STILL haven't tried once to get ahold of me in anyway what-so-ever, e-mail me.   PunkrawkEQ@aol.com   I TRIED discussing these matters with you, you just blocked me out though.  Great leadership and concern, specially for someone that's been your guildmate for over a year now.<br>

It is almost impossible to keep the frienship and family sense in a guild of 30 ppl i can only imagine in one of 130+. Sound to me like you are not cut out for big guild of 100+ and you probably be better off joining or forming a smaller one. <br>
<br>
I wont pretend to know what is going on in AC nor do i care to know but i do know from personnal experience that running a guild with 30 ppl all the while trying to keep it a so called firendship guild is nothing short of a second job. <br>
<br>
I can only imagine how impossibly hard the job must be for a guild of 130+. Like i said i dont know the details or care to know them but you might wanna consider cutting your leaders or ex-leaders some slack, running a guild take alot from you and you dont even get paid for it. I know that on a regular week i used to stress alot more about my guild issue than any issue i had going at work.<br>

  Like I said, there's a thing called RESPECT.  Just because you have 15 people sending you tells at once doesn't give you the right to just forget about who you're talking to.  That's such a fucking joke excuse man.  If you're the guild leader, and you're suppose to maintain the guild, part of that is talking with the members... SPECIALLY when you have something to address with them.  <br>
<br>
  And no, I'm not gonna do your job.  Fuck you, I've tried contacting you umpteem times and ways, if you wanna talk about this, you e-mail me.  If you haven't noticed, I've expressed my &quot;happiness&quot; with how badly Ancient Council is in need of some attention from people that care.  These are my opinions and I'm gonna stand by them.  <br>
<br>
 As for telling Ancient Council members not to respond to this thread... I'm imagining you gave another one of your speaches in the private forum of &quot;You respond and you're listed&quot; messages as well.  If you were as honorable as you claim to be, you'd have nothing to fear and would let Ancient Council members post whatever they want... Because if you're as good a leader as you think yourself to be, there would be nothing but grand posts of how flawless Ancient Council is.<br>
<br>
 Before I strayed, as I was saying.  I've tried you before, and I have nothing left to say.  I've posted what I thought, and will probably be ignored because of fear of the wrath of Utendar's &quot;noloot4choo!&quot; list within the ranks of Ancient Council.  Now, if you have something to say about me or anything I've said, you bring it to me.  Otherwise, fuck you, e-mail yourself if you get lonely, anxiously awaiting a &quot;I'm sorry Utendar, Ancient Council is glorious under your reign!&quot; letter.  I've tried talking to you, I've tried talking to officers.  <br>
<br>
It's sad how uncaring you were/are towards my situation, and hopefully you'll wake up and treat your current members a little better, taking the extra time to talk to them, instead of raising those L60 characters you bitched at us for not having.<br>

 Heh, I know you didn't say, but just making clear...<br>
Not all of Ancient Council.  Members = great people.  95% of the guild rocks.  But those other 5% are a poor, sad, sorry excuse of a human being because they want uber loot and care shit for maintaining morale of their guild.  The 5% that has the deciding factor of the 95%.  The leader's systems they follow and the structure they use is bullshit.<br>
<br>
Specifically noted...<br>
 -Utendar(for being the one that controls AC, or lack of)<br>
 -Baragon(for being a complete greed machine supporter)<br>
 -Fangarr(Ditto above, but being a sarcastic, wise ass to belittle people as well)<br>
 -All the rest of &quot;the elders&quot; that let shit happen because they're too comfortable with where they are to care.  I'd love to know who the hell they are, but they seem to only be refered to as &quot;the elders&quot;.<br>
