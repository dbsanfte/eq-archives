<br>
When this thread was first started, I asked my guild to respond calmly and intelligently, if at all. I do realize this is the Blast Furnace, and NOT a place for shiny happy thoughts. That being said, I will try to take my own advice and stay cool. <br>
There were only 6 people that know exactly what happened that evening in Velks. I trust Zed and the members that were there - if they weren't happy with the cleric, then it just wasn't meant to be. Zack could be the best cleric on the server, but if the group doesn't click, it doesn't click. I can not say who was right or wrong, or indeed if anyone was in the wrong, since I, like most of you, was not there. I don't want to get into the debate on when to CH and who should pull. I'm a bard - I pull - I have never been in a group with a cleric that pulls, and I don't CHeal. I personally don't care who pulls, as long as the whole group is on the same page and it works. This point is now moot, everyone group will do it how they wish. <br>
As I hear the story, he was not asked to leave for a guild cleric, since she wasn't even on that continent at the time, but again, that is now a moot point. <br>
What disturbs me more is the KC incident. Having trusted my life to Minah repeatedly, I find it hard to believe she would leave mid battle &quot;without warning&quot;.  I have known Minah (and many other Dark Rain members)  to be late to guid events while waiting for a replacement to come to the pick up group. Please understand I am not saying you are lying, I just feel I am missing part of the story here. <br>
As far as the leadership of Dark Rain:<br>
Ventrixx (SK formerly known as Venerial Owns)  - GuildMaster<br>
Bemeni - GuildMistress<br>
Relic - Officer<br>
Zedicuss - Officer<br>
Bustyn  - Officer<br>
Please feel free to contact one of us in game if you wish to discuss this, or any other matter further. Dark Rain does NOT condone this type of behavior, and it's my hope to not be a flame topic again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Just thought I'd respond here.  We were grouped for what, maybe an hour or so, I'd say?  Fun group, lots of banter, really chatty, even if pulling was a little slow.  Not much we could do to fix that, since everything was camped in the zone, but we did pretty well.<br>
<br>
I was in KC to hunt with Kreig yesterday, I'd promised him that I was going to hang out with him, he was a little down, and I was there to cheer him up.  When the new group formed, I was upset with him for disbanding without warning our group, but I'd made a promise to him, and he asked me to go with him.  One second, we were fighting, the next second, Kreig had disbanded, and he sent me a tell saying that he needed me with him in the other group.  The leader of the new group was spamming me with tells and invites, and I told him to hang on, we were in the middle of a pull, and I couldn't leave right away.  He said that was cool, and that they'd wait for me for a minute.<br>
<br>
I told the group that I had to go to take care of Kreig, and that I was sorry, and when the message went through to the group, Punk was pulling.  I disbanded from the group at that time so that I wouldn't suck up the group's xp, and I stayed with Punk's group, keeping him on target and casting heals on him until the mob was dead.  I didn't move to join the other group until they were finished fighting the mob that Punk had pulled, because I wanted to make sure that they were safe before I left.<br>
<br>
I was just as frustrated with the situation as everyone else, and I would have been perfectly happy to stay with Punk's group, but I'd made a promise to Kreig, and I wasn't going to walk away from him at that time, he was very down, and needed a friend with him.  I apologize to Punk and the rest of the group, but I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, and had a split second to make a judgement call on that one.  And I did give the group warning that I was leaving, I realize it was quick notice, but I did let y'all know that I was disbanding, and stayed with you to make sure that you were ok.  If that makes me a bitch, then oh well, not much I can do about it.  Sorry you feel that way, bud.<br>
