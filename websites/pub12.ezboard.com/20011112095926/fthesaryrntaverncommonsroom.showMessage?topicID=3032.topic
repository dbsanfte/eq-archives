<br>
I had saved up some pp to buy a fungi tunic and when in nfp yesterday I saw a Fungi on auction for 20k, I thought great.<br>
<br>
 I went into the tradescreen with behindjade (anon) she put the fungi in, I put 20k in and she went LD (used /q probably) <br>
I had my cash still though, she comes back after half a minute and wants to do the trade again, ok I thought still a good deal then.<br>
<br>
She puts in the Fungi (atleast I think that at that time), I put my 20k in and I end up wtih a 20k costing cloth mantle, which has the same graphic.<br>
I was stupid enough to not check the second time, cause I saw a fungi tunic graphic.<br>
<br>
I have petitioned and it has been put in the hands of Ashlanne, but I know it will not be reimbursted, cause like the gm said as a reply all deals are final.<br>
<br>
I just want to warn everyone to check and double check when you make a deal, people like this should be banned for such unfair and low behaviour, but that won't happen.<br>
<br>
I write this in the hope this person won't make more people the victum of such a scam.<br>

The recent case of a ranger losing one of their epic swords because he was right-clicking and a Lam equipped so when he right-clicked his epic it poofed because his inventory was full.  There was all sorts of outrage and crying about it and it was finally re-imbursed to the person. <br>
<br>
You know what?  If you can't figure out how to loot your corpse after 2+ years of playing this game you deserve to lose your items.  It's sad, it's terrible to lose something you spent all that time working towards, but it's your own damn fault.  <br>
<br>
I realize this is a seperate subject, but the idea is the same.  Pay attention to what you're doing and these problems will never happen in the first place.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/urideroftheapocalypse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rideroftheapocalypse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/7/01 4:01:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.guildmagic.com/pics/34656.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those scammers will never fool me</span><hr size=1> Do any of you READ what I wrote or you rather just read your own replies?<br>

<br>
It's not possible to keep your guard up all the time.  And not only that, you shouldn't have to.<br>
<br>
I was once an attempted victim of a scam - I caught on before it was too late, but i almost lost everything I had owned in the game up to that point.  Nothing can be more depressing that losing what you worked so far for, people quit the game over this kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
Verant CAN see who created the mule, they CAN check the logs, they CAN see that a person made a trade with the intent of scamming someone.<br>
<br>
WHY NOT use that information available to them and ban the fuckers?<br>
<br>
Even better, make thier Real Life info available to the public and let me pay them my own visit.  Scamming people is a cowardly act, and I hope with severe passion they will feel the consequinces of their actions for hurting innocent people just wanting to play a fucking game.<br>
<br>
That is the part of the policy they need to change, to stop letting these people hide behind their regulations and policies.  If you think these scammers should be allowed to run free and hurt more people (crime repeats itself always) or do you think something shoudl be done, even if the original player can't get his gear back.<br>
<br>
If you think the former, you are scum in my book. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udakston.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dakston</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/7/01 5:56:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/skastner/daks_b.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those scammers will never fool me</span><hr size=1> &quot;It's not possible to keep your guard up all the time.

<br>
Two responses to this.  One, it's a game.  If you get so worked up over it that you feel the need to react like this over pixelated items, then you should really rethink why you play this game.  Two, it really isn't difficult to &quot;keep your guard up all the time&quot; if you use the tools that are available to you.  Hit &quot;ALT&quot; before hitting Trade to make sure all the items are what they should be.  Don't take the word of one price check response.  And just like the real world, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I was once an attempted victim of a scam - I caught on before it was too late, but i almost lost everything I had owned in the game up to that point. Nothing can be more depressing that losing what you worked so far for, people quit the game over this kind of stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
See my first point above.<br>
<br>
&quot;Verant CAN see who created the mule, they CAN check the logs, they CAN see that a person made a trade with the intent of scamming someone.&quot;<br>
<br>
That might be feasible...if they had the resources available to do it.  If the GMs weren't bothered by petty disputes over a friggin' orc in West Commons and other trivial shit, they might have time to police trade scammers a little more.  OR, we could take it upon ourselves to make sure we don't get scammed using tools they've implemented for us.<br>
<br>
I'm not touching that comment about making their real life information available.  That's about the dumbest fookin' think I've heard all week.  It's a damn game, not the real world.<br>
<br>
Guess you can call me scum, because I see it more effective if I protect myself from trade scammers than hoping that my Guardian Angel will be watching over my shoulder making sure I'm all safe and secure from those mean old scammers.<br>
<br>
I swear, some people take this game way too seriously. <p><hr>

The thing is, sarcasm is largely displayed by inflections of the voice and body language.  Seeing as how this is a pure text medium, you gotta use some other form of conveying sarcasm.  Little smilie faces often do the trick.  INFLECT SARCASM PLEASE.<br>

Also sorry to hear that this f*ck was able to pull this scam off on you and also to say that we all know about these things and how we are responsible, well maybe, but sometimes we aren't thinking correctly (ie family issues, not feeling well, or just having a good time) or we have to much faith in people and expect them to be honest or it even could be that you just started playing eq a few months ago and aren't aware that people are out to scam others or aware of all the policies or that &quot;ALT&quot; shows the items name.

nand, your argument is moot in this case. ashrak paid 20Kp for a cloth mantel. its what he put in the trade screen, its what ashrak put the 20kpp up for. reguardless of what he thought it was.

i think that the original poster got fucked, and the person that did that to him should be banned.  i think verant should change their rules, and it should be common sense, but where do you draw the line?<br>
<br>
some guy in NFP screws you over for a deal?  you pay 10x more than you should have?  that's your fault, you should have looked.  some guy scams you and screws you out of 20k due to him being a nazi?  bannable.<br>
