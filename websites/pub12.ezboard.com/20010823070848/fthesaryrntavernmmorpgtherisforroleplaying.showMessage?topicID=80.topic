<br>
Part 1… Setting the stage<br>
  <br>
  The bright sun peers through the treetops of the Faydark. It is quiet and the breeze gently sways the limbs of the trees so that the leaves cast an everlasting ballet of shadows amongst the surroundings. Ripples, from a puddle left by a storm on the previous day, send forth an aluminous web of light to join in the enchanted dance of the shadows. Seedlings from various seasonal flowers contribute an endless cast of ballerinas that dance in the arms of the breeze. The ground lay thick and damp, covered in heavy moss and thick underbrush. Flowers of every color or combination of color could be seen on long stems that reach to the audience of the sun. The timeless roots of the ancient trees twist and mingle about the underbrush. An orchestra of unseen birds, high in the canopy, plays an erratic masterpiece on their fluted bills. A maiden of Kelethin lay daydreaming at the base of a towering Oak as if it were her throne. Her bright eyes glint in the rays of sunlight. She watches the clouds pass, her eyelids flutter seemingly applauding the show. The realm is dreamlike, tranquil. A cloud overhead slowly eclipses the sun and drops a curtain of darkness upon the stage.<br>
<br>
Part 2… Behind closed curtains<br>
<br>
  The darkness is cool and chilling. The maiden crosses her arms and closes her eyes, deep in thought or perhaps a dream. The darkness deepens. An unnatural shadow befalls the stage and the dancing light gives way to a masquerade of shadow. The flowers frost lightly under the blackness of the curtain. The trees dance with fury. Their leaves cry out with the sound of thunder. The wind is howling with an eerie note. Her arms tighten around her. Her breath is heavy and can be seen leaving her frosted lips. The chill is paralyzing. Then from the darkness of the brush and even darker shadow lurks. The leaves are pulled back, breaking off as the ice around them fractures, and the shadow comes forth. A thin Elf appears, his skin as dark as night, hair as pale white as the moon and his eyes glint like the stars in the heavens. He is clad in dark chain and is wielding a serrated sword of wicked length. He gazes at the maiden. The trees no longer move and the wind dies as if Tunare herself was holding her breath. All is quiet, no note is played, no leaf dances. He, for a moment, stares emotionless at her lying amongst the roots and underbrush. He kneels beside her as she slumbers in a nightmare of cold darkness. He draws near to her face, his eyes still cold and emotionless. His lips touch hers. Not a kiss, not really. He rises to his feet and towers over her cold body. She trembles. His knuckles whiten as his grip on his blade tightens. His other hand reveals a twisted dagger of bone, chipped and stained with blood. The edges of his lips curl. With out warning his blades are thrust! The wind bursts out in screams and the trees lash about violently. The wind commands the stage, fallen leaves dance franticly about the scene as the dark figure hacks away. The trees scream with horror. The flowers twist in the wind as the blood rains down on them. The maiden lays motionless except for the jolting forced by the impact of the blades. His hands bring up into the chilled air his batons of death, flinging their music of blood about the scene and then with much more intensity once more berried deep into the flesh of their drum. The eerie music of the wind stops.<br>
<br>
Part 3… The show must go on!<br>
<br>
  The darkness weakens as the evil of the Drow fades. The cloud overhead retreats behind the leaves of the canopy and the audience of the sun returns. The curtains of darkness are lifted and the tranquility returns. Although more melancholy. The bird’s breath upon their beaked instruments softly plays a sadder note. The wind is gone and the dancers float lonely to the ground about the maiden. The flowers hang their heads, heavy with blood. The puddle gives a pale reflection of crimson to the maiden’s feet, which lay near to it. Her toes drip with the remnants of the evil soloist’s concert. The sun’s rays dance their way up the bloodied body. The light from the loving sun glitters as it pours across the blood pooled on the young elf’s navel. Like stage lights, the radius of sunlight breaches her face. The warmth of the sun touches her lips as they begin to tremble with reality. Her soft cheeks speckled with blood like the notes of music scattered aimlessly across sheets of flesh. The light pierces her eyes as she flashes them wildly open. She peers up at the light streaming through the leaf-covered branches above. The swaying leaves take on the appearance of angels floating down in a halo of soft sunlight. The rustling of leaves sound like whispers urging her to sleep. Her heart, slow and heavy, sounds like the beat of a marching drum. Slower and lighter its beat lingers. The light is so great as it pours down upon her that she closes her eyes. Tired and feeling a warmth wash over her she holds in her seemingly last breath. She holds it as if she was holding on to her very life. Her heart is loud and pounding ever so slowly. The darkness of her thought blackens and she feels no pain.<br>
“Crys…” A voice whispers.<br>
“Crys…” It voices again. “Wake up.”<br>
She gasps for air as she wakes from her dream.<br>
“Oh, Ashton! You scared me!” She replies. “I was having a…”<br>
“Nightmare?” Ashton interrupts with a frightening grin.<br>
