<br>
<br>
How about a nice simple truth that no one can argue with.  NONE of us know how things work.<br>
<br>
None of us KNOW what makes up a soul (or the lack thereof).  None of us KNOW what (if anything) happens after you die.<br>
<br>
My pet peeve is people who absolutely cannot admit that they might not be 100% correct about something (which is admitedly in conflict with my above statements, but, heh, feel free to argue them.)  Not everyone is guilty of this, but in discussions such as these, most people (from my experience)  are very unwilling to even admit the possibility that somoene else might be right.  It is really a contest of pushing your views in a way that cannot be refuted.  Now that's fine in most argumentative situations, but in philosophical discussion, wouldn't it be better for all involved to put forth their weakest points and explore the possibilities that might lie within those?<br>
<br>
I can't say that what anyone believes is wrong, because I dont know.  That's not to say that I am a troubled, conflicted, indecisive person in search of the truth, but it's that I can't believe anything fully.  No matter what I think to be true, I always know in the back of my mind that there is a possibility that I could be wrong.  Instead of &quot;believing&quot; something, I prefer to admit the possibility of things to varying degrees.  I'm pretty damned sure that I'm typing this at the moment....but heh, ya never know.<br>
<br>
That being said, lets think about a couple of things :<br>
<br>
People often talk of emotion as though it was a magical gift that only humans are capable of.  How do we know what lesser beings feel or don't feel?  Well, we don't.  How do we know that emotions aren't made up from 100% natural chemical process that can't theoretically be replicated at will once our knowadge of the human body as advanced enough?  Well, there are already plenty of mood altering drugs on the market, and there have been for decades.  Now I know (and just so i don't get smaked down by you arguement police out there, when I say 'know' it's only to simplify things, as it gets hindersome explaining my view of the word 'know' with each use), as it most of them are harsh blanket fixes to extreme problems....but if you can alter something to a certain degree, it's only a matter of time before that alteration can be refined.  And to those that think you can't replicate love, well, why not?  Just because it is an amazing, almost unfathomable feeling.....well, you felt it right?  So it must be in the capacity of the human body to feel it....so with the right inputs, why coulnd't you replicate it?  And if you don't think love could be a survival instinct, why not?  Unlike many animals, humans have very few children in their life time, and those childern are very fragile for a very long time.  Human chidren need care, attention, and development for a long time.  If you had no reason whatsoever to care for your childern and family, the human race wouldn't last very long would it?  Why then, isn't the capacity to love your partner, your children, and anyone else a survival instinct?<br>
<br>
People who talk of souls typically say that your soul is ever lasting.  If this is the case, where did it come from?  It would seem to follow, that if something were never-ending, then it wouldn't really have a beginning.  Now if you consider infinite time, i guess the possibility of infinite numbers of souls is also allowable, but still, doesn't it seem odd that something that never ends, has a beginning?  Of course, reincarnation takes care of that handily, but most western philosophies scoff at that.<br>
<br>
Now without really getting into the pros/cons or organized religion, how can you say your religion is the correct one?  There have been countless belief systems throughout history and countless different variations on all of those.  If you are a part of one of the many that believes that your is correct, why do you feel this way?  Almost all of the people that grew up being taught a particular belief system feel that it is the 'correct' one.  You can often get around this in christian cultures because at least the ideas are similar, but what about the ones that vary dramaticly?  Are all of those people going to 'Hell' even though they have never heard of &quot;Hell&quot; simply because they follow a different set of rules?<br>
<br>
I have had a number of people try to convince me that their way of thinking is the correct one, and the attempts have varied from horribly bad, to quite good (the best being some chick on the beach in panama city.....but then again i was REALLY REALLY drunk....I found holes in her arguements, but 2 of the drunken chicks I was with got 'saved' on the beach, only to forget about it 10 minutes later and continue on to La Vela with us).  If I have time, I usually entertain their attempts because I like a good arguement, and you never know when someone is going to open your eyes to a new point of view.  That being said, I'd like to offer some advice to people who argue for their religion.  The &quot;if I'm wrong, no big deal, if your wrong, your going to hell&quot; arguement only works on certain kinds of people (drunk ones come to mind), but more thoughtful 'sinners' will talk about varying religions and how statisticly, you probably picked the wrong religion and are screwed anyway.  Also, any arguement based on fear is not going to work on many people, because even if they haven't thought about it enough to realize what's happening, they know that doing somehting out of fear is wrong.  What the fear arguement (the above included, as well as things like &quot;i feel sorry for you&quot;) basicly does is lend support the idea that the only reason religion exists is to keep people content by giving their lives artificial fulfillment by dangling the carrot.<br>
<br>
Maybe the next time I'm feeling contemplative I'll write up an arguement for organized religion and let everyone critique it.<br>

No, not really... heck even mathematics understands the concept of a &quot;ray&quot; which, if you've forgotten what you learned in algebra I, starts at a give point and continues on infinitely in one direction.  Why's that hard to believe?<br>

It all boils down to how you FORMED the concept of god... That is the ony thing i question... which no one even attempted to answer. <br>
  <br>
       This question is very personal... In effect i am asking the believer... or non believer. &quot;How did you form the concept that what you say is true for certin?&quot;<br>
 <br>
        A lot of people ( which seems like a very cowardly answer ) say &quot;we dont know anything for certin...&quot; hehe.. Are you certin of that answer?<br>
    <br>
         Let me throw out there a crude nutshell version of how I Came to the conclusion that there is no god.<br>
   <br>
         1: I observe reality for what it is, and my place in it. I look at myself as a human being that shapes his own life by his own actions... If i were to have a &quot;soul&quot; that only means that i am a conscious ( pardon spelling atm ) and aware of what is around me.  By soul i do not imply anything magical at all...    I take reality for what it is and nothing more.. that is all i can do as a human. I exist... And these objects around me Exist also. &lt;existence exists&gt;<br>
 Before anyone can ask &quot;How do you know there is or isnt a god&quot; you have to discuss what one knows and how one knows it? .. I understand that i am Aware... By consciousness i am perceiving that which exists.<br>
        2: if you accept the first step... This is what evidence depend on. (this is the part where i wish you would have read up on this.. but nm) There is no way to escape the first step if you assume your alive. <br>
         ( bah im tired )<br>
        3: Take your claim ( god exists, or God does not exist) And validate your claim to see if it corresponds with reality.. See how you FORMED the idea that a god is true or not true. <br>
<br>
           Lets take the claim &quot;God is true&quot; .. Lets try to validate this claim.. First i have to understand what god is... Is god a person or a force? .. is god immortal? How can i form this concept of WHAT a god is.  ( sooner or later you will get the idea that just the concept of god is impossible but lets &quot;skip&quot; this for a second so i can get to some even funnier shit )   Lets say that i just assume no one will ever know the true power of god, and its impossible to form a concept of him.. (if i or you cant form a concept of god.. then the argument becomes more based on feeling than fact)<br>
           Lets keep trying to validate the claim that a god is true... i will use some popular arguments .. &quot;An eye is such a perfect design .. a god must be in it!&quot;  Lets question this claim.. Is it possible that things like this evolve? What is the evidence... If there is lack of evidence or science doesnt understand it yet... does that mean a god is really in my eye making it perfect?<br>
           Great .. im way to tired to deal with this atm... All i want to know is how you formed a concept of a god... You wont tell me.. but then youll use science to bash science and logic to bash logic like always... And then ill have to read more posts about why people are morons and cant question stuff them selfs... Yadda yadda ... <br>

<br>
Were you saying that I'm plagerizing Decarte? It's been a while since I had a philosophy class, but if I'm plagerizing anyone it is Socrates, simply because I enjoy questioning what people think they know to be true. <br>
<br>
I personally don't have any of the answers. Why does this make me a coward? I think its more cowardly to adhere yourself to certain things that are claimed to be 'true' and not open yourself to any kind of doubt. It's easy to blindly follow something.<br>

In order to live you have to make this assumption..  To question everything is good, but you have to have absolutes to base your qestions on... <br>
   If you had no absolutes then you wouldnt live for very long... for example: &quot;How do i know im really hungry .. no one knows... What is hunger anyway?&quot; .. And then you die of starvation because you failed to reconize that as a human being in order to survive you have to eat some food. ( you are an entity interacting with other entitys in reality -if im mis spelling shit... oops-) <br>
    Hey that reminded me of a quote i read some years ago:<br>
<br>
  &quot;It has often been noted that a proof of God would be fatal to religion: a god susceptible of proof would have to be finite and limited; He would be one entity among others within the universe, not a mystic omnipotence transcending science and reality. What nourishes the spirit of religion is not proof, but faith, i.e, the undercutting of mans mind.<br>

<br>
You, Aris/Arismo/Whatever are a troll. A troll is someone who posts just to get a rise out of people. It is an interesting psychological phenomon, this apparent need to 'be important' by making someone feel upset. <br>
<br>
You post solely to get a rise out of people. (like comparing Hitler to Christ, I mean, can you be more obvious in your trolling? A little subtlety would be nice.)<br>
<br>
You seem to think you have an idea how to present an argument. You don't. You merely spout pseudo-philosophy in an effort to sound like you know what you are talking about, and present these ideas as though they sprung fully formed from your pin-sized head. Not working out, sorry. I have trouble reading your long-winded and rambling posts without yawning. It reminds me most of the unabomber manifesto.<br>
<br>
This is not the forum for debating the existance of god. I recommend alt.atheism.<br>
<br>
You seem to think you know how to flame. You don't. Merely spouting invective does not a flame make. If you suffer from some form of Tourette's Syndrome that actually causes you to uncontrollably type swears, well, there is medication for that sort of thing now.<br>
<br>
People like you have come and gone from these boards, with your vitriol and stupidity, while more constructive members remain and add value to the place. You will go too, when the shock value of your insipid posts reduces through overuse. You will not be missed.<br>

I'll take a look at it, I'll probably realize I'd get ripped to shreds by 50-year-old scholars of Christianity/Monotheism as well as atheism and evolutionism... but would be cool to take a look at <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You assume that a few things are true and you go from there.  It may sound odd, but the most concrete things that we have are completely abstract.  No matter what your arguement is, it has to follow simple logic.....if 'a' is true, and if 'b' is true, then 'c' is true (or some variation of that).  <br>
<br>
Things like logic are the closest thing we have to absolutes.....and I'm sure there are some situations where even that is debatable.<br>
<br>
If you think this is self defeating, then show me how.....without the use of assumptions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

Well golly-gosh Mr. Atheist, I guess you are just too smart for us dumb folk to understand. Clearly we should bow to your superior knowledge and intellect praising all the while for you have shown us the Truth! And if we don't think it is the Truth then we are clearly just too dumb to realize it!<br>
