<br>
First, I have to say, that I have seen this person selling this item for some time at the same price.  I understand he is a warrior and lacks the intellect to grasp anything other than holding aggro and beating things up (not that this is a small task in any way), but the person behind the computer probably is rather intelligent and capable of understanding this concept.<br>
<br>
The Everquest system of economics relies on two basic principals:<br>
<br>
1) Supply and Demand - Despite the level of mob the GBS drops off of, it is rare and for a long time it was highly sought after.  When I first came to this server, I would see people selling it for 20k.  Granted, the demand for such an item has decreased significantly, but such is the life of a market driven primarily off supply and demand.  Better items were found or made available and the market reacted.<br>
<br>
2) The sellers ability to "sell" an item.  Salesmanship.<br>
<br>
First, let's look at the auction said warrior was displaying to the market.<br>
<br>
A warrior auctions, "WTS piercer 8/23 150 dot 4k"<br>
<br>
Now, I saw this auction for a while and said nothing.  It really is none of my business what he sells it for, but I enjoy discussing in game economics with people. So I zipped him off a tell, asking him the name of the item.<br>
<br>
He responds, in /ooc, that it is a Scorpikis Claw Impaler and that I should come take a look at this awesome weapon.  Well, the weapon is a piece of cow pie as a weapon.  So I informed him, in what I thought was a nice manner, that one could get a weapon (to use as a weapon) with much better stats for the same or less money.  His response was, you go ahead and do that then.<br>
<br>
Well, the conversation got ugly. I accused him of being rude and in 6 th grade logic he basically said, "I know you are but what amd I?"  He followed up such a lovely piece of intellect with the phrase, "it is an extremely rare item from HS".<br>
<br>
Now, I have never been to HS, because I am just a n00b.  However, I don't care where you got this piece of crap.  It's rarity has little bearing on it's value in this case.  Granted, you could sell this as resist gear, but for the same price, you could get much better resist gear.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the weapon yourself:<br>
<br>
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=3568<br>
http://eq.castersrealm.com/data/item.asp?Id=1521<br>
<br>
Make sure you click on the Pricing Data link:<br>
<br>
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/pricing.html?item=3568<br>
http://eq.castersrealm.com/data/item.asp?Id=1521<br>
<br>
I was looking at this from a rogues perspective. 8/23 wouldn't be such an awful weapon.  But, unless there is an error on the web pages, the warrior simply can not distinguish between a 3 and a 5.<br>
<br>
Next point, one web page has deemed it common, the other rare.  Someone else will have to confirm the rarity of this item, as I will likely not make it to HS in the very near future.  Needless to say, rarity only impacts the items value when it is in demand.<br>
<br>
Granted, this item has 4 STR and 10 SV Poison, but in demand?  I could buy a Slime Coated Harpoon for 1k or less, which is 10/25 with unrelated rogue stats.  1/4 the price, the same delay and 1/4 more damage?  I am sold on the Slime Coated Harpoon.  Let's look at yet another weapon, just in case you thought this would be a lovely off hand weapon.  The Crystal Grinder (9/27) is a not so bad off hand weapon with a cut saw graphic.  Granted, it isn't super fast, but 2/25 ths slower for 1/8 more damage isn't a terrible trade off.  You can buy a Crystal Grinder in EC, with very little patience, for 250 - 300 pp.<br>
<br>
So, for still less than half of the price of the item this warrior was selling, you now have two arguable better items.<br>
<br>
Now, let's talk proc.  Well, as an enchanter, I can tell you a dot proc can be very evil.  What happens if you have to switch targets?  Will a 150 dot over the course of a minute or two significantly change the outcome of a fight?  Not likely by the time you could afford to shop at the Tiffany's of Everquest.  Maybe this would be good against level 20 and under mobs, but not likely a favorable proc once you start grouping with people who use crowd control.  I may be wrong on this, but for less money, a rogue can apply more useful poisons in a far more controlled manner.  I have no idea of the taunt value of said proc is, but the last thing a rogue wants is to be moving up the hate list of a mob any faster than she already is.<br>
<br>
And as for SV Poison and STR stats, so freaking what.  Still for less money than you are selling your item at, I can probably do better with other items, even after having purchased two other weapons.  Read Safehouse on their opinions of STR vs Haste.  STR may increase your max damage with a backstab, however, haste owns STR and the wise rogue is investing their time and effort into AC, DEX and Haste items. 4k doesn't seem like a good price for 10 SV Poison, but what do I know.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know about the other classes that can use this item, but for a rogue, this weapon is mostly junk.  For 4k, I would rather by a single Mrylokar Bracer than by this.  Maybe this is an uber bard weapon and bards all over Norrath are scraping up coppers to purchase said uber item.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'll talk salesmanship.  I can sell you some nice ocean side property in Colorado.  I could care less if you think this item is a rare drop of some uber mob.  It doesn't reflect it's value at all.  Your ability to call it rare does not change the weapons value unless you are talking to some newbie, who likely does not have 4k to begin with.  Try lowering your price.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I don't want you to get cheated out of what you feel you deserve, but you would save yourself a lot of time and actually have some platinum in the bank if you sold it for less, as opposed to having some junk weapon collecting dust in your bank or inventory.<br>
<br>
This isn't aimed at you, personally, but your attitude made me feel inclined to type /camp desktop and come let the world know how I feel about people selling rare items for more money than necessary.<br>
<br>
Next weeks topic, Silver Chitin Handwraps and the little haste item that could (not be sold for 30k).<br>
<br>
And for a bit of comic relief, I leave you with the following auction.  (I am serious.  /giggle)<br>

If an item is fairly easy to get, then it will be less costly than a comparable item that's much mor rare. <br>
<br>
Example: Guantlets of the Black. Uber AC, with str and wis thrown in. The AC is very near that of planes armor for he calsses that can wear it. When it first came out, the prices were in the 3-5kpp range. This reflected ONLY it's stat value. As it became more and more common, it's value began to drop. Once people realized how easy to get it was, it's value fell in the toilet. You can barely GIVE them away now, because anyone who wants a pair can get one relatively easily. The mob is about level 30, not a particularly rare spawn, and the guantlets are his common drop. BTW, the rare drop (dark ember) has suffered a similar fate- not quite valueless, but not exactly commanding the 9k price it did early on. Note that early buyers didn't pay a high price because of rarity. The item was brand new, so no one knew how rare or common it was. Given it's stats, most probably assumed it would be pretty rare. In fact, details about where it dropped were pretty slowin coming out, as the first discoverers obviously realized it would soon be common, and wanted to milk it for all it was worth before it's secret was out. Thus, they tried to keep the details about where it dropped as secret as possible. <br>
<br>
So, commonality and ease of aquisition most definitely have an effect on value. It's not JUST intrinsic value according to stats. Rarity may not have the same effect that commonality does, but there is no denying that it has an effect.  <p><H6>Elvyrra Grovedancer<BR>
