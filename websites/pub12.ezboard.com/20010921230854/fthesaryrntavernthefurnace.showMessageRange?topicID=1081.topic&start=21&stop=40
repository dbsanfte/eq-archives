Who cares if I'm an asshole.  I don't play EQ to be nice to everyone.  I'm nice to people, just not you.  In this world if you are too nice to people they walk all over you.  Didn't you learn that in High School? USA didn't walk into Iraq and give Sadam some Milk and Cookies and that was it.  We bombed the piss out of them to show that being nice gets you nowhere.<br>

Please pull your head out of your ass, we didn't bomb Saddam to be 'mean'. We bombed him because he threatened our oil supply which we depend on as a nation. Was Saddam a nice person in the first place? No, he was an asshole and in my mind he still hasn't gotten his just rewards. I'm not &quot;too&quot; nice to people and I sure as hell don't let them walk all over me. I pride myself in being diplomatic when I need to be and blunt when I need to be.<br>

Thanks you for making my point for me. IT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOT OURS! You have personal problems great, don't bring it here unless you have a valid point to make.<br>
<br>
This thread was directed at everyone on the server, not OOP. I don't have to justify myself to you so I'm not going do. I'm not going to bring myself down to your level sorry to disappoint you. I have friends in almost every guild on the server and I'm sick of this guild going after the other no matter who it is. Yes a lot of it has been H&amp;E and OOP but they aren't the only ones that bring shit here that shouldn't be. I just want the friendly atmostphere we had when the server was brand new.<br>

We are about to make the attack when you bullrush past because of the &quot;you have no chance of killing&quot; that mob.<br>

All my group would have to do is have one cast of tash to nail you on an attempte KS.<br>

Waltzing in and acting the big bad macho wannabe foh and saying &quot;you don't have near enough to kill it&quot; means dick. If you got beat, then you got beat. I say wait till the group there decides to give up and/or find something else to attack.<br>

Yeah!  We finally have official word from Garhbage himself.  Thanks for clearing it up for everyone.  Guess someone needs to inform VERANT so they can let their guides know the first in force rule has be revoked by official proclamation.<br>
<br>
Easy to say this is the way it should be when you are always on the losing end of first if force.  But some find it easier to whine and petition.<br>

<br>
You?<br>
 Me?<br>
<br>
No one has the right to decide what number constitutes a proper force.<br>
<br>
If a group wants to try with 18 so what, you breathing down their neck doesn't help. Your arrogance is blinding you spyryt. <br>
<br>
If a group of 18 beats your group of 70, and they really want a legitimate shot at something, you have no right to tell them to back down. Like I said, who decides what constitutes the proper force to kill a mob? Does what you say go, because you think that the mob can't be killed with any number less than 70? Are they wrong because they want to try it with 18? <br>
<br>
See, you are trying to justify you bossing your way over a smaller force by shear numbers. If a group wants to try it, then you have absolutely no right to tell them to back down. <br>
<br>
First in force, yes, is first in force. But just because you outnumber someone doesn't immediately give you the right to take a spawn, especially if you got beat. <p>~Garbhad Brainbender~

<br>
for instance today at Sontalek HnE had 24 or something people apparently claiming/camping him. as our 50 went by we could have decided to take sontalek (no need to wait the 3 hours for 30 more HnE to show) but we didnt because we had other plans.<br>
<br>
and as to your question of who dictates what the magic number is...its up to whoever is leading said raid, of course. if they dont REALLY want the mob they will probably leave it alone over a small group &quot;claiming&quot; it. if they really want it then they can push it to the &quot;first to engage&quot; rule. all depends. but we all know this, it just doesnt always suit some people thus this ridiculous little debate...<br>

For someone to waltz in to someone elses raid and say &quot;you don't have enough back don or be trained/jumped/leapfrogged (whatever the case may be)&quot; is just assinine. <br>
<br>
Also, another issue I want to bring up is that in order for two groups o people to get along there has to be communication and patience. If neither of those are there, then any relationship between them shouldn't even be attempted. This has to go for all people involved on both sides. No one likes people breathing down their necks when they make attempts, so why do it? It is human nature I guess to be curious at how others are performing, which causes friction, and friction is bad. <br>
<br>
However, Cerranshaun is right, the lure of phat lewts and supposed stardom because of digital accomplishments blins people. Then again, human nature dictates that people are greedy. Guess it's a sign of the times.<br>

        What i think don't really matter so, knowing that. im going to say soming any way. i think you all are right. all of you have verry good point's. what i mean is i've been in &lt; HnE&gt; and &lt; OOP &gt; both guild's are verry nice i really like the player's in both guild thy have alot of hart,and like to do well in the game, and try verry hard. i have only good things to say about both guilds.<br>
<br>
<br>
        I my self, and the ression, i say, i my self is because thats the only person i can speek for, I've got sick of the stress of seeing nice people. i know on 2 of the best guilds on this server fight...i know this may sound fucked up. yah some one trying to be nice on the Tavern. not sure why im even posting this..because every thing i say dont make a hill of Orc shit.. it just dont matter,will not change a thing..<br>
<br>
<br>
      if what Garbhad said is true...then again, human nature dictates that people are greedy. singn of the time's...that's sad to know....it's just a mob last time i looked alot of them out their...&lt; HnE &gt; and &lt; OOP &gt; have some of the verry best officer's , i know and guild leader's for that matter.. im sure thy work and talk things out better then we do. So why come here and play in the orc shit....hey log on happy EQ dont pay you to play..you pay them...just try to enjoy..i allways try to worry about my self..not what otheirs are doing or what thy are killing...if i worry about who is doing what, how can i think about what i am doing ?<br>
<br>
<br>
      ya i know im playing in the Orc shit too by posting here...well one good thing about playing in the Orc shit is......alot of us here =)<br>

You cried like a whining little bitch when you were told straight out that you were of no use for us if you were not willing to change faction. And you wouldn't have been so they were correct when they said that.<br>
<br>
Did I say you were in HoE at the time? Nope. I said your guild (it is the guild you are in these days right?) take it upon themself to decide it. Therefor, it makes a member from the guild a huge hypocrite to say what you are saying.<br>
<br>
Would be even more amusing if Naval said it though heh.<br>
