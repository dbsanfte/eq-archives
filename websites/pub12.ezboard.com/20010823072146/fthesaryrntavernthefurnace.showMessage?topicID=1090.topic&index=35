Back onto the Arabs, their society is so opressive, terrorism is the only form of speaking out.  When you live in a country where you can stand on a picnic table and incite a protest against anything, anytime you want, its easy to forget that in some countries, you can get shot for that.<br>

I'm not even gonna touch that one... I'll call up Venym maybe... he's much better at showing racist people that they're morons than I am<br>

Yep, she did hammer that spike through his head... but then, he'd also killed several thousand Israelies... think of it as sort of a form of capitol punishment. You may see that as justification but, IMO, if someone kills 3000+ people, he deserves to die.<br>
<br>
He did kill entire races, but NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. It wasn't a situation of diversity we have here in America... it was a case where an entire invading army was of the same race.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot;? Could you give me a scriptural reference on that? I'd like to look up the original Hebraic meaning... I'm GUESSING it means something more along the lines of &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a sorcerer to live&quot;... which makes quite a bit more sense... sorcery is the idea of harmful magic, conjuring demons, laying curses on people, etc.<br>
<br>
I kind of agree with one of Knee's points... why didn't we just give them part of Texas? Or, better yet, part of the East Coast? Would they have sailed there, said &quot;no thanks&quot;, and turned back around to Israel? I kinda doubt it. Much easier to give them someone ELSES land.<br>

I wasn't particularly making an attack against Christianity either. I was just pointing out that, if you define murder as the taking of another human life, then nearly every religion in the world can manage to justify the occasional massacre.  I grew up in a fundamentalist home, went to a Baptist school and had Bible classes every day of the school year.  The Old Testament is a wonderful piece of literature and it's full of great moral stories, but it's also one of the bloodiest pieces of work that has ever been written.<br>
<br>
I'd be happy to try to find the references for the examples I've spoken of, but I don't even keep a Bible in my home.  It's one of those side effects of being raised in an intolerant environment where girls weren't allowed to wear pants, television was forbidden and the pope was the anti-christ.<br>

Note for the record that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not once</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have I used a particular race/class/region as a specific instance of atrocity except when quoting MSNBC in my post about Israel's &quot;retaliation&quot; rocketing. Every race and region in the world has committed it's own atrocities, no one's hands are completely clean. In fact, my whole point all along has been that pretty much anyone is capable of Very Bad Things(tm).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Serbea-- Cluster bomming in marketplaces<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Terrorist psychos of exactly the kind I denounce as evil.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Vietnam--- Napalm,carpet bomming,VC village clensing, agent orange...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nasty war. Bad things happened. Americans were the terrorist pyschos in that conflict, no doubt about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> North Korea-- Carpet bomming, starvation.. god only knows what else..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Bombing the civilian population of Germany was the only way to produce a change in the attitude of the formerly &quot;untouchable&quot; German nation. That doesn't make it right. Again, same terrorist pyscho mentality. But hey, war is hell eh? Yeah, but that doesn't make it right. Unfortunately, you gotta win somehow, tho.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> WW1-- umm wow... that was a friggen mess<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This war was actually a little shy on the &quot;war crimes&quot; we've all come to know and love so well. Mostly people just died en masse due to the introduction of the machine gun and a lack of creative tactical planning on the part of the Zergling mentality in charge of the armed forces in any number of countries.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Americian indians-- How many died from what ever god forsaken diesies we introduced into they're society when we asked them to leave they're land.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Rarely were American Indians ASKED to leave. Usually someone just showed up and started killing them until they retreated from their lands, or swindled them in bad deals. Diseases that killed most American Indians way back when were usually brought on by forced death marches of hundreds of miles at gunpoint by soldiers on horseback who provided little to no food, water or medical supplies. Once agian, an atrocity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When Columbus discoved the america's--- How many babies died from the common cold?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Uh. okay. Not sure what this has to do with anything.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When the spanish wiped out the aztecs-- &quot;is that a gold tooth in that babys mouth? GIMMY!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

See: American Indians, Isreal/Palestine, Serbia/Croatia, Nazi Germany vs The World. Thuggery bad. No biscuit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Crusades--- What a cluster that was. How many babies died there?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Already discussed them. They sucked. People did very bad things to each in the name of &quot;God&quot;. Who was probably very dissapointed.<br>
