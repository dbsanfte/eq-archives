I'm getting pretty sick of &quot;shadowknights&quot; coming to these boards complaining about how useless they are.  If they would get a little skill, they'd realize how untrue those statements are.  I'll have to assume that every one of these whiners is like the dozens of shadowknights that I group with on my rogue alt that have no clue what they are doing.  We can TAUNT better than everyone else, and it's sad when I group with shadowknights where I have to evade constantly, back off to avoid aggro, and things aggro on other group members, because as a shadowknight, I think they are giving us a bad name when they don't know that disease cloud is their friend.  Another group on the horrid shadowknight list.. the ones who think that shadowknights can't tank anything past 50.  ARGH^$&amp;#!  Heh.. sorry ranting from things that pissed me off the other day.<br>
<br>
About the ability points... I'm level 58.  I don't think it's unfair at all that you can't use the class abilities til 59.   Why?  Because it's a waste of time to be working for those abilities until you're around that level, and you'd be much better off using your time to level.   When you gain levels, your power increases a lot more than it would if you spent all your time getting a damn horse or a more powerful harmtouch that you'll use one game day at the most.  The only thing that would be really useful to work on your level is innate running speed if you pull a lot.. and you don't have to be level 59 to work on that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  For the rest of it.. just get higher levels first.. everyone will take a level 58+ SK with no ability points over a level 54 one with all of them any day. <p><img src=http://ritkhan.homestead.com/files/valsig.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uandvarishadowmist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AndvariShadowmist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bastard Bard</span><br>  Posts: 1537<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/13/01 11:52:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> Yeah Nandarie for some reason Bards have been classified as Hybrids.

<br>
Valrya is correct, nothing beats a SKs taunt ability and they can tank exp groups just fine. Hell one night when we lacked a tank I took my SK to Velks and tanked with him at 49. Rogue/Monk/Wiz never got hit. It is called using the class to the max and above all: KNOW your class.<br>
<br>
Also.. the greatest ability you can get in this game is levels. Levels mean EVERYTHING. Learn it, shout it, send emails to Kappaphi about it. I would NEVER put any exp into alt exp until 60 unless maybe to get some quick points in Innate Run for pulling/trains.<br>
<br>
Oh and I find it funny how every other Paladin I have discussed the expansion with consider it great and a very nice power increase for their class..<br>

<br>
Shadowknights and paladins are TANKS .. not damage dealers.  Rogues and rangers can do more damage, but they can't tank nearly the amount of things we can.  They are offensive melee.. we are defensive.  If you want to deal damage, play a rogue.  If you want to be able to tank, but you want something with a lot more flavor than a warrior, solo ability, the best taunt, best survivability and self reliance, play a shadowknight. <br>
<br>
You think that level 54 is the endgame.. that's proof enough that you need your head checked.<br>

I still can't believe you people are replying to what you're not reading.<br>
<br>
Yes Andvari I do keep posting the same thing over and over..why? Because you people don't seem to comprehend what I'm saying. It's pretty simple.<br>
And Euda, (here's an example Andvari) you say to find a class that has skills I like to play..jesus christ man, have you read a single word? Its not about me liking or disliking the skills, its the LEVEL THAT WE ATTAIN THEM THAT I QUESTION. Can any of you READ for god's sake?<br>
I agree, Shadow Knight is the master taunter. When I played my sk on a regular basis, i could hold the taunt easily, no matter what members the group had. I also had clerics complaining to me to let the warrior taunt more because i was getting pounded. Yes, even the dumbass warriors that can't stay opposite the Rogue. Let them taunt more before you start, they said.<br>
One last time.. One last single time..<br>
Class Specific Skills are the issue. I feel that level 59 is a little too late for some of them. Understand? Make sense? I've only had to post this umpteen times now, I'm sure sooner or later one of you will get it. No, I'm not saying give us our advanced skills at level 1, or 25, or 45. 50+ is fine, but I say if you work hard for the skills, there's no reason why some shouldn't be available below level 59. Clear? I can't say it any fucking simpler.<br>
One last time...One last single time..<br>
The discussion regarding Shadow Knights that I regret I started in the first place, was about their damage output 50+. Not their spells. Not their taunts. Their simple goddamn motherfucking melee damage output 50+, and how I had hoped the new Advanced Skills would help with that problem. I stated this repeatedly..REPEATEDLY that my issue with them was damage output. RE-FUCKING-PEATEDLY. <br>
If your'e still clueless, or if you still want to post about how I slammed the entire sk nation for not being able to fear kite, or whatever you fuckin idiots can dream up, then find some junior poster boards to play on. I can see getting flamed, but getting flamed by ten year olds who's posts amount to little more than 'screw you poo poo head you're wrong' is ridiculous.<br>

<br>
The skills were given to the game as a further way to advance your character after lvl 60. You see, once you gain level 60 you can't level anymore. But you wouldn't know would you since you play the &quot;end-game&quot; at 54.. <br>
<br>
LEVELS MEAN EVERYTHING.<br>
<br>
Got it?<br>
<br>
VI clearly stated that the skills were meant as a further way to enhance the highlevel chars. They were something to strive for when you honestly didn't have much more in sight. If they didn't do that a lot of the highlevel players would quit. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
As for your SKs damage ability.. SKs and Pallies are the defensive hybrids. They can tank as good as a Warrior (unless Warrior pops Defensive), taunt better but do slightly less damage. If my memory serves me correctly SKs do 85% of a Warrior's melee damage. A Ranger is the offensive hybrid. They do insane damage but die if you look at them twice.<br>
<br>
Now go play a Druid or some other class you might understand.<br>

Then you go on some tangent about how shadowknights suck and are underpowered cause we don't do as much damage as rogues/rangers/warriors/monks.  People (mostly hybrids) have repeatedly tried to explain things to you, and all you do is degenerate into some flaming fuckfest posts.<br>
<br>
People RIGHTFULLY complained about the exp penalty and two handed weapons and that got fixed.  However, watch out about complaining about everything under the sun, because when you actually have a valid complaint people will be less likely to take you seriously if you are a known whiner.  Alt advancement was put in for level 60s to advance their characters.  If you would even think about sticking your exp into alt advancement if you could get class abilities at level 54, I would laugh at you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/udaclifster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaClifster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Ale Swiller</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/13/01 1:06:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well..</span><hr size=1> Asmoaen the only thing you have proven is you have no experience and knowledge to back up your rather limited insight of the SK class.

as opposed to the dumbass SK's who out-taunt the warrior on purpose so that the cleric's mana is wasted?

Sure, maybe the lower levels can't use these skills but you still have 6 more levels to look forward to and are missing some disciplines and spells as is. Why not hit 60 first, then get the special luclin abilities and then IF you still think it sucks then you can bitch.<br>
<br>
Realistically the special abilities for each class are there to reward those who have already put in a lot of time in the past and want something to look forward to.<br>

<br>
I don't think you slammed the sk nation, you just made an ass out of yourself and showed everyone how little you know about your own class *shrug*. I've grouped with many Highly skilled Sk's that knew what the hell they were doing, and they kicked ass, they knew the role of the class they played.<br>
<br>
And about the level to attain skills... *gasp* gosh imagine having to lvl up and earn it *sob* Just because people disagree with you doesn't mean they are clueless and not reading your post, they just flat out disagree with you.<br>

Skills = end game stuff. Class Spacific skilsl = END END game stuff. Just shut it and take it like a good boy. AS if a new srt of zones, new Class spacific armor quests, and items and spells is not enough for you to go after 60. You have to bitch about skills you have to use exp to buy, and you cant get them yet. If your dont like it leave. Thats alwse been the polocy you know. Ya ya Skills suck ya ya SKs blow. Theres the door heres my boot.
