i guess if music is offensive its bad then.  hm, free speech. can you say that?  we dont need morons like you to go around saying music is offensive.  if it offends you so much, why bother doing your &quot;research&quot;?  plus, how can you generalize someones music based on one song they have written?  i admit, even my most favorite artists have songs that i wonder how the hell they made them.  no ones perfect.  please learn how to analyze things from a distance, instead of being so narrow-minded and making a judgement based on one song.<br>
<br>
<br>
hm, please explain this sentence for me:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;You can dislike a form of music, but you can hate profane and disgusting material such as this.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
so i guess what you are saying is that rap/hiphop is a phase?<br>
<br>
ok, so the words are offensive, but can you honestly say that the type of music you listen to does not contain something offensive?  even if you listen to holy gospel church music, its offensive to other religions.  no matter how you look at something, someone will always find it in one way or another offensive.<br>
<br>
i know ill get flamed for what i am about to say, but who cares.  im guessing that you are a caucasian male...thus, you listen to rock/punkrock...aka the white boys music.  however, you have no reason to get mad at me, because i am making an assumption, just as you made an assumption about me.  im in a &quot;phase&quot; as you say.  tell me what kind of music you listen to, and i know i can find a way in which it is offensive to someone.<br>

It got two well known reported gangbangers off the streets. It kept them from killing someone else. <br>
<br>
It was well known that at the time, Tupac, Biggie, Snoop, Dre, and many other rap artists were still hanging tight to their gang roots and were rollin with them on drive bys and other criminal activities. <br>
<br>
Neither Biggie nor Tupac were doing anything new, as Tain said. Neither of them really did anything to change their influence on the community and/or their self image. Both were more worried about how they looked to all their homies, that they didn't see how the rest of the world saw them, and it inevitablly killed them both. <br>
<br>
They both led lives that they knew was going to get them both killed. THey glorified that fact, and made it seem as they were untouchable. <br>
<br>
They were bad rolemodels for the youth that listened to them. Saying how cool it was to shoot someone, and how cool it was to slap women around and treat them like shit. They were not cool, they were not glamorous, they were both two pieces of trash that got taken out for good. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20411>Garbhad Brainbender</a><br><a href=http://www.ezboard.com/messages/alert_spamblock.html>Phantasmist</a><br>

<br>
Once again, it proves that those who listen to rap and are professed fans are nothing more than rash thinking dullards who can't form a well written argument. Xuilidar, no offense man, but you fell in to the stereotype and proved the point that everyone against hiphop/rap were here to make.<br>
<br>
Rap, unfortunately in my opinion, may be a form of music, however, it has no good moral value behind it. It's the only form of music that glamorizes it's artists for killing other people over something as simple as a color of a piece of clothing. <br>
<br>
Not only does it glamorize killing, but it also portrays drug use and a complete disrepect for the law as a beautiful thing. Each artist plays a game of 1 upmanship, trying to better the other artist by saying how big his dick is, and how many &quot;Benzos&quot; they own in their Compton garage. It's all about being the big pimp, and how many phat blunts they smoke. <br>
<br>
People wonder why rap music gets blamed for being the sole impression of a young kid. When the kid has role models to look up to like Snoop Dog, or Tupac, or Puff Daddy, where &quot;Big Pimpin&quot; in your 64 with 15 switches while you collect money from your bitches, then go knock back a 40 while rollin a 187 on a couple a niggas from the east siiiide is the cool thing to do.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't hate rap entirely, as a matter of fact, Chronic and Doggystyle are two of my favorite albums. Not for their musical talent. But for the shear comical value of both albums. <br>
<br>
Now I am not saying that the Rock industry has all wonderful role models, hell I would be the first to admit that it doesn't. <br>
Especially with bands with frontmen like Sid Vicious once was, or Axl Rose of Guns N Roses. <br>
<br>
However, those are just the people and the mistakes they made. None of them ever glamorized how cool it was to get high on Heroin or get shitfaced every day on Jack Daniels. <br>
<br>
There is the darker side of the metal world, yes I know. You have such heavy bands like Slayer, or Death Shroud, who are considered black/death metal. However, most of their fans don't go out and commit viscious crimes towards humanity in such a high percentage as rap fans. You don't hear of a metal head killing 3 people on the street because of the color they wear. <br>
<br>
Rap, when it first came on the scene 20 years ago with bands like George Clinton and the P Funk All Stars, The Sugar Hill Gang, Jam Master Flash, and Run DMC, did not intend for Rap to be all about gang banging, and killing niggaz, and pimpin hoes and then beaten them when they didn't bring the chronic or the seagrams gin. They meant for it to be a new style of funk, with an intent to get a message out via a beat. Nowadays, it's nothing but a G Thang and coastal rivalries. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20411>Garbhad Brainbender</a><br><a href=http://www.ezboard.com/messages/alert_spamblock.html>Phantasmist</a><br>

<br>
funny how you think all teenagers that listen to rap/hiphop have bad grammar.  generalizing us just like you generalize the genre.<br>
<br>
its sad how the old fogeys of america today wither away as they get older.  too bad they are going to die a lot sooner than me.<br>
<br>
next,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;Now there has to be rap artists that you can like that have more respectable lyrics.......&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
two things here...first off, bad grammar. second, how narrow minded can you be to generalize all hiphop/rap artists as &quot;profane, vile, disgusting, bigoted, sexist, etc&quot;?  if you do some research, you would notice that hip hop is actually a very diverse genre of music.  not everyone sings about killing people, getting lots of women, etc.  please, like i said before, do more research on rap/hiphop before you say stupid shit like you have said many times before.<br>
<br>
enough talk about ulric, the old guy with bad grammar.  garbhad, please look into rap/hiphop more.  ill mention some artists that do not rap about offensive stuff.  for example, mos def.  check out some of the things he sings about.  there are so many more to name.  i have posted before about how i hate commercial hiphop.  everyone raps about their many &quot;hoes&quot; and their &quot;blingbling.&quot;  if you look into hiphop, there are hundreds of artists that do not fit this stereotype.<br>
<br>
AS A NOTE TO EVERYONE, PLEASE DO NOT GENERALIZE HIP HOP AS A BAD GENRE OF MUSIC.  at least do some research.<br>
<br>
you dont see me looking at punk rock as offensive.  i could find it offensive, but i dont.  cause some of the stuff out there is pretty good.<br>

<br>
There are a handful of instances here where people have gotten offended by the blatant propaganda, and picking at the needed sore spot of Rap to prove their near-pointless-point. I personally do not think that proves anything, really. Maybe get 100 random hip-hop listeners to reply this way, and you have something. Dullard or not, the point is why tell people what they know? I know, as an avid hip hop listener, that the largest portion of the music appeals to those who have aggression, and do not exactly maintain that 4.0 GPA. But what I cannot stand is the people who pretty much hate hip hop solely from the lyrics of a large portion of the songs. I think the lyrics in a lot of songs I still like really suck, but enjoy the song for other qualities.<br>
<br>
Glamorized for killing. Sounds like the army handing out metals for bravery in action, IMO. Just over a religion, resource, or in retaliation, all of which are as petty as clothing, race, or color to some.<br>
<br>
Drug Abuse is rampant. I am willing to bet that the heaviest drug that most rappers do is Marijuana. Do you deny though, that many artists wouldn't have made pieces such as they have without some strange thought or image made by the brain induced by some sort of stimulant? I feel damn silly, trying to argue this point with all of you police men and veterans, who I damn well be none grew up in an area where pimps and rap are part of every day life. If you did, I am sure you wouldn't be so offended or repelled by it. If a rapper rapped about Sunday church and going golfing with their father I'm sure you wouldn't really find that as too bad of a statement.<br>
<br>
Having all the things you mention(15 switches, 40 Oz. and bitches) reminds me of a Country Western. Everybody wants to be the baddest mofo around. Certain things improve your image of being a bad mofo.<br>
<br>
Drop Top Caddy w/ 15 Switches = Black Stallion.<br>
Bitches = All the ladies in your corner at the poker table.<br>
40oz = expensive whiskey!<br>
<br>
The mentality has been present for as long as man had sufficient food and therefore had more free time to occupy.<br>
<br>
Rockers didn't glamorize the rocker life? Bullshit! Look at how many teens want to be rock stars. Hell, all that mentality started rap. MTV has even done a report on the rocker life as of late. Party all night, sleep all day. This goes with the same trend, when you look at it.<br>
<br>
Drop Top Caddy w/ 15 Switches = Whatever expensive car the rock star wants to be caught driving.<br>
Bitches = Women wanting 'Autographs' backstage, all with measurements peculiarly close to 34 24 36.<br>
40 Oz. = Probably Crown Royal, and the mentioned heroin.<br>
<br>
Rock N' Roll fans don't commit crimes in public area's? Wait, wasn't a recent Woodstock considered a complete catastrophe of rape, arson and assault? Hmm, didn't they shrug off Columbine on Marilyn Manson? You cannot blame a type of music on a person's actions. If these people had half-assed parents that taught them to think for themselves I doubt you would see that happen. Personally, my parents are open minded and always were there to guide me. I have heard and seen some nasty shit that makes 99% of the rap lyrics baby talk, but my morals and better judgement always seem to keep me perfectly level-headed.<br>
<br>
Ok, I have three more things to touch on, then I'll stop cause I'm pooped.<br>
<br>
One, in general, a lot of the recent rap does rap about drinking heavily. I catch a lyric about weed here and there. The Thug/G-Thang is just the human behavior of &quot;I want to be tough, don't make me angry&quot;. I rarely catch a rhyme about gang related activities anymore, and I don't recall the last time I heard a rhyme about committing mass murders.<br>
<br>
Two, I enjoy rap because like you stated, it has a comical value for me to. The funniest rapper, in my opinion is Eminem. The situation he raps are just plain hilarious. If he is serious, I don't know but I laugh. I also enjoy it for the beat, I like something I can bob my head to, something I can chill to, and something I can well, rock too, all on one album, usually.<br>
<br>
Three, Garbhad, I was not offended by your remark, but how can you say that rap fans are dullards who just use profanity to prove a point, and cant think straight, when rock fans like to generalize other music categories and argue it on messageboards! Oops, I just generalized too. Sucks, donut?<br>
<br>

Well, one thing in common with rock and rap... is I don't think either really enjoys the men in blue.

You don't catch raps about drugs?  Gimme a break; are you deaf or just so stuck up on your principle that you don't listen to what is being said anymore.

It's the same message that comes through with rap everytime.  I don't have to be a fan to understand it.  The music is about violence and drugs and a lack of respect for authority.  I've heard rap around me for many years now and while the beats and authors of music change, the message remains the same. <p>~<a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=10615">Ghar Durr</a><br>

D12/Eminem do rap about about every drug out there, and murdering his wife. In fact, they talk about having their grandmother suck their dick. IN FACT if you read a little bit about them they are criticizing the actual media and THEREFOR it comes across as comical to a mind that can comprehend the messages as not only a surface meaning. They aren't always criticizing the media, sometimes I wonder if their being serious or not, but I really doubt it. You have to remember that this is a release of stress and anger for some artists, they seem to come across as the most controversial.<br>
<br>
Rappers still 'rep' their former gangs, if they had them. It is just part of the persons upbringing, sadly. I said gang related activities, as in drive by's, graffiti, jumping people in. When rap becomes focused on these I don't really enjoy the lyrics. I usually choose rap artists based on a few friends who are into the DJ scene and listen to nearly every album that comes out. Anything they like I listen to, and choose what I like from that. It's a sweet deal that not everyone has, but the cover and song titles tell a lot.<br>
<br>
That's the problem with it, though, there are so many people that are so stuck on being offended and repulsed by shit that people can't really speak their minds about world issues. They don't know the meaning of parental guidance. Hell, write a detailed poem about life in the Red Light District of Amsterdam. (where complete imbeciles as I have mentioned wouldn't be blind to the drugs and prostitution) I would like to see it not touch on many of the issues that are presented in some rap songs.<br>
<br>
If you don't have enough will power and knowledge to not let rap change your entire way of life, then by all means please don't listen to it.<br>
<br>
Your missing a lot of the meaning, how many articles on the music about the lyrics from the author have you read, exactly? <br>
<br>
Everyone against it was never really a fan, and everyone for it is a fan or once was.<br>
<br>
And, really when I think of it, Ghar who are you to talk about someone disrespecting authority?  I don't know who you think you are talking about that, seeing some of the shit you have said and done in the past. It's important to not come across as a hypocrite. My general vision of you is that if it isn't in your preferred category, it is sub-par and everyone else should change to your ways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ughary.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghary</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/23/01 12:13:32 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://ghareq.homestead.com/files/head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh. repeat myself.</span><hr size=1> &quot;You have to remember that this is a release of stress and anger for some artists, they seem to come across as the most controversial.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep that makes it okay to sing about murder of your wife and rape of women.  Riiiiight....  Because that is what most rappers believe in, a general disregard for decency.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rappers still 'rep' their former gangs, if they had them. It is just part of the persons upbringing, sadly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep just as I figured.  Just a lack of personal responsibility.  So he shouldn't faulted for that.  Lets all pity the rapper for a poor upbringing and because of this anything he says should go unchecked.  He had a hard childhood, poor him.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the problem with it, though, there are so many people that are so stuck on being offended and repulsed by shit that people can't really speak their minds about world issues. They don't know the meaning of parental guidance.&quot;<br>
<br>
And there are others who are so hellbent on proving to us that rap is a decent form of art, but can't put together two coherent sentances to do so.  You wonder why others get offended.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your missing a lot of the meaning, how many articles on the music about the lyrics from the author have you read, exactly? &quot;<br>
<br>
I think when eminem raps about his pills and murdering his wife I get the meaning clear enough. <br>
<br>

<br>
Now this is funny.  You can't debate the facts so you go bringing other things into this.  But it figures.  This will be the last conversation I have with you Xuilidar.  Talking to ignorant people with no mind of their own but to spill emotion all out onto the table doesn't make a fun debate.<br>
<br>
&quot;My general vision of you is that if it isn't in your preferred category, it is sub-par and everyone else should change to your ways. &quot;<br>
<br>
I'm so glad you've figured out my whole life from an online persona!  Its okay Xuilidar, mommy is right there to make it okay for you now.  If anything is comical about rap, as you pointed out in your post, its the mindless fans that listen to it.  If anything this whole thread has been comical because of how wound up you drones get over rap music and how cool it is. <p>~<a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?s=&postid=10615">Ghar Durr</a><br>
