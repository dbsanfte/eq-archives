If your not there... you're not raiding the place... If you have 50 people in sro... 0 in hate... its not being 'raided'.  If your not there you cant claim it sad to say.  Thats the way the server and most have molded.  Back in the day when i was in ToE and we regularly raided planes we ran into the same problem.  It became basically a race if you want to raid.<br>
<br>
I recall a particular occasion especially... where 3 guilds were mobilizing for hate... we all knew about it... but we prepped 2-3 groups up fast and zoned in asap... and 'claimed' it so to speak.  And left 50 people from other guilds sitting in the dust with no raid to go to.  Then after rest could mobilize they came in... sometimes its only and best thing you can do.  It can be shitty but with their popularity thats what we have to deal with =/.<br>

<br>
<br>
I saw on our /guildmotd Last night that Hate was planned for CH today at 5pm - I proceeded to tell my guild that you were having an open raid in Hate at 7pm and I didn't think it was right. Skyla/Soldaris said that our raid (CH) had been planned for a week, but I didn't know that - only saw it on MOTD last night. <br>

And a guildleader at that. Would realize that just becouse you post a raid thats gives you zero rights to it when your planned time comes. The only things that matter are numbers and location. If you do not have the people in place first you got absolutely no claim to the plane or mob or whatever. CH was totally in the right to goto a empty Hate and start raiding it. And should not be catching flack becouse you posted you wanted to do a open raid on said day and time.  <p>Wyrmwood B'Dynn 60 Grave Lord <BR>

The only &quot;wipe out&quot; we has was when we got the Corrupter of life down below half and he ate us...  But considering that we had just around 20 people up there.. most of which were below lvl 55.. we did Really good. We even got one of our Pallys a nice 23dmg 27 dly 1hs .. whatever its called Dark metal something.<br>
  <br>
    but as to the original post... You cant claim a dungeon on a board. There have been MANY times when CH was going to raid something only to see that it was taken. Its no big deal when this happens... You just move on.. see what IS open, and shit you CAN take.<br>
    <br>
     I dont know what your veliosu faction is, but i can almost bet that a place like Kael was open for you to raid. <br>
     There isnt anything wrong when some one else beats you out to a dungeon or spawn... It can be a little frustrating but it happens. <br>
     To be honest i didnt even know about hate today until i logged on lol... it wasnt this thing that was planned out weeks in advance like you make it sound like it was.. Unless Dikidoo and some other officers are tactical super computers that are able to some how calculate who will be on and when.. to plan out raids weeks in advace. That would own, but i really doubt that.<br>
     <br>
       This is what i run through my head when i want to raid something.. and maybe this can help you out..  What man power is avalible? ... What will be open? .. Are we able to do this? .. How much time will this take?..<br>
       A while ago kinrea suggested that we have raids on a set date, but not a set dungeon because that never works. That seems like a decent idea as well. <br>
        My point is that there are always options... And i do not see in anyway how CH was in the wrong here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soldarislamerchant>Soldaris LaMerChant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/12/01 3:31:45 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Nalice_LM/SOLD2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> sorry hoe no had one wipeout and that was at 4am est....umm...and that was on 2nd floor doing it with 3 clerics and 30 peeps...kiss off....<br>

<br>
<br>
I know that a great deal of people knew about hate on Saturday.  I heard it come up in several conversations, and many friends I have in smaller guilds were excited to get the chance to go up to hate.<br>
<br>
I was preparing to leave Kael to go join Aurelle when I got a tell form my brother.<br>
<br>
Niliamann:  DAMMIT!<br>
Me:  ???<br>
Niliamann:  Chaotic Horde went up to hate!!!<br>
Me:  LOL that's gonna piss off alot of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
I sent a tell to Aurelle, and she said they ported up 45 minutes before the open raid was going to.<br>
<br>
<br>
I won't make an argument over whether or not Chaotic Horde had the right to jump ahead to hate.  Of course they did.  First in force as always.  I don't think anyone will deny them that right.<br>
<br>
<br>
What I will argue is that it was a shitty thing to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
If anyone in Chaotic Horde says that the guild was unknowledgable as to the open raid, they're full of shit.  Your own member posted here stating that the matter was discussed.  Additionally, I see a fair number of Chaotic Horde posting here regularly.  To have missed out on seeing the raid post could only come from complete ingorance.  It's been up in the commons section for over a week, at the top of the board usually.  40+ responses.<br>
<br>
And as I stated before, there were several people talking about it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there was a very large number of people in sro ready to attend the raid.  You cannot aruge that it was a case of misscommunication.<br>
<br>
<br>
Organizing open raids takes a shitload of work.  Not exhibiting the decency to respect that time shows bad taste.<br>
<br>
Again, not arguing that Chaotic Horde doesn't have the right to go up.  By all means they did.<br>
<br>
But you just trampled over something that you shouldn't have.<br>
<br>
 |<br>

\|/<br>
<br>
<br>
If it shows up correctly that was a down arrow.  I know that Chaotic Horde shut-down a large-scale raid which had been highly publicized for many people today.  That's where you fell in my eyesight, as well as in the sight of many other people.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I feel that whoever lead the Chaotic Horde raid owes a great deal of people an apology for the lack of judgement shown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And how does anyone die to the corruptor of life? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/umckener.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mckener</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/12/01 7:30:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> [QUOTE]If anyone in Chaotic Horde says that the guild was unknowledgable as to the open raid, they're full of shit.[/QUOTE]<br>
Why? I run the chaotic horde website myself and even I dont check our own message boards every day.. Sometimes I dont check it for 2-3 days. I checked our message board the day before the raid. I saw that one post kinrea had but I didnt even read the whole thing. I just skimmed threw the post not even noticeing a date or anything because I wasn't interested. So im going to tell you I did know about the raid but I didn't know when it was and I didn't care, I can tell you now that half of Chaotic Horde doesnt even know the address to our own website. So if you say im full of shit so be it.<br>

We dont spend it reading message boards for hours on end (atleast most of us.) To think that a simple post, on a message board that half the server doesnt even traffic on a consistent bases, gives your raid validity or a reservation or what not is ridiculous. If you want to reserve something, go call a restaurant. There are enough issues in this game to deal with to have added to it the point you need to skim a message board every so many minutes to make sure so-and-so hasn't made a reservation at Cafe del Hate. <br>
<br>
Fact is you may have been in S Ro, but S Ro isnt Hate. And unless your raiding S Ro, you don't have much of a raid do you. Chaotic Horde mobilized and you didn't, you snooze you lose.  One phrase you should always keep in mind when raiding - First in Force. This isn't a phrase reserved for &quot;uber&quot; guilds. Your no more special than anyone else who claws and scratches for a raid. <br>
<br>
And cut out the entire throwing around of &quot;We're not HnE or OoP or &lt;insert guild&gt;.&quot; You are not excluded from the rules that all servers abide by just because you are not one of the servers &quot;uber&quot; guilds. We fight for our raids just as Chaotic Horde does just as GoL etc do. You are and should be no different, because fact is, your just another guild. So stop spending so much time posting your raid intentions and more time mobilizing to them.<br>

He said that the few CH's who did know of this raid didn't publicize it to us, that's not exactly true but this apparently isn't something taamas is aware of, that is OK.  I know that Kinrea did try to alert us of Aurelle's plans, despite the fact that it was not her responsibility to do so.  It is not anyone's responsibility to do so.  The fact is, Saryrn is finally growing up.  If someone wants to organize an &quot;open guild raid&quot; which sadly never works out well anyways, they need to make contact with the leaders of EVERY guild that could feasibly do the raid they want to do and find a date which can be aggreed upon.  If this cannot be done, there is no guarantee that a conflict will not occur. (although even if you do have an agreement w/ every major guild leader, a conflict may still occur and the First in Force rule will still apply, it is just much less likely a conflict will occur.)  If anyone thinks it is too much trouble to try to work out a suitable time (i myself think it would be FAR too much work) then that person should not get upset if their open raid gets canceled.<br>

I was a member of a guild that to this day I believe will never be plane ready. So what to do? Join a guild that is! Fuk open raids.  You can't trust the peeps and you can't be sure you will have a fair chance at the loot. So either stick to Norrath or join a guild that can do raids without any outside help.<br>

As to CH knowing or not knowing, I would mobilize just to beat you there myself just because I am a bich that way. WTG Soldaris and don't apologize to them, let them go elsewhere. <br>

a group?<br>
2 groups?<br>
<br>
Are levels a factor?<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm being silly in asking for useful information here, but how should someone get several folks together for a planes raid, without having all the crap happen that I have read above? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uphelony.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phelony</A> at: 8/13/01 7:52:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uqualan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qualan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/13/01 7:53:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> Yes, level is a factor, Basicly the higher the level, the lower the force needed to do the planes<br>
<br>
for the &quot;normal&quot; hate fist floor i think you need around 2 groups o be called to be in force, except whn the groups are pretty much 50 and below, in which case you will need around 3 groups<br>
<br>
Now i don't know if som eof the big well established guilds like OOP will do that area with one group of 60's or not, you better ask them that question :-)<br>
<br>
seems to me that they probably will consider one lvl 60-ish group enough of a force to claim the plan as they can probably clear the ground floor as is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rule of thumb on raids, the higher the level ombined with raiding experience will make the need for bigger groups progressively smaller--note the raiding experience-- You still need to operate as a team to do it :-)<br>
