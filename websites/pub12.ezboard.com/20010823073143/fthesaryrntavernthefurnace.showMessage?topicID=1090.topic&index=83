<br>
In another post you said this: &quot;What I belive no ones business but my own. &quot;<br>
<br>
And yet when someone says the're christian, you take it upon yourself to make it your business and insult them.<br>
<br>
Last I checked in these threads, it has been people like you whos doing the provoking, the religious group has merely been defending their faith(mostly).  So how exactly are we &quot;The religous fruit cakes insist on shoving their ideas down everyone elses throats, by gun point, allienation, and good old fashion brain washing.&quot;  Yup i'm the one trying to shove my ideas down your throat, i guess thats why your the one insulting a huge amount of people around the globe because they believe in something you don't think exists.<br>
<br>
This is for not only Macalister, but the others who are posting like him.  What I'm saying is even though their are many people posting &quot;I feel sorry for people who dont believe in God.&quot;  Most still respect your beliefs and are not out-right flaming you for your belief.  If we can respect your belief(or non-belief) why the bloody hell do you insist on insulting ours?<br>
<br>
I will agree on some of your views about the Bible, most of it is very outdated, yet i grew up with it, and I have my reasons for not agreeing with it, instead of just outright flaming it.  Do you really know what &quot;turn the other cheek means?&quot;  or &quot;it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, than for a rich man to go to heaven&quot; means?  If you do then I'll shut up right now because your talking about your dislike of the religion/bible from experience, and not just an outsiders view of it.  Oh, and neither of those quotes are anywhere close to what most people think they mean today.<br>
<br>
Now I'm not agreeing with everything the Church has done, nor are they perfect, or are their leaders perfect.  I am saying though that when a common belief has lasted this long without people finding a huge fualt in it (kinda hard when the Church uses that lame &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot; excuse which i think is what Verant's &quot;The Vision&quot; was based on) that there must be something more to it than we can comprehend.<br>
<br>
wow I certainly got off topic from lifebanes post didnt I..<br>
<br>
Well on topic..Why the hell if there is a newscast&quot;10 adults and 1 child killed today&quot; everyone cries about the kid... who cares about adults anyways? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukeeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/12/01 1:58:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMFG (not eq related)</span><hr size=1> Please know that the following is not to insult, demean, or offend anyone. It is the logical arguement that was asked for in another post as to why I don't believe Atheism.On <br>
<br>
Evolutionism-<br>
<br>
Basic Theory of evolution- Over time, organisms “change” or “evolve”. The modern humans are evolved from lower life forms, those life forms evolved from even lower life forms, and those life forms were (if you go down far enough) eventually formed by the random chance combination of molecules.<br>
<br>
1) Fossil record<br>
<br>
Colin Patterson, senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, yr. unk., <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If I knew of any (evolutionary transitions), fossil or living, I would certainly have included them (In my book Evolution) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
David Raup, curator of the Field Museum of Natural History, yr unk<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We are now 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species, but the situation hasn’t changed much- we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So in other words, there is NO TRANSITION POINT between humans and monkeys or between ANY OTHER ORGANISM that has ever been found. But you saw some in the news early, you say? Lets address those now...<br>
<br>
Archaeopteryx- This is the so-called “transition” between birds and dinosaurs that’s been found.<br>
<br>
Hank Haangraph, The Face, 1998<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  First, fossils of the Archaeopteryx and the type of dinosaur Archaeopteryx was supposedly formed from were both found in a fine-ground German Limestone formation said to be late Jurassic. Thus, Archaeopteryx is not a likely candidate as the missing link, since birds and their alleged ancestral dinosaurs thrived during the same period of time. In addition, it should be noted that a great deal of controversy has occurred in the evolutionary community as a result of other bird fossils classified by scientists as “Late Triassic” (prior to Jurassic) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thus… bids were found in times millions of years before Archaeopteryx fossils.<br>
<br>
2) Ape-men<br>
<br>
I’m just going to us direct quotes from Haangraph… these “fossils” are so ridiculous its almost funny.<br>
<br>
Would be if people didn’t believe it, at least.<br>
<br>
The Java man-<br>
<br>
Hank Haangraph, The Face, 1998<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  What is not so well known is that the Java man consists of nothing more than a skullcap, a femur, 3 teeth, and a great deal of imagination. Even more disturbing is the fact that the femur was found 50 feet away and a full year later. Most unsettling of all is that for almost 30 years, Duboius downplayed the discovery of 2 human skulls, which he found in close proximity to his “find” <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The Piltdown man<br>
<br>
Hank Haangraph, The Face, 1998<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> While the Pithecanthropus erectus (Java man) can best be placed in the category of fiction, Piltdown man (Eoanthropus dawsoni) may be factually described as a fraud. While the fraud may have been cleverly concieved, it was crudely carried out. The jaw of an ape was stained to make it appear as though it matched a human skull; the piltdown fossils along with accompanying bones were not only stained but reshaped. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Marvin Lubenow:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The file marks on the orangutan teeth of the lower jaw were clearly visible. The molars were misaligned and filed at two different angles. The canine tooth had been filed at two different angles. The canine tooth had been filed so far down that the pulp cavity had been exposed and plugged. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now onto the possibilities of humanity evolving from a single-celled organism (indirectly).<br>
<br>
CHARLES DARWIN, THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES, 18??<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To suppose an eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of a spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Biochemist Michael Behe, yr. unk.,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Each of the anatomical structures Darwin thought were so simple actually involves staggeringly complicated biochemical processes <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Finally, I think this statistical argument- based solely on mathematics and the laws of statistics, sums up why I believe evolution is absurd.<br>
<br>
Coppedge, yr. unk.,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The probability of a single protein molecule being arranged by chance is 10^161, using all atoms on Earth and allowing all the time since the world began… for a minimum set of the required 239 proteins for the smallest theoretical life, the probability is 1 in 10^119,841. It would take 10^119841 years on the average to get a set of such proteins. That is 10^119,831 times the assumed age of the Earth and is a figure with 119,831 zeroes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
I have lots, lots more if anyone finds problems of holes in these arguments. I didn’t even touch cosmotogolgy… and I’m sure some of my fellows have arguments I’ve never even heard of.<br>
<br>
BTW, MacAlister... pick up the book &quot;The Face&quot; at your local Christian bookstore... maybe those teachers weren't as right as you thought.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you just want to burn it or ignore it like the very sort of person you've been insulting... go for it.<br>
