If you dont want the long story, just jump to the bottom where the real important message is.<br>
<br>
This kind of human garbage is personified on the saryrn server in a druid by the name of Dreamie. I would give you her surname, but its changed so many times I am unable to keep track.<br>
<br>
This will be one of those long ass posts, so grab some popcorn.<br>
<br>
Dreamie came to the server to help a real life friend 'rebuild' a guild. Defender of the Faith. As long as you dont look beyond the surface too far, you will see a charismatic, energetic, flirtatious druid who is 40ish, who is very quick to tell you about all the wonderful things that 'she has done'.<br>
<br>
However, scratch a little below that shiney surface, and you will find a person who is so deplorable, so gut wrenchingly ugly, that you just may gasp in horror. Heres the dill'yo.<br>
<br>
Husband Number 1: Kadran was a sweet guy, if a little quiet, I cant remember his race (humanish or elvish) or his class (either warrior or pally) but Dreamie and Kadrans wedding was the biggest guild event in recent history (at that time). Loving couple blah blah blah. Well, for some reason *gasp* right after they exchanged EQ vows, things fell apart. Dreamies version..? She said that he was 'abusive', neglectful, arrogant, treated her badly (isnt that the same as abusive?) lied etc. Kadrans version? Dreamie had asked him to call her in RL and he really didnt want to because she is married with a child. EQ cyberfucking is one thing, poking his nose in the door in RL was another. So she trashed his reputation, he left the server, and a lot of friends, and she gets her way. Oh.. and I should mention that before they were 'eqily divorced' dreamie had started to hang out with two other guys, brothers in real life. One of which was to be her next EQ husband, and, in front of Kadran, while still 'eq married' emoted &quot;Dreamie looks down *not Kadrans* pants to see what there and becomes VERY excited.&quot;<br>
<br>
My theory is that if you are going to RP to the point of getting married, you should at least RP a little respect. Or EQ marry someone with the same attitude.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Enter the two fresh victims, and me. I was in the same guild as her btw, DoF. One day, as a measly level 16 year old, i was out soloing aviaks and I get a tell from her, asking me to come out and help her. Me being 16, her being 29, Im all like o.0.  She wanted me to flirt with one of these two guys, one in particular, so that he 'wouldnt be jealous' of her flirtations with the other. I did so, but I actually did get along really well with the one that i was supposed to be flirting with, and not long after we ended up getting EQ married, which was too much for her to swallow. She told this guy (whom I have an affection for in RL, which she knew about fully) that I was screwing my roomate. UNtrue. Complete, maliscious lie intended to seperate me from my now in game husband, Ajantus. If this isnt enough, on the day I announced in guild that me and Aj were doing the deed, she sends me a tell, saying that her half of the duo had just asked her too. Which was also untrue. She had to sulk and pout upwards of an hour to get him to ask her. To boot, she ran around telling people that i had &quot;stolen one of her men&quot;. A)Ajantus never WAS her man. b) She practically begged me to come out to OT, a place where i would not have gotton any xp at all, and very little loot, to 'fix her situation'. Anyway, Me an Aj were married, all was well. Her and hers got hitched, all went well, until he made it clear that, although he cared about her blah, she wasnt his sun, moon, earth, and stars, and that he too needed to play and level. Because *DUH* its a game. She threw a hissy fit one night and he left the guild (which he had joined to be near her) and she proceeded to trash talk him like you would not believe. Now, he and my hubby are really good friends. RL, EQ etc. My eq hubby is a rather soft spoken person, who tends to see things the way they are. I personally have spent many hours grouped with this guy. he is a) a good player. B) a nice guy c) considerate, kind, fair just blah blah blah. His only seeming 'fault' in my eyes is that he is sometimes a bit of a flirt. Who the hell isnt? Anyway.. they get a divorce, and, get this... She wants his last name. Just so he doesnt have to deal with her, he drops it. A couple days later so does she. <br>
<br>
Cut to present time.<br>
<br>
I am bopping about the message boards for my old guild, because I really do love them all truly. Great people. (1 exception *growl*) And I see that someone who I have always considered to be a very close friend has agreed to marry this wench. Although this really slices through me like you wouldnt believe, it really is his decision. I can see how he would be able to ignore the vileness of her her nature too, as he is quite trusting, and she is a very good liar and actress. But, a different game friend of mine, also incensed at his choice of bride, basically asked him &quot;Wtf&quot; and whether he was right in doing that or not, Dreamie decided to slam his in game wife, a very sweet person who has 'honestly' gone out of her way to help people, with insult after insult. Calling her a slut, etc blah. This girl now has her on ignore.<br>
<br>
~~~~<br>
<br>
Anyway, I guess the crux of it all is this..<br>
<br>
Dreamie = Backstabbing, lying, manipulative, insecure, self serving slut, who, by the way, cannot play her class as well. She is the only mid-40's druid I have EVER seen who cannot quad kite.. heh. I doubt she can even single kite yet.<br>
<br>
Seeldar = New husband. Wonderful guy, plays his class well, awesome sense of humor, trustworthy.<br>
<br>
Please, PLEASE, when this 'eq marraige' falls apart, and she starts slamming his reputation, please PLEASE do NOT LISTEN TO HER. I have seen too many of my friends, drawn in by her black-hole like personality leave the vortex beaten and half dead, and mostly devoid of EQ enthusiasm. And, do yourself a favor, do not involve yourself with her in anyway. She has gotton groups killed with her ignorance and feigned 'knowledge' of the game, she has screwed up much needed good reputations, which are needed to obtain groups at higher levels, she has dragged Real life into a game repeatedly, insistantly, and for some of us, has screwed part of it up, and in all honesty, for everyone that she says she has helped, i can only find one or two instances of it, and they were minor and on days when nothing else better could be found to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this tirade fucks up my reputation, so be it. Its the truth, and if you decide to ignore what Ive said you will find out for yourself, because she is like a sexual disease. Everyone she fucks with, gets it. Im willing to retire Sycha, my main, if I have to, for whatever reason I may have to, to warn everyone else what she is, and possibly to save Seel's rep.<br>
<br>
Any questions, just ask. Im tired of not speaking up out of some inane need to not damage the matter further.<br>
<br>

The people who really know & group with these "husbands" will know the truth and thats really all that matters in the end. Sure, it eats you up inside, but in reality it's just bringing you down to the same level as that which you hate. EQ's ability to make things seem real intimate and personal to people is both a bane and a wonderful experiance. Those people will learn eventually and everyone will be better off for it & you'll be glad you didn't get involved... (Although, it seems its a bit too late for that now...) Just remember, as in everything, what goes around comes around and the people that are doing wrong will get theirs in the end... <p><html><body><font face="arial" color=CC0033 size=2><b>Kinrea Keres</b><br>

What a b*tch.  I believe she has a very low IQ in RL because she was not able to comprehend that a camp was TAKEN, and did not need to be shared as we were clearing the whole camp AS SOON as it spawned.  She threatened me with /petitions and /reports and mentioned something about me swearing at her which I never did.  Delusional. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uwhitetrashwarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WhiteTrashWarrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(7/30/01 1:28:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Its time Dreamie's bull* ends.</span><hr size=1> I &quot;cyber&quot; with the hookers up in the Blind Fish on occasional.
