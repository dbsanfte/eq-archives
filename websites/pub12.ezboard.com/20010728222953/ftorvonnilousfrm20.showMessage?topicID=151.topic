<br>
As far as when does he become FFA: If there is no raid scheduled to take him down in the near future, and he's up, then he's FFA. The person organizing the spur-of-the-moment raid could come post on the board here that they're doing so, but it's not critical by any means. <br>
<br>
I see no need or likelihood that Naggy will go FFA on this server. If the people organizing raids in advance and scheduling them can try to schedule and do Naggy within a day or so of his spawn time there's no reason whatsoever for higher level guilds to kill him. If one of those raids falls through or doesn't kill him, then someone else needs to take care of it. <br>

Vox?  FFA?</span><hr size=1> What does this have to do with BoW? Stay on topic please.<br>
<br>
If a scheduled Naggy raid fails to kill him then yes he becomes FCFS (first come first serve) for that spawn. If no Naggy raid is scheduled he becomes FCFS for that spawn. (I dislike the term FFA because it connotes kill-stealing, raid-jumping etc.)<br>
<br>
Naggy spawns once a week predictably, barring patches. If you want to schedule Naggy go ahead, people have been and still are doing that, just note the last date he was killed and add one week (or two weeks, or three weeks, etc. as you can be sure he will be killed reliably within 24 hours of spawn).<br>
<br>
If there is a patch, note the date of the patch. That becomes a schedulable date for Naggy as he will be up after a patch.<br>
<br>
If you've got a raid scheduled 2 or 3 days after a Naggy pop you should move your schedule either ahead to the spawn or further back to a week from the spawn. There is too much interest in producing rez sticks for a general agreement to let him stay up waiting on a reservation more than 24 hours.<br>
<br>
As far as Vox is concerned, she has the same spawn time but is not under the same pressure to be killed as the consequences of leaving her spawned are minimal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uxertonv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XertonV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#122950>(5/26/01 1:56:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy?  Vox?  FFA?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, okay let me clear some things up.  This post was in NO WAY a flame.  It was a simple inquiry as I had NOT SEEN any specific rules stated for what happens to these dragons if raids get canceled, so I just wanted to know if a raid is canceled does it automatically become the first person who gets a group together gets it?  <br>
<br>
That question I believe was answered in the affirmative, so let's leave it there.  I understand that Naggy is essentially a hinderance for the cleric epic, BUT as a Paladin my epic revolves around this &quot;hinderance.&quot;  With stated rules as to what is allowed in case of failed raids, I would and could put together a raid in a short period to kill these dragons as quickly as possible, making everyone happy.  I NEED to get in AS MANY Naggy/Vox raids as possible, or never lvl to 53.<br>
<br>
I mean, how the hell you even brought it into a BoW/Rokar flame boggles me.  Get a grip already!  There's a reason this is in the &quot;Dragons&quot; section, because it deals with DRAGONS.  If this was in the &quot;I'm jealous of Blades of Wrath or I just like bitchin' about stuff&quot; section, then maybe these posts would be on topic.  That's what I get for posting a simple question.<br>

Nagafen I'd consider FFA if he isn't killed ASAP. So, if you have a Naggy raid scheduled for say Thursday, and he's up on Tuesday, kill him. If not, I (and more than a few other people from other guilds) will assemble a force to kill him as soon as possible. <br>
<br>
Some may say this is disrespecting someone's reservation. But ask any of the Clerics on the Ragefire list if they give a flying (oopsie!) about your reservation, when a lot of them have been waiting 2, 3, hell 5 months to finish a quest that they really should've been done with ages ago.<br>

Sorry but I think you might be overreacting just a tad on this one. Nagafen, I'll say again, is a special case in that he is THE bottleneck and roadblock to attaining the single most useful (to the Cleric and everyone they group with, their guild, and the server as a whole) epic weapon in all of EverQuest. Take a look at the Ragefire list. Do you honestly think it's ever going to get shorter? I don't. Neither do a lot of people. Nagafen WILL NOT stay up for days at a time. Under no circumstances.<br>

Reserve Nagafen by SPAWN, not date. <p><P>

Feeling threatened? Maybe it's because you're one of those people who wouldn't mind seeing Nagafen up for 5 days at a time, eh?<br>

<br>
Oh and remember, Vox and Nagafen have a level cap. So any raid on them will have to be done by people under 52. thx info~<br>
<br>
And next time you need a rez, make sure it's not a stick rez. Since you want to do nothing to alleviate or HELP the situation. I don't think anyone cares HOW he's killed. As long as he's killed as soon as he spawns.<br>
