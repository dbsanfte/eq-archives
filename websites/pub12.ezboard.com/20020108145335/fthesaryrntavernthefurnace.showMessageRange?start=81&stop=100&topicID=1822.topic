<br>
No one even bothered to try and refute Tain's and My argument that in the last 10 years all rap has been a copy of Straight out of Compton in it's lyrics and style. Not one artist in the rap world has tried to do anything different. You can not refute that. They use the same recycled bullshit everytime they create an album. They either speak about drugs, killing, beating women, or about themselves and how fly they are now that they are making records. <br>
<br>
What you rap advocates aren't getting, is that sure while not all rap is gangsta rap, the entire industry is predominantly based off of it, and the fact that it's advocated in such a vast majority of it's fans shows that the actions of it's artists are also advocated and even encouraged.  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20411>Garbhad Brainbender</a><br><a href=http://www.ezboard.com/messages/alert_spamblock.html>Phantasmist</a><br>

Another thing Garb, you say that those that advocate rap also advocate what is being said? Thats pure speculation and downright apalling that you would think that.  I listen to rap, but I in no way condone raping women, killing people, doing drugs or any of that sort.

<br>
I disagree with this statement, I myself listen to all kinds of music even some rap, but am mainly a metal head. If that statement was true where Metal is concerned I'd be a huge advocate for drugs, suicide, etc.. IMO it all depends on the person and how weak minded they are to listen to lyrics and live by them, alot of people I know just like the music cause it sounds good to them regardless of what the lyrics are about.<br>
<br>

Hmm seems this was said by me...oh wait yes it was...<br>
<br>
If you had bothered to read everything, you would have noticed this line. I said that not all rap was gangsta rap. Hell Run DMC and Sugar Hill Gang are not gangsta rap. However, the fact that most of the more popular artists are of the Gangsta Rap genre it shows the mentality of the fans. While you Arkay may not condone it. Many of the fans do. They want to hear the latest adventures of their favorite rapper. Which is a sad state of affairs. The fact that this is what sells is wrong. Also Arkay, if you don't condone the actions of the gangsta rap genre in the lyrics they use, then what about them attracts you to it? If it's just the beats, then why not get a cd that has just beats on it? <br>
<br>
Valrya pointed out A Tribe Called Quest. Now, here is a band that while in the hip hop genre is more of a fusion/funk/jazz band. I have 2 albums myself that I purchased back in highschool 10 years ago. However, them not being in the gangsta genre rules them out of the equation. Their music, if you listen to it, a lot of it is based loosely off of Miles Davis. The sound behind it is quite noticable. <br>
<br>
I am done arguing, as it seems no one can come up with undisputable evidence to refute anything I or anyone else has said.  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20411>Garbhad Brainbender</a><br><a href=http://www.ezboard.com/messages/alert_spamblock.html>Phantasmist</a><br>

Sorry Garb but I'm tired and feeling stupid right now.. but you are saying that all rap is gangsta rap nowadays, yet when I point out some rappers that aren't gangsta rap, they are out of the equation BECAUSE they aren't gangsta rap?<br>

Compare the record sells of Nsync and Britney Spears to anything else with an ounce of talent.  Most of MTV and pop music is crap.  I put most gangsta rap into the &quot;pop&quot; category because that's what it is.  Popular MTV metal, rap, and punk IS crap.  MTV tends to take one talented band that did something different and happened to sell records at the same time and mass market about 50 clones along with it because they know it makes money.  What was refreshing at first becomes stale and old in less than a month after MTV catches on to it.<br>
<br>
Remember the 80s?  Metal was mass marketed in a crap fluffy form at those times just like rap is today.  A billion crappy clones singing about meaningless crap and putting out a frivolous image.  Poison, Winger, etc... It was bad, but there was still metal out there that was good, even if it didn't sell as well as Motley Crue.<br>
<br>
My point is that you shouldn't blast an ENTIRE genre of music because the popular mass marketed form of it is bad, because there's still stuff out there that's good even if it's not as popular.  People who say that &quot;All rap is crap because it's all violent&quot; when all they've heard is the gangsta stuff are making fallacious statements because not all rap = gangsta.  Someone CAN be a hip hop fan without liking gangsta rap.  There are rap songs by hip hop artists completely criticizing gangsta rap.  The *form of music itself* isn't bad, and I find it very refreshing to listen to when I don't feel like hearing guitars and just want a mellow beat to chill to.  You said yourself, you have a Tribe album.. congratulations, you listen to rap, or have enjoyed it at one time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukhama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khama</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(12/24/01 3:50:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2pac and Biggie</span><hr size=1> Ugghhhh......

I kinda liked Eminem's stuff, one or 2 of the singles that were released. Turns out he's just a complete and utter reject and waste of air. Marshall Mathers doomed Eminem from the start, no matter how good his albums were.<br>

Gangsta rap. Welcome to ghetto culture 101. Hi my name is Tyrone &quot;Stereotype&quot; Jones. I was raised by my mother, as my father got her pregnant and left us. She had to assume both the punisher/provider and comforter roles for a lack of male authority around the house, and she did a decent job. However, because she was so busy trying to provide for my well-being, I started into drugs, gangs, and the like. It is more important where I come from the be the biggest, strongest, &quot;baddest mamma-jamma&quot; than to receive things like an education, or get a job. In fact, because those rascals who do study and get good grades think they are better than me, I have to seek them out and eliminate them, for they are a threat. There is only one way to influence people, and that is through fear. There is only one fear that prevails among all people, and that is the fear of death. Regardless of my willingness to go through with the task of ending someone's life, if I threaten it, things will go my way. <br>
<br>
I must constantly keep up the appearance of physical/social superiority, lest my own social standing be damaged. I walk different from everyone else to display my superiority. I wear my clothes in a style that represents that I have no scruples, and would likely cause you bodily harm should you interfere with me. I am ruled by the fear that someone else will be stronger than I, thus making me weak. I must dominate all that I can. I can write rhymed verses about how tough I am, how much other people don't really mean anything, and set a beat to it. I will use &quot;rap&quot; as my way showing everyone what a bad ass I am.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tupac/Biggie<br>
Wait a minute, that rap stuff really pays off. I'm rich now, but I still want to dominate others. I know, I'll rap about how much more money I have than you, or how good my &quot;rhymes&quot; are. I have to compete with other people who rap about the same stuff I do. Hmm.. I know I'll rap about how much better an artist I am or how everyone else sucks. After I get shot at a few times, I'll rap about how much it sucks to have to dodge bullets, how sad and dangerous my gangsta life is, and how I wish I'd never gotten involved. Wow.. even more money. Hmm.. seems I'm not tough enough any more. I know, I'll go to court for my past transgressions! Whoops, I'm dead now.<br>

<br>
Sorry- I'm deaf irl, so I cant provide a better argument than what is simple to me, if it's bad, it's bad, if it has a good moral that will make the world a better place, in any way, then it's good.<br>
<br>
Rapping, singing, harmonicaing (lol) about killing is quite apparently bad. Those who sing about it are just trash. To say people like Tupac and Biggie contributed to the world is utterly bullshit.<br>
<br>
The real people who tried to change the world are those little people doing the things behind the scenes to help us all. I mean, really, they could rap all day about how the world could change, and it wont mean jack shit unless they are doing what they preach.<br>

<br>
and its obvious if you dont like the genre of music then what you say against it makes perfect sense too YOU, but mine and many others opinions will never be swayed on the issue of rap being the same recycled crap or &quot;it breeds violence&quot; arguement.<br>
<br>
I could easily say that all country music singers are losers who cant keep a girlfriend or a truck or a dog...<br>
<br>
I could easily say all heavy metal is about devil worshipping and its all been the same for years because they play guitars...<br>
<br>
But the fact of the matter is that no one will ever win an arguement about music because every arguement is completely bias no matter how you look at it. It is impossible not to be bias with music because your either going to like or your not going to like it. Be it because you THINK its all recycled crap or because you THINK that it's very original and something you like to listen too. Everyone I know loves pink floyd I think they're crap... I dont need to argue my reasons why because they arent gonna go hey dude your right I think my floyd cd's are gonna be drink coasters now...<br>
<br>

<br>
Garbhad I got some news for you.... <br>
<br>
About slim to none of the gangsta rap you hear is performed by people that are still gangstas... give me a break man the second they can afford to get off the streets they came from you better believe they do it. Tupac was never even a banger in the first place... he went to dancing and acting school in case you didnt know, in fact the only time he put on that hard ass image was when he was around suge knight and deathrow. I will be the first to admit that suge knight is a fuck though.<br>
<br>
I have been into the rap scene for years now and for the past year been trying to make my own rap music. I have met many many people inside the industry (probably no one you've heard of because its obvious you dont like rap music) and you'll be surprised to know that they are all very intelligent, down to earth people. I also know about a million and a half rap fans and even more surprising is that they too are very intelligent down to earth people! wow huh?<br>
<br>
I'm sure it's very easy for you to categorize music by skimming the bad apples off the top of the barrel and then basing your opinion for the whole genre on that. However you can trust me on this, you know about nothing when it comes down to the majority or the type of people who make rap music and the type of people who listen to it. <br>
<br>
I can understand if it's not your cup of tea, but I really wish people wouldn't throw about every generalization and stereotype at something that isn't their cup of tea. Oh and then on top of that try to attack the intelligence of the people who try and defend it. <br>
<br>
Like it or not rap is the modern day rock. Remember when your parents wouldn't let you go to that KISS concert way back when? It is because of the fact that they took their small amount of un-researched knowledge on the music and then based all of their opinions on that, much much like people do today with rap music. <br>
<br>
So Garbhad and folks you can continue playing Tipper Gore now I've said my piece.<br>
<br>
and if I am lucky I mean really lucky Ghar and LordUlric will point out my spelling mistakes... point out my grammar mistakes and I'll feel like I won the lottery =P. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1822.topic&start=121&stop=136>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1836.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1839.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=1822.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=1822.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1822.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1822.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntavernfrm14">Attack on America<option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm16">Shadows of Luclin<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://clicks.about.com/157/spkcpa.asp?PM=485_d_ezboard_spcpa&rURL=https%3A//sprinks.about.com/userforms/create_user.htm%3Fpc%3Dd_ezboard" target="_blank">
