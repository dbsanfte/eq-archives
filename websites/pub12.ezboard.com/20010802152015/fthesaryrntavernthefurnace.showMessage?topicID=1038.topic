Being a lamebrain I though this was a partner guild &quot;Tribunal of Norrath member Auralee&quot; so I sent her a tell asking if she wanted the help of a L47 Monk.  I got invited to come.  I quickly realized that this was not the &quot;ToN&quot; crowd I usually hang with but I fiquered hey nice to play with some new people.  (Monks need to network to be able to get groups I heard)  <br>
<br>
    We start out with a serious ass kicking 2 groups.  Not being familiar with the Hole all I can say is that we plowed our way most of the time pulling 3-5 at time.  We got to what was I call the Dock and we had a pull of 2 Golem and I elemental something.  Main was on the Elemental and after a few secs the chanter calls out the Golems are Un-Mezzable (Yellow to a L51)  We lost 3 members but the following CR was not too bad since a rezzer was still alive. Few minutes after the rezz's our main tank and her Shammy companion left. After a bit we had a total wipe out and were on CR duty.  <br>
  CR took awhile but nothing epic.  We were ressing in the zone in and I sent a /tell to Aurelle saying I could use one of the Smoldering Brand (9/22 All/All with a little proc)  that dropped. She didn't reply. About 30min past and I had to get to a ingame wedding so I camped out and logged my Druid.  <br>
<br>
    After the wedding I sent her a tell saying It bugged me that she didnt even respond to my tell and that I still wanted a chance at least to get it ie &quot;Roll&quot;.  She proceeds to tell me &quot;She spent&quot; over 400pp in reagents and that she was keeping this to cover her costs but she would sell it to me for 500pp.  <br>
<br>
    Now I have been prepared to deal with all sorts of looting rules from these boards and playing in game and I know that I should be sure to ask up front what the looting scheme is.  But WTF is up with cleric hogging 2 900pp items plus whatever the hell dropped in her group that got 85% of the kills.  I feel Royaly Flushed.  Silly me I though clerics charged for Resses when they need money.. Not hog the loot from someone who was welcomed to the raid by her and needed the item..  Welp I said what I have to say and this totally is against Aurelle not her guild which did a hell of a job in the Hole with me. <br>

I edited it some and paragraphed a bit.  Just had alot to say about what happened.  In it's basic summary :<br>
<br>
Aurelle skipped &quot;need before greed&quot; and &quot;greed before need&quot;. She declared to me that all dropped loot on her raid to be hers after the raid was over. Here I was waiting at the end for the &quot;End of raid Loot&quot; split and I was not even offered a single PP.  No rolls, no what you got nows, just I need to make a profit here is all she told me.  Oh she did tell me she was sorry she didn't reply to my /tell &quot;She was busy planning her next raid&quot; when I sent it.<br>

Did you offer to pay her to help reimburse the cost of her reagents? Or did you just expect to be able to roll on something that dropped because it was your right to?  <p>~Garbhad Brainbender~

I expected to be given a chance to roll on the 2 Weapons that dropped. I was the only person there at the end that was not in her guild so I would have had about a 1 in 10 chance of winning from her which would have been fine by me.<br>
<br>
No I did not offer to pay for her reagents upfront. But if she would have asked all 10 of us for 40pp each to share the cost I would have gladly handed over the 25 pp I had left in my pocket after I had /split 50+pp twice during the game.<br>
From my occasinal /loot<br>
<br>
Again,  I just felt like a hooker that was stiffed at the end and I will learn from it and ask questions next time.  Just kinda feel sad to now have to ask a Raid leader &quot;You goona hog all the loot?&quot; to be sure I don't have this happen again.<br>

Your such a babe..<br>

You looked nice with a little fire in your hand...<br>
<br>
Whole point to the post was that I was rudely awakened to a new level of looting.  Thats all.  400-500pp is nothing to me nor to Aurelle I am sure and you prolly have a at least a million in your accounts as well.<br>
<br>
I really liked the text I saw on my screen as you were being pounded on by like 5 Mobs hit for 150's.  &quot;Galana has taken a defensive stance&quot; heheh you rocked hard in there.<br>
  I hope to someday have my character as strong as yours must be.<br>
<br>
Our guild did a Seb key raid tonight and I was Hunter/Forager seeker with my little druid.  We got 11 sets of Seb - Idols Loot was Iskar illusion mask, Iskar BP, 2 Silken Cat gridles and a ton of spells.  Brought the fun back out and I feel much better now.<br>
<br>
Ridaas is prolly better off without another 1HB. Poor monk does not fair well when she becomes the main aggro hehe.  And my Tranq Staff does a fair amount of damage.<br>
<br>
Keep your brand, give it a newbie if you don't want it.

Shoulda asked about the loot policy before the raid. ALWAYS ask about the loot policy if that is the reason you are going somewhere. Make it your Standard Operating Procedure.  <p>Maday Maday <BR>

Please dont come here and start to bash someone who offered for you to come on a raid to help a fellow guild member of hers...

<br>
Yes I find it perfectly acceptable that you spent 700pp on gems only to have gotten 200pp in cash.  Some days the cleric makes money most days they don't.  Part of the class and it sorta is expected of you to have learned that by now.  Goes along the lines of 200pp+ Rezzes you can charge for and not get flamed for being a greedy bitch. Players accept that as a valid way for you to cover costs.<br>
 <br>
Letting a fighter have a better fighting weapon when it drops is the noble thing to do.<br>
<br>
Letting the fighter try his luck against others is a fair thing to do.<br>
<br>
Making the fighter watch as it is sold for wholesale is a Aurelle thing to do, and I hope there are few others like her.<br>
<br>
As far as the battle between your guild and mine you spoke of....  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  And what are the sides please?  I would really like to know.  95% of our top members outgrow the guild and moved on to guilds such as yours.  Were we in ToFS some night when you wanted to refill your peridot bag?  Cause we certainly are not competing for the same Epic spawns.<br>
<br>
Aurelle, it was your raid.  It was your rules.  I was the idiot for asking what they were. I am comfortable with all other loot rules, yours was a unwelcomed suprise.  I wish your guild members Luck and good fortune, but for you I only wish anguish the likes of 1000 times what you put me through. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ushiningforcesoflight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shining Forces of Light</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(7/31/01 3:33:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.shiningforcesoflight.20m.com/Angel.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boy did I just get a rude awaking.</span><hr size=1> This is sad and pretty much uncalled for... <br>
<br>
Take it to me in game stop posting bullshit.. if you got an issue with me bring it to me.. no reason to post here.<br>
<br>
yes i was the one who removed Tanzor for looting a BP out of order... sad sad part is if he wanted his honor all he had to do was take a Suspension for the BP to goto the rightful owner... but yanno what he didnt he kept it... yeah love it when you know this shit and there is NOTHING you can do about it.<br>
<br>
Ridaas if that damn smoldering brand is THAT important come and farkin get it... no reason for me to get blasted over something so petty... <br>
<br>
Call me a bitch, wish the worst for me... but ya know what.. The first death i had in the Hole i took an XP hit for it... OMG i am such a sorry ass cleric, or person IRL.<br>
<br>
I used 3 stacks of peridots... OMG she was not even caring what she used as she knew that with the Smoldering brand she would get the 500-800pp that she lost.<br>
<br>
But.. i dont know.. some ppl in this game have issues with loot and i forget that not alot are in the higher lvls and the lowers think that we have 100kpp in the bank... sorry face reality... we dont... Clerics are the poorest players on this server... we have to buy regents... No regents.... No cleric... <br>
<br>
BUT, again get your ass to Great Divide and i will be more than happy to give in and let ya Roll on that brand... then it would be fair, as you would call it.<br>

Point is use the jasper symbol unless the mob doubles or quads for over 250.<br>

<br>
Did I indicate in this post anywhere that I still wanted it from you?  Sorry if I did cause I don't mean too to give that impression.  I did ask that you explain this, in your words, &quot;Battle&quot; between our two guilds to me but this too prolly only exists in &quot;Aurelle Land&quot;<br>
<br>
I would have been happy to talk to you about this Hun but for some reason you decided to send my guild leader a /tell (complaint) last night while I was online without sending me a /tell (Hey lets work this out) ever.  If you had wanted to take it off the boards at least you should have asked me directly.<br>
     <br>
       After Bini showed me what you said to her, you became the only person on my /ignore list (I removed a name that was a flaming newbie when I charmed the Kodiak he was fighting..You will never be taken off)<br>
<br>
Please you are complaining that you lost some exp now too?  Our puller that day was killed about 6 times, maybe 7.  Even with exp rezz I sure he lost a bunch of exp. You were the raid leader, you should have made sure there was more than 1 EXP rezzer in the raid so don't look to me for sympathy.<br>
<br>
Matter closed in my book.  <br>

Some days the cleric makes money most days they don't. Part of the class and it sorta is expected of you to have learned that by now. Goes along the lines of 200pp+ Rezzes you can charge for and not get flamed for being a greedy bitch. Players accept that as a valid way for you to cover costs.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is the most ignorant shit I have ever heard. Followed by &quot;how 'tis nobler to let tanks upgrade weapons...&quot; blah blah blah...  When was the last time anyone paid 200pp for a rez that the cleric didnt have to cross most of Norrath to do? I dont charge for rezzes, unless you are a porting class, and then I charge 60pp. That is no more and no less than a fucking roundtrip port to a location of my choice, since most porters think that their mana is worth more than mine. <br>
<br>
Why is it that when tanks upgrade their weapons, they dont pass their old shit to the cleric or chanta's to cover their costs for keeping their sorry asses alive? Seriously, what is the difference between one of the people who work hard to keep an often ungreatful person alive selling an item, and that ingrate turning around and selling the 7k item he just replaced it with? I practice and believe in NB4G, but sometimes people really piss me off with the stupid shit they pull. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but reagent costs are NOT something that we should just have to &quot;accept&quot; and take it up the ass everytime some numbnuts tank wants a 12pp symbol buff. <br>
<br>

Like you said, her raid her rules. Don't like it, leave.Simple? For your "sometimes they make money, some times they don't" analogy, that's utter bs. Any raid, people should help the cleric meet ends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessageRange?topicID=1038.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1048.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1050.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=1038.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=1038.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1038.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1038.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#DDA0DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
