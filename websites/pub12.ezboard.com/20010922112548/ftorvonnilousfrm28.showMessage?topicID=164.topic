<br>
Also, should i take the trouble to build ghosts for my infantry squads?<br>
<br>
Another question - how do i balance my groups of infantry.. for example do i have in 1 group: 4 medics 6 marines 2 firebats, or.. 6 medics 3 marines 3 firebats?? I need to know the best combination.<br>
<br>
Also - when i move my groups to attack the enemy, how do i move them? I am concerned that attack-moving (pressing a and clicking where you want to move) will prevent the medics from healing marines until the medics reach that spot... and should i have my medics in the front of the group, or should i have them follow marines/firebats, or should i just have them move the same way the other infantry move?<br>
<br>
Also - Use of stimpacks.. should i use stimpacks when i am attacking? how long does one shot of stimpacks last?<br>
<br>
what upgrades should i pursue?<br>
<br>
what is the best accompanying unit that i wouldn't have to make a lot of for my infantry?<br>
<br>
I would be very appreciative of an answer! i know there are some people here with knowledge of starcraft tactics.. i've seen kolas' screenshots of terran ownage!!1 <p><b>Energy</b> 49 Wizard <b>RETIRED</b><BR><b>Opyx</b> 44 Bard<BR><b>Asasin</b> 19 Rogue

<br>
Medics are @#%$ annoying to control but when they are in the right spot they make the difference between a win and a loss.<br>
<br>
1 marine ( with first armor upgrade ) and 1 medic can take out a sunken colony easily ( the 1 armor means the guy has effectively 41hp and at 20 a shot from the colony he takes 3 shots ) but vs cannons they just all die.<br>
<br>
get stim, get crap loads, and just bum rush someone, if you have healers round stim first then the healers heal back to full, it lasts 10 seconds or so i think anyway.<br>
<br>
when you move, attack move to somewhere near what you are attacking to let them all get together again, dont attack from long distances or its single file butchery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
firebats own protoss sheilds and zerg units because of the 4x3 square splash damage, they also hit themselves though, and theres always the explosive, normal and some other kind of damage to take into account. e.g ghosts do 10 damage, but they have explosive damage, so it does full to small units ( zerglings zealots marines ) half to medium ( dragoons vultures ) and a quarter to large ( tanks reavers archons ultra's ). you should find out which guys do which damage, as it makes a big difference.<br>
<br>
What do you want to do in the game, if you are rushing get lots of food and 2-3 barracks at first, figure out the build order that works, and send lots of the guys out to die whilst making more all the time. The time they have to travel is working against you though so if you build them near the enemy you can keep them occupied with defence while you explore and get more minerals, effectively closing them in, however if they manage to kill your things you have no defence except that they dont know where you are yet.<br>
<br>
If you want a quick kill but with some safety 2 tanks + 12 marines + 2 medics + 2scv's owns to gradually move up and outrange everything, any air gets owned as the marines should have 2-3 upgrades by the time you have tanks, just got to not place them all too together cause of reavers and other tanks, and lurkers /shiver ( always have a com scanner ).<br>
<br>
Also do you play on battle net or via modem, i played alot on battle net with a friend and team work owned everyone else , records were like 100+ 10 10 ish for both of us, and thats without any of that 3vs1 comp on that chitty space map just to get wins <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
just play them alot on a bunch of different maps  vs other people and you pick it up anyway, all about doing and no one likes theory anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well have fun playing it, before EQ i spent about 3 years playing that and its still a great game, that D2 and EQ are all you could want thats out so far ...<br>
<br>
2 sunken colony's in an oposing zerg players base is an amusing way to slow them down or even take them out, sometimes the f00's just think its theirs and dont worry till they attack...also cannon rushing can be done similarly for slowing them down at the start...as can lurkers and dark elves ... so many things to do ...<br>
<br>
I havent played in a while though so they may have changed a few things round <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I'd probably suck now and be slow as all hell so im not going to give you a game so you can whoop my ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(imagine accidentally grouping 6 medics and ordering them to attack that scout)<br>
<br>
Also, ghosts are a good elite squad so to speak.. make a few to throw in with marines (dont bother with bats) for the good range pulls then let marines chew them up, and yes, stim ALOT.. bout a 5 second duration at 10hp a time. The mixed marine ghost squads are good for distracting the enemies units and cannons, sunkens, etc for that lone ghost to get his nuke targeted.<br>
<br>
I'm on BW alot, usually playing user map settings games (mods) because straight games are way too boring nowadays. (Wow, yet again my opponent is a zerg yay, I'll be zerg and sunken colony rush him whoopdedoo) I play as Caffeine~ on USAeast so send a /w sometime and I can show ya some stuff and techiques and some tactics etc.<br>
<br>
(I'm one of the few people that will play 'Toss in a ladder game and win heh)<br>
<br>
Been playing since about `97 when it was only Diablo Shareware, Retail, and starcraft. (Warcraft wasn't bnet yet hehe)<br>
<br>
Anyways, hope this helps, and good luck.<br>

I'm not just talking about your troops, I am talking about building as well.  Protoss and Zerg have it easy (Protoss especially), when it comes to building management.  Protoss, you basically only need 1 or 2 probes building at a time.  Zerg, you can create lots of drones at once, which makes for fast minerals and fast building.  Terrans have the biggest disadvantage when it comes to building.  First of all, they take a hella lot of room.  Supply depots will take most of ur room, and ur other buildings will clog ur base up even more.  Having a good base layout should help you overall.  Remember to use those supply depots as walls (I'm not talking about blocking urself in) to detour the enemies into coming around in case of an attack.  However, if ur playing terrans right on a 1v1, you shouldn't be getting attacked very much.<br>
<br>
Terran, if you know how to use them, are the best race in the game.  I have met great players, but all the ones that are the best, play terran best.  When you use terran, you got some pretty gay disadvantages.  Physically weak and not as overwhelming as the Zerg.  But the best terran players are the best starcraft players.  Btw, this isn't based oh BGH...that's way too easy.  Your question about how many medics, marines, firebats you should have...you should have more marines than medics, but about a 3 to 1 ratio would be best put.  Don't have too many medics, 3 to 1 is plenty.  Firebats, don't over invest as well, they have their uses, but if you don't see Zealots or Lings, they're pretty much useless in the mid/endgame.  Ghosts...don't use them unless ur nuking or countering against capital battleships, they're not worth fighting against a group of rines, as their cool down rate will just get them raped.<br>
<br>
Machines are nice, but in limited resource maps, you have to know how much you can invest in each of them.  Tanks, they kick the S H I T outta land.  I prolly don't need to tell you this.  But, you can't really depend on tanks alone.  Vultures, are one of my favorite terran toys.  They seem to suck, low armor and a damage penalty on heavy armor like tanks, goons, zealots, etc.  however, they are damn useful in that they can lay spider mines (earlier the better, players don't get detection so early), they pack a punch against light armored units like rines, bats, protoss shields, etc, and they are hella fast, very nice for going from one hot spot to another.  Goliaths, hehe, kick ass air D, but don't invest unless you know your opponent has mutas/guards, carriers/sairs, or battlecruisers.<br>
<br>
Terran ships...they pretty much all suck cept for science vessels which should be ur detection.  Wraiths don't do very good damage on ground, their cloaking ability is nice, but their cost makes them too expensive to make any kind of mass cloaked assault making them rather useless.  Battlecruisers...well, they're too expensive to be investing in...especially if ur not playing BGH.  These definitely aren't going to be made in bulk in normal maps, so will make a minimal difference.  Valkyries, nice air to air, but just like devourers, u ain't gonna be killin buildings with this.  Science vessels have by far the best use in the terran fleet.  EMP can get rid of toss shields AND a shot of EMP also rids any unit that uses...I guess MP (purple bar)...a well placed shot will render corsairs, arbitors, wraiths, ghosts, medics, templars, dark templars, useless.  Irradiate can get rid of pesty lil buggers like templars that keep storming ur units.  Actually, my FAVORITE tactic w/ the vessel is this:<br>
<br>
Take two science vessels (preferrably more, the more you have the better) and make sure they have irradiate researched.  This should be done rather early as enemy air defense should be minimal.  take them to the enemy minefield, or close to.  Have them put irradiate on each other (yes you can irradiate science vessels and they will not get damaged).  Put on the patrol command, and patrol along the enemies minefield.  A couple passes and all their probes/scvs/drones will have been wiped out.  Funny as hell watching it too.<br>
<br>
Also, adding to this above tactic, you can also have both shield each other as it only takes 100, and irradiate should be 75.  <br>
<br>
I was gonna post some tactics on how to play against each race, but ill keep them to myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Terrans are harsh opponents.  I respect anyone who can play them to their max.  Nothing is more irritating than seeing your armada irradiated, locked down, and/or nuked.  All the races are pretty well balanced (Kudos Blizzard!), but the Terrans are an absolute pain in the butt in the high tech end game.<br>
<br>
1 medic per 3 marines usually works.  I usually have 9 marines and 3 medics on a hotkey.  Same with Firbats, but they tend to kill their medics for some reason.  Suddenly, stimpack isn't as dicey to use anymore...<br>
<br>
Oh, and get all the weapon and armor upgrades if you can.  Although marines are not as fragile as zerglings, they often die just as fast.<br>
<br>
I keep ghosts on a separate key, usually taking the LONG way around stuff.  I don't mix them with any other units.<br>
<br>
Ahhh...the good old days when Battle.Net wasn't so freaking lagged...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
