<br>
For all of you who occasionally have a real bad day when you just need to take it out on someone -- don't take that bad day out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know. <br>
I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered saying &quot;Hello?&quot; I politely said &quot;Could I please speak to Robin Carter?&quot; Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin Carter's correct number and dialed her. She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly. After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again. When the same person once more answered, I yelled &quot;You're an asshole!&quot; and hung up. Next to his phone number I wrote the word &quot;asshole,&quot; and put it in my desk drawer. <br>
<br>
Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer and I'd yell &quot;you're an asshole!&quot; It would always cheer me up. Later that year the phone company introduced Caller ID. This was a real setback for me because I would have to stop calling the asshole. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number and when I heard his voice I made up a name and said &quot;Hi, I'm with the telephone company and I'm just calling to see if you'd be interested in our Caller ID program.&quot; &quot;No!&quot; he shouted and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said &quot;That's because you're an asshole!&quot; <br>
<br>
A couple weeks later, an old lady at the shopping center really took her time pulling out of a parking space. I didn't think she was ever going to leave.Finally, her car began to slowly back out of the spot. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out. &quot;Great&quot; I thought, she's finally leaving. Suddenly this black BMW comes flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her spot. I hit the horn and started yelling &quot;You can't do that. I was here first!&quot; The guy climbed out of his BMW completely ignoring me. He walked toward the shopping center as if I didn't even exist. I thought to myself, this guy's another asshole; there sure are a lot of assholes in this world. Then I noticed he had a For Sale sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the phone number and drove on looking for a parking spot. <br>
<br>
A couple of days later, I'm sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling my favorite asshole and yelling &quot;You're an asshole!&quot; (It was really easy because I had his number on speed dial by then.) I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black BMW on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy too. When he answered I asked &quot;Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is&quot; &quot;Can you tell me where I can see it?&quot; &quot;Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and the car is parked right out front.&quot; I said &quot;What's your name?&quot; &quot;My name is Don Hansen. &quot; &quot;When's a good time to catch you, Don?&quot; &quot;I'm home in the evenings.&quot; &quot;Listen, Don, can I tell you something?&quot; &quot;Sure.&quot; &quot;Don, you're an asshole!&quot; I slammed the phone down and added Don Hansen's phone number to my speed dialer. <br>
<br>
Things seemed to be going much better for me -- now I had two assholes to call. Then after several months of calling the assholes and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. So I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a great solution. <br>
First, I had my phone speed dial Asshole #1. A man answered in a nice voice &quot;Hello.&quot; I yelled &quot;You're an asshole!&quot;, but I didn't hang up. The asshole said, &quot;Are you still there?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said &quot;Stop calling me.&quot; I said &quot;Make me.&quot; He said, &quot;What's your name, pal?&quot; So I told him &quot;Don Hansen.&quot; He said &quot;Where do you live?&quot; &quot;1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black BMW's parked out front.&quot; &quot;I'm coming over right now, Don. You better start saying your prayers!&quot; &quot;Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole!&quot;, and I hung up. <br>
<br>
Then I called Asshole #2. Don Hansen answered. &quot;Hello.&quot; I said &quot;Hello, asshole!&quot; He said &quot;If I ever find out who you are---&quot; &quot;You'll what?&quot; &quot;I'll kick your ass!&quot; &quot;Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, asshole. And I hung up. <br>
<br>
Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was on my way to 1802 SW 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as I got there. <br>
<br>
Another quick call to Channel 8 about the gang war going on down on West 34th Street. <br>
<br>
After that, I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious satisfaction! Watching two assholes kicking the shit out each other in front of 6 squad cars, a police helicopter and a news crew was one of the greatest experiences of my life! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Have a great weekend everyone<br>
