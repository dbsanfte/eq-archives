The fact is, we were gathering at SS room for FG run before the first of the Naggie raiders showed up.  I suppose some of the Naggie raiders thought our progress was too slow even though we've only been killing FGs for an hour or so before the Naggie raiders decided to come up to the hallway before the teeth staging room and sat down right next to us.  We didn't invite the problems but they came to us anyways.  The confusion wasn't caused by us and I've been willing to give benefit of the doubt that he was genuinely trying to make things right.  However, as I've stated before, Kunlo clearly shouted that the Magus kill belonged to the FG raiders, not the Naggie raiders.  I'm still a little appalled that people were confused about who rolled what #.  I mean, how hard is it to figure out that the number below your name is your roll.. shrugs.  Infer what you will, I'm still gonna give Torke the benefit of the doubt here since he did indeed seem to be trying hard to right this wrong.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uwarelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warelen</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#DDA0DD>4/19/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#DDA0DD>9:48:49 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Vanadar</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well i dont anything about this but heres my opinion anyways. I think Tokre? so many diff spellings in the post, should have had some common sense. I believe that they would have /ooc or whateverd that there was separate raids but sometimes people dont read. And before you loot something, check back at all the rolls to see if one was missed etc, not just cuz 1 guy says "grats Tokre". Just a little reading is all that you need to do. And even though the FG raid was all SGA, when you mix it in with a pick up raid, shit will go down. I would have said, hey Nagafen peoples get back there and keep away. Personally if any one of them was within 10ft of the corpse i would have said "hey you get lost." Not to be mean but so he didnt accidentally loot something based on a comment from a non leader and a not so high roll that he wasnt supposed to roll on. Also i think the SGA set up is inherently going to cause confusion just because your not all the  same guild and when your talking in ooc shout say whatever, people who arnt with you are gonna hear and think your talking to them. So basically its a little lack of common sense and some confusion that made this happen. And so what if you have to wait another 6 hrs for another PMM as long as the guy is sorry and punished. </font><P><img src="http://b.PostMyPic.com/b.nsf/Z/sigMRGQ/$file/sig.jpg" alt="Dont mess with the shaman OWNAGE">

Anyone at that raid, and I've talked to several people about it, will agree that it was 100% chaos.  No, I wasn't there, but I do know that pickup raids can be a nightmare and from all the accounts I've heard about this one it was typically chaotic for a pickup raid.   Maybe even worse than normal because 2 separate raid groups were there which adds even more confusion to the mix.<br>
<br>
Also, questioning whether he was honest or not is pretty fucking lame considering he agreed to take a 1 week suspension from EQ in order to let the &quot;rightful&quot; winner of the PMM get the mask.  Some folks go &quot;that's no big deal&quot; but I have to disagree.  He did the right thing, and yet someone posts that he's a ninja looter on a public board with the sole intent, as far as I can see anyway, of ruining his reputation in game.  Then a bunch of people who are in that guild jump on board and start questioning whether he's doing the right thing for the right reasons or not.  Good christ, do we have to hyper-analyze everything here?  <br>
<br>
Leave the guy alone.  It's pretty damn pathetic to crucify someone for 1 incident which, by all that anyone can tell, they are trying their damndest to make right.  </font><P><IMG SRC="http://home.netcom.com/~elnator/graphics/kumlaksig.gif" align="right"><FONT face="Tempus Sans ITC" size=6 color="red"><STRONG> <BR>Kumlak

I've been following this thread without saying anything because I wanted to hear more about what happened. And though I wasn't there it seems that a Big Mistake was made and a lot of people think they have the right to pass judgement. I think this never should have come to the boards and should have been settled privatly. Why does Hareq come on to attack Torke first when the person cheated should have done so? Granted I take it he was leading the raid but really, from what I've heard here it seems that everyone was aware that Torke felt bad and was trying to make right. Now why attack his reputation after that? Before you attack someone, take a few days to think it over and make sure you need to. Now, despite his actions to make it right, from now on Torke will have this hanging over his head. I don't think that is right.<br>

<br>
The little I know of Torke does not point to him being a Ninja looter.  Infact he seems to be polite even to strangers.<br>
<br>
But Kumlak after observing and being an active member of this message board (Arena) for so long don't you realize by now that folks just come here to flame half of the time?<br>
<br>
I would say most of the time but I do notice useful conversations here and under the market and class boards.<br>
This is a hard place to find carity, support, help, or justice unless you have a ton of freinds or certain guild tags.  And even then I hear its hard.<br>
<br>
People come here with problems and tend to ignore peaceful solutions.  Some may say this is just human nature.<br>
<br>
Good luck Torke.<br>

I was there at the time of the confusion, and wrongful looting too.  Your account of what happened is pretty acurate, but my problem is with the title of your post.<br>
<br>
&quot;Another Ninja Looter&quot;.  From the title, one can very easily conclude that you are out to ruin this guy's reputation.  From being there, it was very obvious that Torque was very sorry for what he did, and very much wanted to get the mask back to the rightful owner.  I don't believe his actions warrent his name being under the post of &quot;Another Ninja Looter&quot;.<br>

<br>
Another Ninka loooter may be the title, but it hardly seems the point of this thread.<br>
<br>
I would like to point out that Verant's Customer service solutions being what they are, this board is one of the only venues where anyone can air a greivance, or correct a wrong. I'd also like to point out that without any attempts to correct wrongs, people seem to continue to walk all over others for their own greed. Not all people, just some.<br>
<br>
I gave Torke my &quot;are you a greedy kid&quot; lecture onsite and left it at that. It is unfortnate that the nature of these incidents always follows a predictable pattern when they are announced: first a sense of agreement, then the backlash.<br>
<br>
Hareq's intent (I think) was to post here to learn about Torke's character...not knowing him, how were we to know if he was a Scartek, so to speak? He has friends who support him, good. I'm relieved everyone seems to think it was an honest mistake, becuase I'd really like to believe that is true. At the time it didnt seem like one, he had more indignation about the fact that he didnt understandy Why he wasnt entitled to roll, and that he had the winning roll (whoich he didnt) so...going from that, which was all we had to go on...well...At the time of this incident Torke was not guilded. Had he been, the matter would have been taken there.<br>
<br>
His actions since the incident paint him in a very honorable light. That's great. If anyone said anything completely unfounded to Torke (which some of you seem to imply) then they were wrong to do so. I'll admit it for them. Shrug.<br>
<br>
When the game gets down to loot, I gotta go take my dog to the park, get drunk with my irish, read a trashy book. It's just pixels. Chill.<br>
