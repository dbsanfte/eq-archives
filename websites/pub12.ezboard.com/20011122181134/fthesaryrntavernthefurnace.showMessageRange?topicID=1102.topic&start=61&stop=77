<br>
As stated in that post it was respected sometimes youforget the lil things and to be honest the raid was with alot of first timers in Hate, the only reason we got wiped out was due to folks gettin lost and we were out of your way.<br>
<br>
I did apologize for the hassle that the group caused then as we were tryin to respect your camp... so shhh  <br>

I can't believe that after 16 months and 18 billion arguments on the subject, people still think that posting here reserves something in game.<br>
<br>
I'd like to know what Dikidoo said that was so awful.  He hung himself?  I think he was much more polite than I would have been if faced with this drivel.  Then again, I have a very low bullshit tolerance level.<br>

The last 4 times I have been to hate,  we haven't &quot;claimed&quot; the zone, and there were usually at least 1 other guild up there that we either worked together with or went our seperate ways.  <br>

Anyway the point is as far as &quot;first in force&quot; yeah a level 60 group can clear it alone but chance are they aren't up their to take your armor,  usually they won't try to &quot;claim &quot; the zone.  just a specific mob. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ugranyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(8/15/01 9:58:09 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://pages.sprint.ca/granyte/files/profile.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: open Hate Raid Sat Aug 11th got blown...</span><hr size=1> What a stupid waste of space this post it.

<br>
What worries me is that CH are so disrespectful of their own members they ignore them when they are pointing out appropriate behaviour.<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that a large proportion of CH players are kids, which probably explains, but does not excuse, this behaviour..<br>
<br>
If one of my guildies suggested pinching a planned camp I would rebuke them, if they persisted or worse continued with such a plan they would get disbanded..<br>
<br>
If noone in a guild (ie AoTS) reads the boards then they have an excuse, but CH willingly took the plane despite they clearly knew an open raid was due.<br>
<br>
OOP and HnE despite posting here that they agree with the first dibs rule, have generally in the past respected open raids..<br>
<br>
It is basically impossible for multi guild raids to kit up in the same timespan as a single guild raid, and as such smaller guilds will never get to play in these zones unless they get some level of basic respect from other guilds.<br>
<br>
First dibs is crap rule that displays a kind of 'I am the hardest, therefore its mine' caveman mentality..<br>
<br>
Still, what is done is done, and there is probably no point whinging about it now, lets just hope that T'Kagi Ro style Ragefire train/KSes don't ever make their ugly heads known on this server..  <br>

<br>
&quot;First dibs&quot; is childish...  so what else would you propose?  You could have a calendar, but then then competition turns to a race for a website than for a zone/mob in game.  It would still be a &quot;first dibs&quot; situation, and one which requires no actual game or organizational skill.<br>
<br>
What I suggest for raid leaders who need several days to organize a raid is to talk to officers/GL of various capable guilds and see what their plans are.  Talk to them one-on-one within the game, or email, or whatever. <p><font face=helvetica size=+2 color=purple>Kaerel</font><br>
