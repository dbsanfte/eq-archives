<br>
Well tonite was an interesting nite, I have seen a dungeon I have never ventured into before, and am just wondering how long it will be before I fall upon the slimy floors of Lower Guk...<br>
<br>
Well things didnt go off to a great start this evening as I was out of provisions and decided I should take a trip back to Freeport before continuing any further, I stock on Rations and Water, loaded my bags with Invis potions and a couple of Endure Breaths for dire emergencys....<br>
<br>
Returning to Lower Guk I thought, after looking at my map, that it would be easier to take the entrance directly into the Live Side of Lower Guk, a few spawns on the path which were handled with ease and a jump into the water for a swin to where the maze began...<br>
<br>
A few more easy spawns and then with one of them on low hp he decieded to go for a run, bringing back with him 8 of his froglok friends and Minotours, Uh oh thought I now which was was the zone  <br>
<br>
A rather large train ensued as I gather up the pace and headed for the zone, phew I made it out with a little under 2 bubs of health, so resting for a little while to gather some strength, along came a guild friend to aid me on my quest....<br>
<br>
Eldonsquare Gardens &lt;Celtica&gt; a brave 56 Ranger of the Elven breeds came along with his well drawn maps and extreme knowledge of a place of which I was not accustomed...<br>
<br>
So after buffing me up he proceded to direct to the location I required, the Jail Room, on the way to the area, Eldon was cutting through the spawns like a knife through butter with his fine Epic weapon, Oh how I crave the day when will behold such magnificent weapons....<br>
<br>
We proceded to the jail slicing from and cattle alike, it was coming to the point where I considering opening my own burger chain  <br>
<br>
But alas we reached the area but there was no sign of Slaythe the Slayer, I could only presume he had poped out to drink tea and biscuits, perhaps with Gabbie....<br>
<br>
Well at this time the evil eye was up so we moved along the twisting corridors and headed to this extremely large eyeball, to poke it in the pupil with out sharp pointy things, and WOOT what should it have but a nice Evil Eye bag which Eldon allowed me to have as a token of this gigantic floating eyeball goo....<br>
<br>
Eldon then proceded to show me the sights of this wonderous zone by taking me onto the Dead Side, and onto the Undead tower....<br>
<br>
We looked and poked around every little nook and cranny looking for things to slice and dice and generally make a bloody mess of, there was a Cleric in the zone who required assitance in the massacre of the Sage, so who were we to say no, another set of frog guts on my sword could do no harm....<br>
<br>
He was slaghtered with the might of Eldons sword and had a Braided Cinch Cord for the taking, which was given to the Cleric for his own uses, I was just happy to see more frog gibblets......<br>
<br>
Deeper and deeped we moved into the tower killing as we went, until we discovered that the Ghould Cavalier was up for the taking, so wiping my sword on one of the heads of my enemys we proceeded to give his arse a good spanking in the only way he desered, said removal of said head....<br>
<br>
He dropped a nice little shoulder item, Adamante Epolets, which again the good hearted Eldon allowed me to take home for my good comrade Cryogenic Freezers &lt;Celtica&gt;, without a doubt Eldon is a very kind hearted soul, and gave up a lot of his evening to help me in my quest, and give me a jolly good tour of this zone, of which I had seen nothing before.....<br>
<br>
So I lay down my weary head, in the hope that Slaythe will be around tommorow, but if I have too much trouble getting there, I shall return at a later date and make my way to Cazic where there is much to be done,<br>
<br>
Thanks Eldon for everyhing and I look forward to us doing it all again soon,<br>
<br>
Unyil tommorow, when the day breaks, I shall return<br>
<br>
Walla out  <br>
