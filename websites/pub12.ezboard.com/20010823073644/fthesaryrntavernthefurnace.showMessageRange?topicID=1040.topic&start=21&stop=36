In order for him to point out my faults he has to make it seem like he doesn't have those, and then trips over himself when he forgets his own lies.<br>

Their version of fun of playing: Explore new areas before anyone else. Kill mobs before anyone else. Get equipment before anyone else. And yes then brag about it. <br>
<br>
No way is better than the other, it is all in how YOU enjoy the game. But guilds like FoH, LoS, AL etc are the only true explorers of the game. Everyone else are so far behind they can (and most do) read detailed descriptions on a board of everything.<br>
<br>
And if you can't see the problem of the loot on Tunare.. it took them 12 hours or so (estimating) to clear the plane. It took them 20 minutes (if I remember correctly) to kill a 925quading flurrying mob that was deemed unkillable. Their result: 2 robes that you can get from yardtrash in the same zone (1 given to a Necro in a sisterguild, 1 ROTTED), and a sword that nobody even wanted and was given to an unguilded Ranger in zone. Wooot worth the effort!<br>
<br>
Yes that is my view, I expect Kumlak to flame it like he always does.<br>

Wouldnt dream of trying to.  The day I start to care what a person like you thinks about me is the day I hang it up for good.<br>
<br>
Actually, the thought of someone that gets religion and preaches to everyone on the evils of this game every three months and then continues to put in massive game time calling me a hypocrite is humorous at best.<br>
<br>
Everyone thats not one of your groupies sees that you are doing the same thing you always do.  Trying to bring RL into a thread about one of your FACTOIDS being proven wrong again.  For someone that cant stand to be wrong you sure are wrong alot.  Seems like if you were half as smart as you claim to be you would learn to shut your mouth every now and then.<br>
<br>
Once again, the topic of post was to point out that you were full of crap with your declarations about the game.  Whatever smoke screen you try to throw up, I still have the fact that you are a dump ass to keep me warm.   <br>
<br>
Man I cant stop laughing at how much you want people to think you have some intelligence and just keep proving other wise.  Its gotta be just tearing you up.  <br>

And yes, I agree the loot on Tunare was 100% bogus... I suspect that Verant, in their infinite wisdom, didn't think anyone would take her down so soon.  Same shit that happened with VP and several other mobs that FoH has hit before Verant thought they'd be able to.<br>
<br>
FoH should be used to this by now though.... after all it happens to them all the goddamn time.  They're constantly pushing the envelope killing mobs that the boneheads at Verant don't think are gunna go down till XYZ expansion *yadda yadda* so they don't bother fixing broken loot tables, etc.  <br>
<br>
Sure I feel sorry for them getting a bum deal on loot but to blow it way out of proportion is just silly.  I suspect that Verant will fix the loot tables now that Tunare has actually been taken out. <p><TABLE Width=650 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

This coming from a person who thinks that anything he does in a game has any bearing on his real life stature is laughable to say the least. You're ignorance of human interaction and reality are a bit skewed by your ineptness to not only perform in real life but in a game as well. You pine for the glory and fame you can't get in real life so you try to act superior to those around you in a game. You sir are the very imbodiment of all that a hypcrit stands for.<br>
<br>
You begin by saying how I act superior, then the EXACT next line down say that anyone who works an evening shift is nothing but a janitor who is beneath you. <br>
<br>
Then you come to claim that you don't care what I say. If you didn't care what i said or thought, then why do you keep posting. <br>

<br>
Couple of things you are overlooking in your failing attempt to skew the original focus of this post.  No where in this thread have I made any claim about how much I do or dont know about this game or about how uber/gimp I think I am.<br>
<br>
Im not the one always trying to make &quot;statements of fact&quot; about the game.  Once again, Im just pointing out how ignorant and full of shit you are.   <br>
<br>
Im not the one always inflating the amount of HPs I can achieve on this board.  Do you know anything about my gear, my level or my hps? Once again its you not me.<br>
<br>
Im not the one always talking about how fast I can clear a certain camp on this board.  Ever take the Disco challenge someone put up after you ran your mouth as usual?  Any idea where I hunt or what I kill?  Nope once again its you not me.  <br>
<br>
Think you can figure out who does all of the above on an all too regular basis?<br>
<br>
/em hands Garhbage a mirror.<br>
<br>
And on top of it all you talk about how sad people are that do exactly what you are doing.  <br>
<br>
Hmmm someone has been throwing the hypocrite label alot lately.  Think you can figure out who that is?<br>
<br>
 /em hands Garhbage a mirror.<br>
<br>
So guess according to your own definition:<br>
<br>
Garhbage = laughable.<br>
<br>
And as far as your this round of real life jabs you insist on trying to inject into this.  You know as much about my life as you do about this game.<br>
<br>
&quot; Btw let the thoughts of me keep you warm, I will keep your wife warm since she probably hasn't seen you in three weeks as you hole your self up in a deep dark dank room filled with veisions of granadeur from your digital avatar.&quot;<br>
<br>
My PC was moved to the family room a short time after UO came out.  My wife sits right next to me and we converse and interact the whole time Im playing.  Many times my son has sat in my lap watching me play.  <br>
<br>
You see, not everyones life is as lonely and sad as yours Garhbage.  Im happy, my wife is happy, my son is happy.  Yes this game can become like a mistress but I have my shit together and know my priorities.  It took alot, but a balanced has been reached.  <br>
<br>
Whos keeping you warm at night Garhbage?  Maybe that janitor you like to misqoute me on so much?<br>
<br>
Any other comments to make about things you know nothing about?  Its starting to be too much fun seeing you scratching and fighting to stay above water and stick your foot in your mouth at every turn.<br>

Proving someone wrong is like when someone state that CH is 32k HP and you show them the spdat proving that it is 10k.<br>
<br>
Proving someone wrong is like when you state that every mob in TOV is lvl 60+ and then a lvl 60 ranger post that he saw blue shit on track in TOV. (And yes i was wrong there too and admitted it).<br>
<br>
Proving someone wrong is like when he state that tunare is unkillable and a fews days later FOH kill her.<br>
<br>
Proving someone wrong is not having a different opinions on event than they do. And i still stand by my opinion on the andael incident as i am sure you still stand by yours. Doesnt make either of us wrong.<br>

<br>
You are the one who started with the real life cracks.<br>
<br>
Don't make me go further with them, you leave the real life cracks out, and I will as well. <br>
<br>
I don't believe I misquoted you about the janitor comment. You made implecations and the tone behind your post was that EVERYONE who was on a night crew of somesort, or worked a graveyard shift was nothing but a janitor. <br>
<br>
You see here is where we have two apposing views from different aspects of life. You obviously were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, because according to you anyone who works as a janitor, must not work as hard as you do, because that is all that they can become. <br>
<br>
Bah, why am I furthering this argument with you. You are obviously an intellectual superior to all who are around you as implied in many of your various posts. No one would have a chance of beating you, I mean you work during the day, so you are obviously superior. <br>
<br>
What I think I will do from now on, just to piss you off, and just to continue to inflate your ego, I will just start making shit up just so you can feel better about yourself by pointing out where I am wrong. Hows that sound. Need a little confidence boost? Well now I will be your personal confidence builder. Propping that self inflated ego just so that silver spoon can remain shiny.<br>

I am currently a software analyst with quite a varied background, education, and life experience.<br>
<br>
I strongly resent the idea that anyone working a non-standard business schedule is any less capable, qualified, motivated, or successful as another person.<br>

<br>
Bage, Im really starting to wonder if some one has taking over  your board account.  You just cant get a damn thing right.<br>
<br>
Here is the first real life attack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps if you were to use that invested intelligence of a fantasy setting you could get a better job than the gap at the local mall. &quot;<br>
<br>
And the posted by sure says Garhbage.<br>
<br>
&quot;What I think I will do from now on, just to piss you off, and just to continue to inflate your ego, I will just start making shit up just so you can feel better about yourself by pointing out where I am wrong. Hows that sound. Need a little confidence boost? Well now I will be your personal confidence builder.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow thanks and I guess you decided to make it retroactive to a month ago or so aye?  Because youve been doing this for a while now.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't believe I misquoted you about the janitor comment. You made implecations and the tone behind your post was that EVERYONE who was on a night crew of somesort, or worked a graveyard shift was nothing but a janitor.&quot;<br>
<br>
No the tone of my post is that you werent fit to manage anyone above a janitor.<br>
<br>
&quot;You obviously were born with a silver spoon in your mouth,&quot;<br>
<br>
You are hopeless.  You just continue to spout nonsense.  And you continue to be wrong.  You were the one making DIRECT comments on how you knew you were better than everyone in real life.  But let me break this too you, YOU SUCK.  You are a poor judge and analyzer of people.  You lack knowledge in many of the areas you try to present yourself as an expert in and you dont know how to shut your hole rather than try to make declarations about things you dont know enough about.  You come up with this crap hoping youll hit the mark out of blind luck and someone will think you are smart.  However you just come off looking like a dumb ass.<br>
