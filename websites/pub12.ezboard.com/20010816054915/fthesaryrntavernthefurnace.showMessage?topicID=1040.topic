Yes I know everytime you open your mouth and have to reverse the BS flow because FACT is proven &gt; Garbhage FACTOIDS you claim to be proud to not know everything about the game.  But for someone who opens his mouth about everydamn thing you sure are a complete dumbass.<br>

<br>
On the old board before Zamtil redid the PHP, there was a list created by Kreugen, of Unkillable Mobs.<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly the top three went like this:<br>
<br>
Sleeper<br>
AoW<br>
Tunare<br>
<br>
Like I said that was on a board that is no longer used by them.<br>
<br>
Now here is a discussion about Unkillables...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?s=b36dbf21216c8af0fa1ca0f7248bc5e0&threadid=2174">www.noows.com/showthread....eadid=2174</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This thread talks mostly about the AoW, however Kreugen says that Tunare may well be killable. Also in their chat room a few weeks ago they were even saying that Tunare was still a bad ass and they didn't think anyone would be taking her out any time soon due to her melee range.<br>
<br>
My guess is they got bored and put a serious attempt in to it. Everytime it was mentioned they always pissed and moaned saying that &quot;PoG is a waste of effort and time, it takes forever to clear the zone&quot;.<br>
<br>
So yes, my factoid at the time was correct for the information that I had.<br>
<br>
So in all politeness, Please....go fuck yourself =)<br>

Had they not taken down their old PHP message board in favor of the new one, you would have choked on those words. The list created BY Kreugen, Endorsed by Furor, stated full in fact that they themselves didn't think she was killable. <br>
<br>
Oh yes, I was sooo wrong...I was merely relaying information that was stated BY THEM in previous posts BY THEM on their own board. <br>
<br>
You are truly an ignorant human being. <br>
<br>
<br>
I also find it mildly ironic that you wouldn't respond to the fact that I pointed you out as a hypocrit in the other thread. I may be an asshole, and I may make outrageous comments. However, at least I am uniform in my opinions. I don't see much of that coming from you. Caling someone out one minute, pointing out what you think are their faults, then doing the exact same thing you say they are at fault for. <p>~Garbhad Brainbender~

<br>
No actually it was because it wasnt your over-inflated opinion of yourself that I had a real problem with, it was the fact that you were wrong and completely full of BS.  It was a response to your typical &quot;Ive been proven a fool once again so Ill start the Im better than them in RL ploy to try to divert attention&quot; approach.  Kind of like you are trying to do with this thread.<br>
<br>
Just starting to take some small amount of pleasure in pointing out how much Razon-like you can be by just flat out telling someone they are wrong and then not being able to face up to it when you are exposed as a complete BSer.<br>
<br>
(But maybe I am just taking some elses opinion as my own from another deleted message board so I can try to look like I know what Im talking about.  I can just blame them later when Im exposed for being completely full of shit.)<br>

Err I know this is the blast furnace, but still that post on killing tunare was interesting. I am still curious what the proc on that sword does, anyone know? And as for it being craptastic, 14/21 with proc is by no means craptastic, primal 1hs are 13/20 with proc arent they, and warrior epic is 14/24 with proc. Seems as good as any of the best wepons in the game. <p>Galana<BR>
