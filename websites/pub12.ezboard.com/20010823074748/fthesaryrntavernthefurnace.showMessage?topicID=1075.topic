<br>
Tennessee's state government is trying to push through a state income tax.  The Tennessee state consittution strictly prohibits a tax on income...but do you think its stopping them????<br>
<br>
We have a &quot;Republican&quot; governer that ran on a platform that he is opposed to an income tax.  He has now changed his mind.  The Tennessee Republican party opposes this unconstitutional income tax they are trying to push through.  The state Democratic party fully supports the income tax.....but to be fair, there are some honorable democrats that oppose it.<br>
<br>
I don't know if anyone has seen anything about it in the national  media....but Tennesseans are tired of being taxed...and have had enough.<br>
<br>
About two weeks ago...there was a massive peaceful demonstration against the government in Tennessee.  It was portrayed as a &quot;mob&quot; by the media...which it was not.  <br>
<br>
The legislature has approved a &quot;bare bones&quot; budget that includes about a five percent increase in the budget over last year's.  The governer of Tennessee has vetoed this budget and today our legislature is meeting to attempt to override this veto.  <br>
<br>
We, the people of Tennessee are trying to take our government back and rein in the rampant spending in our government.  I am a state of Tennessee employee and I see the waste and abuse.  There are hundreds of state troopers, metro Nashville police, and State Capitol Police to &quot;protect&quot; our elected officials from this &quot;mob.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would like to know if we are getting any kind of national coverage.  Please post if you see any articles about our struggle against taxes.<br>
<br>
I would also be interested if anyone in Connecticut (I think it was Conn) who remembers when your state instituted a state income tax and the protest that followed...would post your thoughts.<br>
<br>
I also understand that North Carolina is starting to have a tax revolt there.  I wish to encourage North Carolinians to remain strong and don't fall for the typical threats that governement uses against its people.<br>
<br>
Stay strong.<br>

Usually states that don't pay income tax, make up for it with higher taxes for taxable goods and services (Texas for example).  Wanna know the worst part?  If they suddenly introduce a state income tax, there's little to no chance that those other taxes will come down.  How much better do ya feel now?<br>
<br>
I haven't heard anything about what's going on in Tennessee, but that's not atypical for me.   I usually miss the evening news and rarely -- if ever -- watch CNN or other 24 hour news networks. <p>Dakston Darkbow - Arc of Amicus<br>

<br>
But guess what..that is ok with me.  Everyone pays the same percentage in sales tax, so its a flat rate.  If you make a million dollars a year or ten-thousand, you pay the same rate.  A sales tax is a voluntary tax.  If you don't want to pay it...don't buy anything (other than necessities).  <br>
<br>
One of Tennessee's greatest strength is its low taxes.  Tennessee is one of the lowest taxed states in the union.  <br>
<br>
I dont know what the tax is on gasoline...but a gallon here is about $1.20.  <br>
<br>
I don't know about cigarettes...but again...that is a voluntary tax....if you dont want to pay it, then dont smoke.<br>
<br>
Your argument is very similar to the old tired out arguments that are always used.  If an income tax passed, then the sales tax would go down....for now.  Until the next &quot;budget crisis.&quot;  Then it would go back up again.<br>
<br>
Did you know that the original Federal Income Tax was a one percent tax on people making over $500,000 per year.  Now virtually everyone pays federal income tax <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All taxes, once instituted, are raised.  We have a very low tax rate here and lots of business locate here.  We want to continue this trend.  We do not need any new taxes.  <br>
<br>
We need to lessen the tax burden on the people.<br>

Re-read what I posted man.  I'm in total agreement with you.  What I'm said is that if a state income tax is instituted you'll still be paying that higher sales tax, the higher fuel tax, and all those other &quot;hidden&quot; taxes that you pay now to make up for a lack of an income tax.  In essence, you'll be taxed twice as much as you are now. <p>Dakston Darkbow - Arc of Amicus<br>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't state and local income taxes deductible from the federal income tax when filed.  If I'm not mistaken, these taxes are deductible but in arrears.<br>

I went to school in Ottawa at a fine school known as Carleton University.

Point being all Canadians paid for me to go to school... I than took my knowledge/exp and headed South for a different country to benefit. <br>
While not great here in CT, (No not Cazic Thule, Connecticut), my taxes are a lot lower than Mantrid's in Canada. :P<br>
<br>
I agree very much with what was touched on above though... and that would be a flat tax!!!!!  Something like 17-18% across the board.  For those who say that benefits the rich, STOP WHINNING!!  It benefits you too!!! Stop worrying about what everyone else makes, and try to be happy for what you are doing.  If I make more I still pay more taxes, if less than less. Nice and tidy... also would make April a much better month for all as the form would be damned simple. (I could go on about not having the IRS et... but I might get audited)<br>

I am not saying that you personally are solely reliant upon others.  I am saying that those of the socialist ilk tend to look to government to take care of them.  Those of us who are not of the socialist ilk tend to rely upon ourselves more.  There are always exceptions, but this will basically cover it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do care about myself and my family and I want to get the best healthcare and retirement I can.  Consequently, I would not go to any type of government run healthcare system because of its proven inferiority to private institutions and I would much rather invest my retirement into something that actually produces a return upon my investment.  I do not rely upon Social Security to provide my disability insurance, I have a private insurance policy.  I have life insurance to take care of my family and replace my income should I die.  In other words, I try to take care of my family using all the means at my disposal.<br>
<br>
I chose not to by new cars so that I can afford a nice house. We choose not to borrow money for anything except our house, which we only borrowed on a fifteen year mortgage.  We do not use credit cards, we use debit cards.  In short, I chose to be responsible.<br>
<br>
You said in your post something on the lines that you don't want to worry about retirement and healthcare and other such issues.   I infer that you would rather the government take care of this for you.  If that is your attitude, I submit that you should examine your attitudes and beliefs to see if you, in fact, do rely upon others and not upon yourself.  I believe it was Socrates that said, an unexamined life is not worth living.....<br>
<br>
However, if what I inferred from your statement was wrong, I apologize.<br>
<br>
Back to my main point.  Taxes everywhere are too high because people rely upon government too much.  The USA was started based upon a tax revolt over far less in taxes than we currently have.  The internet is one of the last areas of our lives that is not touched heavily by taxes.  <br>
<br>
If you think about it, in the USA at least, we are taxed when we are born through a birth certificate, we are taxed when we die, through a death certificate, and taxed throughout our entire lives.  <br>
<br>
I understand that lots of you may not be Christian..but...God only asked for ten percent, why should our government need more than God?<br>

Mine will be 20 years but hopefully I'll make the double up payments, etc.  I forget my rate, but it will float under prime to start (like 1.5 points under which was funny as hell cause my boss, a CMA only got like 1.4 points- he's annoyed lol)<br>

Stoan - wow, guess it's not that much different except i'll probably fly to see you.  Actually with other shifts I may end up going down there more to help out so we can hang....just make sure you have High Speed so I can play when i'm down there...i want my shoes back dammit, but at least I have an excuse not to go into the 40C humid plant....my bro stole my safety shoes so i CAN'T go out there to fix your PC lol. <p>Mantrid Dronemaker- 35th Level Enchanter <p>
