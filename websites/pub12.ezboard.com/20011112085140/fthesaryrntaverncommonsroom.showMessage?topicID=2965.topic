I have put up with every upgrade hybrids have gotten and not said anything. Well lets see they can tank well now due to having the same defense and now will be doing almost as much dmg. WTF!<br>
And spells to boot! Hey i guess we warriors still have defensive at 55th level but ya know for 54 levels we don't so why freaking bother? Hey and like the past you know the hybrids will whine some more and they'll get a discipline almost as good as defensive and put warriors right out of business. FUCK VI! I have had it! Thankgod daoc is balanced and nobody is excessively out of whack. I will never purchase another VI eqish can't make up their mind and stick to their word game again.<br>

Yeah i can see it now, you'll be saying just give us something almost as good as defensive, then you'll be spewing the crap all the pre 55 warriors have to listen to like how you can taunt better and how you can finish off a mob better and how that makes you a better MA and that us warriors aren't important because i heard all that BS pre 55. One ability makes us the better choice post 55 and that is defensive, for all that you guys get that we don't one ability that you can use every 15 mins doesn't make up for it let alone almost anything that is tagged war only costs outrageous amounts of money and is UBER rare. Hybrid gear is far more common and far easier to attain. You guys have always gotten the better end of the stick and always whine every time VI throws the warriors a bone, the last upgrade you guys got i said nothing about, now sure warriors are best on a raid, but in a group sks and pallies do a better job and that was before the latest upgrade. Sorry foos i pay attention to the details and your crap doesn't hold much water. Every uber guild has one or two MAs and that leaves the rest of us warriors out in the cold, so yeah tell me about being wanted or being useless, i have to give up all that extra dmg ability most times by using inferior weapons to the MA so that i won't take aggro and so do all other non MA warriors. Now with the upgrade between your spells and your better dmg output now you guys will actually outdmg non MA warriors. Yeah tell me some more BS. Prekunark warriors sucked plain and simple and all i see coming out of the latest 1337 upgrade is warriors getting pushed back to prekunark days a little more. Warriors are the only class without a get out of death free card amd you asses think you deserve all of our skills to boot. Admit it you didn't make a warrior because you though that with spells you were better than any old boring warrior then you all find out post 50 that warriors are a bit better and decide to whine so that you can push the class back again and be on top. I read the class discussions before absor removed them and i know that this is the case. Like i said you will all be asking for a disc like defensve soon and then you'll use your better taunting skills to say you can do a better job than us. Warriors need 2 things to balance out what VI just did, alot more hps and skills that allow us to take the beating, daoc has a nice one called protect, allows us to take the hits for another member of the group, not wuite taunting more like placing yourself in harm's way, and a better taunt but VI already stated they won't upgrade our taunt. So what did you think you deserved? BS!<br>

<br>
Clearly you focused on "roleplay" a bit much and don't bothered to learn about other aspects of EQ *Grin*.   <br>
<br>
<i>"Before any of you 1337 fooking SKs decide to reply, admit that eventually you all will be asking for or want a discipline like defensive, hps and ac are moot anymore, sks come damn close in those departments anymore especially since the introduction of zones like tov"</i><br>
<br>
Hmm, I haven't heard any SK/Paly/Ranger asking VI to give us uber disciplines like the ones warriors/monks got at all.  The voices in your head must tell you other wise.  Your entire HP/AC arguement is moot since Verant will never let hybrids have the same hp cap as warrirors and warrior item will always have the highest AC.  When was the last time you saw a SK/Paly being the main tank against a mob that flurries/rampages, quads for like 250+?   Didn't think so.  When it's all said and done, this game is about boss mobs and you won't see any many SK/Palys being the main tank for them, that's the bottom line.<br>
<br>
Maybe in a normal exp group, SK and Paly are almost as good as warrior in tanking but that's the way it's suppose to work.  VI made it so no class is indispensable in a normal exp grouping situation.  I'll be damned if any groups ONLY want Warriors as their tank because SK/Palys are too weak.  Grin, seems to me according to your theory, SK/Paly should be far inferior to warriors.  Well, I guess you're prolly the only one who's amused watching 10 paly/SKs lfg at zone in KC, Velk, Seb.  <br>
<br>
"Hybrid gear is far more common and far easier to attain."<br>
<br>
Blaming it on the economy now.  I assume your first choice for this arguement is the kunark armor.  Well, warrior kunark armor is more expensive, I'll admit that.  However, keep in mind the fact that the warrior DON'T cast spells in the first place and having those armor adds to their arsenal drastically.  As for hybrid Kunark armors, we already have 90% of the spells on those armors by level 39 and really, doesn't make that much of a difference except convienence and saving us spell slots/mana.  I trust we don't even need to go into the AC difference.<br>
<br>
"Every uber guild has one or two MAs and that leaves the rest of us warriors out in the cold, so yeah tell me about being wanted or being useless, i have to give up all that extra dmg ability most times by using inferior weapons to the MA so that i won't take aggro and so do all other non MA warriors."<br>
<br>
This is funny, I guess you seem to have forgotten which is the most popular class in EQ.  Translated to uber guild terms, gee wiz, I wonder which class fills up most slots in an uber guild roster *Ponder*.  Reality check, when you play the most popular class in the game, you better be ready to deal with the consequences.  Being that you have to compete for better items, paying more for weapons... etc, that's the way it goes.  Don't be blaming that shit on anyone else besides yourself.  If no warriors are gonna pay over 20k for a Cobalt bracer, you won't see anyone auctioning them for 60k in nfp.<br>
<br>
"Admit it you didn't make a warrior because you though that with spells you were better than any old boring warrior then you all find out post 50 that warriors are a bit better and decide to whine so that you can push the class back again and be on top."<br>
<br>
Don't be presuming why I made my choices in classes.  You don't know me and are far too inferior to understand my logic.  Well, I'll try to explain this to you even though I doubt you'd understand.  I PLAY THIS GAME FOR FUN, MORON.  I don't give a shit about what class is best post 50.  If I did, I wouldn't even make a warrior, I'd make a chanter or cleric.  Get a clue.<br>
<br>
"Warriors need 2 things to balance out what VI just did, alot more hps and skills that allow us to take the beating"<br>
<br>
You sir, is a garden tool.  The average warrior at level 55 has 300-400 more hp than Paly/SK of equivalent level?  When the fuck will you be happy?  When you got 1000 more hp than the closest contestents?  More skills?  Have you EVEN taken a look at the SK/Paly disciplines?  Are you fucking out of your mind?  Our skills blow HARD compare to warriors.  And now you want to seperate that gap even more by giving warrriors more skills?  You know what, I get your mentality.  You don't give two shits about balacing, you want the warriors to be a god class, the do it all class.  You want them to be so damn powerful that no other class can possibly come close in matching their defensive/tanking ability.  Go play DAoC, EQ isn't for you.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uvalrya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valrya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 307<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/3/01 10:28:00 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ritkhan.homestead.com/files/comeskull.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a bore</span><hr size=1> Kalana knows jack shit.  Let's look at the AWESOME shadowknight disciplines we have...<br>
<br>
/disc unholy .. the harm touch upgrade.  Resisted by most uber mobs... fooking ragefire resisted this.  Oh and it takes over an hour to refresh.  Not to mention that it barely puts a dent in the mobs when it DOES go off.  Even when we use this disc warriors will still outdamage us just by pressing &quot;attack&quot; and swinging at the mob.<br>
<br>
/disc Leechcurse ... heals you when you deal damage.  Takes over an hour to refresh.  Lasts like 15 seconds.  Our level 60 discipline!  omg how overpowering!  Gee wally, I can tank King Tormax with this one.<br>
<br>
Let's see what other awesome upgrades.  We got the same defense skill.  Offensive skills, dodge, parry, etc warrriors are STILL BETTER!  Get that?  Warrior only armor has a lot more AC and HP on it too, so warriors have the most tanking power AND do more damage.  Getting the same defense as warriors gave us a better chance at exp grouping.  From the look of it though, you wouldn't be happy unless warriors were the only tanks that got groups and all the hybrids were at zone LFG.<br>
<br>
Do you know why warriors aren't getting the upgrades now Kalana?  Because they GOT their huge upgrades when Kunark was released.  Hybrids were left in the dust when this happened and Verant is just now getting around to balancing it out.  In Velious, duel wielders got weapons with awesome ratios that blow all the two handers away.  Warriors will still do more damage, but knights will do a bit more than the small fraction of damage they used to do.  So that means while the warrior is tanking, at least we have a higher damage output to help take down that mob.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hah!  Now look who's whining.  At least when you aren't main tanking you are still doing more damage duel wielding then a hybrid using a two hander.  Maybe if you would level up a bit, guilds would let you main tank.  Lemme guess though.. you can't level up because all the groups in Seb and Velks are picking hybrids over warriors for exp groups <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://ritkhan.homestead.com/files/valsig.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ukrazaak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazaak</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 351<br> <font color=#6FB8DD>(10/3/01 10:37:05 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.tiac.net/users/eswimm/Krazaak.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a bore</span><hr size=1> Warriors are one of the most required classes, absolutely essential for tanking ubermobs.  Their damage output really isn't even a consideration, beyond being able to keep a MOB taunted on them.  That said, warriors still deal nice melee damage, being the standard upon which the others are based.<br>
<br>
Now, SHD/PAL are unable to tank most of the ubermobs due to lower AC (from equipment), lower dodge/parry/riposte skills and lower HP.  On top of that, we deal way way less damage, due to lack of dual wield, lower offense/weapon skill caps and lower melee table.  <br>
<br>
With the proposed changes, we'll deal a bit more damage, although still below that of a warrior.  We still won't be able to tank the same mobs.  Who looses?  Warriors certainly don't lose out.  Hybrids aren't going to suddenly be a requirement of raids, we'll merely be able to contribute more than lag.<br>
<br>
Verant was very smart in the way they designed this enhancement, since it very specifically targets raid encounters.  By increasing mimimum damage hits and melee tables, they are pushing up our damage on uber encounters where we miss way too much and hit for minimum when we do connect, without greatly effecting exp group situations where we usually have no real issues with damage output.<br>
<br>
As for SHD and PAL having more access to good gear, that is simply because they are two of the least played of the classes.  It isn't even entirely the case anymore, because many SHD/PAL twinks popped up when the exp tables were changed.  Add to the fact that we're now forced to compete with warriors (who can generally make better use of tanking gear) for all the high end SoV gear, we're in an even worse position.<br>
<br>
Hell, maybe the token uber guilds will start taking SHD/PAL at 59th level, instead of 60th.... doubt it though. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=36513">Krazaak Crushbone</a>

<br>
Or maybe the reason these &quot;uber guilds&quot; won't let you MA is because you have a piss-poor attitude and they're looking for someone that can see the good in their class.  You can't play your class well if you think your class sucks.   <p><hr>

By this comment alone, you must either, 1. Have a really low self esteem, or, 2. Don't know jack about your class when compared to other tank classes.   Tell me, how can you feel worthless simply because of that?  Who do you think would be preferred at a boss mob raid, 10 SK/Palys or 10 Warriors?  This is not a question for the gifted.  Anyone can make the obvious choice here.  This is the way it was and this is the way it's gonna be after the change.  I don't think you're comprehending the fact that even though the large gap between hybrid and warrior will be narrowed slightly, it doesn't mean warriors aren't going to be valuable or wanted.  Someone is going to get the shaft when you got 30 other people that plays your class in the guild.  Deal with it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessageRange?topicID=2965.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessageRange?topicID=2965.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessageRange?topicID=2965.topic&start=61&stop=78>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessage?topicID=3022.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.showMessage?topicID=3011.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.emailToFriend?topicID=2965.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.threadControl?topicID=2965.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2965.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2965.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntavernfrm14">Attack on America<option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6FB8DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntaverncommonsroom>Commons Room</a><font color=#6FB8DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
