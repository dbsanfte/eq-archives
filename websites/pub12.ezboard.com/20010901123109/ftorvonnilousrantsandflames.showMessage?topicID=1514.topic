Reserving a plane does not give you the right to dictate what happens on that plane the day before you reserve it.<br>
<br>
For the second time your 'friendly' LOL neighborhood wannabe uber guild has thought they owned fear the day before their scheduled raid.  They wanted us out of the plane this time by 10pm pacific.  <br>
<br>
10pm forum time.  Nope you can't even stay until midnight get out now.  So we have a guild wizard and guild enchanter who didn't get to complete their epics because we left the plane as an act of civility to the server bullies.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but as far as I am concerned making reservations in pointless if other guilds will gripe at you.  &quot;You can't kill Cazic we reserved fear for tomorrow!!&quot;  &quot;blah blah&quot;<br>
<br>
You know who you are.  You know that you take other people's reserved spawns.  (/cough Klandicar twice) You know that you try to twist our arm and bully us.  You know that you get on lists and let the mob sit for 3 days repeatedly.<br>
<br>
Just comes a point in the life of a server where people have to say, &quot;enough is enough&quot;.  I don't want to put up with your perceived uberness.  You don't own any plane or any spawn.  You may flame other guilds repeatedly on these forums and try to paint them as the bad guys with smear compaigns, but people see who you really are.<br>
<br>
And it isn't just us.  We just didn't fully believe the others until now.<br>
<br>
I hope you find your mobs in fear worth it.  Or do we need to zone into fear in the evening when you've given up on trying to defeat Cazic? eh?<br>

<br>
Second, you should have either directly talked to me or another Councilor if you had a problem. I was on but busy during a raid so I wasnt able to talk to you.  I havent been able to get the full details of whats happened personally, and its probably my fault for not trying to head it off once I heard a vague outline of it.<br>
<br>
As for Klandicar, you know full well why we got two spawns *that was agreed to by Rokar* due to the fact Blades killed Zlandicar (with a few Uniquity members helping I might add) previously that week.  I dont remember seeing Uniquity on any kind of rotation agreement so I really dont see how that applies to you or your guild.<br>
<br>
I apologize for being slack in not passing up Trak faster, that is indeed my fault being raid cooridinator for the guild.  Ill try to keep up with it just have been concentrating on other stuff and really havent had time to check the boards lately to see whos up.<br>
<br>
Insulting us as a guild is not going to get a rise out of us, were just not that kind of player who enjoy flaming and tossing insults. So when you want to come to me or another Councilor and speak in a more calmn tone just let me know,  Im sure we can figure out something to make both parties happy and continue peacefull relations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uaccidic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Accidic</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://planetdia.virtualave.net/iconff/gau.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Future Ruler of Norrath<br>Pimp of the Gnomes</span><br>  Posts: 6124<br> <font color=#122950>(8/11/01 12:08:51 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://shildare.homestead.com/files/Pics/zioanim.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice guys or bullies?</span><hr size=1> Bah...

Explain to me how Tides acting like you own fear well into the day before you have it reserved is not insulting our right to just play EQ.<br>
<br>
And I was wrong btw.  You didn't want us out at 10pm forum time but 9pm forum time.<br>
<br>
The Klandicar incidents were not those that were a tradeoff for Zlandicar but again whose counting there?<br>
<br>
When ANY group decides they own planes the day before they are reserved they have gone much, much too far.  That isn't reasonable, realistic, or even inline with a 'nice guy' type guild.<br>
<br>
Seriously.  Let's ask every guild on the server what they would say when the 'big bully' guild comes and says, 'get out of fear by 9pm pacific'.<br>
<br>
Blood of the Phoenix what would you respond to tides?<br>
Fifth Column?<br>
Blades of Wrath?<br>
Soul Cadre?<br>
<br>
Do I need to run my exp group schedules by you too?  No, this isn't acceptable.  NO, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME.<br>
<br>
Or was all that spam from Blurred, Luminati, etc that wednesday weeks ago not the stance of the Tides of Destiny officers.  We had fear reserved on wednesday you had thursday.  Cazic was up on wednesday and we were going to kill him and did in fact.  It sure didn't stop EITHER of those from outright telling me that your reservation of fear on thursday meant that we couldn't kill Cazic on wednesday.  There were others from Tides that messaged me that night I don't remember but it was tell hell.  And let's not forget that the server went down and Cazic was back up for you that friday and well...you weren't able to take him down despite all the crap you gave us about taking him down.<br>
<br>
Twice.  Twice.  We ignored one and the second we left evidently to be civil.  But the Torv server is not the property of Tides of Destiny.  Is rant and flames the place to resolve problems? no.  Is rant and flames the place to remind everybody that this is the same bully who has come here so often and flamed the uber guild on the server?  Yes.<br>
<br>
I'm not looking to resolve problems with Tides of Destiny.  When you decide that Torv belongs to you what can be resolved?  People often would whisper that Blades of Wrath was some evil uber guild.  Sad to see that the guild that steals spawns from Blades happened to be some of the biggest proponents that Blades don't respect other people's spawns etc.<br>
<br>
So tomorrow I'll hear from Ssil and he'll tell me not to post anything on here.  But I'll be glad I did.  Because you guys know that if it wasn't for us working with Blades after you guys STOLE their Klandicar that you would probably have 8 to 10 less ST keys right now.  So you have your keys and you have your fear.<br>
<br>
And you also have your new reputation as the bully that says, &quot;you must be out of fear by 9pm pacific because we have it reserved tomorrow&quot;.<br>
<br>
What would you say if we told you that?  Hmmm?<br>
<br>
Exactly.  Nothing is resolved here other than where I stand and maybe some people realizing what kind of guild you are.<br>

<br>
Put simply, we planned to do fear early am Saturday. Last weekend, I lay the claim down on fear. I didn't take friday as well, obviously I should have. It aparent to me now that most people consider early AM Saturday to be the same as late Friday and that is the source from which this conflict derives.<br>
<br>
I get home from work, and I send you a tell letting you know that we intended to go in early saturday to kill shish. Suprise, shisshar is up. I had expected it to spawn at about 2 am EST Saturday.<br>
<br>
Ok, well sucks to be me then, my timeing was off. I tell you to go ahead and off it if you can do so before Saturday. You didn't take that well at all. Ok, fine, lets find a comprimise. I can understand fully why some people will think that even though it is only friday still in a quarter of the planet that you could have a reasonable expectation that friday doesn't end at midnight eastern. The majority of the players are US based after all, and most people are up fairly late on a weekend night such as this.<br>
<br>
I tried to talk to you about it, to try to find a time where we could say up to this point is still friday, and if it still alive at that point then ToD will kill as planned. Instead of talking, you got angry and stopped talking to me, saying that you leaving fear in an hour and that you will remember this.<br>
<br>
Well, I don't want a fight. I don't want any enemies. And spawns in this game are not worth makeing enemies over. I talked to Tanger, whom I have known for a long time. He tells me you had to leave anyway, to kill trakanon before you lose some clerics due to logging out. I waffle on it for a long time, emphesising that we will cancel our saturday fear if needed to avoid makeing an incident. Tanger assures me that it is OK, you needed to leave anyway, and that we should go ahead.<br>
<br>
Without any further tells from you, Uniquity leaves fear. ToD stays out of fear till 2 am eastern, our orriginal planned entry time. We go in, we kill the mobs, and I still never hear back from you.<br>
<br>
It is very hard to solve problems when there is no line of communication. The mobs are not worth this arguement. At one point in our conversation, you sugjested that I would slander Uniquity on the boards if you did not leave. Never was that the case. Let me state here that I have several friends in Uniquity, and I have a high opinion of the guild. Let me further state that I have a good opinion of you and that I want to come to a resolution for this problem that you find acceptable. I particularly do not want you to feel that we are enemies somehow.<br>
<br>
I appologise to you for the perceived slight, and I'm sorry my earlier communications before I angred you were not as clear and concise as they should have been. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C5C5BA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/usielle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sielle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Insane Enchanter<br>Elfie Admin<br>Belmonte's Bane</span><br>  Posts: 1282<br> <font color=#122950>(8/11/01 2:06:23 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice guys or bullies?</span><hr size=1> Clerics logged anyways, and Trak still dropped. <p><BR>

Saturday is saturday. Friday is friday. Doesn't matter what timezone or continent or planet (who knows some weird peeps in EQ).<br>
<br>
However, EQ/VI/Whatever 's servers run from San Diego California. that is PST. It doesn't matter if it is 5am EST if (for some really fugging wierd way) if it still was nighttime on friday PST. I am no officer, or have any clout with any guild whatsoever, but I do hate misscommunication in the worst way. And besides, I only heard few snippets to gain an inkling of what was going on. What I did gather was being given a specific time. If not true, probably wouldn't have been said. If it was true, bad bad bad.<br>

Ah well, least a lot of the yard trash got cleared. Go us'es.<br>

That one was signed off on the forums Sythrak by Konga and Rokar and led to the deal of giving you the next 4 Zlandicars and an alternating rotation set up for Klandicar (which as I kept track of was not followed and I'm not the only person who seems to be of this opinion).<br>
<br>
If we were involved in killing a ToD Zlandicar I'd be curious as to why we were NOT messaged.  I know that we were in spam hell when we almost took your Zlandicar and I mean 'we' as in Uniquity.<br>
<br>
We may not have been in the rotation but I'd say when we killed Zlandicar with 18 Uniquity and 19 BoW that pretty much puts us in the rotation, no?<br>
<br>
Going back and forth may not help, but this post was never about resolving an issue between us.  This post was about making a final stance that just reiterates what Sirakova posted AND says don't even think about telling us what mobs we are allowed to kill while we are in a plane.  The first time we just made note of it.  The second time it has been put out in the open what is going on.  I'm sure you'll make sure there will be NO third time.<br>

<br>
&quot;BoW is taking the next Zlandicar and Klandicar spawns. Tides is then taking the Zlandicar spawn<br>
until another guild joins in. Klandicar will stay on an every other week rotation with Tides picking  it up after BoW.  All parties have agreed to this. Though we are asking them to sign off here as public agreement.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is from the Dragon boards, signed off by Konga and Rokar and written by you if I remember correctly.  Its still there for all to see.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tides is then taking the Zlandicar spawn until another guild joins in&quot;.  There was no agreement to the next 4 Zlands, there was an agreement we would be killing Zland due to no faction loss at the time until another guild is capable of killing the dragon as a guild.  Kland would be rotated with Blades and Tides.<br>
<br>
18 Uniq and 19 BoW sounds like a joint raid to me, not a singular guild raid.  We already know Blades as a guild can kill these dragons, and usually the agreement is when a guild proves they can kill them alone then<br>
they can be set up into the rotation.  Revisions can of course be made, but I think you need to figure out whether  Blades + Uniq is considered as a one guild rotation concerning large mobs.  I dont really know currently whats up with Blades on these spawns since they seem to be having problems.<br>

If he can't remember it you can jog his memory by saying, &quot;was there some if/then clause involved to make sure Tides gets X keys&quot;  That was the 4 Zlandicar thing but some things weren't there for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually and there was more than that involved in the Klandicar part as well.  That also doesn't need to be brought to public attention and I think you can deduce why.<br>

<br>
first of all, <br>
get your guild leader  Ssil to speak for your guild.  you seem to have an issue with your temper.<br>
<br>
second of all, <br>
i was in tells with you yesterday, but i said NOTHING of ToD's stance.  all i did was listen to you complain, insult, and threaten me and my guild that you and BoW will not honor anything reserved by ToD.  that if we were to reserve something, that you would probably be interested in killing it before us just because we reserved it.<br>
<br>
third <br>
everytime you send me a tell asking me something about ToD's stand, i repeatedly mention that i am not an officer that this is my personal opinion.  i do this explicitly because i dont give ammunition to people like you to use against me.<br>
<br>
fourth <br>
you're telling me you are the sole force behind uniquity and BoW that is keeping BoW from going FCFS on ToD and have been for the past 3-4 months.  i had no idea you were leading both guilds, by the way you talk to me thats what it sure sounds like.<br>
<br>
i don't know what you were trying to do by telling 2 members in ToD that weren't officers your problems with us and fearplane.  you obviously weren't making an official threat on behalf of Uniquity and BoW, because I would imagine you'd make those threats on the boards or directly to an officer.<br>
<br>
I can only assume that you were intending to bully a few people in the guild to hopefully get them to speak on your behalf or further your cause. sorry, try someone else. better yet, if you have a real issue, tell it to your leader and the leader of the other guild you are speaking for, and let them handle it.<br>
<br>
i always kept it cool with you eliezar, we never hung out but like i said i always kept it cool with you and angil.  it just sounds like this game has gotten to you you seem to be way to stressed out nowadays. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/umaloric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maloric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#122950>(8/11/01 11:34:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice guys or bullies?</span><hr size=1> Go back and read his first post.<br>

<br>
That was also Cazic v1.0 that could have been killed by any open raid of like 30 people.  <br>
<br>
The new CT has rotated between the uber guilds on some other servers, but I am not sure it is like that here or not since we did have that old rule what Sira posted. <br>
<br>
It only makes sense for the entire server to rotate and stick to it.. It is bad enough that 1 uber guild has to reserve/clear fear weekly for CT, but if 2 guilds are fighting over fear, that leaves only 5 reservable days for the rest of the server. <br>
<br>
Just my opinion though. <p>- Uinael</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B8C0C7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ueliezar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Torvonnite</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#122950>(8/11/01 12:20:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: you're way too into this game</span><hr size=1> It was me personally that was a go between Konga and Rokar to keep Blades from just taking every spawn, yes.  Ask Konga.  Ask Rokar.  Blades were going to just FCFS everything and Uniquity would have benefitted greatly from it.  We thought we needed to give it a shot at working out first.<br>
<br>
It was Tides that on two occasions has decided that we don't have the same right to the fear plane that you do.  Two occasions tides people were all huffy because we were there to kill something you wanted to kill the next day.  This is so against the way this service has operated it isn't even funny.<br>
<br>
We watched as you took a Klandicar out of rotation while we were in western wastes.  Oh but only BoW would do that.  /yawn.  Wait ToD are the good guys.  Its BoW that does the bad stuff.  Nope we were keeping track and we saw it.  Every Blades of Wrath member can verify it to as I asked them if Tides had last Klandicar and they said, &quot;yes is he up? he's ours&quot;.  Amazingly I watched Blades just let that one go by.  They were more concerned with doing ToV north than getting in some petty spawn dispute.  How many times have I seen Blades of Wrath let things go like that?  A lot.<br>
<br>
How would you react to a guild that jumps spawns out of rotation and tells you on multiple occasions to leave the plane you are in or not to touch certain mobs in it?  If Saben isn't the person to talk to about the raid HE SCHEDULED and HE APPROACHED US about then who is?<br>
<br>
Tides of Destiny was always painted as the nice guys that were just clueless.<br>
<br>
Clueless = giving a manaregen item to a warrior.  Everybody still laughs when they hear about that.<br>
<br>
What next are you going to tell me today that I have to get out of Mischief because you want to do it tomorrow?  Or are you going to give a 12dg 16del sword with 40 percent haste to a necro?  Maybe you'll set up a CH rotation on a shaman for Cazic Thule?  er you tried that already and it didn't work? sorry<br>
<br>
Am I mad?  I am mad that we were dumb enough to put faith that you guys were an alright group of guys and then we watched you take spawns from other guilds and try to bully us out of fear on two occasions.  Gee and when the TRUTH comes out those nice guys in ToD tell me stuff like this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saben is a greedy ass&quot; Ask which warrior in your guild told me this today.  He wants me to know that it isn't all of you that want to bully people around its just &quot;some members but not all of us&quot;.<br>
<br>
The some that lead raids and harass other people, like Ssil, while they are leading raids.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget that it was Relixander of Tides of Destiny that trained a crapload of dwarves onto a group of Uniquity people hunting in Thurgardin.  Oh wait.  It wasn't Relixander it was his son and his mom said he really didn't train anybody.  Nah we just had 6 or 7 deaths and some walking and rezzing to do but there wasn't a train.  Was this train provoced?  Evidently from someone not in our guild and someone in our guild jumped in on the disagreement.  That sucks we should NOT have said jack to andria, but we got trained none the less.  <br>
<br>
Let's not forget that we had an actual enchanter waiting on the mob to spawn in Neriac and you guys had a mule.  Our chanter had people en route and was in zone trying to claim the mob when your group comes in and says, &quot;tough luck&quot;.  Sure we said it isn't something to squabble over.  <br>
<br>
Of course after the HISTORY of Tides of Destiny infractions you wonder if it is something to squabble over or not?  How many spawns do you want to push us off of?  How many spawns of our friends will you steal?  How far do we let you go before we just say FINE, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.<br>
<br>
So continue to bully.  Continue to give warriors manaregen items because they need them.  Continue to throw 70 people at mobs and hope the mob goes LD so you win.  Continue to throw accusations at the people you harass (Blades of Wrath, etc).  <br>
<br>
Just make your slogan &quot;Tides of Destiny - mana regen coming to a warrior near you&quot;  or &quot;Tides of Destiny - clear all exp groups and raids on server with us or else&quot;<br>
<br>
But you are the &quot;good guys&quot; on the server.  You are the &quot;adults&quot;.  And if I say, &quot;no more of this crap from you we'll just take what we want.&quot; Then of course I'm the bully.  /bog<br>
<br>
And remember Luminati YOU are the GENIUS who said, &quot;yeah it was GOOD that the warrior got the manaregen item.&quot;  There goes any hope of credibility in you knowing up from down.<br>
<br>
You also said, &quot;Blades are evil they won't share spawns with us they'll just take what they want.&quot;  But wait...Blades shared and held up their agreement yet YOU took their Klandicar and your whole guild pleads amnesia about it now?<br>
<br>
So take things as you want, but don't accuse me of bullying you.  You never push someone unless you are prepared for them to strike back.  But I don't guess you were...<br>
<br>
I guess if I wanted to actually flame you guys I could have just posted some logs from your guild chat though.  Its amazing the amount of people you trash isn't it?  People that mind their own business.  People that don't tell people what mobs they are allowed to kill.  People who don't give CoFs to mages and manaregen items to warriors.  I'd be flaming them too.<br>
<br>
I've seen some pretty bad things on Torv.  Twice I've been on raids where I was not allowed to even roll on an item that I could use that dropped.  One of those times I was the ONLY PERSON on the raid that could use it.  I didn't flame either of those guilds on the forums.  I've seen two guilds on the server just go right up and TAKE Uniquity spawns.  Neither of them were flamed by me.  Although I did laugh when someone else decided to take a few spawns of theirs later.  What goes around comes around eh?  So you can make things out however you want.  But remember I don't tread the rant and flames lightly and I don't do it except where habits have formed that make it worthy.<br>
<br>
Just remember all those times your members flamed BoW about nothing.  Nothing else really to write or reply to about this.  I just hope a good chunk of the other guilds see how you guys react to people who are minding their own business but happen to be after some of the same mobs as you.  Next time there is a disagreement with the other guilds they are going to be thinking in the back of their head, &quot;Wait a minute.  These are the guys that tried to push Uniquity out of fear twice AND who stole Klandicar spawns from Blades of Wrath.&quot;  That's gonna change the way they deal with you guys and the amount of trust they have in you.<br>
