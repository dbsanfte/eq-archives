You cant return what you sold.<br>
<br>
It also doesnt address what kind of friends you have who would take this info behind your back, and betray you so utterly.  I can't imagine a friend doing this to me, I can imagine someone trying to sneak the items away from guild who they just left.<br>
<br>
But to address the one thing you did respond too, a person would have to be fairly comfortable with the game to know how to use the /who command with filters such as &quot;all&quot; &quot;60&quot;.  It seems odvious to people who have been playing a long time, but to a newbie, its not odvious at all.  I again put forth, anyone who would know enough about the game to login both accounts, trade the items, and know how to track down people such as pickher to trade, and a fairly accurate idea of the value of the items would know that this is a MAJOR nono.  <br>
<br>
You can not claim your friend was ignorant of the fact that what he was doing was majorly wrong.  There is NO way a friend would know this much about the game and believe that its ok to login a strangers acount and &quot;borrow&quot; their items.  Wrong in general, and very wrong in betraying YOUR trust. <br>
<br>
And again, you flatly contridict yourself when you claim that your friend intended to return the items he was just borrowing. and that he tried to sell them.  You have stated both, both can not be true.<br>
<br>
Conclusion, there is no friend.<br>
<br>
There is just gelroos.<br>
<br>
I am very sorry Gelroos, I liked you, but it doesn't add up, it just doesn't.  I was the last(vocal) member of Bow to give up on believing you, on the private boards I stated again and again how I just couldnt believe you would do this, but I am sorry, sooo very sorry, but I really think you did.  Maybe you were just pissed and in a moment of anger did something you regret, and got caught before you had time to reconsider and return the items on your own, or feared that you were screwed if you returned the items, and hoped no one would find you out.  I hope that somewhere in you, you wanted to return them before you were caught, but were afraid, cause we all do really stupid things when we are pissed and are not thinking, and sometimes they are things that we cant easily undo when we calm down.  I dunno, but I did shed a tear for you when I finally felt convinced it was you.  I wish we could go back a week and pretend this never happened, for you, for kenar, for the server, for all of us.<br>
<br>
I know many will always think Bow jumped to a rash conclusion, but there was heavy talk on our forum, with many people who were long time friends of Gelroos defending him, and many people who refused to accept that this could happen.  It was not a rash descision, and in the end, a unanimious one(some members did not comment at all, and for their opinion I am in the dark)<br>
<br>
Maybe if you come clean, say you acted in haste, then feared what would happen if you tried to undo what you wished you had never done, maybe then the server can heal.  Maybe then Bow will learn to not hate the sight of you, and learn to just tolerate you doing other things.  Maybe then we can be friends again, somewhere in the future.<br>

And you're right there are a lot of holes in Gelroo's story. I'm still not convinced of his guilt but I hope Gelroos is able to answer the points raised in Calli's post. There are a number of issues that need addressing IMO.<br>
<br>
In particular the issue of why was your 'friend' trying to sell the items. Has he since confessed to you he was actually trying to get some pp? Or did he try and shaft your reputation?

I didn't know he was going to sell them.  I thought he was going to just use them for twinkage and give them back.  THATS WHAT HE TOLD ME. And when I say newbie, I'm not talking level 1.  I'm talking level 15.<br>
<br>
If i was EVER going to steal someone's equipment, which is something that I would *NEVER* do, it would not be Kenar.  I go back with Kenar to the old EoP days in solb.  He is by far the most friendly, generous person I've met and I'd by NO MEANS steal ANYTHING from him.  I'm sorry Kenar if you're reading this, I will accept responsibility for leaving info &quot;out in the open&quot; which is my bedroom, I didn't think I'd have to lock it up in a vault or something.  I'll accept that, and for which I am sorry.  I guess I should of destroyed the info when I left the guild, I never had really thought about that. I've just been so busy in real life lately.  If anyone here had to study for final's so they would graduate ( I had a 71 D in English and i NEEDED to study 7 hours a day to pass that damn final or it would be another year in school.  That's what EQ does to ya )  But guys, believe what you want to believe, I just can't go on anymore, there's no way, after 57 levels on this server I would go and do a thing like this and ruin my own reputation.  This is the best server I've ever been on, I love the people here for the most part.  <br>
<br>
Calli when you said that it sounds like something someone who recently left the guild would do.  Did you read why I left the guild?  Was I pissed off at the guild?  I *needed* time to level, and get my epic.  I wasn't getting that in BoW.  I wanted my epic so so bad,  why?  The effect on it is the MAIN REASON.  Not because I'm a lewt hungry guy.  In all of the raids i've been on  with BoW, I have asked for a total of about... 3-4 items that dropped.  NOT lewt hungry. I love being useful to people.  I had planned on re-joining when I had graduated high school, gotten a couple levels and epic.  But now, becuase of this unfortunate incident, that is no longer a possibility.<br>
<br>
  As for me not believe I get caught, I know a lot about GM's, I know items being transferred can be traced.<br>
In response to my friend &quot; betraying me &quot;.  This is a game.  To him, at least.  Maybe not to some of you, or me.  But to him it's just a game, and by taking items from a fantasy game on the internet, items that arn't really even real, didn't seem much of a big deal.  I'm still working on getting him to post an apology on the main board.  Believe me, i'm trying.  I've talked to him so so many times about the crap i'm getting in EQ.  All I ever get is the response &quot; chill out man it's just a game, i think you need a real life &quot; <br>
<br>
If he stole a wad of cash from my wallet, my television, my vcr... now that would be betrayel.<br>
<br>
Most of the things I'm saying have already been answered.  I'm done posting,  I don't want to argue with anyone anymore,  I'm hated now because of this incident, I really don't want to be hated from an attitude or harsh words aswell.<br>

That does NOT sound like any vindictive thief I've ever met, not even someone who made a mistake and is trying to hide it now. His facts fit too well together.<br>
<br>
Sure the situation can be twisted around, to suggest one incident that he was flamed for over half a year ago that shows the person against Gelroos was probably trying to get his friend phat l3wt..but that still doesn't change that all the facts can fit TWO sides. When the facts are considered neutrally, and with his reputation, Gelroos' side seems more plausible.<br>
<br>
Gelroos I apologize for continuing this. I really hate seeing arguments that I see major holes in, but that are so eloquent people are going to believe them just for that. I have a hard time letting this go but I can understand you not wanting to continue posting your defense and risk harsh words that will hurt you further.<br>
<br>
I'm not a part of this except as a concerned third party who sees a good person being accused of something very bad. I really would like to know the answers to a question you haven't found out yourself (or haven't told us). Have you asked your friend why he was asking about prices and trades? The rest of your story seems VERY believable. He told you something but did another thing..I would really like to know why (and I'm sure other people who lean more towards believing you want to know as well.) Was he curious what the items cost? Did he think this was your character and didn't have a problem selling &quot;your&quot; items? Has he given any explanation for this? That's the only &quot;hole&quot; I see..but since you haven't answered it yet it's not a true hole, just a possible hole *grin*<br>
