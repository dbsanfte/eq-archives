<br>
Several seasons ago I submitted to the tugging at my heart, by a dark man of necromancy. His name is Dansen. As we sat under the moon in North Ro so long ago, watching the sunrise as we were sharing ourselves with each other, I came to realize what my reason for being in Norrath is. I discovered that Rodcet Nife chose me to touch the heart of another, bring him into my life, and share my light with him. He also chose me to open my heart and mind to one most seekers of life would shun. Rodcet Nife chose me to seek the truest form of life, the life we share in love and peace with another. <br>
<br>
Many nights have passed since then, and my feelings for Dansen have only grown stronger. I never spoke to Dansen of my calling, but I think he always knew. I set aside my beliefs, and he set aside his, and we became one. We set out together with our differences behind us, and found a blossoming friendship that soon bloomed into love.<br>
<br>
Indeed, in the depths of Infected Paw, Dansen forever changed my visions of life in Norrath as he knelt before me with these four words…. “Will you marry me?” <br>
<br>
My heart cried, and my soul danced with his as I ecstatically accepted his proposal.&quot; - Klem<br>
<br>
We would like to invite our friends and family to celebrate with us as we start anew and take each other in marriage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Klemara took Dansen’s hand in her own and held it tightly, knowing this was the beginning of what would be the most beautiful flight of their lives. The flight of love, of not two people, but of two hearts joined in faith and devotion into one being. As Priestess Aytania finished her blessings over the couple, and pronounced them united as one before the Gods and Powers of Norrath, Dansen took Klemara in his arms and the two sealed their vows with a soft, gentle kiss, full of pure love and admiration for each other. Dansen looked into Klemara’s eyes and wiped away a tear as it streamed down her cheek, gently brushed her hair from her face and whispered in her ear, “You are my world, and I love you, my angel. We were meant to be.” Klemara nuzzled her head into his chest to hear his heart as it beat for her, for them, for their love, and said to him, “I know, doll. We are all I’ve ever dreamt of.” She raised her head and looked at him and whispered, “Let’s go home.”<br>
<br>
_________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<I>But where would home be for them? Klemara has stepped away from the light of Rodcet Nife, and though she knows he chose her for this, and in his eyes all is right, the townfolk still do not understand. Dansen, once walking in darkness, now has a light and love in his life, and thus Innoruk’s other children may see him as a defect child of hate and banish him from dark lands. Neither of these places could be home. So they shall walk in the shadows of their love, and take comfort in each other’s arms at night. Home is where your heart is, and Dansen & Klemara will find home in each other.</I><br>

<br>
Soon thereafter, Lord Crazeco came upon them and blessed their new surname, Dae’Mela, elvish for shadow love. The two were now one, in the eyes of all present and those who were not, for eternity. As the sun set and the celebrations died down, friends began to fade away. They retreated with family for one last hunt, and then settled near the ocean for the evening. As they sat in the damp air of the night, the stars and moonlight glowing across the rippling tides, Klemara turned to Dansen and with once glance told him he was everything she would ever need. The two took comfort in each other and found home for the night.<br>
