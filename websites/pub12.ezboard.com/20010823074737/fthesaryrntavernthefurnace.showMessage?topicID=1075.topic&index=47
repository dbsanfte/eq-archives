I have smoked pot so don't try to tell me that it hurts you or is a gateway drug.  Alcohol has been much more unhealthy for me than pot and kills more people.  Cigarettes kill more people than pot.

        See its all inter-related. From why taxes are moraly evil.. to why drugs should be legal.. I can even string it to why a god doesnt exist... But that would take a while..<br>
         To have money taken from you by force... by a government implys that the government doesnt believe fully in individual rights.  It implys that people do not know what is best for them... but some how magicaly a government does. You have to ask &quot;To what extreme will the government have controll in my life?&quot; ...  Will the government tell me what i should eat and drink? .. What drugs i can take or not.. And throw me by gun point in a prision when i made a choice that can only hurt myself? ... Do i have a right to my life anymore?<br>
          It seems more and more like .. No you dont have a right to what you can do with your body/life.    <br>
         You either believe in individual rights or you dont.. Freedom (lassiez faire capitalisim) or slavery ( communisim)..  This country is getting more and more socialist, and people dont care... Makes me wonder if people would care if the country was taken over by a dictator. <br>
           But this post was started as a bash to TN taxes... But then in later posts he said how some taxes were needed. You cant have it both ways... im sorry.  The root of any tax is robbery... money taken by force. And to say &quot;some robbery is needed&quot; makes you just as bad as the people taxing you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/ulordulric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordUlric</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#DDA0DD>(8/14/01 7:23:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Taxes :(</span><hr size=1> I am sorry if you don't get my point.  I don't if I can state it any more clearly.<br>
<br>
Taxes are a fact of life.  We need them for basic services.  The common good is served by a government run and  tax funded military, police force, food inspectors, etc.  Like it or not, your view is on the fringe.  Most people concede the need for some level of taxation.  The argument is the level of taxation.  <br>
<br>
I agree that too many people rely on government to provide services that they shouldn't be relying on.  However, that does not change the fact that government should provide some basic services funded through taxation that is for the common good.<br>
<br>
I guess we both believe that the tax burden is too high, so lets just leave it at that.  I am for lessening the tax burden and you are for relieving it entirely.  On this issue lets just agree to disagree <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Arismo, I don't really think you understand how cheap some people are. Just because people would like police doesn't mean they would give them money. &quot;Ohh there will be enough donations, so Ill just skip out this time.&quot; How many people do you know that download MP3s they really love and never buy the album?

  In a lassiez faire society people would have a lot more money in general. Items would be a lot cheaper also.  To donate a few here and there wouldnt put any strain on your pocketbook at all. <br>
   Think of how much money corperations would donate in such a society... Assuming the coperations value there own property, and freedom. Such coperations would LOVE to donate huge amounts... Because in a lassiez faire Govt.. they would be more prosperous than ever.. certinly more than any company in a socialist government. <br>
<br>
    You might think that monoploys would result in such a capitalist driven economy.. You need to understad that the only harmful monopolys have been government backed. There would be no government backed companys in this system. The governments only job would be to protect individuals from harm or fraud. <br>

Who is to keep all the corporations from getting together and deciding to pay workers the bare minimum or using child labor?  Who is to keep them from unloading tons and tons of pollutants into the water and air we need?  Corporations aren't some perfect benevolent force.. they are driven by PROFIT and (the bad ones) GREED most of the time.  Car manufacturers have already shown that they WILL build a deadly car if the cost of life is less than the cost it will take to fix their product so that it is safe.  There are pharmecutical companies that WILL (and do) put deadly medicines into the market if it will give them profit.<br>
<br>
Lowering the cost to make things doesn't necessarily make prices go down.  Nike laid off American workers to get sweatshop labor at a few cents and the shoes are STILL expensive because they want to cover the costs for their lame ass advertising and make  HUGE profit for the CEO and executives.<br>
<br>
Regulations on corporations are put there to protect the people.  I don't want to breath smog everywhere and drink foul water.  I don't want to see people being paid a few cents an hour for slaving all day and get sick from lack of health care.  Your ideas would change the country from a state where we have a &quot;little&quot; power to NO power unless you are the head of a corporation.  You don't like waste being dumped in your neighborhood now?  At least you can TRY to get the goverment to stop it.. with laissez faire you can just get shafted.  You can't elect the executives of large corporations. <br>

You say greed like it is a bad thing... Like money somehow is the root of all evil. I disagree... Money is earned by effort, and creativity. Those are not evil by any means. <br>
   The thing with the sweatshops i got to disagree also... People go there by choice.. No one in those 3rd world countrys that choses to work in a place like that is forced to go to work with a gun to there head. And if they are.. That takes away a basic right.. The right to your own life..  If you were to check out the link i gave it will answer most questions about this..  <br>
    <br>
      If companys band together and try to make a Oilgopoly (spelling?)  it doesnt matter as long as its NOT government backed.. Because competition is always free to enter and exit the market. And in the end the COnsumers decide what is best for them.. <br>
     Unlike marxisim.. or socialisim.. This is the only free system i can think of... You are not a slave to the state or &quot;the people&quot;, you are an individual.  <br>
      The governments only job is to have a monopoly on force, for the protection of our indiviudal rights. And if we value those rights, which we would, corperations.. people.. would be free to donate at anytime they want.. Not because they have to.. not because its some &quot;duty&quot; forced on you by gun point.. But because they WANT to.<br>
<br>
      As for pollution... If it can be proven that they are actually doing harm to others property or life.. then yes that is against the law as well.  <br>
    <br>
     As for child labor and your statement of paying workers less... You have to realize some economics here, and some basic common sense.. If i were to pay my workers as little as i can.. What incentive do they have in a free society to stay? .. My production would not be as good, and my profits would suffer becasue of it... It would also lower my workers morale. It would be in my best interest as the owner of the company to keep my workers happy. Or my workers will leave for better paying jobs.  It would be impossible for every company to get together and decide that all our workers shoud get this amount per hour and no more... The free market doesnt work like that at all, and it wouldnt be in the companys interest anyway.<br>
        Childlren working on my factory floor would be no where near as effective as adults, and would just get in the way.. lol. I would not hire a child to do a mans job.. to slow! I havent thought much about the legality of this also...  but it seems that the parent, or guardian would have rights over a child until a certin age... And the parent would have say if the child should work or not.  It would have to be a mutual agreement between the parent .. child, and company.  Unless it was a simple ass job.. it would NOT be in the companys best interest to hire a child. I wouldnt... <br>

What about the third world people who are tricked with contracts saying they are going to get a job in the US but they end up on some island in a sweatshop and aren't ALLOWED to leave by contract?<br>
<br>
The richest companies.. when choosing between human rights and profit.. will almost always pick profit.  I do think greed is a bad thing.  Greedy people - Money itself is not bad.. it's the LOVE and OBSSESSION with money that is bad.  When is it ever enough?  How much shit do you have to accumulate in your pathetic life before you are ever satisfied?  How many workers have to be laid off and lives ruined to make a fraction of your miserable stock go up before you are HAPPY? <br>
<br>
Companies are ALREADY laying people off to get cheaper labor... you say it's not in the company's best interest to do so?  Then why are they doing it?  People who previously had benefits get laid off for temp workers and young workers so they can pay less.  If there were no minimum wage, wages would drop a LOT.  Workers in this country are already a lot worse off then they were in the 70's when you adjust cost of living/inflation.<br>
<br>
Your idea is a utopian fantasy.. Corporations SHOULD NOT have the same rights as a human being.  I personally don't want to live in a world controlled by the whims of rich businessmen.. oh wait.. what do we live in now?  /sigh<br>

  Your statements seem really racist if i do say so... Why dont big coperations have the same rights? .. They are made by people like you and me who just happened to have a bigger vision of what they can achive. <br>
   By racist i do not mean against the color of a persons skin... But the achivements, and wealth of &quot;big business&quot; ... You need to question.. WHat are you really against here? Achivement? ... Progress? ... Mans Mind? <br>
   I hold people in Big business with more respect than most people ... because they have shaped their vision, and we have ALL benifited from it ( bill gates is a good example).<br>
    Without the achivements of Capitalisim, and big business you might not be on a computer right now...  All of these man made objects around you in your room or where ever your reading this... HAve some Value, and were created somehow by man made effort. That is what Money is when you think about it.. It represents a unit of effort on your behalf... and you trade it for an item you want... Effort traded for Effort.<br>
     a &quot;Tax&quot; Is not a trade .. Its forcefully taken. <br>
       I am only suggesting a system where there is no legal robbery. I like to believe that as a human i have free will and know what is best for my well being... I should not be forced to live for a &quot;state&quot; or &quot;the people&quot; against my will. <br>
<br>
        You say that companys are laying off  people left and right... Yes, they are.. Look at the bad economic climate.. would you rather these companys go bankrupt, and then everyone loses there jobs? ...  Working is not a &quot;Right&quot; .. It would be insane to have companys  by government force.. not be able to lay people off.<br>

You just reminded me of people who used to say to me &quot;you hate the kkk?  doesn't that make you racist against the racist people?&quot;  /groan. <p><img src=http://ritkhan.homestead.com/files/valsig.JPG></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uvalrya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valrya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0> at: 8/20/01 10:59:28 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1114.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.showMessage?topicID=1138.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.emailToFriend?topicID=1075.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.threadControl?topicID=1075.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1075.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1075.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub12.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesaryrntaverncommonsroom">Commons Room<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm12">Screens -n- Things<option value="thesaryrntavernthesaryrnmarketplace">The Saryrn Marketplace<option value="thesaryrntavernclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="thesaryrntavernfrm9">Class Epic Quests<option value="thesaryrntavernthefurnace">The Blast Furnace<option value="thesaryrntavernmmorpgtherisforroleplaying">MMORPG: The R is for Roleplaying!<option value="thesaryrntavernlinks">Links! <option value="thesaryrntavernfrm13">Archives 'n Misfits</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#DDA0DD>- </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthesaryrntavern>The Saryrn Tavern</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><a href=http://pub12.ezboard.com/fthesaryrntavernthefurnace>The Blast Furnace</a><font color=#DDA0DD> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
