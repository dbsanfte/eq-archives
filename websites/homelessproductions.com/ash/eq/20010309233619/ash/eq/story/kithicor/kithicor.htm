      <tr> 
        <td height="665"> 
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It<font face="Calisto MT"> was cold that night, 
            and rain came down upon my hair. Cold in Kithicor Forest? It never 
            had been before, and perhaps it was an omen of what was to come. </font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Guildmaster be damned! 
            If I never kill another goblin, it would be too soon,&quot; I thought, 
            as I exited the cave that leads from Rivervale to Kithicor. The guild 
            had sent me to Rivervale to help the locals with their goblin infestation 
            problem, but they were much more a nuisance than a threat. I began 
            to think that they had just sent me away, as if I were some kind of 
            problem.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">As I jumped down the cliff 
            face to the dark green grass, I shivered, and looked about me. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The Kithicor woods, named 
            after a strange, silent wood elf named, ingeniously, Kithicor, was 
            one of the most empty hunting spots I had seen in my travels. The 
            locals concentrated all their efforts on the Thicket side, and, thus, 
            left their backside open for attack. Hence the reason I was here, 
            in the cold, wet, foggy mess that is Kithicor Forest.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I quickly ran to the shelter 
            of some trees, and ran into, of all people, Aldarin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Hail, old friend!&quot; 
            Aldarin said, probably as surprised as I was.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Hail, and well met!&quot; 
            I said. &quot;What brings you to Rivervale?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He looked at me with a smirk. 
            &quot;I went to Faydwer without you that morning, but something told 
            me something was wrong. So I went back to Qeynos, spoke with Gatha, 
            and she told me you came here on a guild mission to Rivervale.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;So,&quot; I said again, 
            &quot;What brings you to Rivervale?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Aldarin chuckled, &quot;I 
            thought you might need some help...if you even found it in the first 
            place. I am quite surprised to see you here in one piece.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Heh. We will see who 
            saves who next, my friend.&quot; I said, glad to see him again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I quickly told him the situation 
            in Rivervale, and my reasons for leaving the relative safety of the 
            Misty Thicket to come to these woods. &quot;Let us investigate, then, 
            and see if anything is afoot.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">As we traveled in Kithicor, 
            we met a cleric of Karana named Gnorth, a humble little fellow, who 
            claimed to be from Freeport. Since we were hunting Darkweed Snakes, 
            among other poisonous things, we decided to let him travel with us.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;You two know that there 
            are rumors of Ghouls in the area, eh?&quot; Gnorth asked, with a suspicious 
            tone.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Aldarin stopped in his tracks. 
            &quot;Ghouls? This close to a city? I do not believe it.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I paused, thinking of the 
            adventures I had had with Levarne. &quot;Aye, Aldarin. I do believe 
            that Ghouls are around. That's part of the reason I wanted to come 
            here.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;This is mad!&quot; 
            said Aldarin. &quot;Do you think we can handle such beasts?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Gnorth smiled, &quot;We shall 
            soon find out, friend.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We continued our travels, 
            and looked for anything suspicious. After skinning perhaps eight or 
            nine snakes, we all heard a tremendously odd moaning sound.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Stay put,&quot; said 
            Aldarin. &quot;I believe we may have stumbled upon our Ghouls.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Gnorth and I stayed under 
            a thick tree, which helped us avoid the rain. We were silent, a bit 
            nervous, and very worried about our ranger friend.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">He suddenly appeared over 
            a ridge. &quot;Seven zombies line up in front of some ruins just over 
            the ridge.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I looked at Gnorth. &quot;I 
            think we can handle them, don't you?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Gnorth smiled and lifted 
            his mace. &quot;Aye.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I think its a bit risky,&quot; 
            said Aldarin, but then, he too drew his sword. &quot;But we can't 
            let the undead camp this close to a major city.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">At that, we began the most 
            dangerous war of our lives. Seven zombies surrounded us, as we stood 
            back to back, and took them out one by one. Aldarin claimed the unlife 
            of three of them before Gnorth and I had taken out one (at least that's 
            what Aldarin claimed after drinking some Dragon's Breath back in Rivervale 
            later that night). I was freezing some of them, and burning others, 
            as Gnorth smashed heads with his mace, even as they shrieked and slashed 
            us with their claws. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Soon, a pile of seven dead 
            bodies littered the clean forest floor, that seemed to disrupt nature 
            itself. The bodies reeked of burned flesh, but there was no blood 
            to be found.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;We have probably alerted 
            the master&quot; I said, in a somewhat concerned tone. &quot;I wonder 
            if he is working with the orcs and goblins of Runnyeye?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">My question was met with 
            a grunt from Gnorth, and utter silence from Aldarin.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">A quiet moan alerted me that 
            something was indeed amiss. I stood and spun around, just in time 
            to see a zombie slash at me. It hit my arm, and it went limp. The 
            coldness of the creature seemed to freeze my blood, and by it's touch, 
            I wanted to faint. I stabbed feebly with my dagger, and struck it 
            several times, but still, it swung it's arms in a frenzy, trying to 
            take the life from me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">A sharp crack sounded suddenly, 
            and the zombie fell into a heap onto the forest floor. Behind it stood 
            Gnorth, and he was patting his mace in his other hand. &quot;Where 
            are they coming from now?&quot; he asked, ready to fight again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Aldarin held up his hand, 
            to keep us quiet, and then pointed to his left. From where he pointed, 
            no less then five more zombies came over the crest, and the battle 
            was on again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Swords slashing, and maces 
            crunching, shrieks and sobs, and cries of pain were heard through 
            out the forest. I cast as many spells as my body could handle, and 
            I even stabbed a few with my Giant Snake Fang, and soon, none were 
            left. The severity of the problem of Undead and Rivervale was apparent.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">We ended our travels back 
            in Rivervale, after alerting the proper authorities. Of course, they 
            said, &quot;We'll look into it, and see if there is anything we can 
            do.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I suppose that means that 
            Aldarin and I will have to go back, and see if we can destroy their 
            master.</font></p>
