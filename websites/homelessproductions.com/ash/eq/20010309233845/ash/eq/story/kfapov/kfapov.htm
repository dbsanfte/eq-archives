    From Another Point Of View</b></font></p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border="0" width="75%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr> 
        <td height="1155"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"At least its not raining," Kiedatar muttered 
            as he strode down a well worn trail in the Karanas, heading back to 
            Qeynos, his home in exile.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> As he came over a small rise in the road, 
            he encountered a slightly built man in a robe. Judging by the man's 
            size and the lack of any visible scars, Kiedatar quickly surmised 
            that this man must be a magic user like his friend Lenhaj.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Not entirely comfortable with magic, Kiedatar 
            decided to press on without speaking. After all, the man might be 
            in league with the bandits that infested the area. Still feeling the 
            effects from being poisoned by a giant spider earlier that day, Kiedatar 
            had no desire to get involved in another fight, especially one that 
            might involve magic. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">As he passed the man, he spoke up, "Excuse 
            me, sir, but I seem to have gotten turned around. You see, I saw a 
            giant in the distance, panicked, and got lost until I found this road. 
            Unfortunately, I do not know if this is the road to Qeynos, or which 
            way Qeynos would be."</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> The man stood up, brushing the dirt and 
            dust from his robe. He seemed harmless enough, Kiedatar supposed. 
            "I'm headed in that direction myself," he said. "Feel free to tag 
            along. If you can't keep up," Kiedatar shrugged as if to imply that 
            he wouldn't wait if the man could not keep up. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Thank you, good sir, you are a life saver. 
            Karana was most kind in sending you to my rescue." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar just shook his head and began a 
            brisk jog down the road toward Qeynos. To his surprise, the stranger 
            managed to keep the pace and began talking with him. Or rather, talking 
            to him, for Kiedatar did not encourage the conversation. At least 
            the man seemed well learned and intelligent and his talk, while idle, 
            was not the inane prattle of many of his countrymen. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">About thirty minutes later, the low throaty 
            cough of a lion startled the two as they walked along. Kiedatar froze 
            and held up a hand to silence his companion. He looked around, but 
            could see no trace of the lion. Wait a minute! There in the bushes. 
            Two green eyes set upon a tawny face looked back at him. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">By the size of the creature's mane, Kiedatar 
            knew this lion was older than many of the lions that he had seen before. 
            This was not a good thing, for surely with age, the lion had only 
            become more and more dangerous. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Barbarian," his companion hissed. For a 
            moment, Kiedatar was irritated. These soft southerners did not seem 
            to realize that they were far more barbaric than their northern neighbors. 
            They had no respect for nature, the Great Spirit, or even themselves 
            for that matter.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"What?" </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"We've got a problem." The man jerked a thumb 
            behind them and Kiedatar glanced in that direction. The man was right, 
            they had a problem. Three of them as a matter of fact. The lion in 
            the bushes, and the two lionnesses that were sitting calmly on the 
            other side of the road, not much more than 30 feet away.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> They were in trouble.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> Kiedatar was still feeling nauseous from 
            his battle with the spider earlier and his companion did not look 
            capable of taking out three lions even with magic. For a brief moment, 
            Kiedatar considered making a run for it and hoping that the lions 
            would settle for a meal of wizard. Even as he thought the thought, 
            he recognized that the Great Spirit was testing his moral resolve. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">As he glanced around looking for a defensible 
            position, he saw a tall tree. If they could get up there, hopefully, 
            they could the lions off until they grew tired or until help came 
            along. He forced a smile so as not to frighten his companion unduly, 
            "When I say go, we are going to make a run for that tree. You'll have 
            to drop your pack. With luck, they'll stop to eat whatever food we're 
            carrying and leave us alone. Besides, it'll make climbing easier without 
            the packs. You understand? Good." Kiedatar slowly slipped his arms 
            out of his backpack and noticed that his companion was doing the same. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"GO!!!" He shouted, dropping the pack, and 
            began to sprint toward the tree. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Behind him, one of the cats let out a bone 
            chilling screech and he knew instantly that the cats had not gone 
            after the packs. Kiedatar reached the base of the tree and jumped, 
            grabbing hold of one of the lower branches. Using his strong arms, 
            he quickly pulled himself up. Behind him, his companion was struggling 
            to get up the first branch. Bracing himself, Kiedatar reached down, 
            grabbed the man's wrist and yanked him up just as the cats reached 
            the bottom of the tree. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">One of the lionnesses tried to jump up into 
            the tree as well, but was met with heel of Kiedatar's boot. The cat 
            dropped back to the ground, snarling. The two travelers worked their 
            way up a few branches. The cats began to circle the tree, but none 
            of them made the attempt to climb the it again. Kiedatar could not 
            resist it. "Hah! You silly cats, you were not meant to lunch on Kiedatar 
            today. The Great Spirit protects me and some day I will eat your hearts 
            and take your courage." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">CRACK! The branch under Kiedatar's feet snapped 
            and the big man plummeted to the ground, hitting several other branches 
            on the way down, knocking the breath out of him. He hit the ground 
            hard and it seemed as if the very stars were dancing around his head.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> He was dead. He knew it. The Great Spirit 
            was punishing him for his pride and arrogance. The cats would be upon 
            him at any moment, tearing the flesh from his bones. He would never 
            see his beloved north again. The People never give up. Even winded 
            he tried to regain his feet to climb back up the tree. One of the 
            lionnesses clawed at him, tearing deeply into his thigh. The lion 
            looked about to pounce. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">KABOOM!!! The world exploded, or so it seemed 
            to Kiedatar. A ball of fire exploded right in front of him, throwing 
            him against the tree and knocking his newly regained breath right 
            out of him. He felt his eyebrows singe, and he cringed when he thought 
            of what that blast might have done to his wolf skin helm. He heard 
            the lions shriek in pain.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Don't just lie there, you oversized barbarian. 
            I merely scared them with that blast, and I lack the mental energy 
            to cast another spell. Get up here." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar grunted, staggered to his feet, 
            and pulled himself slowly into the tree. At last he reached the same 
            height as his companion. The man regarded him with a bemused smile. 
            Kiedatar wanted to punch him.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"Thanks," me muttered irritably. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"It was my pleasure," the man said, nodding 
            his head. "Try to pick a sturdier branch this time." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"I'll keep it in mind," Kiedatar grumbled. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The man stuck out his hand, "My name is Gilgadet. 
            I'm a wizard." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Kiedatar reached out and took the hand, engaging 
            in the strange southern ritual of handshaking.</font></p>
          <p> <font face="Calisto MT">"I am Kiedatar of the People. I'm tired, 
            hungry, and slightly crisped."</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT"> The man smiled and shrugged. "At least it's 
            not raining." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">"Aye, at least it's not raining." </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">It started to rain. </font></p>
