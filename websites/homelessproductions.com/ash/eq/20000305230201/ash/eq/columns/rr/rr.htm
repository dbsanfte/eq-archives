        <p><font color="#3300FF" face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Rant Submitted 
          by Ryndal on 5/10/99</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I have traveled the lands recently 
          only to find a few things disturbing. The fact that so many people forget 
          what good role-playing is all about is the most disturbing of all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">You know, I once met a man 
          (I'll keep his name to myself) who ended every word with &quot;th&quot;. 
          I suppose he might have been trying to mimic some Shakespeare or somethingth, 
          but, more than likely he was trying to make fun of the role-players.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Everyone is entitled to play 
          the way that they wish. But for a game to have enough ambiance to literally 
          suck you into it, it is unfortunate that the feeling is disturbed (not 
          entirely destroyed), by a player who is talking about his car, wife, 
          school, etc. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I believe the downfall (if 
          any) to online RPG's is not going to be technology, camping, too many 
          magic items, or any of those hotly debated issues. I believe the problem 
          with these games are the people. Ironic, isn't it?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Sadly, there is nothing that 
          can be done about it. You can't force people to role-play, and EQ, so 
          far, has proven to be very condusive to role-playing. The problem is 
          better solved by leaps and bounds over UO, but still leaves a bit to 
          be desired. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">For every bad incident I have 
          had, however, I have had two good incidents. This gives me great hope, 
          in that perhaps good role-playing will be taught to those too unfortunate 
          to not know what it is, or how good an experience it can be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I was waiting for the ship 
          to take me from Freeport to Kelethin, and I asked a dwarf who was standing 
          there if he knew when the boat was going to get there. He told me he 
          wasn't sure, but if I didn't stop singing, I was going to scare the 
          fish away! (Aye, I am a bard). This turned into a long conversation 
          about BlackBurrow Gnolls, the cites, guilds, and several other in game 
          topics. Soon the dock was full of players, in character, speaking of 
          passed adventures. And even though this dwarf was high level, he escorted 
          me to Kelethin, and later to Crushbone, all because we were in character. 
          Because of role-playing, I made a good friend.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">That was, perhaps, the most 
          fun time I have had to date. We never even lifted a blade to strike 
          an opponent, or sung a damaging song, but I was every bit in Norrath 
          as I had ever been.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">The next thing that bothers 
          me is the fact that people are so defensive. I don't know where this 
          phenomenon comes from, but it's evident everywhere. In game, newsgroups, 
          where ever. What makes people flame?? Indeed, it's something that could 
          be researched for years. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">There was a guy who was obviously 
          in a party in Northern Ro the other day. Everyone in his group was using 
          the /group tag, except him. He was using auction. Usually I keep to 
          myself, but I felt sorry for him. &quot;Maybe he doesn't realize it,&quot; 
          I foolishly thought. So I sent him a polite /tell asking him to use 
          the group option instead of auction, as the rest of us didn't care to 
          see &quot;Who's Loot&quot;, and &quot;Man that was close&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">What he responded with shocked 
          me. &quot;Who the F*** are you to tell me to do anything?&quot; Of course 
          this was still on the auction channel, so now seventy other players 
          are seeing this, and probably wondering what he's talking about, since 
          they didn't see my message. I didn't immediately respond with anything. 
          So for the next five minutes he harassed me with auction (generally 
          making an ass out of himself in the process), then he said, &quot;What 
          if I don't want to use /group. Then what?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't going to respond, 
          but then I said, &quot;Then nothing. Just common courtesy, that's all.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure if he reflected 
          on this and decided he was being a jerk, or if he had too many /tells 
          after that to count, but he suddenly stopped. Both harassing me, and 
          using the auction channel.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Now, I realize that you can 
          just turn off all auctions, but that is rather inconvenient if you are 
          shopping for armor, (as I was). It is far more convenient, and courteous 
          to other players, to use the channels the way they are intended. Why 
          broadcast messages intended for your group to the entire zone, especially 
          when it is simple to put an &quot;X&quot; into the group box?? I fail 
          to see any reason or excuse to misuse the channels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">But that goes back to what 
          I was saying about role-playing. Verant has made it extremely easy to 
          be courteous to other players, but no one cares. Very few characters 
          actually give a damn about other's. Most only care what their skill 
          is in 1h Slashing, and how many minotaur axes they can sell that day. 
          Which is fine. I just wish there was enough courtesy in the game world 
          to let people play, and associate with players of like mind, uninterrupted.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the rant,</font></p>

        <p>Ryndal, with all due respect, I think you are full of sh*t. First of 
          all, MOST people do roleplay somewhat. You can't have a CRPG that is 
          a perfect RPG, because there are to many limitations with today's software. 
          The sooner you realize this, the better chance you'll have enjoying 
          EQ.</p>

        <p>I think that people choose to be the way they are...from playing the 
          way they do (I must be level 50 to have fun)...all the way to flaming 
          in newsgroups. It's just the way that most people are...especially younger 
          people. Over the last few years, I have learned how to better deal with 
          other people...You know how? Here's the big secret:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ignore them.</p>

        <p>I agree with Ryndal. It's just supposed to be a fun ROLEPLAYING game. 
          I wish there was a full roleplaying server. I mean...the pkers got their 
          own, why not the roleplayers?</p>
