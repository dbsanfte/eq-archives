    to a Journal</b></font></p>

        <td height="36"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Today, for no apparent reason, I decided 
            to begin a journal...a diary if you will. Perhaps it is for my own 
            benefit, so I can reflect on where I have been, or what I have done...perhaps 
            so I can become a better person, a better bard...Or perhaps it is 
            in case I suffer the final death, so that a record of my achievements, 
            and my losses shall be on paper, and the Choir, (whom I suppose will 
            be written about in depth in the coming years), might write a song 
            about me.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I am Ryndal, a bard from Freeport. I am slightly 
            arrogant, or so I have been told, and I do-quite often-break of into 
            rants, and tangents. Why I don't just sit and act like the others 
            around me is obvious. This world is full of adventurers. To be set 
            apart is to become an individual. And an individual is much more likely 
            to become a hero, than your everyday, average, BORING, adventurer. 
            Especially the ones whom I would consider cowards. You know the ones...they 
            never really leave the confines of the cities, and are always looking 
            for a safe place to have their souls bound, in case of death. How 
            difficult is recovering your equipment, anyway? At least the gods 
            have given you a second chance of life. And life is, after all, ruined 
            by the living. Indeed, perhaps Undeath would be a better life than 
            this...but I digress (see, I told you I would go off on tangents).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">As I said before, I am Ryndal of Freeport. 
            My father was a merchant, and spent most of his days in the Marketplace 
            in North Freeport. He ran a small shop that sold supplies to adventurer's, 
            and to other stores. He met my mother, who was a ranger, during one 
            of her frequent visits to the fine city. My mother, a wood elf, was 
            fairly tall for her race, and extremely beautiful.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Speaking of beauty, I seem to see it in everything, 
            as most people should. But the beauty of a woman...The subtle curves 
            under leather armor, and the way they smell, even after hacking the 
            legs off a giant spider....Is it not perfection in the works? The 
            gods must have spent an eternity arguing over the way a woman's legs 
            might curve, and their breasts....not unlike the rolling hills near 
            Qeynos! . . . . . . . . . . . . sigh.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">My parents were married soon after my mother 
            decided to retire from adventuring, and help my father run the store. 
            He did a great deal of new business, as my mother drew the attention 
            of all her adventuring friends. It was then that I came to be, and 
            these were wondrous times. Such is the greatest beauty: A happy family.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">After a few years, just a few, mind you, 
            but I was old enough to know what happened, and I remember it as clear 
            as yesterday, my father decided to expand the business into the Western 
            Commons. He seemed to think that more supplies would be sold on a 
            battlefield, than deep in the city. Perhaps he was right, and so, 
            against the wishes of my mother, he proceeded to open the place.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">On his first day at work, a messenger appeared 
            at our little store in the city. &quot;Victors! West Commons branch 
            is open for business, mi lady.&quot; Said the messenger to my mother. 
            &quot;It is doing fairly well. Victor misses you, and the little one, 
            and will return by suppertime&quot;. With that, the messenger turned 
            and walked out the door.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">My mother, always excited about such things, 
            decided to make a large, banquet style feast for dinner. She began 
            preparations immediately after the leaving of the messenger. A friend 
            of hers, who worked for the city of Freeport, allowed us to rent a 
            hall fairly cheaply. I remember the hastily cooked fish, boar, steaks, 
            and other edible, but expensive, delights. The hall was decorated 
            by city staff, and all was finished. She sent out a multitude of messengers 
            to get word to all of our friends in the Freeport area, and placed 
            signs all over town, inviting all to the Hall for the feast to celebrate 
            the success of my father.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">When dusk settled over Freeport, we began 
            expecting my father to return. But he did not. The hall, full of eating 
            adventurers and merchants, seemed empty without him. Hours went by, 
            and, although the feast went on without him, I began to suspect that 
            something was wrong. I remember feeling lost, as I wandered the hall, 
            looking for him, or my mother. Both seemed to have disappeared.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Soon after this, a fat merchant halfling 
            from Rivervale, (who made the most wonderful Iron rations around), 
            came to me and said, &quot;Little Ryndal, you will be spending some 
            time with me the next few days! You can stay with me, and help me 
            run my little outlet here!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">When I asked him where my mother was, he 
            just smiled and said, &quot;She had a few errands to run. She'll be 
            back.&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I did not believe him, but his tone was soothing, 
            and I had been with him before. I decided not to worry, as perhaps, 
            she really did have a few things to do. But I was still a bit disturbed.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The next few weeks, I spent with this halfling. 
            We didn't do much, other than run his store, and he ignored all my 
            inquiries about my parents. On a gloomy day soon after, my mother 
            returned, and said, &quot;Oh, little Ryndal. Poor, little Ryndal.&quot; 
            Her eyes welled up with tears. &quot;You father will not be coming 
            home. My worst fears have come true, and on the first day of business!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Further questioning revealed little that 
            day, but I came to learn later, much later, that my father had, in 
            fact, been slain by a Griffin. The nasty beast did slay him, and put 
            his soul to the permanate slumber. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">We moved from Freeport to Kelethin after 
            that, and I was amazed at the tree city. She opened a bakery there, 
            I suppose she didn't want to continue in the general store business, 
            as it reminded her of my father too much. The days passed there in 
            safety, and I soon got over my loss.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">But a man named Gregory Lutesong is who really 
            helped. He was an adventurer, but was a bit different from all the 
            others. He would come into my mothers bakery once a week, and I would 
            always race to see him. He would come in spinning tales of adventures, 
            and singing wondrous songs. Indeed, he was an inspiration to me....and 
            to many others as well. Groups of people would flock to him, and ask 
            about his latest tales of riches (not that he ever seemed to have 
            any...indeed, mother was always giving him food). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">His tales, true or not, left nothing to the 
            imagination. Swords flying, and feet kicking, and this bard would 
            sing these beautiful songs, and inspire his battlemates. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">One time he came in, I followed him out. 
            I wanted to see where this man went in our fine city. Sneaking several 
            feet behind him, he went to a smallish shack across a long bridge. 
            I read the sign above the door: The Bards Guild. Oh, the wonders that 
            came out of that building! Poetry, song, and many woodelf's would 
            dance the old dances to these songs! I began to get swept up in the 
            old magic's of my (well, half of my) people. I was hooked.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">And so it came to be, that I became a bard. 
            I would spend hours with the guild, even though I was much too young 
            to become a member. I met many nice adventurers during these times...and 
            the man I followed to the guildhouse the first time began teaching 
            me the mechanics of a mandolin! What a fine instrument the mandolin 
            is. So many different sounds to be made into music. And music, my 
            friends, is what drives the soul. The secret to battle is not courage, 
            strength, valor...nay, ask any general...the secret to battle is morale. 
            And what better way to raise others spirits than a beautiful song, 
            and joy, and merriment!</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">This is why I chose the path that I am on, 
            for I want to bring happiness and joy to others around me. I want 
            to see the beauty in everything--from a springtime flower, to a troll. 
            (Aye, the last one is a bit difficult). Fairness to all, is my motto, 
            and has paid off greatly, as I have made some friends, even with dark 
            elves. (Although I can not speak of them to anyone).</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I suppose I began this journal more for a 
            point of reference than any other reason. As I graduated the basics 
            course at the guild, my mother passed away. Indeed, she was getting 
            old, but I think more loneliness did the job than age. She gave me 
            a wondrous life, without my father, but never seemed to be the same 
            again. Rest in Peace, mother, I will spread the word of your beauty 
            to all, and, one day, publish a report of your wondrous deeds while 
            you were adventuring.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I closed the bakery last week, and moved 
            to Freeport, so I could be closer to my origins. Kelethin is a beautiful 
            place, but one which holds too many painful memories for me right 
            now. Perhaps in time, I can return, and my jaded eyes can once again 
            become soft with the greenery there. Perhaps.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">As for now, I have begun a repor with the 
            guildhouse in Freeport, and I will begin to forge my way in this life 
            very soon. Sooner, in fact, than I would have hoped.</font></p>
