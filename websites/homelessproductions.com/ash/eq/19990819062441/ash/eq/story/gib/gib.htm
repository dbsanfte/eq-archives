      <tr> 
        <td> 
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Hail, and well met, stranger,&quot; 
            said the old man, as wind blew across his thinning hair. &quot;You 
            have come to hear the story of Gilgadet, both Wizard, and Scolar. 
            A man of worldly origins, but perhaps, godly power. I will spin the 
            his tale for all to hear.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">And so he did tell me.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It all began seventy years 
            prior, when Shamak Westwater, Gilgadets grandfather, decided to move 
            his merchant business to Qeynos, as he heard of better business there. 
            After the long trek from Freeport, he and his wife settled down and 
            enjoyed years of profit.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It was during these years 
            that Gilgadets father was born. He was a small baby, but Evander grew 
            into a healthy toddler, however, he was quite destructive. Even though 
            he was young, he often flew into fits of rage that no one had ever 
            seen from a boy so young. His mother would protect him, and tell people, 
            &quot;He is just a baby!&quot; However, none of the other people saw 
            it this way. They chastised Shamak, and spoke such atrocities as, 
            &quot;Kill the boy, or leave the city, that is your only choice, now!&quot;</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">With little knowledge of 
            weapons, or art, the couple removed themselves from Qeynos, and relocated 
            to a small village in the Jaggedpine Forest. There, they took up farming 
            for a living, and raised Evander in relative safety.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Throughout adolescence, Evander 
            learned to better control his anger. Although the family had lost 
            it's fortune by being thrown out of Qeynos, they began to live a happier 
            life. The time came, though, for Evander to leave the family home, 
            and begin a life of his own.</font> </p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">He moved from the small village 
            back to Freeport, fully intending to regain his family fortune. He 
            began a small merchant outfit, The Humble Backpack, and began selling 
            his merchandise. After a year, he met a beautiful woman who went by 
            the name of Rune. The married, and began a family. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Gilgadet was born, on time, 
            and healthy. They lived in relative peace for five years, when Evander's 
            rage rose once again. On a stormy winter night, he and Rune had an 
            argument, and he slashed her with a knife several times. He drug her 
            body into the night, fully intending to leave her for dead. But she 
            did not die.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">With her strong will, Rune 
            returned to the family home, to find that Evander was beating his 
            only son. She snuck behind him, and smashed him with an iron cooking 
            pan. As his eyes rolled back into his head, she lifted Gilgadet in 
            her arms and whispered, &quot;We must leave.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">She packed very little, and 
            moved away from Freeport; as far as she could afford. And so, the 
            family once again returned to Qeynos. Not wanting to alarm the people, 
            for she had been told of her husbands follies there, she changed her 
            name from Westwater, to Qual' Iian, which meant in the elvan tongue, 
            Blessed Ones. It also explains how a full blooded human aquired an 
            elvan name. People, although very curious, do not seem to force the 
            issue. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">For ten years she worked 
            odd jobs, trying to find a niche in the Qeynos society, so that she 
            could provide for Gilgadet, and she had almost forgotten upon what 
            terms she came to the city. She returned home one evening, after running 
            some errands, and a knock sounded loudly on their inn room door.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">As she opened the door, she 
            found a note on the floor, with no trace of who left it. The note 
            read:</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT"> <b><font color="#FF0000">Don't 
            think you got away this easily, woman, for I know your every step. 
            And, mark my words, Gilgadet will be dead soon. I promise.</font></b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Tears welled up in her eyes 
            as a myriad of memories enveloped her. She knew that Evander was serious, 
            and that something had to be done to protect Gilgadet. So she went 
            to the Hall of Sorcery to see what could be done about it.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">The Guildmaster listened 
            to her words carefully, and said, &quot;Woman. The best defense is 
            a good offense. No one could protect your son as good as he. Send 
            him down for a test, and let us see if he has the skills to become 
            a wizard, so that no man, including this heathen, Evander, can harm 
            him.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">The old man sat back in his 
            chair, looking at us, and waiting for some reaction. He sighed and 
            stood and said, &quot;I will tell you more in good time. These old 
            bones need to rest.&quot; He walked away, and we wondered if we would 
            get to hear more. </font></p>
