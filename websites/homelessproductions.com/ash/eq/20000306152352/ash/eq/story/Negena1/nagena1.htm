      <tr> 
        <td height="36"> 
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I am thankful for many things. Aye, the wine 
            we drink, the poems we write: even the very blood in our viens. In 
            fact, the thing I am most thankful for (at least today), is that I 
            am able to write the second entry into this journal. Indeed, I have 
            been blessed with many things, and my blessings continue to this day.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Although I haven't written about her, I met 
            a druid named Lilthia recently. She is a wonderful person, and her 
            attitude on life is like no other. Indeed, she breaths life, and justice. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">It was for these two reasons that she wanted 
            to travel to Nagena, and take care of the hags and witches there, 
            for they, we heard, are destroyers of life, as opposed to proponents 
            of it. I had no idea how underpowered we could be.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">The journey began with ease, comming from 
            Rivervale and traveling through the commons in the general direction 
            of the feared(at least to the &quot;light&quot; races) forest of Neriak. 
            We had no choice but to travel through these dangerous grounds to 
            reach Nagena, far in the Lavastorm Mountains.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;We must cut through this forest, Ryndal.&quot; 
            Lilthia said, studying a map she bought from a halfling merchant.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;Aye, milady. I'll get us through here 
            as fast as I can...but no promises. The dark elves will not take kindly 
            to our kind here.&quot; I was a bit disturbed by our having to travel 
            so close to our evil cousins homeland.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Lilthia looked up from her map. &quot;I believe 
            caution would be advisable over speed here. I think they can see better 
            in the dark, not to mention the fact that they know this forest better 
            than we do.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I suppose I should have agreed with her, 
            then sung Selo's Accelerando anyway, but I did not.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">We began our journey through the forest with 
            caution. I noticed that the forest was very dark, especially for so 
            early in the afternoon. The tangle of branches was so thick that almost 
            no light shone on the floor of the forest, and the air was stagnent. 
            We could hear strange sounds, and it seemed to us that something was 
            watching us.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">All around, I could see shadows, and eyes. 
            Aye. Eyes. Little pairs of eyes, seeming detached from their bodies. 
            Looking at us. Gazing with curiosity, and wide with....fright? I doubt 
            it.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I wanted to see if I was going insane and 
            ask Lilthia about it, but it seemed as though speech might make them 
            all attack us. Perhaps that was a wise thing to do.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">We crept around the forest for hours, hoping 
            against hope that we'd come to the entrance to the Lavastorm Mountains 
            before dark.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;You see that path?&quot; she wispered 
            pointing just beyond a large sycamore tree.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;Aye&quot; I said.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She pointed to her map. &quot;That is the 
            path we need to take.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Looking at the map myself for the first time, 
            I noticed that there was a river in the way, and that a bridge spanned 
            across it. &quot;Hmmm.&quot; I said, &quot; I hope I'm wrong, but 
            I 'll wager that the bridge is guarded, to keep the light races out.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She crinkled her nose. &quot;I hadn't thought 
            of that. Well...not much we can do but go and see&quot;. She said 
            this happily, as if she knew that death would not touch her. Indeed, 
            she breathes life.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">We crept along, just off the path, although 
            we had it in plain view at all times. The eyes that were watching 
            us began to thin out here, and I could hear the sound of a rushing 
            stream.She motioned for me to stop, and she crept silently through 
            the brush, as the life giving plants seemed to make way for her, and 
            welcome her footsteps silently.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She trotted silently back, and wispered, 
            &quot;There are two guards. At least two I can see. I would assume 
            that there are two more on the far side of the bridge. I saw them 
            checking travelers' bags, and making sure who is entereing their lands. 
            We must be close to the city.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I sighed, &quot;Aye. It would seem we have 
            found their check point.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;What are we going to do? We can't swim 
            the river, and the branches are much too high to climb across.&quot; 
            she said.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I am sure she didn't expect me to answer, 
            but I actually did have a plan. In fact, my plan was to rush the bridge 
            with Accelerando, and call it good. And, in the end, it is exactly 
            what I did do. But, at that particular moment, we did not, because 
            we heard:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;STOP! LIGHT ELF YEILD TO MY BLADE!&quot; 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I turned and saw a dark elf warrior, wearing 
            blackend plate mail. His sword looked huge in his hand, and was most 
            likely magical, albeit unholy.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Lilthia grabbed my hand and ran back into 
            the forest, all while I began sining Selo's Accelerando. Soon, we 
            were running fast enough for me to detach my hand drum from my belt, 
            and we ran even faster. I shouted to her, &quot; I think we should 
            rush the bridge!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;What?&quot; she yelled, trying to hear 
            herself over the wind in her ears.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;Rush the bridge!&quot; I yelled again.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;What? Brush my, what?&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I sighed, although she couldn't hear it, 
            and turned around. Her arm was almost wrenched from it's socket, but 
            it got her attention. While we were stopped, I said, &quot;Rush the 
            bridge. You know, run across it, and hope these evil people don't 
            hit us&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">She looked at me for a moment before she 
            started to answer, &quot;Bu-&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;STOP!!&quot; </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I looked up an realized that we did not distance 
            ourselves enough from the elf. I began singing and running again, 
            but this time headed strait for Nagena.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I will never be able to explain the eyes 
            of the first dark elf guard at the bridge when he saw us comming, 
            suffice it to say it was a look of pure bewilderment. We were running 
            faster than any animal that roams those parts, and given that dark 
            elves usually stay close to their home, he may not have ever seen 
            anything this fast...let alone two of them. Lilthia and I raced passed 
            the two guards before they knew what happened, although it didn't 
            take long for them to regroup, and come after us.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">At this point, just to recap, we were running 
            across a long bridge, with at least three dark elf guards hot in persuit. 
            We had no where to go but forward. Our biggest concern, was that if 
            one of the guards behind us could use magic...well, we would be dead.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">After running a few more feet, I glanced 
            to my left, and saw Lilthia happily laughing. I was astounded to say 
            the least...I suppose I wasn't feeling very bardic at that moment, 
            and besides-if I began laughing with her, I would not be able to sing, 
            and we would slow down.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">We were quickly approaching the end of the 
            bridge, so I began scanning the mist for new guards. As I suspected, 
            there were two more. They heard me singing, and saw the globes of 
            light around me, so they tried to block the bridge. As luck would 
            have it, (and perhaps some intervention by Bristlbane), we skirted 
            the edge of the bridge and made it across. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">But now there were five guards (at least) 
            chasing us through the woods.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Remembering what Lilthia had said about the 
            road leading to our destination, I followed the path. Each step getting 
            us closer to reletive safety. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;STOP&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Yet another--no two more dark elf guards 
            chasing us through Neriak. Great, I thought. Now there are seven.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">&quot;It seems that one of them was able 
            to use magic,&quot; I thought, for it was not long before I could 
            disern shapes in the mist in front of us. Six shapes, to be exact, 
            and all of them assuradly guards. But, luckily, that was not correct. 
            It was, in fact six dark elf adventurers fighting some beast or another. 
            Imagine their surprise when they saw the dark elf guard train we caused.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">Soon, we made it to a mountain pass, that 
            led out of the forest, and into the safety of Lavastorm. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I am sleepy now, journal. I will write more 
            about our encounter in Nagena later, although I might have to spice 
            it up a bit, as it wasn't nearly as excruciating as our encounter 
            with the dark elves. How can one race hate another so badly to want 
            to kill them on site? What had we ever done to them?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Calisto MT">I suppose some questions shall remain on 
            the tonges of the unwilling, and some answers left in the breeze. 
            Aye. I am tired.</font></p>
