    Beginning for Garorm</b></font></p>
  <div align="center">
    <table border="0" width="75%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr> 
        <td height="37"> 
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">It all began 
            60 years ago. Garnald Bludfyst was a great Barbarian Warrior. He had 
            journeyed to the 4 corners of Norath, and had seen most of the wonders 
            of the world.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> About 40 years 
            ago, he met Shalana. She was a beautiful lady of human blood. She 
            was very practiced in the skills of Magic. Shalana was journeying 
            across the Karana plains, and came upon Garnald locked in mortal combat 
            with 6 lions.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> She rushed 
            to his aid, and with her powerful magic, and his mighty sword, they 
            dispatched the lions, but it nearly cost Garnald his life. She spent 
            3 days and nights at his side, nursing him back to health. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">By the end of 
            these 3 days, Garnald had fallen hopelessly in love with Shalana, 
            and she with him. They journeyed back to her family’s home in the 
            hills near Qeynos, where they quickly announced their plans to marry. 
            Shalana’s family was well off, and the event was a wondrous sight.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> People came 
            from all over to celebrate the occasion. The party lasted for nearly 
            3 days, and the entire town of Qeynos was drunk from the good ale 
            and wine. After the wedding, they journeyed to Halas, where Garnald’s 
            home was, and settled in. For the next twenty years, they shared a 
            wonderful life of love, and adventure. Between all the grandeur of 
            travel, Garnald and Shalana Bludfyst begat three children. They were 
            named Tavin, Thalliass, and Garorm.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> About sixteen 
            years ago, Garnald left on an expedition to Freeport. He was to be 
            gone two fortnights. He never came home. Tavin left to go find his 
            father, and returned a week later, with the sad news that Garnald 
            had been slain by a hill Giant in the Eastern Plains of Karana, on 
            his way home. Tavin was very saddened to deliver this news, and after 
            giving the message, announced that he was leaving Halas and going 
            in search of a new meaning for his life. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Shalana was 
            completely devastated. Garnald had been the whole of her life. After 
            two months, she decided she could not bear the memories created by 
            life in Halas any longer, and announced that she would take Garorm, 
            and return to Qeynos to live with her family. Thalliass refused to 
            leave, preferring to stay in Halas, and finish her apprenticeship 
            in The Tribunal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">So it was that 
            on a cold Saturday afternoon in January, Shalana and Garorm departed 
            for Qeynos. At this time, Garorm was 6 years of age. On the journey 
            through Black Burrow, a band of gnolls ambushed them, and despite 
            a valiant fight, Shalana was slain. They then turned on Garorm, and 
            gouged out his right eye. He would have died that day, had it not 
            been for some brave warriors, who came along and rescued him. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Garorm was delivered 
            into the care of Shalana’s parents, who raised him to a young man. 
            At fifteen, he swore an oath that he would avenge his mother’s death, 
            and declared the Gnolls of Black Burrow as his sworn life enemy. He 
            then announced that he was going back to Halas to find his sister, 
            and make his place in the world. Garorm arrived in Halas late that 
            night, and made camp in the merchant’s cave at Everfrost Peaks. The 
            next morning, he rose, and ferried into Halas to look for his sister 
            Thalliass. He found her at the Tribunal. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">She had finished 
            her apprenticeship, and was now a Shaman of the 6th rank. She was 
            very happy to see him after nearly three years since her last visit. 
            They went to the Golden Torch for a glass of ale, and to catch up 
            on times past. Garorm asked her for news of Tavin, but alas, she had 
            heard nothing of his fate since his departure those nine long years 
            ago. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">They talked 
            late into the night, and by the time they called it a night; Garorm 
            had decided that he would request apprenticeship at the Tribunal first 
            thing in the morning. The next morning, Garorm awoke, and found a 
            note from Thalliass:</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Dearest Brother, 
            </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Seeing you again 
            has made me long to renew family bonds. I wish you the best success 
            in your apprenticeship. Here are some goods to help you in the coming 
            months of training. I am departing now at first light on a quest to 
            find Tavin. Wish me a good journey, and I will see you again one day, 
            with our brother. </font></p>
          <p align="right"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Love always, 
            Thalliass </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">On the table, 
            along with the note was about 6 platinum, two backpacks, some rations, 
            and a worn great staff. Garorm ate a quick breakfast, and headed toward 
            town.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF"> So begin the 
            Chronicles of his Life. </font></p>
