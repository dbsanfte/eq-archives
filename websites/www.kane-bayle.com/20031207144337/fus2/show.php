Sheriff Tinsi Dreamcatcher had been rumored turning herself into an elf out of pure madness. The hobbits were angry, ANGRY i tell you&#33;<br><br>We decided to take on some dragons. And dragons we did kill&#33; For the first time in TCR, Sontalak bites the dust. And with him, a few more of his kin were eliminated. <br><br>Everything went fine, until when we killed one of them dragons. Some Humans or something appeared and started chatting, and then teleported us to plane of knowledge&#33; Rivervale authorities are still investigating on the two suspects, named Zebuxoruk and Druzzil ro, as they are not registered in the Kane Bayle Taxi Union. Contact Sheriff Tinsi if you see either of these individuals selling unauthorized teleports&#33;<br><br> <br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/quarmdown.jpg"> <br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/Sontalak.jpg"> <br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/Lord Vyemm.jpg">  <br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/Lord Koi.jpg">  <br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/Lady Mir.jpg">  <br><br>Those who couldn&#39;t be there, I wish you&#39;d been with us today.

Truth is, I could have not done this without you all, and i am proud of everyone who made this possible. We will continue to work everyday for TCR being and remaining the best place to be in on KB. <br><br>And for those of you who don&#39;t know us from the inside, here is a little snip of tcr at our worst =)<br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/quarmquotes.gif"> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/logo.jpg"><br> <br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/desertquote.gif"> </p>   </font></p><br>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><p align="center"> Teh plane of time was slowly driving the pigglets into madness. Maddened ramblings were heard constantly in guildchat, aswell as frightening references to naked hobbits. The first victim of such madness was a druid, formerly known as esper. We thought we had lost him as he drifted into madness and proclaimed both his love and his slavery towards a being such as a hobbit. Witnesses say that he suddenly felt the urge for a surname, and suddenly a halfling witch bent his mind and made him...well you can see it yourself<br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/tinsislovetoy.jpg"> <br><br>It took a week at the Erudin&#39;s mental hospital under istari&#39;s loving care to bring the elf back to his senses. But while that was happening, We did not stop advancing in the plane of time. Tallon fell, and shortly after did the other three.<br><br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/tallondown.jpg">  <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/terrisdown.jpg">  <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/vallondown.jpg">  <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/saryrndown.jpg"> <br><br>As you can see, a certain little dorf had angered the gods. Being quite a spiteful and unforgiving kind, as their spirits were released, they placed a curse on our poor ortenga. We&#39;d not really known what the curse was, until we saw him missing. Detective Mirux and detective Krip were dispatched to seek the reason of ortenga&#39;s constant hiding, and the evidence they found was more shocking than anyone&#39;d ever imagined.<br><br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/ortengahomo.jpg"> <br><br>It took about a week of dorfwomen stripteasing aswell as certain methods of subliminal persuasion  <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/ortengaisnotahomo.jpg"> <br>to lift the curse. Tis all good since it ended good, but please no more dorf striptease, ok?<br><br><br><br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/logo.jpg"> </p>   <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/negilquote.jpg"><br> <img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/fus2/uploads/asytell.jpg"> </font></p><br>
