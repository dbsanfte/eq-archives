These nasties died for the first time to us this week:<br><br>Fire fun, <b>Blazzax the Omnifiend</b>. He actually died on our first try, and if it wasn't for all those "100% sure confirmed rumors" that he is the hardest mob in elementals then we would have tried it long ago and I could have put this pic in my last update and wouldn't have to update today!<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/150.jpg"><br><br>More Fire fun, <b>General Reparm</b>. According to our math wizards this guy can do 15300 points of damage in 1 round! We thank the gods every day we have people like Istari to think this stuff up and make graphs daily about all things DPS related.<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/151.jpg"><br><br>We started some Air exploration trips too, leading to <b>Avatar of Wind</b>. Air isn't bad. I still prefer Fire and Earth, but Air is a nice break to the usual armor farming, where we can die more and get less loot for it! But those Xegony keys don't create themselves do they...<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/153.jpg"><br><br>We've also been playing with the Fennin ring. We ran the script and completed it successfully on first try, ending up by meeting this guy, <b>Fennin Ro</b>, who then wiped us halfway during the fight. We will have revenge soon.<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/152.jpg"><br><br>And of course we've been busy farming our usual share of mobs in all 4 planes. Here are some of the items that droped into our hands during this week:<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/149.jpg"><br><br>Oh and talking about Xegony keys, who thought once we get to elementals, all those boring key and flag quests were over with?? WRONG!! Plus most don't go on key ring or anything like that.<br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/159.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/160.jpg"><br><br><font size="4">Quotes</font><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/158.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/157.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/154.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/155.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.kane-bayle.com/gallery/images/156.jpg"><br><br>-Dendory<br><br></font></p><br><br><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1">05/29/03</font></td></tr></table><br>
