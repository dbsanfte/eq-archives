        Celestial rapture is always looking for Good people to

        We might not recruit quick, or recruit often, but there

        <em>How to get in TCR - i.e. our application process:<br>
        <br>
        Group with us and get to know us. Join our chat channel
        and talk with us.<br>
        We are a tight knit group of players who take pride into
        the guild's advancement.<br>
        Someone who knows you and can vouch for you is a good
        thing to have.<br>
        <br>
        The nature of the high level game requires high level
        players. <br>
        You're welcome to pre-apply anytime, and tag along for
        exp groups - but keep in mind that it is best if you are
        lvl60 - with an exception for clerics.<br>
        <br>
        The process to apply to CR is divided in three phases. <br>
        When you express an interest in joining, you can hang out
        in our channel crcount:crcount - that is kept moderated
        during raids, but otherwise it is the place to start
        getting to know us.<br>
        Do not let the levels you lack discourage you - with the
        new exp zones in POP one could do 50 to 60 in merely a
        week.<br>
        Group with us, get to know us, we can possibly help you
        get character flags for the zones we exp in such as POV.<br>
        <br>
        An applicant is any person who has expressed interest to
        join. They are welcome to group with us in crcount, and
        getting to know us, and vice versa.<br>
        Applicants must ask before coming to raids.<br>
        <br>
        Once the majority of the guild has got to know you, and
        you satisfy the level requirement (case-by-case
        exceptions on that can be made, but not often), a
        decision is made and you have the status of recruit - and
        are informed of it.<br>
        This means that we are actively considering you to be
        guilded soon. Recruits must come to all raids and show us
        what they're worth.<br>
        <br>
        Once we've seen you in action, and we know you, and you
        gradually get to be a part of our team, and we choose you
        to be with us, then it's probably time for you to wear
        our tag.<br>
        <br>
        Be patient. Don't expect a guildtag after two raids or
        three. It's not a quick thing. <br>
        <br>
        Be on at eurotime, and frequently - If you can only play
        a couple hours a day on weekends, then the guild isn't
        for you. We raid anywhere from 4 to 6 days a week,
        depending on <br>
        <br>
        Have a solid Internet connection. If you go Linkdead
        during raids and fall back in time, then you do little
        good.<br>
        <br>
        Come prepared to raids. Peridots, reagents, coffins, etc.
        We help with the costs of reagents, but ask in advance!<br>
        <br>
        Have resist gear appropriate for all encounters, and work
        on it if you don't. Try to get a bare minimum of 100 in
        any one resist with 100 mr at the same time. Have an
        invis-EB-night vision item, or potions<br>
        <br>
        Must know how to listen and follow orders during raids.
        If you just go around doing your own thing (scouting),
        and cant follow instructions, then the guild is not for
        you.<br>
        <br>
        Do not expect loot for some time after you join. We want
        people to earn their items.<br>
        <br>
        You will only have one main character for CR. Do not
        expect loot for alts, unless it's a rot item.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        SERVER TRANSFERS --<br>
        <br>
        We respect the fact that people who choose to join us
        with server transfers lose all their gear to be doing so.
        If you wish to join us, and your character is on another
        server, I will require an e-mail from you first. Include
        in that e-mail the reasons that make you move, what
        server you come from, level-class-aa purchased, your past
        guild history, and contacts from your past guilds that
        may let us know more about you. Include in the e-mail
        your playtimes, your /played, when you started playing,
        and any information that you would deem useful. Upon
        acceptance of your application you will be told to move,
        and will come to raids as a recruit. We will then get to
        know you in person and help gear you up, and if you hold
        true to your promises, we'll tag you.</em></font></td>
