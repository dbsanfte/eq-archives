<p>Decoy opened his eyes after the normal night. Beer, killing and women, typical for him. The all to failure hang over was pounding in his head. The slash above his left eye and burn on his right hip showed that the evening before hand had been exciting to say the least. The burn looked like acid not fire, probably some stupid shammie he said looked like a dogs ass. Maybe a Necro, they dont like it when you grab their pets leg and use it to open beer bottles. O well neither one of them deserved his contempt any more than they already have.

<p>Stumbling to the rickety wooden door that closed his room in the inn. He kicked a skeletons head across the room and stepped on the third and forth finger of someones hand. He open the door, the owner of the hand was still leaning on the out side of the door, and stepped over the bodies that where piled there. Looked like he had had a better time than he thought. Not all the bodies looked like they had come from the bar though..... Three of them where Orcs, they dont handle their liquor well anyway, and one was a dog thing (he hates dogs). There was allot less blood than he was used to when he had a hang over this bad, maybe the inn staff had hosed the place down.

<p>At the front counter the inn keeper barely acknowledged that he was there. Knocking 3 times on the guys forehead and clearing his throat finally got the inn keepers attention, and all he did was look at him and hand him is weapons that he had checked the night before. They where still covered with blood, they cleaned the halls but not his swords. What kinda place is this?

<p>Decoy turned to leave the inn and the Keeper looked at him and told him the Captain of the guards wanted to see him. Wonder why they would want to see him, it doesnt look like people here were overly put off by his behavior last night, not even a comment from the innkeeper.

<p>Out in this cold mountanious place it wasnt that great but it was away from Freeport, they chased him out from the last time he went on one of these benders. He strolled over to the castle in the center of the mountain pass and started to look up the captain of the guard. he found teh captain like normal off to the back and doing nothing, to much burocracy for him.

<p>"Hey captain what do you need?"
<p>"Well mister we saw what you did last night, we want to higher you to eliminate these Gnolls and Orcs for us."
<p>"Why would I wanna do that? I am not part of the military here so I dont see why I should try and help you out of your mess."
<p>"Well either that or we will lock you up, take your pick."

<p>Decoy scratched his head, looked around and mad his final comment, "I see I have no choice, I guess I will kill rather than end up in shackles."

<p>"I knew you would see it our way, you can start now. You can keep all the money they give you and the more proof you bring me of their deaths the closer to freedom you will be." the captain closed out his speach with that and a slight turn back to his paper work.

<p>Decoy now had a new job, killing for money and freedom.
