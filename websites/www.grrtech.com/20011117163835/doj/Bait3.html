<font color = "gold" size = 3> The history of Bait - Chapter 3<BR>
<font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><BR>
</font></font> <font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"> The little gnome on the shabby 
pier talked of adventure and excitement. I looked at the little gnome and thought 
why not I haven't been there...</font> 
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The little raft was wet and half sunk in the 
  ocean. The landing was rough on this desert island with only one soul inhabitant. 
  He was kind of stand-offish but nice enough to direct me to the pier where their 
  gnomish contraption would transport me to the main land. As it paddled through 
  the water, ice gathered around the keel scrapping down the sides. I realized 
  I had made a mistake, Erudites are warm weather people, ahhhh Tox the trees 
  and fog.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The freakish ship bumped against the pier next 
  to a huge glacier. The other Gnomes had build a little village right near the 
  pier where they could watch for supplies and other ships since they did make 
  a living quite dishonestly, they were pirates. They where kind and offered little 
  services but enough to stay alive in the cold waste land.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The land was full of these cats, white as the 
  snow and twice as mean. They where easy to avoid though but the problems started 
  with the possessed snowballs. Then the Giants already angry at the world and 
  wanting to take it out on my frail Erudite body. I first came upon their scouts 
  but then I saw some of their guards around the greatest bridge I have ever seen, 
  almost grand enough to make an Erudite think about connecting Odeus to Faydwer. 
  But then those Elf's would try and cross it...</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Across the bridge was a wonderful wild land, 
  beasts of all forms unseen by any Erudite before. Monsters lived here too, blue 
  Orcs that were incredibly stronger then their main land cousins and Half Walrus 
  Half human things (only dumber then both). This land was still cold, so cold 
  that the Dworfs that lived here were blanched to a blue. There where more giants 
  and a City of theirs, they still didn't like me or my kind. They don't deserve 
  to live in my opinion.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Through this waste land on the other side was 
  a divided land with these Marvelous creatures Dragons that wander the frozen 
  river and the same dwarves in fact the Dwarves have their city there hidden 
  and buried like all dwarves deep in the mountain. They are suspicious of me 
  but they still tolerate me and like my business I suppose. Plat is hard to find 
  to them.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">I am still looking for some more clear water, 
  my line is unwet and my bait grows old. Maybe further exploration is needed.
