<font size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><BR>
</font></font> <font color="#FFFFFF" size="4"> <b>After looking around the dragon 
city I found a way to a new place. A little place with Wild dragons, Elephant 
seal people and the Omithar. The Bulthorks are as angry as the Ulthorks but stronger 
and a lot meaner. The Omithars are the sworn enemy to the Bulthorks and the Ulthorks 
alike, they even rewarded me for proof that I have killed soem of them. the Omithars 
are a people that I could live with forever. They follow Prexus and warship the 
bounty of the sea. They dont have any fishing bait but that is I think because 
they can just swim after what they are after for dinner. Below the cliff is a 
great place to live, the sea even keeps it relatively warm down here, or is it 
that the cold is seaping into my very soul.</b></font> 
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Something was still missing. I wanted to 
  search more. Maybe I am not looking for poeple like the Omithars who follow 
  my ways but something else. I have to wander some more and try to find what 
  I need. My soul is still wandering.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Back to wandering the frozen wastes. I know 
  where the Omithars are and I may end up forever living with them but until I 
  see what I am after I will not stay. The ice helps to cool the burning desire 
  to see more and do more. I head back into the caves under the Orc Fort. The 
  Orcs are even orginized enough to have built a frort of their own, not stollen 
  or claimed from raiding someone elses town. They did however build it on top 
  of entrance to a mystical cavern where there are many Orc miners digging up 
  the Velium and a Dwarf town where they are in constant battle with the Orcs.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Deaper into the Caves are translucent spiders 
  and parts of the caves that have come alive. The terrors are viscious and unthinking 
  just like the spiders. Creatures that dont think earn my disgust. I still have 
  killed few of these because they are smart enough to gang up on any single person. 
  Kindness is something that the others here have not heard of and My services 
  are seldom wanted. Still nothing was here for me to find. My search was growing 
  old, I need to find something that I do not know.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">The cold has worn my nerves thin. I have 
  decided to head back to the main land and maybe even home. I could start a little 
  shop and fish. Maybe I could even head out to the Omithars and live with them. 
  </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">I start scaling the magnificant bridge, almost 
  the acme of the span. Suddenly pain strikes my back. A dagger icy and frozen 
  buries itself in my back, my blood flows over my robe and across my body as 
  I lay face down. I try to look and see where this strike came from, nothing 
  anywhere. I see a vision right before everything goes black, an angel, pale 
  as the snow but real and caring.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Who? Why? Revenge? Angel? Dead? Alive? Where?</font></b></p>
