</font> <font color = "white" size = 4> <font color="#FFFFFF">Decoy was born at 
a very young age. From the very beginning he was spilling blood on the land, his 
mother died in child birth, his father went insane and no siblings. He had taken 
up a job colecting the ingredents for Ogre swill so that the bartenders could 
brew it up. His reward was a sip of the product that lead to him burying his anger 
in alcohol. He killed rats for years and one day he saw his father drunk in the 
gutter. He saw the years of forgotenness and abuse and blame rise up in him. He 
drew his sword and ran his father threw killing him in a single blow. This act 
showed him the way into the arms of Rallos Zek. The blood spilled on the ground 
and soaked in. This sight was profound and disturbing to him. He picked up his 
bag and headed to the pier to drop off the days hunt.</font></font> 
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">He spent the next few years drunk and earning 
  a living collecting ingredients and earning beer money. After a while he meet 
  a drunken Eruidite that told him of the ways of the world and how large and 
  wide it was. They would get in Barroom brawls and cover each others backs. He 
  talked about some guy named Prexus and fishing all the time. He was a good friend 
  but kinda funny in his conversation, and then his friend sobered up and left 
  town.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">This inspired him to strike out. He started 
  seeing things and travelling about. He kills for fun, not sport or need. He 
  gets joy out of seeing the blood spilling on his boots and reminding him of 
  the day with his father and the memory of his mom. He drowns these memories 
  in the sea of beer that he drinks.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The only enemy that he cannot defeat is sobriety. 
  When he isnt drunk he pursues returning to that state. Alcohol drowns the memories 
  and some day his battle scars and alcohol will kill the brai</font>n cells that 
  save his memory. </p>
