          version see message board</font> 
        <p align="left"> <font color="#FFFFFF">This primarily deals with the meeting. 
          We will be staying in this guild, there will not be a merger at this 
          time and if we change our minds es doesnt want us en masse. We will 
          be posting on their application boards and go through the regular recruitment 
          process should we decide to split and head there. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Our own recruitment is an issue we need more 
          chanters, clerics, tanks to be able to do more. Our aux healers and 
          tanks along with a few jabobers can substitute fairly well, but we need 
          chanters. The feeder guild idea seems fairly unpopular so far, at this 
          time I dont know that we have enough to warrant one in guild and not 
          many seem to want to be a feeder to es. A feeder to es seems to me to 
          be fairly equitable. Personally to allow all of you to do the most being 
          a feeder and placing the highers in es seems like it might be a good 
          idea. The odds of me and my crew if you will (rad, sacer, leia, vinger, 
          ditty, devoor, etc) joining es however are slim at this point. If you 
          want to know why ask me in game. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking with callandria, she was interested 
          in an alliance or possibly being our parent guild. To that end we have 
          been invited to a raid sunday with them sign up on their board at www.eternalsovereign.com 
          I would recommend you go if you can. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I personally want to go back to being deadly 
          justice, that will wait due to our state of flux right now. Also ask 
          me if you have questions on that. That was my guild before we merged, 
          I want to get away from the stigma we have gotten lately and well theres 
          a new sheriff in town. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As far as what we can do I saw kedge for the 
          first time at 52 and had a good time. May be later, but sooner doesnt 
          necessarily mean better. If I end up getting my em legs at 60 because 
          thats how long it takes it doesnt matter much to me, time heals all 
          wounds and I'd rather stomp through things with good friends that I 
          respect than people I tolerate. Upcoming, we will be doing more mid 
          level raids. I want to do alot of the dungeons most havent seen but 
          is achievable currently. This will be a balance between experience and 
          raid days, to that end I'd like to see a big one like kedge and maybe 
          a 1 or 2 group raid like cc over the weekends so people can attend raids 
          and advance in level. Obviously we need the participation of most for 
          the big ones. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My work schedule is a real problem for this I 
          wont be on today simply because of it. I will be looking to others to 
          start leading these and helping in general especially as I start deploying 
          for a week or more at a time coming up. I will be looking for a strong 
          assistant leader to take over in these periods, someone I know can and 
          will be on and take care of business. </font> 
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Yet another good one to tell me about in game. 
          Well good huntin all hope to see you tomorrow and please post here or 
          tell me in game if you want to or just for the hell of it. Use your 
          officers thats what their there for. </font>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><i>On 
          Saturday, April 21, at 2pm PST (5pm EST), I will be planning a Kedge 
          Keep raid. This is one that many people have asked about, so here it 
          is!! This raid will be for anyone 35+, and needs a good turnout, as 
          we will need 3-4 groups to take down Estrella and Phingel. Start your 
          planning now, with the following tips:<br>
          <br>
          Save up to buy a Fishbone Earring(1.5-2k pp) if you can. If you cant 
          buy a Fishbone, then bring plenty of fish scales please. The magicians 
          Radiac and Koronado will help us greatly on this for their ability to 
          summon waterstones, but a fishbone earring is still better since you 
          never have to worry about your Enduring Breath being lost during a fight 
          or even dispelled, and if you go AFK (the biggest killer in Kedge).<br>
          <br>
          Get your swimming skill up! Practice swimming till you are at least 
          a master(100) in swimming, if you haven't already done so. This is important 
          so your not lagging everyone else behind while your getting &quot;better 
          at Swimming(2)!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Also please inform me ahead of time if there are any very important 
          items to be had here (i.e. does anyone need anything for their epic 
          here??). If so please let me know so I can plan accordingly.<br>
          <br>
          This will be a very fun and challenging raid for everyone so anyone 
          that can go and are 35+ please try and make it and this can be a successful 
          and a raid to remember. Thanks!<br>
