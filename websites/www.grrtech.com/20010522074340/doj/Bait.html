On the Morning Of April 1st a young enchanter was sitting on the dock in Erudin. A fish on the line and a cold beer in his hand. He had never felt so happy. That is when the sharp pain in the back of his head appeared. The fog cleared the next day. He woke up in Freeport around all the funny lesser beings. They looked at his shabby dress and beer breath and gave him small coins to go away. He forsaken all alcohol that day and studies hard. he would work in life so no one laughed at him anymore. His sympathy for the lesser and needy is great though. He has returned home but cannot stay too many memories of frat parties and naked romps in the street to keep him in town. His education is on the road spreading word of the evil of drinking. He spreads this word in his many shapes throughout the world. You can ask him for anything but a drink and he will give it to you.

His family history was enchanting. Truely. His mother and father married as elemantals. His grandfather had lived in Neriak selling encyclopedias door to door. His sister disapeared into Kunark. He took the family trade as a testamony to his heratage. He isnt overly proud of his job. It is what mom and dad wanted though. His true passion is fishing. Prexuos leads him to the sea for the bounty and in it he finds peace. The challange of man versus beast and the salt air makes his heart beat and his mind clear. if there is time to kill you will find Bait with a pole in the water.
