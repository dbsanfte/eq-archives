I couldn't have said it better myself.  The bottom line is no religion can provide sound proof that their deity exists.  What do you call believing in something that cannot be proven?  Faith.  Therefore, religious faith = wishful thinking.  These are people that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wish</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for an eternal afterlife, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wish</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for a god who loves them, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wish</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for damnation of their enemies.  I really get a kick out of the yo-yo's that say religion has enriched their lives.  It would seem to be the opposite to me.  I feel sorry for anyone who can't feel good about himself/herself without the crutch of religion.<br>
<br>
I would be interested in your info on the existence of Jesus, Kneight.  I used to believe in the historical Jesus, but now I'm even kind of wary on that.  Either way, I'm sure the Romans crucified many wannabe messiahs.<br>

Even before the western world was known, cultures had a belief in the after life.<br>
<br>
christain/catholic/muslim.... they believe in god, and an existance of heaven, and hell.<br>
<br>
hindu....there's a belief that the physical world is the illusion, and once you die..if you can release yourself from the necesity of the real world, you'll return to....&quot;can't think of the name of the god&quot;<br>
<br>
bhudist(sp?)....a belief that once you die, you are reincarnated as some other form...an animal, or a plant...etc....and that the way you act in life, and your devotion to your religion will determine what you are reincarnated as...all the way up until you are reunited with....(i'm guessing buddah, but I can't remember these names. it's to early, and i haven't had my pillz so i can't function right now hehe.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, my point is...out of every race, and culture...there has been a diverse yet parallel belief in life after death.<br>
<br>
just something else that leads me to believe that there is something else after death.<br>

In every religion, that scenario holds true.  I used to think that there was some universal truth to the idea of an afterlife and an all powerful being.<br>
<br>
Then as I asked more and more questions, and didn't get answers that explained things, only answers that went in cirlces, I came a the conclusion that they were just regular people like me, trying to find some meaning where none could be seen.<br>
<br>
If you believe that there is a 'Heaven' then you wouldn't want to do bad things because you would go to 'Hell', this would be a major deterrent(sp) against commiting crimes, or doing 'bad' or 'evil' things, against other people.  It's the fear of retribution for your actions, that deterrs you from this course of action.  You want to be good, just in case there is something at the end of the line.<br>
<br>
But if there was significant evidence to prove that there was no 'divine retribution' for our actions, what's to stop you from killing or stealing or just causing totall chaos and anarchy?<br>
<br>
I think that the religions all have a common theme because people are all the same.  We all need to have the underlying feeling that if we do good, there will be a reward for it.  So Pavlov-esque(sp) it kills me.<br>
<br>
If you truly believed that there was no &quot;God&quot; what would you do?<br>
<br>
Maybe there is an ET out there who has this info, but cannot reveal it to us because we simply cannot comprehend this, and that just the knowledge alone would totally rip apart the fabric of our very existence.<br>
<br>
Maybe there is a God, and the only way that you can make it to heaven is to take that blind leap of faith and just believe for the sake of believing.<br>
<br>
I think Mother Theresa summed the whole thing up for me when she was asked by a reporter if she thought that it was important to minister Catholosizm(sp) to the world.  She said (and I am paraphrasing of course), &quot;I don't think that it is important for everyone to be a Catholic.  I think God is much bigger than that.&quot; she said, &quot;I think wheather you are a catholic, muslim, jew, bhuddist, christian, God just wants you to be the best that you can be&quot;<br>
<br>
The only way I'll believe in life after death, is when Jerry Garcia appears and jams with me.<br>
<br>
That'll be enough for me to believe in just about anything. <p><img src = "http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/newtag.gif""http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/New5.gif'></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utewlbocks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tewlbocks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite</B></font></span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/1/02 7:53:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /flame any and every homophobes</span><hr size=1> Wow Doof.  I'm quasi-impressed.  It seems you have done at least some preliminary homework on different religions.  That's why I'm surprised you didn't come to the same logical conclusion that many others have.  That conclusion would be that all god-based religions are the result of primitive minds trying to explain the unknown.  Buddhism, as you may know, is not a god-based religion, however, the Buddha did borrow the idea of reincarnation from the Hindus.<br>

That was a good explination. Another thing that makes me question the bible and religion is that everyone says God wants you to be a good person. Then religious people use their religion as an excuse to do wrong. For example in the past there were the crusades and now there are muslim wars, hell we had the Twin Towers blown up because of religion. Whites used the bible as an excuse for slavery saying the bible showed that blacks were inferior. People on this board used the bible as an excuse that homophobes are wrong and abnormal. <br>
<br>
If God really did exist, when you got to heaven do you think he would say, " thank you for hating all gays on my behalf, or thank you for killing all those people for me"? Doesn't make sense. I think the bible has been causing more bad than good which is why I would question religions that believe it's in the name of God for them to be imoral, close minded, and hurtful to others.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uishmialmuaddib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ishmial Muaddib</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/1/02 9:55:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://212.212.159.252/tearaina/imagesP/Ishmial.jpg width=140 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /flame any and every homophobes</span><hr size=1> I think God is dead.<br>

If one were to actively use a persons sexuality to try and keep certain opportunities from them that would be discrimination.<br>
<br>
Saying that homosexuality is abnormal is nothing more than voicing an opinion.  Which is protected by the exact same right that gives them the right to say &quot;We're here, we're queer and proud of it&quot; or whatever battle slogan is common place today.<br>
<br>
As for the God belief you have two choices to the matter really.<br>
<br>
1) He exists<br>
2) He doesn't exist<br>
<br>
So if you believe he exists more than likely you are going to buy into the whole &quot;God&quot; as society has imposed upon you from media, family, friends, school what not.  This &quot;God&quot; is one who essentially wants you to be cool with everyone.  Don't do shitty deeds in essence.<br>
<br>
If you believe he doesn't exist well there isn't much more to it.<br>
<br>
I have come to the conclusion that most people on this earth do not kill, maim, steal, etc.  There are lies, adultery, etc. but in the scheme of things are these truly the BIG sins.  So if everyone is already living a life that &quot;God&quot; has supposedly asked them to live through scripture, stories passed by word of mouth, and lore than  the only difference in non believers and beleivers is the fact that believers have made a consentious decision to say &quot;I believe in God&quot; wether in their heart or publicly isn't really an issue.<br>
<br>
So if most people are living the &quot;right&quot; life then there are three scenarios.<br>
<br>
1) Live the &quot;right&quot; life and believe in God.  If he exists then you go to heaven.<br>
2) Live the &quot;right&quot; life and don't believe in God.  If he exists than you go to hell.<br>
3) Live the &quot;right&quot; life and believe or don't believe in God.  If he doesn't exist are you going to be dying and look back and say, damn I really should have killed more people?<br>
<br>
The point of this belief post (I say belief and not religion because it is religion that fucks people up not believing or not believing in God) is this.  If you are already living life that is considered the &quot;right&quot; life than what have you got to lose?<br>

I for one believe in God.  Not the Catholic God, not the Muslim God, not the Protestant God, but the God who I believe I've come to have a relationship in my heart.  To me this world is too amazing to have been put together by chance. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=129304&resize=true" TARGET="_blank"><img src="http://www.knology.net/~chanson/Tael_Smurf.jpg" BORDER=0></a>

<br>
Either he exists, or he doesn't. <br>
<br>
If he exists, and you are a good person, you go to heaven.<br>
<br>
If he exists, and you are a bad person, you go to hell, or outer darkness or whatever.<br>
<br>
If he doesn't exist, you are just fucked.<br>
<br>
So logically, it makes more sense to go with &quot;exists&quot;, and be a good person, because the other two choices guarentee that yer fucked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>aka Raisst Ritter</span><br>  Posts: 1959<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/1/02 10:27:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=60>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /flame any and every homophobes</span><hr size=1> Ack that will teach me to reply to a post before reading em all.<br>

Taelnayael, this is basically the crux of your and Dirra's posts.  I fail to see the logic here.  I guess you're saying that believing in any myth is better than nothing?  How can you be sure the myth you've chosen to believe in is the right one?<br>
<br>
And to me, the fact that this world came together by chance makes it all the more amazing.  Out of infinite possibilities, this is what we ended up with.

the movie stigmata pretty much summed up my believe in there at least being an historical jesus. from what i have read there are tiny references here and there in history about him or something like him and the events surrounding him. then they found the scrolls from the &quot;13th apostle&quot; which they now believe to be jesus himself based on the langauge (aramiac? i think.or something that sounds like that) age and the way the writing was wrote and the context. i would go around and dig up specific stuff. but i am lazy. rent stigmata. watch it. and then check out the real life connection on the supossed scrolls of Jesus Christ. <p><font size="3"><p align="center"><marquee bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#00FF00" vlink="#00FF00"

If one were to actively use a persons sexuality to try and keep certain opportunities from them that would be discrimination.- Teal<br>
<br>
Calling one person abnormal and then placing yourself as normal is calling that person inferior to you. Inferiority is discriminating someone. If you are heterosexual and you say thats normal, then by saying homosexuals are abnormal you are putting them in an inferior position beneath you. By the way, homosexuals have to deal with being deprived certain opportunites every day because they are seen as inferior and abnormal.<br>

Be the best person you can be and do the best you can do.  Organized religion just mucks things up with details and the 'our path is the ONLY path, and everyone else is wrong' crap.  And we all want to believe that there's SOMETHING after this life.   We don't know what form an afterlife might take, but we hope there IS one.  After all, we invest a lot of time and effort in becoming who we are.  We're a goal-oriented species, and can't stand the idea of spending decades developing our lifestyles and personalities, not to mention the eons our species has spent building our societies.  Why?  Just to have everything we've worked for go 'poof!' at the moment we die?  We just can't conceive of that.  Every culture has it's image of the Divine; that invisible, mystical force that guides us... or perhaps that Divine energy that is all around us that we shape with our will and through prayer/visualization/will?  But which path is the 'RIGHT' path?  I personally believe that all paths lead to the Divine, and each must choose the path that is right for them.  I believe in Karma.  What goes around, comes around.  I try to follow the Wiccan Rede and the Rule of Three.<br>
The Rede says, &quot;An it harm none, do as ye will.&quot;  Do what you want, but make sure whatever you do doesn't harm anyone, including yourself.  And the Rule of Three says that whatever you do comes back to you threefold.  So the more positive energy you put out, the better off you are.  Just common sense, as far as I can see.  But that's just my humble 2cp.  As far as sexual preferences go, see the above.  Do what you want as long as it doesn't harm anyone else.<br>

This is not discrimination.  <br>
<br>
By the way, homosexuals have to deal with being deprived certain opportunites every day because they are seen as inferior and abnormal. - Arrora<br>
<br>
Thank you Miss Obvious, I didn't realize that there was discrimination against gays.<br>
<br>
If you are heterosexual and you say thats normal, then by saying homosexuals are abnormal you are putting them in an inferior position beneath you. - Arrora<br>
<br>
One might use an analogy here.  Say there is this great writer, his talent is absolutely amazing.  The normal people of the world have nowhere near the skill with words that he does.  They would be the norm.  He would be abnormal.  By people saying he is abnormal is that placing him benath them?  No it is making a distinction in that he is different from the majority of the population.<br>
<br>
However you look at it.  Calling somone abnormal doesn't discriminate if you use it in the clinical definition of the word.  Calling someone abnormal and basing your treatment of that person based upon the general human emotions that fall in line with this subject may very well be.<br>

<br>
<br>
According to this definition, only 3-b is negative.  The rest are simply stating that you are noticing differences and acting on those differences.<br>
<br>
So if I see two tubs, one has boiling water and steam, and one has ice cubes, of course I will make a decision based on different stimuli but it does not mean I am discriminating (as 3-b) vs one tub of water or another if I choose to bath in the cold or the hot.  I am just noticing the inherant differences.<br>
<br>
Tael used a great example that calling something abnormal is not an insult automatically.<br>
