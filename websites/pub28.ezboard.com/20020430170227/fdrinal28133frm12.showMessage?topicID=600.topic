FUCK these lame ass....</span><hr size=1> bands that call themself metal. these bullshit punk/ska/pop bands that call themselves a metal band are just pissing me off, I read this today, after hearing a song by this band,  and was very disturbed.<br><br>""We figured introducing ourselves with this type of song would be a good way to make an entrance." — the Apex Theory's David Hakopyan<br><br><br>A lot of contemporary metal lyrics are impossible to understand. One song with a particularly puzzling passage is the Apex Theory's "Shhh ... (Hope Diggy)." <br><br>The track features a tribal beat, ringing, distorted guitars and the lyric "Hope-diggy-da/ Chicky-diggy-da/ Ras-pi-ran-te," which has driven many a fan to hit rewind. While it's easy to sing along to, it doesn't make any sense, even in Armenian, the language in which it was written.<br><br>"There's no literal translation," said vocalist Andy Khachaturian last week from a couch in his manager's office. "When I was really little, my dad would throw me up in the air and catch me and throw me up in the air again, and that's what he would be chanting."<br><br>The rest of the lyrics are in English and while they're also cryptic, they're nowhere near as lighthearted: "I can't take the squeaks any more than I can take you/ You say you're sick of me, well I'm sick of you too/ Haven't you gone far enough, my friend?"<br><br>"That's about how the people who are closest to you can end up really choking or restraining you, and sometimes they don't even know it or mean it," Khachaturian said. "They can hold you back and prevent you from doing what you want to do. I'm just saying we should allow each other to be free."<br><br>The duality between nonsensical and serious lyrics perfectly compliments the Apex Theory's multi-textured music, which combines metal, prog-rock, Mediterranean music and even jazz. And the off-kilter rhythm, skittering drums, whirlpool guitars and aggressive vocals of "Shhh ... (Hope Diggy)" are a perfect taster for the band's debut album, Topsy-Turvy, which comes out April 2. <br><br>"There were some people who had doubts about whether radio would even pick it up because of its intricacies," bassist David Hakopyan said. "But we figured introducing ourselves with this type of song would be a good way to make an entrance. If you like this, you'll probably like everything else we do. If you don't, you don't want to listen to a thing.""<br><br><br><br>pisses me off that they can classify something as "metal" just because it has "cryptic" lyrics.. it's fucking lame, this is just another hop up and down sound like all the other popular rock style.<br>then I hear Sum 41 referring to themselves as a "metal" band, another punk/rock teen pleasing pop band. fuck them!<br><br>now, I understand that there are other forms of music, and people like what they like, nothing wrong with variety! but, when you take those talentless forms of music and call it metal, they're saying they are worthy to be in the same genre with metal legends and current metal greats. Same goes with Kid Rock calling himself a rock and roll start when all I hear is rap with guitars and country songs, bands like limp bizkit that say <br>"I don't mind being classified as pop. pop means popular!" -Fred Durst.  <br><br>there's more meaning to metal music than topping the charts and being known as a popular music performer. People say "all metal is, is a bunch of power chords and people screaming into a microphone" those people don't listen to the music, they only hear it, and close their mind to it because it may be a little too aggressive for their liking, which there's nothing wrong with not liking that style of music, but when you say there is no talent that goes into it, that is when they are SO wrong. listening to that music puts me in an emotional state, I have such a huge appreciation for the talent in those bands listening to guitar solos, hearing new forms of bass playing, different drum techniques, hearing the vocals pouring out their feelings and singing about issues so real to them and how I can relate to some of their views. <br>I guess the biggest thing in music I listen to is the guitars there is so much feeling and emotions running through that sound, it's not someone strumming some strings producing static, it's individually picking at each string with a different tone, resulting in a song by itself without any need for lyrics, all the emotions and meaning can be felt by that guitar solo.<br>well, now I'm just trailing off... anyway, I guess what I would like to see, instead of all of this new radio pop shit being called metal, make an effort to call it "modern rock" and leave the title of metal to the real metal artists, whether it be black metal, death metal, speed metal, heavy metal.. .there's no reason a band like Linkin Park should be classified in the same genre as Opeth.

Only slightly did he imply it by starting the article with example #1, but this implication was actually cleared up by example #2.  Basically, the WRITER says Apex Theory is influenced by metal (as well as jazz, mediterranean, etc.).  The band didn't give itself a metal label.<br><br>You're overracting about 2 words used by a writer in an article about a band.  There was no metal classification put on Apex Theory in that article.<br><br>But music has been diluted by crap in the 90s and 00s.  It started with disco and its snowballed through the 80s and onward.  Music is art.  Art commercialized is crap.  Music has become crap.<br><br>The remedy?  Support your local music ARTIST.  Go to the little shit holes where they play and buy their under-produced 5 track demos.  Bring the good ones to your friends and tell them to see that band.  <br><br>Stop listening to the radio, MTV, VH1, BET, etc.  Don't support the commercialized music industry and the problem will go away.  All the money hungry bastards will go elsewhere.  Take the business man away from the music industry and you might start seeing good music again.<br><br>Disco isn't dead...it just changed its tune.<br><br> <p><br>---Me<br><br><b>"Hanlon's Razor:</b><br>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujarakmase.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarak Mase</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CiH Asshole</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 3:45:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.headcharge.com/new/sm_cover.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: There are no genres</span><hr size=1> acctually, I got metal from something else I was reading that I didn't quote, the band called themself a metal band, but that was in a magazine I was reading at the gas station. there are many many other bands that have caused me to write this post, I guess this apex theory thing set it off. <p><center><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/2.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?

FUCK these lame ass....</span><hr size=1> I asked myself another question: Do we really need all these different genres?<br>I for one think that it is pretty cool that nowadays all different styles of music are mixed up. Several years ago, the music you listened to expressed your way of thinking and your lifestyle. But today? Come on, almost noone still lives by their music. Neither Punk bands, nor Metal bands, nor Rap artists, nor teenie pop bands.<br>The Punk revolution is dead for example. Ska anyone? Only &quot;old school&quot; people remember bands like Bad Manners, Specials or Loafers, with some luck you can find people who know Madness.<br>Rap? Yah right, it is all about &quot;ice&quot;. I don't blame them that they make a shitload of money with their music, but honestly, today's rap can in no way express what Rap once stood for.<br>Gothic? Cool music, but who still lives that way? Almost noone, so when you go onto a Sisters of Mercy concert, you see a crowd wearing tee-shirts and jeans, in opposite to the early 80's where everyone was dressed in black.<br>The world has changed a lot and so has its music. People come closer and so come the different genres. This is a good movement in my eyes cause this way bands have the chance to be heard by a bigger amount of people. People see the announcement of a concert and don't say: Hey, I don't go there cause it is metal but they might say: Hmm, I have heard of them before and as far as I remember they make some decent music, let's check it out. Maybe bands do not always have &quot;their&quot; audience on their concerts, but they for sure play in sold out halls and sell more records than they would have done if these strict genre regulations still existed.<br>In the end you can decide yourself if you want to listen to them or not. You do not have to if you do not want to. Well, and if your favourite hardcore Punk band all of a sudden plays a Britney Spears cover, live with it and laugh your ass off. I for one like funny cover versions, like Lagwagon's Ska version of the Inspector Gadget theme. <p><center><img src="http://home.the-web-ac.com/jokosel/pics/signature.jpg" border=0></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=600.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=600.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=600.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=600.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=600.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=600.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=600.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=600.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
