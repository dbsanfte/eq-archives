In a sense CiH won the great race because they uberized faster than any other group.  You were the first to be able to do what you wanted.  Hell, CT was still doing nag/vox when CiH first killed trak.  Because you were the first ones there, you grew accustomed to getting exactly what you wanted.  You owned the server.  <br>
<br>
As far as the alliance, the officers at the time from day one will remember that I pointed out that both guilds should stop recruitment, before the numbers got out of hand.  If you don't remember run back and look at the joint officer board I have a post there about it.  You may speak with the bulk of our recruits now, and they were told we had closed recruitment.  Through the alliance we didn't recruit for that very reason, you kept recruiting then decided too many mouths to feed.<br>
<br>
Now then, the very large problems at heart seem to be the following:<br>
<br>
1. Cats was attempting all the stuff we did in the alliance prior to the alliance, CT was not.  Its not to say that we couldn't do it, its just that already WL and CiH were farming the server much like CT and CiH does now.  I would imagine a guild like TK is about where CT was pre our alliance.<br>
<br>
2.  Going into the alliance, cats had some better gear than CT did.  I say some because Cats profited just as much loot wise as CT did, your loot whoreing members got just as much or more loot than our loot whoreing members did.<br>
<br>
3. As mentioned above, cats history, they have owned the server.<br>
<br>
From these three points, Cats feels that they are the best guild on the server.  And they are.  But they aren't so much better than some of the other guilds out there that they can dominate a server like, AL for example.<br>
<br>
I personally got very frustrated.  The end of the alliance didn't treat me very well.  The cats officers decided to place the blame of the alliance's end on me, and several members (of CiH) have constantly harassed me to no ends over some of the points that they feel I am to blame for.<br>
<br>
A person can only take so much of people implying through tells that 1. I'm better than you, 2. My guild is better than your guild.  I'm no longer the guildleader, but I do stand behind one of the principles that I used when building CT, and that is I don't care if we are the best guild in EQ or the best guild on the server or even the best guild in a zone.  We will go out and try to achieve whatever we can.<br>
<br>
CT is not, never will be, nor ever wants to be the best guild on the server.  We don't post our accomplishments on public boards so that other people can see how great we are.  We don't try to compete with other guilds.  We compete with the game itself, trying to see if we can do something we never have before, or if we have, do something better than we have before.<br>
<br>
When I personally (though i wasn't the only one) received tells, and trevize, you were not the only one, from members of cats essentially telling me that my guild has to play by these certain rules imposed by cats or we will wake the sleeper --or-- that you were going to wake the sleeper so that my friends wouldn't have the possibility of ever seeing the warders I got very upset.  What the intent of my post was supposed to be was that CT isn't going to play that game.  I hope you don't wake the sleeper, and I ask you not to and if its something you want I will get down on my hands and knees and plead with you not to wake him, because I promised to my guild that all members would get a key and get into sleepers (and the implication is obtain loot from the warders that they wanted).<br>
<br>
What my personal belief is, however, CT isn't going to be dictated how we can play EQ.  Last I checked, a member of cats doesn't pay my monthly bill to sony.  Until that happens then I will play the game the way I want to play it.  I don't pay any member of CiH's bills either, so I don't try to dictate how they play the game.  And this is what i was trying to say when I started this thread.  I don't want you to wake the sleeper, but I have no control over that.  But if you choose for whatever reason to wake the sleeper, do you know what happens?  Nothing.  The sleeper awakes, and much of the server is deprived of part of this game, but in the long run nothing.  I'll still log in and try to achieve something new or something better, my guildmates will do the same.  Cats will log in and probably do that same exact thing.  We'll just have a few less things to kill each week.<br>
<br>
So, if that's the case, why should we cave in to threats and ultamatems?  I don't own you nor portend to, but in the words of Uzzu, you don't own me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>a WOOD elf warrior.. right</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/16/02 2:33:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb -- To Cats</span><hr size=1> I don't want to flame or anything, but this thread seems to be the logical one to post my thoughts on.<br>
On AB (yeah, leave our server board and get back to your shitty Euro server), we also have a North ToV rotation between Darkwind and Mortalis:<br>
<br>
You have 48 hours to clear North Wing, after 48 hours it is FFA. If you are not done with North Wing within these 48 hours, you betterhave your members online very early the next day to not lose your dragons. Rotation switches with every respawn/patch/server maintance but NOT with a zone crash!<br>
<br>
I think that is a pretty fair solution cause this way no guild can be sure to *have* North ToV after 48 hours. This way *holding* North ToV and clearing other things first is no option. This balances a lot of things imo. Maybe worth a try on Drinal too?! <p><center>

<br>
Sure your mad and want to react in a way to punish the abuse people give you. Do you think your the only ones who take abuse? Look around the world is full of it. Many come to EQ world to have that excitement that you go through in killing Nag/Vox doing the Kings &amp; lords as well as ST. I have old friends that are in Cats that go way way back to the CBC days, I am sure many of you remember those days as well. I guess it just depresses me in a way. Because I know one day I would kill nag/vox and other high end stuff because I knew they would be there when I was able to get there. But is going to really suck that day when I find out the sleeper was awakened on drinal. Which would not only crush my hopes at a future challendge but also the hopes of so many.<br>
<br>
Guys follow your goals do what you want. There are let me downs throught life and we all have gone through them and learned from our mistakes. Just make sure what ever happends it is done with REAL thinking and not mixed anger emotion.<br>
<br>
P.S this whole thing is 100 times bigger then it has to be. Lets just drop our walls for a bit, have a beer and relax. <br>

Cya all in game<br>

And the majority of CiH acheivement will be to wake the sleeper.<br>
<br>
If you can argue with that statement, then you argue your own want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usslithissik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sslithissik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/16/02 4:37:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://24.42.1.36/~thalakar/smallss3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb -- To Cats</span><hr size=1> Gell : CIH didn't own the server just cuz we had the ability to do the tough things sooner, thats just the way it seemed.  This game is about accomplishment so I dunno if this once again &quot;You loot wh0res, we're bitter you are more advanced and now that we can do the same stuff, fuck you&quot; attitude is kinda sad. This is the same type of hands on the waist finger waggling stuff we got from Maar when Winter's light started killing harder stuff.<br>
<br>
What is REALLY surprising is it's coming from CT now cuz we were so tight for a while and I am still friends with a lot of members.<br>
<br>
You especially Gell benefited from the alliance possibly moreso than any one individual with often what a lot of people, including those in you're own guild, looked upon as questionable dedication to raiding cept when something sweet a crusader could use might drop.<br>
<br>
Anyway.<br>
