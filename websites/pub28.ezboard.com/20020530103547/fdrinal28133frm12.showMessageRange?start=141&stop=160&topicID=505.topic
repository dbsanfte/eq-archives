I didn't know you were GoTK? (thats the right abreviation correct?) anyway, i didn't know you were there, sorry dude, you got a huge sig the only thing i read was your lvl to see how you were comming along, other than that i've honestly never heard of GoTK (i'm assuming that i'm the afformentioned liar) honest mistake, never read the sig.  other than that i stand by my previous post, and i stand by my guild on this one.<br>
<br>
  Most of this thread is too funny for me, i really get the feeling that most of the guilds whining about respect and not ks over corpses and all that wonderfull stuff would have absolutly no problem what so ever doing the same or similar.  The only guilds here I accept calling me an asshole is GoTK and AA, you guys vent away. the only person it hurts from for me is Higar (you rock dude) but the rest of you? i say Fuck yall! woo eat a dick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwolfraan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfraan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.seaforth.com/images/rcain.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/02 3:39:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=505.topic&index=142>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.seaforthlanding.com/images/misc/homeranm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I'm really going to enjoy this -_-</span><hr size=1> Now that's the kind of flaming/ranting I'm used to!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   WTG Drinal community.

<br>
OK gang, had enough of fighting the loyal fight and defending the indefensible.  I'll happily defend my guild no matter what may happen up to a point.  However, I just read through my logs of that day to relive exactly what happened.  The complete lack of response by the raid leader to a number of questions I've posed before, during and after the raid means that I'm now going to say what I honestly think.  My actions on this thread were supposed to create a fireball and they certainly have.  The idea was to elicit some sort of response from the personages responsible interally within KC for our actions on the Sev raid.  Unfortunately they haven't.  And so now, here is the truth.<br>
<br>
The Sev fiasco on the weekend was screwed up.  From the start.  We as a guild had misleading information and crossed wires.  We first piled into EJ because we thought the sequence of events was GotK attempting and failing Sev, AA attempting and failing Sev and then both parties giving up and doing their CR.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Already we thought that two guilds were stampeeding over each other to get to the dragon so we gated on over (as soon as we could get enough mana back after the Insanity Crawler started making friends with us).<br>
<br>
When we arrived we checked and saw CS numbers rising.  Admitedly, this was possibly due to some of them helping out but at the time it looked like a repeat of what had happened the week before, namely CS swooping in and taking the dragon.  This was possibility was seemingly confirmed when a member of CS OOCed that the dragon was claimed by someone else entirely (Britain, I think).  Maybe it was a joke, I don't know, but it sure definitely looked like a repeat performance of behaviour we had experienced before.<br>
<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was about this time that KC as a guild first started becoming aware that AA/GotC might wish to hit the dragon again.  But please be aware, we flew into EJ because we thought the dragon was unclaimed.  <br>
<br>
At the time I was having a chat with a fellow raider.  They actually asked me if some other guild was trying to KS Sev from us again...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Point A - If I actually thought we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> KSing as I said, and if I really did think our actions were &quot;ripe&quot; (i.e. hypocritical) why the hell did I go along with this?  Honestly, I'm not sure and I'm pretty appalled that I did.  I can only imagine that at the time I was caught up in the prep and the motions of an All Hands On Deck raid and didn't stop to engage brain.  Our guild was mobilizing and everyone was asked to participate.  But I should have paid more attention to that little, red warning light non-the-less.  I didn't, and for that I am sorry.<br>
<br>
Then again, as stated before, we were under the impression that a KS was going to happen regardless.  And to be honest, I probably didn't help matters...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
[Sat Feb 02 21:49:46 2002] You say to your guild, 'AA are still ressing, they will not be ready for at leats 10 mins by which time CS will be here'<br>

[Sat Feb 02 21:50:11 2002] You say to your guild, 'CS beginning to come into zone.  6 here atm and rising'<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
OK so I admit it, we're now paranoid after previous treatment by other guilds.  But it's not a good enough excuse and I'll discuss that below.<br>
<br>
Also as I said before in this thread, our positioning was poor.  Personally, I was aware of this and, seeing as I was grouped with the raid leader, tried to bring it to their attention.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
[Sat Feb 02 21:58:56 2002] You tell your party, 'if we pull to here we WILL train the others up top and they will petition us.  You ready for a long chat with the GMs?'<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To which there was no response.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Two minutes later Sev was on top of us and that's all she wrote.<br>
<br>
The fact remains, KC were aware that GotK wanted to go again.  And this is where the problem lies.  Yes, everyone is correct, the honourable thing to do would have been to let GotK have another crack at the beast.  When KC thought CS were swooping in we decided to go for the dragon instead of letting them KS again.  However, the problem with this action was that, in doing so, we lowered ourselves down to the level of the very people we were trying to foil and, in doing so, failed ourselves.  In all likelihood sheer momentum carried us through but, looking back, it was wrong.  We should have just sat back and let events unwrap themselves on their own accord.  If CS had done what we thought they were going to do (and I freely admit that, with hindsight, they probably were not.  But we were operating under once bitten twice shy rules) then our correct stance would have been to watch them or any guild who attempted to swipe the raid do so, and then take the moral high ground ourselves.<br>
<br>
Like we used to do.<br>
<br>
Somewhere down the road we sort of lost sight of that.  I think it was because of repeated inter-guild arguments over spawns and raids.  Does anyone in CT/TK remember the fun little three-way tussel we once had over claiming the Sev spawn which ended up with a GM getting the leaders to random for the damned dragon?  That was the event which sparked off the attempted discussion on Kunark dragon rotations which, in the end, never got very far.  And as for Kutch bringing up the Trakanon incident, that stemmed from WL and KC leapfrogging over each other in a race to try to get to the dragon (KC were in zone and forming the raid first).  (And btw, if you check back in WL's own private form you'll see that I was the one trying to mediate and form a joint raid between the two of our guilds.  So don't throw that particular race at me).  Two guilds racing to head for a damned spawn, does that sound like respect to any of you lot?  People talk about respect easily but enacting it seems to be a lot harder.  Anyway, that was another screwed up situation, so bad that I and a number of other people left KC shortly afterwards, some never to return.<br>
<br>
Oh well, anyway.  That's the chronology of events and might go some way to explaining KC's mind set.  You won't see KC actively apologising as a guild because, as in most raid cases with this guild, the action needs to be taken by the leader for the rest to follow suit and I'm afraid that will most likely never happen.<br>
<br>
But if it is any consolation (and it sure as hell shouldn't be), as an individual I am not particularly happy with what the guild as a whole did, what I personally did and the response (or rather, lack thereof) from the people within KC who's voice actually counts regarding this incident.  KC as a guild should be behaving morally and even handedly with everyone, no matter what everyone else is doing.  Somewhere we lost that message.  We should find it again and, after this, you can guarantee that we will do so very quickly.  Sorry about the mess.<br>
<br>
But one last thing and one thing only.  A lot of the people out there who are so rampantly criticising the actions of the other day are now on notice.  Keep your own houses in order.  Almost every guild who this statement could apply to has had members posting onto this thread, now.  The slightest hint of any nastiness and you can bet your bottom berty that you're going to be dragged, kicking and screaming, back to this thread.  Learn to compromise and work with those other guilds you think you hate so much.  You'll be amazed what you can achieve. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24811">Trewayn Fifate</A>, <font size=1><EM>Virtuoso, master artisan and all round good egg</EM>

Trewayn: Thank you for the info you posted, though I think it would have helped things alot more if you had posted that on page one of this thread, it does help at least clarify the thought process going on over on the KC side. I have to agree with you, it seems that the leadership of the raid is *the most* to blame here. Though that doesn't clear the rest of you from fault, by any means, it does at least let us know who the majority of the blame rests squarely on. I hope you don't end up being chastised for coming forward with this info, though I'm guessing you will be, knowning human nature as I do. Thanks for taking that risk. It was the honorable thing to do. <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

If you zone in and see a guild forming up and there are about 15 people or so in the zone, GO HOME, nuttin to see here folks...the dragon will get his ass handed to him soon enough.

<br>
There is no reason for a guild to stand around when another guild is engaging a dragon other than to provide a little extra lag and make the guild engaged feel like they are rushed, and are fixing to get sniped. <p>Skarl Speedbump <BR>58 mage of Drinal<br>skarlspeedbump@hotmail.com<BR> "Why do people like me?

The bard guildleader Trev: man you shoulda rounded up the troops, and bid everyone in here a big &quot;shit sorry we fucked up&quot; instead you came here with your big mouth splurting off, and now you got your guildmates coming on here braging about absurd logic, we hear stuff like &quot;/point guildmates new epic&quot; and &quot;we did it cause it was done before and will be done again&quot; and then we get a several page long reply by you indicating you came here justifying this to  &quot;weed out the truth from your guild&quot; hahahahahah thats funny.<br>

To those who were the target of this dishonor, it must have been a horrible day indeed to not only get sniped of your raid dragon, but to have members die due to the fact the dragon was pulled onto your CR, is an even sicker display of absolute greed and selfishness. Kings Court no more, more like Jesters Court, or PinkeyedLittlebastard's Court. hehe.<br>
