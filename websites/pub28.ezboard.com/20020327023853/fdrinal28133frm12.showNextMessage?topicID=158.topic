A bunch of people show up to kill that fuking turtle, Lodzial you call it? We gladly offer to help kill this thing and do not contest whose it is, as it was all cool. So we help kill this turtle and the way they lotto the stuff is somewhat upseting. You tell me.<br>
<br>
A map piece for that quest, is randomed and someone, who is a 34th level ranger, playing someones shamen at the raid, wins this map piece, over level 50's and 60's, who actively participated in the killing. You know what? Am I pissed that I did not win the piece? no, I just learn every day people get fuxored over with this type of shit and you wonder why people relegate to guilds, and stay with their members.<br>
<br>
Please Divinous, and particuarly Phoenixx, a nice chap usually, whom I do &quot;sorely&quot; apologize for whining to slightly a bit after one of the most saddest events in &quot;stupidity&quot; history went down, let the people outside your normal groups know you would allow a ranger of the 34th season to loot an item sought after by many, 60 rogues, 50+ sk's etc etc, because the principal on this is about make a valve in my godamn head burst.<br>
<br>
Btw whoever the ranger is who won the map piece, I highly doubt they would be able to do the quest, without help, and even if they can, the advantages of it will not be seen I am sure to near 50. Just seems like a large waste.<br>
<br>
Not ususally caught up in this type of stuff but had to write this after logging out pretty much ready to BARF.<br>
<br>
Point taken, do not go on someone elses raid to help them, theres always stuff you do not know they will do, throw in at the last minute without you knowing and it will ruin your evening, and those around you.<br>

<br>
     The ranger who I allowed to roll for the map piece ( part of the eyepatch of plunder quest) was ASKED to bring his cousins lvl 53 shaman to fill our need for a shaman to be present ( slows, tailsman). So he was nice enough to ablige, parking his ranger nearby and getting his Cousins Shaman who was logged in the burning woods. I at the time announced that he would going to be lotto'ing as his ranger and would not lotto as his counsins shaman.<br>
<br>
     The lotto for every single item that was dropped by Lodizal was fair to everyone present. It was very simple rules giving everyone a fair chance at winning something. You were in a single lotto for an item you ccould equip and were going to use. Win or lose, that was your chance. Several people rolled, the lvl 34 ranger won. Everyone who wanted a chance at the map piece had a fair chance at rolling for it. And the map piece was not in any danger of rotting before the ranger could loot it. Lodizal is a lvl 60 mob which  corpse would not poof for 30 mintutes.<br>
<br>
     I also offered to hear you out after all the lotto'ing was done. Instead, you choose to log out. In the past ( though I've had little experiences with you) you've been a nice person until this. Out of the 15 or so people present, no one when asked if the lotto was unfair, did so. There were in fact a few who apologized for you.<br>
<br>
     If you would like to speak your peace and your present your arugment, I will be glad to hear you out. However if you wish to have your disappointment of losing a lotto turn into childish flames be assured you won't be invited to future Divinus Veritas raids.<br>

<br>
The map piece will probably sit on that ranger for awhile till he can finish the quest where a person that is higher level can actually get the quest done and have the eyepatch, Im not sure but can the quest be done pre 50?  I have twinks that are higher level then the ranger, and have the common sense not to include myself into lotto's that would benefit another character moe then myself...You might want to ask if poeple have the other parts of the quest done and how far along poeple are in the quest before hand, this to benefit the person that has been working on the quest<br>
<br>
Hehe in hind sight now people will know why alot of raids are guild only, so as not to piss people off, and normally...few bad apples aside...people are willing to give a little when the item is for a person that would benefit from it more, as the whole guild will benefit from it in the long run<br>

As a result you have the adacity, the sheer nerve to threaten me to not be invited on your raids again.  Do you think I give a good gods damn? You broke some of the most common &quot;hi I am a newbie lamer&quot; type players rules known, Letting players far below their level lotto on stuff they do not, deserve. Fighting a 60th level turtle, needs high level players, and you never told any of us that you were doing this, until after the turtle was dead and you had gotten our help. <br>
<br>
Trust me bro you will Not ever see me ask to join in a group of yours again, ever, you should sit back and realize how absolutly stupid you sound for trying to defend a situation like this, I hope your guildmates are aware of your looting procedures, as everyone I have even spoke with on this has broken out in laughter and said &quot;yeah right no ones that stupid.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hope the 34th level ranger either levels fast, or can take the mobs out for the quest rofl, btw the cougars near one of the camps hit for 60+ its unlikely he could camp the other pieces alone. <br>
<br>
To anyone reading this, its not about the loot, this is just downright absurdity of the situation, and now I log on here to read this poor guy trying to defend his decision and sound all procedural. To anyone in Divinus I truly TRULY apologize as I probably know some of you and we get along, and I am sorry if this is a flame unto you, it is not, it is a shocked assassin still stumbling around in disbelief over such an absurd decision.   <br>

<br>
your attempt to &quot;clarify the situation&quot; only made ya look worse.  How can you POSSIBALLY justify letting that level of a Ranger loot that.  This is a level 60 MOB.  I think you are a druid if I remember right.  Lets say I have a level 34 Druid but use my Wizzie to help Kill Lodizal.  If the Shield thingie drops, well hell, I should get to roll on it for my Druid right?  That is the worst excuse I have ever heard Phoenixx.  Your the guild leader with that kind of logic?  Im sure your guild is going to tell you to your face that its no big deal.  but I know for a fact many of them are pissed and wont say anything.  You cant tell me the Ranger even helped a little bit.<br>
<br>
Very sad Phoenixx, you should feel like shit cause your definately a piece of one.  Its stuff like this that makes people leave the game, and you know it.  Id be embarassed if you were my guild leader...but then again, I would of disbanded you by now.<br>

I could have told the ranger that he could not be in any of the lotto's because he was too low of a level but he could still bring his cousins lvl 53 shaman to help out. And he probably would have done that because he was a guildmate and a very nice person. Would it have been fair to him? No. He helped kill a lvl 60 mob by bringing ( at my request) his cousins 53rd shaman.<br>
<br>
     Second altnative. I could have let him lotto for shaman stuff and not even have told anyone he was playing someone else's account. Would this have been fair? No nor would it have been honest.<br>
<br>
     Sadly, you are missing my point. You feel that because this was a high level mob, the loot should have been lotto'd between those of equal level regardless of who put their effort into the slaying or not. I disagree. We can look at another example. Takes 30 people to do Nagy usually. Cloak of flames drops. A lvl 34 bard was present, rolled, and won. But wait, we deny him because everyone else on the raid was 45 +. Where is the fairness in that? Especially if he made a difference in the fight. That example I just gave you is actually a true story that happened not long ago but without the bard being excluded or denied the cloak. Haven't heard or seen any flames to that raid's leader decision. Wonder why?<br>
<br>
     Just because we dealing with a high level mob, doesn't make it right to exclude people who are lower then the &quot;norm&quot; for such an encounter if they are asked to come along. Normally you aren't going to see people who aren't of level to take on such a mob anyways.<br>
      That also brings a second point up. You had asked to join. We didn't actually HAVE to add you nor did you actually have to join. What did you get out of this? The same thing everyone who actively killed the turtle. A fair chance at a single item. If you had won, there would be no post. No flame. But because you had lost to a much lower lvl player you flame. It's that growing attitude that is self destructing alot of the higher level guilds. I believe CS broke up because Marr was fed up with the greed that was going on (second hand knowledge- I DO NOT know if this is entirely true but makes sense).<br>
<br>
     As far the item &quot;doing shit&quot; for the lvl 34 ranger let's look at the stats and effect. Though I can't confirm what lvl the effect actually starts working ( It's the same effect as the low lvl shaman attk speed buff, adds 20% spell haste). It's possible he may not be able to use the effect till later but it has nice AC, adds str, dex, hit points and some resists. These all are nice stats increases be it for a lvl 1 or lvl 60. If it didn't make leveling alittle bit easier by adding such stats, why even twink? The eyepatch is useful regardless of level.<br>
<br>
     If you don't like my lotto rules, then stick to your promise of not being apart of our raids. I will not let greed influence over fairness to everyone in any lotto. When it comes down to it, I made a single exception to what some of you feel are normal looting procedures. The exception was needed, and thus by making it I had to be fair to the person who was willing to do whatever it took to help out. The lotto could have gone either way but you lost and he won. Now you cling to a &quot;Higher lvl loot should go to high level people&quot; idea ignoring the fact that he had put his two cents in just like everyone else. That's not right in my book and you could  get 100 posts siding with you on this but it wouldn't change the fact you had a fair chance of winning the item like everyone else present only to lose to another person.<br>
      As far as him being able to complete the rest of the quest. It can be done. It may be a challenge but it's not out of his level range. He needs a lvl low 30's rare spawn griffon in Iceclad. Fear (Animal) and snare kite works fine. Saw a level 33 necro do this just fine ( using fear and pet). The dire wolf stalker is more common and near the same level as stormfeather. The last part is rather more time consuming then it is difficult. That's it.<br>
<br>
   Until a reasonable arugment can be presented, I am sticking to my guns. I am sorry if we see differently. We both now know better of the other person feelings regarding how lotto's should be done. All I ask was that you respect my decision even if you did not like it. And again, I would have gladly heard you out before you choose to log out without presenting your argument. You're not a bad person nor do I hate you. We simply don't agree on something that effects what raids we ask to be apart of.<br>

Lodizal permits 53+ to hit him so the difference in levels of 52 and 35 that attempts Nagafen isnt even remotely as substantial as it is for levels that are needed to kill a level 60 MOB.   Since it was your raid, however, you can do with loot whatever ya want and if people dont like it then they dont have to group with ya anymore.  Youve always been a fair person from what ive seen.  I dont blame you at all to be honest, I blame the Ranger for even wanting to be in the lotto.  To me, that is the person that was in the wrong(if someone IS actually in the wrong here), not Phoenixx.<br>

Btw: whether or not the 34 ranger could use the item is really totally irrelevent, could a group of 34th level players take Lodzial? (DOH)<br>
<br>
(RE: shamens, we added a 60 who could slow the turtle, I dunno if a 52 could, and regardless of if he was a 52nd level shamen played by his cousin who is a 34th level ranger, neither should have been let into the lotto for the map piece for that item.<br>

Phonnnix: for the last time, you make claims of greed, yet the only one who is looking greedy is the pathetic chump who looted the piece as a 34th level ranger, and the only one whose looking way stupid here is yourself.<br>

All said and done the ranger won the lotto fair and square.<br>

Just some question SlinkerDread :<br>
<br>
1 Do you farm items ?<br>
2 What would your looting rules be ?<br>
3 Why didn't you organise your on raid ?<br>
<br>
Personnally I think its great that a high level item went to a low non twinked level character. After all isn't that the idea of the game, a chance to get something special no matter who you are.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this post detracts from the game in my eyes, Just inforcing the view that players are inherently greedy and selfish.<br>

It was announced at the very beginning that the Ranger was going to be allowed to loot.  It was not said in guildsay and &quot;was&quot; said where everyone could hear.  I heard it and was in a group with 3 other people.  You say it is not about greed, you say that people in Divinus Veritas apologized for Phoenixx, you say that his guild members did not support his decision.<br>
<br>
Let's get the facts straight, DV is one of the closest knit guilds on Drinal, by being close people do not hold back from posting their disagreements in guildsay.  The guild will either send a tell to a person that they do not agree with, send a tell to the leader or officers in the guild or post in guildsay.  No one said a word to any of us from the guild or in guildsay.  So I have come to the conclusion that you are grasping at straws in a poor attempt to try to make yourself look good.<br>
<br>
Afterlife and almost all the guilds that are organized will announce beforehand looting procedures and it is our policy that if something is announced prior to a raid or a lotto and no one voices a complaint, then the decision stands.  It does no good for anyone to complain and gripe after the raid is over.  As for him being 34, I have watched the majority of people in the guild after obtaining a nice item, go full boar to level up because they have a taste of what's ahead in EQ.  Level 34 is not too hard to get to 50, it can be done in two to three weeks with a little help.  We are not talking level 12.  This Ranger has bent over backwards for our guild and is a really sweet and nice person.  He was asked to do something by one of the officers of the guild and therefore Phoenixx decided on a reward for all his trouble and granted him one lotto.  If a person outside the guild was asked to do something for the guild, Phoenixx would have done the same thing for that person.  The one thing that really upsets me about EQ, is that a person is not judged on their merits as a person by the majority of players, but by what level they are.  DV had enough people that could join in and kill the turtle without any of your help (inside and outside the guild), and people that would not have had a problem with the Phoenixx's decision.  You asked to join, we did not ask you!<br>
<br>
You also said on a prior post that you were not going to post on this again, but lo and behold, another post.  Why was I not surprised?  I think your credibilty is weak and that you are only upset because you did not win.<br>
<br>
Phoenixx put the raid together, organized it, called in people to help and let people know what he was doing.  It is people like you that keep most guilds from letting people they do not know or last minute requests from joining in.<br>
<br>
Also, as far as apologizing goes, talk to the people that you know that were on that raid and ask how many of them apologized for your childish behaviour that night.<br>

And a sad thread too, letting a guy whose highest character is level 34 loot something <br>
from a level 60 encounter just becuase he agreed to stop playing his level 34 character <br>
for a few hours and log in a friends account to help out on a high level encounter is just <br>
wrong, so wrong. If you cant see how wrong this is, then you are too fucking stupid to <br>
be playing this game.<br>
<br>
Hey I got a level 3 character I can stop playing for a few minutes and I will log on any <br>
higher level char to help in any encounters if needed. Of course then I expect to be able to <br>
roll for any loot for my level 3 char. Its only fair!<br>
<br>
And the dumbest thing about this entire thing, is the higher level shaman wasnt even his <br>
own character.
