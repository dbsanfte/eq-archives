I am taking this directly to your guild before airing my complaint publicly on Drinal's EZboard...<br>
yesterday my lvl 30 Iksar SK Istivan Ebonclaww was camping the King in The Warrens, around 2pm. I had been camping him and the High Shaman all morning, I still get exp from them and full item drops, noone else was around so I was just about to jump on the King who was due to spawn at 2:07pm..<br>
The King pops, I begin to fire off my Clinging Darkness spell when your guildmember Dachande drops Inviz and lands an attack before my spell hits. Before I can protest this act of ninja campstealing he announces &quot;Owned&quot; and proceeds to slay the King with a few whacks from his uberweapon. I start to complain, but he dashed off before I could...<br>
I have never had someone steal a spawn from me like that, hovering around Invisible while I was in plain sight not 10 paces away from the King, waiting the hour for him to spawn. If I had known he was there, or had he asked to take the next pop I gladly would have said yes, after all nooone owns a camp. Dachande's selfish immature act cost me an hour's time, and whatever Cold Iron armor or Forlorn Item drops the King might have had that time, since the encounter was trivial to him therefore no such items dropped due to Warren's special loot drop rules.<br>
I could have /report 'ed and /petition'ed him, but there was no text evidence of his selfish act, so I didnt. I could have taken this complaint to Drinal's public EZboard - but havent yet. This is the third time a CiH'er has acted rudely and childishly towards a char of mine, the last two times I shrugged off as a bad apple or two in an otherwise good Guild.<br>
This time I expect some action by your Guild leader, or I'll do the only other thing I can, take this to the public Drinal board and let our server know what kind of people you have in your uberguild.<br>
I await to see what your guild stands for and if fairness exists for lowbies like me.<br>
respectfully, <br>
Istivan Ebonclaww of Drinal - 30th lvl Iksar SK<br>

 I was running around the zone smacking stuff trying to get a hole raid together and I saw the king so i went up and smacked him around for some paineel faction. And then you run up and complain. I didn't see anyone and i didn't kill steal anything. I engaged him first and took the harm touch. I'm sorry you didnt get a pixel of blue or the carnelian and fish wine he dropped =(  <br>

I know how pissed you are about all this, but I don't think you should indict an entire guild over this. I know several people from CiH who are very nice. On the other hand, there is no age requirement for getting in that guild and there is likely a few who, for whatever reasons, are disrespectful and bitter.(Qalar). I can say the same for virtually all guilds. What you need to do is take steps to protect your camp. Get some See Invis gear if you don't have the spell. Say hello and ask if that person is interested in the mob you are camping. If they are, let them know that you were there first and ask if they don't mind waiting for the next pop.<br>
<br>
I recently completed a camp from hell in Iceclad for Stormfeather for a eyepatch quest. Several CiH members appeared during my camp and were very gracious and respectful. Carran and Windayla(sp) were two names I remember from that time. I beleive Carran could have KSed the mob from me being he is a 60 druid if he wanted. Windayla actually gave me a tell that I &quot;shouldn't worry&quot; and that she respected my camp.<br>
<br>
Stormfeather ended up being a 30 real hour (not consecutive)camp and I have known others who have camped this far longer. I took precautions the whole time (see invis, tracking PCs for level, etc.), but the cold hard fact remains. I could have invested the 30 hours only to have my mob KSed from me. It's the chance I took when I started the camp.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hats off to the good and shame on the bad.<br>

<br>
I don't know many CiH members, but when your first impulse is to lie and deny, any apology afterwards will not be taken sincerely no matter who you are or what you're a member of. Simple answer is just be honest. It doesn't cost you anything. If you KS somebody admit it. I don't think most killstealing is intentional. It's the denial afterwards that can hurt more than the KS itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uluuvien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luuvien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/01 8:44:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cats in Hats - great bunch of guys</span><hr size=1> hi kerney <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqalarrubican.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qalar Rubican</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/4/01 8:58:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cats in Hats - great bunch of guys</span><hr size=1> heh, Kerney don't even go there with me.
