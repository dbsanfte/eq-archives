Which, imo, is a bit odd.  There is no difference between a 17 and an 18 year old, yet at 18 you magically transform to a legal adult.  Which makes me think of something else extremely fucked up.  At 18 a person is old enough to go to prison or be drafted into the service where they're able to kill other people YET they are not responsible enough to drink? WTF is that?  I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  I am an 18 year old myself, and I don't drink much at all, but I find it incredibly stupid that I can be charged as an adult, I can go to war and kill another human being, I can buy porn, I can vote yet I have to wait another 3 years before I can legaly consume an alcoholic beverage.  All these restrictions end up backfiring and create more kids that drink heavily at earlier ages than would if it weren't something &quot;forbidden&quot; <br>
There is no reason drugs like marijuana should be illegal.  All our country's harsh drug laws do is overcrowd the prisons, make the mob rich, and promote crime.  But I don't see it being legalized because people are so uptight.  They don't mind their kids getting hooked on cigarettes but, man, pot is fucking evil.<br>

I read it thru.  The guy was accused of raping a 13 year old girl.  I thought Megan's Law was a good thing too, till I read the fine print.  He was convicted 15 years prior.  He was 13 years old when the &quot;rape&quot; happened.   Assault charges were not listed as his crimes so I think it is more than likely it was more a case of sexual experimentation than forced rape.  While I certainly wouldnt want my daughter having sex at that age, sexual urges do start around then if not before.   Human nature conflicts with the law sometimes but another child should not be labeled for his entire life based any act short of murder or something exceptionally brutal.<br>

We cannot pass judgements on whether or not these crimes are really as minor as some would make them seem.  The fact is, the crimes were committed and the person was found guilty, so they should be forced to live with the shame of their act.  <br>
<br>
I myself do not have any children, but I do not want a convicted child molester or sex offender living anywhere near me, children or no children.  That is just not the type of person I want in my neighborhood. <br>
<br>
That being said, the case can and should be made for having an age cap on these penalties.  I do not think most kids 14 and under really have any idea of what they are doing.  If it is a case of a forced assault or rape and it is proven as such, then they should be forced to live with this over their head.  If it is a consensual, yet age induced rape or assault then that is a major difference, and believe me, they do know the difference in our court system and can dole out fitting punishments.<br>
<br>
The fact is many parents will back their children and downplay the event.  In their eyes they do not believe their child could have committed such a crime, and they always believe it will never happen again.  Unfortunately, the public needs to be protected from these ignorant cases.<br>
<br>
As for the Marijuana argument.  Lets see, since it is not quite so bad as alcohol or smoking in number of deaths caused, lets just unleash it on the public.  Nice idea.  Brilliant.  I am an anti-government liberal and I still see nothing positive in making this legal.<br>
<br>
Have you ever thought people don't die as often due to marijuana induced accidents because fewer people smoke it since it is illegal.  Can't wait until one of you that backs making it legal has a kid, girlfriend, wife or whatever killed by some hallucinating fool on the road that thinks the victim was a target they had to run over to get an extra bonus to their car or something.  <br>
<br>
No, marijuana is not a heavy duty hallucinogen, but most people smoking marijauna are also consuming alcohol at the same time.  If you think wither one is bad by itself, imagine when the effects are layered on top of one another. <br>
<br>
As for it being helpful, and relieving anxienty and depression.  There are many other ways to do this without endangering the non-losers of society who have to rely on drugs to cope with their problems.  I say ... GET A DOG!!!  FIND YOUR FAITH!!!  GO SKYDIVING!!!  <br>
<br>
Do any of those and you generally aren't risking hurting anyone else.  Any kind of argument you can put up for marijuana is good other than the use of hemp in clothing and fabrics is total BS.  It's like the stupid tobacco companies saying that cigarettes are actually helping the public because cancer kills off so many people it keeps medicaid and social security costs down.  How lame can you actually be!<br>

<br>
Hey there!  You prolly dont remember me but you helped me and a friend get our Seb Keys one night.   Your a hell of a Ranger. <br>
<br>
That outta the way I would agree that in the case of minors committing brutal crimes they should be dealt with severely.  However it is really hard to apply adult morality to someone only 13 years old.  It scares me to think that they can be branded for life for anything short of murder.  Although our justice system only pays lip service to rehabilitation there is such a thing, and the young have the best shot at it.<br>
<br>
Secondly, sex with a minor itself is a crime.  Consenting or not.  I would hate to think that this guy had consentual sex at 13 and got pegged with Megan's Law for the rest of his life.  I understand &quot;consentual sex&quot; is a possible oxymoron when applied to 13 year olds, but the fact is at that age its possible that both were willing partners.   The lack of any assault charges leads me to think that in any case it wasn't forced sex. Although those charges are often excluded from rape trials since they sometimes happen way after the fact and there is no evidence.  It was also my understanding that crimes committed before you were 18 were kept in a sealed file, with access to those files only under specific circumstances and for purposes of trial. <br>
<br>
And as for pot.  Man Talas, it is so common it boggles my mind.  I hold myself to the legal drugs of beer and cigarettes but when I think of how many people I know who smoke pot it makes me laugh at all the anti-marjijauna education they put us thru in school.   With very few exceptions everyone I know has tried it more than once.   Most will still smoke it on social occasions if its offered, even though they are not regular users.   It is not as commonly used as beer and tobacco but it is FAR closer to it than any other drug out there.   I have never even heard of a fight or accident cause by pot consumption.   I honestly believe it to be a pretty harmless drug if usage occurs after 21.   And 20% of my states crowded prisons are housing folks that are there for pot related charges.  Waste of prison space if you ask me.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt mind it if they legalized it.  But honestly from what I have seen of pot, I don't understand why people seem to think its this awful drug.   If most of the people supporting its legalization weren't heavy users and presented a more dignified front to the media, that probably wouldnt hurt either.  <br>

<br>
Have to admit I used to think everyone I knew used it.  But maybe that was just the people I was around at the time.  Due to job changes and moving and such I was forced to get out and meet new people, and suffice it to say, as I moved up in job importance my choices of friends must have also changed.  None of my current close friends smokes it, and quite honestly I now only know one or two people that do.<br>
<br>
Sadly, the friends I used to hang out with back in college still smoke it, and most of them are still in college, or pretending to be.  Marijuana isn't causing them to fail, I realize that, but I do vividly remember many weeks when some of my roomies wouldn't leave the house for school and would call in sick to work just so they could sit around and get high.  For some people that may sound like fun, but it grew old on me in a hurry. <br>
<br>
The most fortunate thing I have found about Marijuana, is due to its illegal status, most people only smoke pot at home or something they can sleep without having to try and get home.  I think that is one thing keeping accidents down.  How many of your friends smoke pot and then go driving home right after.  If it became legal, I could imagine seeing people smoking it at bars or having a quick one after work to deal with the stress of traffic and then driving home.  My humble, seemingly worthless opinion on this is, that folks smoking pot freely scares the crap out of me because their are just one too many idiots out there who can't control themselves.  Unfortunately, this means those who use marijuana in tehir own home are subject to the same law.<br>
<br>
The way the law stands now, marijuana IS basically legal in your own home, providing you are doing anything suspicious.  In all my years I have known at least a few dozen people who smoke it and none of them has ever been arrested for it.  Lets face it, unless you are doing something really stupid, the police generally don't bother you anyhow.  Heck, we used to throw parties all the time back in school and had music blaring and everything and never once did we see a cop.  I mean, you have to really go out of your way most of the time.  <br>
<br>
So basically, we have a law that is not heavily enforced on the majority of the population.  If it were it would be different.  My original point was to show how silly it was to say since one or two things that kill people are legal, then we should allow another, even if it isn't quite as bad.  Hmmm.  Something is just wrong with that logic.  <br>
<br>
Let me think (SARCASM ALERT), handguns are still legal (as they should be in my opinion), so lets make other killing items legal.  Heck, very few people die from hand grenades each year, why not legal them.  That would probably help to enforce the &quot;Stay right except to pass&quot; laws that most Interstates have that so many left lane hogs ignore.  So, in a way, all those folks dying from shrapnel would benefit society!!!  Yeah, I like it.  Actually the sad thing is I actually like this idea to a certain extent.<br>
