Please read!</span><hr size=1> Outlined in the body of text below I will describe some usefull tips and hints for grouping.  The reason I feel there needs to be a post on this is due to the lack of quality players there seems to be on this server in the general population.<br>
<br>
This is in no way a flame.  It is only to help those that have not yet learned some of the basics in the general population on Dranil.<br>
<br>
Topics will be:<br>
<br>
- Assisting<br>
- Pulling<br>
- raiding<br>
- Argo control <br>
<br>
How do you assist?  Some people take it for granted that everyone knows how to assist.  Well not all do.  I have showed a few people 51+ that were amazed when they learned this.  So hear are the basics.<br>
<br>
Your first option, which I think is the best option, is to make a scials hotkey.  You right click to open the Socials hot key and on the first line you type &quot;/assist &lt;name of puller&gt;&quot;.<br>
<br>
example:  /assist Wingedit<br>
<br>
Don't forget the &quot;/&quot; in &quot;/assist wingedit&quot;.  After the socials hotkey is made you can move it over to you Hotkey box by left clicking and holding it to move it over.<br>
<br>
Another option to assist is to target the person you are assisting and just type &quot;/assist&quot;.  This will target what ever the person you had targeted is targeting.<br>
<br>
It is also a good idea to set auto attacking when assisiting off.  This way you can assist the Main assist to find out what target they are attacking without automatically swinging your weapons.  Type<br>
<br>
/assist off<br>
<br>
If the person you wish to assist is not in your group the best way to target that person is to type &quot;/target &lt;nameofperson&gt;&quot;<br>
<br>
example: /target Wingedit<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pulling is a breeze right?  You go in wack a mob, and run back to the group.  Sounds very simply.  But a lot is taken for granted.<br>
<br>
As a puller you should never switch targets.  If you wack mob A, when you get back to your party make sure you are attacking Mob A.  Don't ever let it leave your target box.<br>
<br>
If multiply mobs come and Mob B, and Mob C show up to the camp before Mob A as a tank you should always wait for Mob A.<br>
<br>
Why not just attack what shows up?  Because it screws up everyones assisting.  When the Main assist switchs targets after someone has already assisted them it is a nightmare for whomever is doing crowd control.  You have party members attacking different mobs.<br>
<br>
United a group stands, divided they fall easily.  The only time a MA (main assist) should switch mobs is when there is something that cannot be controled by whomever is doing crowd control. ( Enchanter mezzing, Bard mezzing, necro mezzing, or if it's just someone rooting)<br>
<br>
If you are in a group with an enchanter, and they get a mez or 2 resisted and get beat down a little... SO WHAT.  It is the clerics job to heal the enc, and usually gain agro from healing to give the enchanter a breath to mez.  It is also the enchanters job to be prepared for this.  Enchanters should not depend on their channeling skill when getting attacked.  Why do you think they have color stuns.  IF they don't use em, let em die.<br>
<br>
A tank should never consider switching mobs because a caster or cleric is taking damage in a fight when grouped with an enchanter, UNLESS the enchanter says so because the mob is too high to mez.  It is the job of the enchater to mez mobs on clerics and casters first, and the job of the healer to keep the chanter alive and other casters to root mobs if necessary.  Tanks plays no roll in this normally.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Raiding is the most difficult of all.  Having 30+ people all doing their jobs effectly with no one screwing up is a rare thing for the general population on any server.<br>
<br>
If you follow what I said in assisting most of the troublesom areas are covered.  Here are some other basic things to remember.<br>
<br>
Do not Sit Down when a pull is in progress.  Most places like the planes the mobs run right pass the takes to the casters when incoming.  This is especially relvenant in plane of fear.<br>
<br>
Watch for the Incomming messge, stand for about 3-5 seconds while the tanks and enchanters do their jobs then sit.<br>
<br>
Avoid area of effect spells always.  As enchanters I recommend using level 4 and lvl 20 color stuns.  The raduis, mana, and casting time on higher level color stuns ain't worth it anyhow. ( But that's a diff topic)<br>
<br>
If you are a caster and feel the need to BURN on a raid, DO NOT do it from the back of the group.  Go up next to the mob among the tanks so that if you get hit 15+ tanks don't end up looking around for a mob.<br>
<br>
Always give the tagger on a raid ROOM TO TAG.  Don't stand in front of them, or even next to them.  Stay well back until mobs are ready to be engaged.<br>
<br>
The rest is my own personal opinions on how to handle mobs on raids.  I have seen a lot of different methods that I do not agree with personally.  So please read with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
When mobs are mezzed on a raid I think that all Warriors should be taunting the MA's next mob before breaking mez ( Make sure you have  /assist off set before hitting the assist key) and as soon as the Main Assist breaks the mez all tanks should attack.<br>
<br>
I have noticed on Dranil that on raids the MA is required to acquire taunt then hit a message that says attack now.  This is a load of horseshit in my mind, and dranil is the only place i have ever seen this done.<br>
<br>
Maybe this came about because people were assisting the MA and did not have /assist off set and were breaking the mezzes.   So this waiting period was put in.  Doing it this way is flawed for normal raiding conditions.<br>
<br>
If the Main Assist is the only one taunting on the break of a mez often times it will be the enchanter/shaman/clerics that get the first few wacks.<br>
<br>
All warriors should be taunting, so the mob has a better chance of staying where it is.  Normally the Main Assist is the highest level and has the best gear anyhow, so he will get the agro in the long run.  Situtations like this is not about having 1 person to heal.  There is usually a cleric in every group, and usually all but group 1 never have an issue with mana.  So what if another tank gets hit or tanks a mob entirly for a whole round.  Better him/her then a caster/shaman/cleric, and you see less mobs running all over the place.<br>
<br>
I am getting tired of typing now, this post has already taken me 10 mins  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I'll move on to argo control.<br>
<br>
<br>
Argo control is about the hardest for most people to learn imo.  I won't say much on it except the basics.<br>
<br>
If you are in a group with a warrior of equal level and equipment as a ranger/Sk/Pallie/monk...ect.  Let the warrior take the argo.  They have the best AC/HPs.  There is no need for halfbreads to unload mana at the beginning of a fight.<br>
<br>
I am sure some will argo ( well not rangers ) that they can tank as well as a warrior as a pallie/Sk, but really... learn the class's before you get head strong on how well you can tank.<br>
<br>
A CH on a warrior is more mana efficent then on any other class.  Remember the fact that I mentioned people are equally equipped and level wise.<br>
<br>
Monks/rogues/rangers using procing weapons should be taken in the back alley and feed to a dragon.  You are classified as Mana sinks, and any smart cleric should ask you to change weapons.<br>
<br>
Sure Monks have FD, rangers Jolt, and rogues evade.  On a normal mob it's usually not an issue.  When a tuff named pops you 3 classes get your asses handed to you so fast that it can effect the outcome due to the wasted mana used trying to keep you alive.  FD does not always work ( &quot;you have fallen to the ground&quot;) Jolt is iffy at times, and evade is not as effective as it once was.<br>
<br>
Taunt is based on a points system, the person with the most points has the argo.  Evade used to bring a rogues points down to Zero, but has been changed now and only lowers a rogues taunt points for each syccessful attempt.  Jolt works the same way.  FD does not lower your points as far as I know, but gives the MA a few seconds to built more points before you get up. ( not much damage being done on your backside on the floor either)<br>
<br>
So please think about what weapons you are using for grouping and how your taunt points will add up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a caster/Druid learn your spells well.  A druid on snare duty should not snare mobs at the beginning of a fight.  Wait till a mob is 50 percent, or snare mobs that have already been mezzed or are attacking an enchanter that had a mez resisted.  A caster nuking should applie the same rules.  Nuking when a mob is full health should get you a seat in the ally.<br>
<br>
Clerics should stick to celestial healing type spells to keep tanks alive until all mobs are under control.  CHing a tank just making it back from pulling 5-6 mobs and nothing has been mezzed will definatly lighten up your day.<br>
<br>
Enchanters should never make their first spell on a pull a color stun for all the mobs. ( unless the tank is almost dead, then hopefully you have AE mez memmed instead )  Should always target a mob and mez, if resisted move a few feet away from the pack of mobs, Color stun it, and attempt it again.<br>
<br>
I am not gonna run through every class, and sceniro.  I just wanted to state some basic stuff that will keep people alive in normal circumstances.  Methods always change depending on the enviroment you are in.  In no way does this apply for killing all mobs in eq.<br>
<br>
To some thing up...<br>
<br>
-Make an assist key &quot;/assist whoever&quot;<br>
<br>
-Puller never change targets, if you do, tell your group.<br>
<br>
-When raiding, just make sure you have a leader with a clue  :P<br>
<br>
-Argo control is the most important thing you'll ever learn to make eq a more enjoyable game with less stress.  Don't get hit unless you are suppose to.<br>
<br>
I never tryed to degrade any classes here, and if I did I am sorry.  Every class has it's functions when played correctly imo.  If you took the time to read of of this I salut you, may your gaming experiece be a good one.<br>
<br>
If you have a thick skull and feel all this is too much trouble to apply... please avoid me at all costs.  I am not wanting to waste my eq time with you  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Please read!</span><hr size=1> Nice post, but a couple of things I wouldn't agree with.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As a puller you should never switch targets. If you wack mob A, when you get back to your party make sure you are attacking Mob A. Don't ever let it leave your target box.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not true.  There are some cases where a puller does need to change their target, depending on what kinds of mobs are following, how many, and how fast.  You shouldn't be assisting the puller, you should be assisting the main tank anyway.  Especially for someone like me, who will break spawns intentionally sometimes using darkness to slow one down, then aggroing another/more.  It's more efficient in certain situations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
If multiply mobs come and Mob B, and Mob C show up to the camp before Mob A as a tank you should always wait for Mob A.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What logic are you using here?  Again, you should be assisting the MA and he should be picking the group target, so what difference does it make?  The object is usually to take them down as quick and efficiently as possible yes? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I for one am not going to stand and let 2 mobs beat on me or just stand twidling my thumbs while they are mezzed, because the mob A. is taking his sweet ass time or has been snared/etc.<br>
<br>
And I totally agree with Sarella.  MA being given sufficient time to gain aggro can make or break a raid sometimes.  Drinal is NOT the only to server to do this and any server that isn't, should be.<br>

<br>
9 times out of 10 when pulling for a group, you won't need to change targets when bringing in multiple mobs.  There are times, however, when you will need to.  This is where experience and knowing the mobs come into play (on deciding which one to kill first).<br>
<br>
In exp camps where it's not always clear that you have a mob incoming (i.e., camp is in a small room with a small field of view), it's useful to have an &quot;incoming&quot; hotkey.  Nothing fancy, just a note to let the group know you have something coming.  I think mine's set up as &quot;/g inc %t&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Between aggroing the mob and pressing the &quot;inc&quot; hotkey, the puller should have enough time to decide which mob he wants the group to kill first.  Usually I'll aggro the mobs, then press inc hotkey when I'm almost to camp, giving the group enough time to stand/pray/prepare/etc, and giving myself enough time to decide on whether or not I made a good choice of my target. <br>
<br>
If for some reason that I switch mobs after hitting &quot;inc&quot;, then I'll hit it again so the group knows to reassist. <br>
<br>
However, it's uncommon to have to change targets after aggroing a mob.  Usually you'll have time to select the target you want before you aggro him and his nearby buddies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note for SK's:  SK's are by and large the best aggro-gaining and controlling class.  Where a warrior would have to taunt 2-3 times to ensure aggro on a mezzed mob, you need only cast DC and the mob will never look at the enchanter twice.  This saves a lot of time, especially in situations where it's critical to kill mobs as quickly as possible.  Add in a quick taunt before you cast and you can be rest assured that the mob is on you for the duration of the fight.  This can be a double-edged sword, however.  Most SK's don't have the HP/AC of the average warrior, which means it's more efficient to heal the warrior.  Therefore, the problem is how to transfer aggro to him.  The solution is easy...when the warrior has had enough time to taunt 2 or 3 times after you've broken mez, you simply FD, wait ~3 rounds of combat, then get up. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note, I've found that in lvl 50+ exp groups, lvl 57-60 SK's and Paladins are good as tanks for mobs that hit up to 275 pts of dmg.  Up to this point, clerics worth their salt can keep them healed and still keep up with the mana regen.  Of course, the margin for error becomes smaller and smaller the closer you get to this number.  Basically when you're fighting mobs this tough, you better hope nobody screws up (although this makes the camp entertaining, imo)  I myself am comfortable tanking in exp camps where the mobs hit up to about 240, with occassional higher-level named mobs available that hit a bit harder.  This covers all of the decent high-level exp camps, so there isn't as much of a problem with hybrids being main tanks as there used to be. <br>

You took it in context as if you are the Tagger it seems.  I am refering mostly to normal group situations.<br>
<br>
I am directing this post towards pre lvl 55 players for the general population on a server also.  These are just basics.  Different enviroments in the high level game have a few different strats.<br>
<br>
In regards to the person that disagreed with me and thinks a MA should gain the agro... it sounded like a oxymoron.  When breaking a mez the point is that tanks have the argo, and casters/shamans/clerics don't get hit.<br>
<br>
If the MA is the only one taunting and breaks the Mez but failed on taunts you see a silly tank running around trying to find a mob that is wacking your clerics, shaman/enchanter trying to get agro.  Increase your chance of Tank argo on Mez breaks, decrease you chance of caster wacking... it's simple logic.<br>
<br>
Every guild leader in smaller and up coming guilds should discuss these 4 points I have made with their guilds imo.  If you see someone doing something wrong ask them if they need advice in a polite way.  Something simple like learning to assist makes for a better gaming experience for all.  The lower the level the you learn it, chances are the higher level you will get in a shorter period of time.<br>

<br>
1.  Put your whole group on ignore...if people send you tells about why you aren't speaking to your group....tell them its against your religion, or you have a cat or something and then tell them welcome to my ignore list!!<br>
<br>
2. always assist F8, if you have to ask who assist is....its F8<br>
<br>
3.  if you ask for buffs in guild chat...yer in deep shit..literally as they will shove yer gnome whiney face up Rullans ass as retribution.  Good tip: always ask in /tell example /tell kilamyan &quot;may I have super clarity pleez sir?&quot; Thats allways good!!  even better yet...discribe the buff to the person as &quot;you know...that buff that is sooo ubar! come on man I need it&quot;  Ask for charisma buffs also....raid chanters love handin out charisma buffs.<br>
<br>
4. To keep up raid spirit...do fun inspiring messages like Do you want victory!! I for example like doing my little /em pops a bottle of champagne and squirts it all over his tits.  This is key to the win!<br>
<br>
5.  Continue to ask for TLs or DMF even when the person is a Pally or a druid.  It builds a tight bond with that guildmember.  Example: Solarflare, give me brells.  /solarflare What? you fuker im a warrior I duel wield you dipshit&quot; /to solarflare OMG yer a warrior? lets /cyber!! /to skarl Im dueling you you dumbass /skarl aww cool, yer asking me out on a date...ill bring the champagne and condoms!!  This builds quite a tight bond with your guildmates.<br>
<br>
6. For all you mages, this is vital! if you see another mage in the raid with his pet up...make a big deal of saying &quot; OH COOL, pets are up&quot; then make a pet...go afk for 20 minutes to masturbate or pick your nose. When you come back announce that people should be applauding the ubar Gobober pseudo monk pull.  Next, watch TV for an hour while the whole raid ignores rezzing you.<br>
<br>
7. When CoHing...whenever leaving groups to join with wizards, when you want back in your original group.../tell group leader LET ME IN YOU BIZZZATCH!! Once back in the group DEMAND that everyone say welcome back! or WB at least! <br>
<br>
8.  when handling lottos..spam in guild chat /gu I WANT IT ALL YOU SUKKAS!!<br>
<br>
I hope this helps!  If you do this you can't go wrong in <br>
successful raiding<br>
