His innabilty to admit to an embarrasing truth was almost his undoing.  Was it perjury?  IANAL, so I can't really say.  Shamefull though.  He deserved to have his law license pulled  regardless of the actions of the VRWC.<br>
<br>
He had an amazing run though.  The beginning of his presidency was a complete disaster with the health care and gays in the military debaucles.  He came back and had an amazing approval rating.  The ML/impeachment thing almost sunk him again, and he came back from that as well.  He even sent Newt packing in the process.  His ability to coopt the agenda of the GOP and make it his own was legendary.<br>
<br>
So I can't defend him.  I wonder what he could have been if he didn't have his character flaws. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 779<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 1:19:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> Ah well that's the beauty of the guy; he wouldn't have gotten where he was without his character flaws <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I include that craven wife of his as a character flaw...<br>

<br>
Murderers do deserve death but our legal system is too shitty to have that responsibility (which is sad considering it's one of the better the world has to offer)<br>
<br>
Clinton did committ perjury.  He is a liar, probably a theif, and a weasel.  While I can't say I like him I hold more respect for clinton than I do bush.  At least Bill had to put effort foward to become president, it wasn't handed to him on a silver platter.<br>
<br>
Affirmative action is reverse discrimination.  I actually agree.  I don't think it's fair to deny me an opportunity because I am a white male, just as I think it's not fair to deny an african american simply because they were born with darker skin.  Unfortunately we are paying for the stupid shit past generations pulled.<br>
<br>
The Bible forbids abortion.  I am sure it does but who cares.  You're allowed to think for yourself.<br>
<br>
Say what you want about stuff on that page but this myth is as true as ever.<br>
<br>
Humans are not causing global warming.  Humans ARE causing global warming at an alarming rate.  Good old scientific fact is there to back it up.<br>
<br>
Humans are not causing ozone depletion.  Humans already did cause ozone depletion, a big fucking hole.  Fortunately CFCs have been banned, it will probably continue to deteriorate for a few years and then stop. Probably by the year 2050 the hole will have repaired itself.  Of course until then, skin cancer rates will increase heavily, going to get worse short term.  Going to take half a century to repair what we did, cannot deny that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usterman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sterman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 1:31:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> Well, as a liberal, let me offer some token resistance.  =)<br>
<br>
We currently recognize the government's right to take away part of our income in the form of taxes or condemn a house that's about to fall apart.  It does these things because it feels it is in the general public's best interest to do so (our taxes pay for many useful things like fire trucks and paved roads; the house needs to come down before it falls on someone's head and kills them.)  The article is just saying that the government could, if it wanted to, decide to confiscate all our bicycle pumps if it decided that was in the nation's best interest and feel justified in doing so.  I, for one, am glad that I live in a nation that gives us unparalleled rights to do whatever the heck we feel like doing with our property.  And I don't see the government becoming too autocratic any time soon; there are too many forces in place to prevent that from happening.  Heck, we have a hard time getting permission to place a phone tap on suspected terrorists; how likely is it that the government's gonna start taking away your copy of Quake III anytime soon?<br>
<br>
As for Clinton:  he was a good President.  He handled tricky foreign and domestic issues quite well and led the country to some prosperous times.  As a human being, he's absolute scum and he deserved to be disbarred.  I was relieved when his Presidency ended because although I applauded his political beliefs and the way he was running the country, I despised the man utterly.  It's like having Hannibal Lecter cook you an excellent vegetarian dinner.<br>

<br>
Well, some of us don't recognize the gov's right to take away part of our income as taxes -- but be that as it may, levying taxes is not the same as owning your property; some would argue that it's just the price of government doing business, a very different thing.<br>
<br>
As for condemnation, of course the government can do that either because a property owner doesn't care for their property to the detriment of others (same thing with pollution leaking out of my property onto yours), or because there is a compelling state interest (ie we have to build a freeway bypass through your lot) but, since we recognize that the government DOESNT own your property, if it is &quot;taken&quot;, it must be compensated. The fact that we compensate (to a greater or lesser) degree people who's property is taken is evidence that the property doesn't belong to the government.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are many takings that are not compensated; the War on the West is a whole litany of such crimes against the people by Washington -- but that's a whole nother thread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulluweyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lluweyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 1:47:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> Dirra, I find it amazing that you are against income taxes since they are in fact a conspiracy created by accountants to create full employment for you ilk.<br>

The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is fucking joke.  Might as well legalize them and tax the shit of them.  The equality vs. merit is a load of shit.  Sounds way too much like socialism (which he goes to great effort to distinguish it from).  But if you notice, a lot of the crap he's spewing sounds like &quot;use common sense&quot; or &quot;it's a matter of personal opinion.&quot;  Either that or it's stuff that everybody believes (race, feminism, crime) or offers no distinct difference in beliefs than conservatives.

If a white person is more qualified than another person he should get the job period. Race shouldn't be an issue.

Maryln was actually a size 12 and compared to the size 0 we idolize today she would be called fat just like Monica Lewinski( they were actually probably the same size ). <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 782<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 4:13:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> Arrora, tell you what -- she may have been a size 12 sometimes but damn that woman was no size 12 in a couple of her movies ... hubba hubba... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

While I don't agree with it, to a certain degree I think affirmative action is a necessary evil.  It forces those so blinded by their bigotry to hire others and hopefully realize that a person's job performance has no relation to anything except their ability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 784<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 4:43:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry, who gave you the power to tell me as a business person that I have to hire someone who is less qualified for the job merely because they were lucky enough to be one of the protected classes?<br>
<br>
And in government -- it makes SO much sense to hire the less qualified to spend our hard earned tax money -- it's just stupid.<br>
<br>
But it does make self-loathing middle class white liberals feel better about themselves.<br>
<br>
A better solution is to provide the opportunities to get people trained and educated and off crack -- so that they will be qualified for the jobs that are now going to them through the luck of the draw.<br>

Boy it sure would be great if we could all live in Dirra's imaginary little utopia.  I didn't say the system worked unequivocably.  In fact, it really only works if the person hiring is a bigot.  In that scenario I think it's a good thing to make the bastard hire someone they normally wouldn't.  Hop on out of Wonderland and join us here in the real world.  Your solutions include social revolutions that, while very admirable and excellent goals to shoot for, are not gonna happen overnight.  Sometimes these revolutions need &quot;kick starts&quot; and that's what I believe affirmative action to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 785<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 6:54:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So incredibly full of shit I can't even begin...</span><hr size=1> No, I just posted that randomly lol.

Anyhow.<br>
<br>
<br>
I see nothing inconsistant with enjoying DK and being a conservative; just cuz Jello is a flaming commie doesn't mean he can't make fun music; such lighthearted hits as _Holiday_In_Cambodia_ actually lambast the kind of self-hating middle class white socialist idiots that I deplore. See also Oingo Boingo, _Capitalism_ for more fun New Wave liberal bashing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
