if 4-5 people = merger, sure I guess. Could be that all their apps were aproved at the same time. But like I give a flying fuck about anyone outside of the guild ^_^.<br>
<br>
CiH was not a merger of guilds to start out from either, it was The Proven who added....ALOT of non-guilded people that everyone knew really well. If you don't like it, you may suck my cock.<br>
<br>
please don't cry while I'm in VP this weekend while you're in Kanor's picking your ass either, thanks.<br>

i wish qalar would just grow up, i might be still playing if he had, but even after im gone he still acts like he is 2, this is the problem with everquest, there is a good core of people in cats in hats, good people in real life and in game, and the people who think they gain the most from the guild are the people who use the guild to put themself on a pedastal and look down at people, this is the mistake i made with divine destiny and it eventually took a fall, its a shame people like qalar are going to be the cause of one of the greater guilds in everquest to fall, and for the general bullshit the other good people who are not in cats in hats are going to have to deal with on the drinal server, cats in hats has alot of nice people but the people who call the shots are the stupidest mother fuckers your ever going to meet and are going to continue to stomp on people no in cats in hats, cats in hats has become worse then anything for the game, i mean, one of the guild leaders coming on the board and taunting the server because of the accomplishments of the guild he is a part of ? come fucking on .. he didn't do anything for the guild other then be at the right place at the right time with the right lie to type.. maybe i should stop reading the everquest forums because i dont play .. but i do and i'll continue to post whats on my mind if i feel like it.. and i'd like to apologize for the people in cats in hats who are good people but are a part of cats in hats that dont approve of what the guild does sometimes, few and far inbetween although.. <br>
<br>
..do yourself a favor, quit the game.. you dont enjoy playing everquest..<br>
<br>
&quot;But like I give a flying fuck about anyone outside of the guild ^_^.&quot; -qalar<br>

CiH is better then ever....where are you?  *nods*<br>
<br>
Cats in Hats has got nothing but better without you.  Lord knows, we don't need our wizards killing themselves on raids(har har).<br>
<br>
You see, if you're not in Cats in Hats, I really don't care about you, honestly.  You can take it however you like, but its the truth and I'm not going to lie.  I would do anything for Cats in Hats members, because inturn it makes my fun in this game, that much better, let alone almost all people in CiH are really fun people to be around...unlike what you were.  If you think I use Cats in Hats how personal gain, all you have to do is take one look at my equipment.  I got an eleet jumpy robe, and Roycal's Channeling crystal...sweet huh?  Lets see what else I have...oh yeah, my Collar of Undead protection...damn, thats so sweet, I only get stuff for myself, gosh!<br>
<br>
Emrok, I know it sucks to not be me.  You have to troll the message boards of a game you once played, looking for something about me to pull me down to your level.  Must really suck to be you Emrok, heh.<br>
<br>
I think of the most fun times in EQ was seeing Emrok kicked out of the guild, and actually kicking Carlon out.  Felt really great to lose people who don't give a shit about what happens to anyone but themselves.  I just love not hearing your comments after we died to Trak in the begining; or any other mob we happened to die on.<br>
<br>
Boy do I want to quit this game Emrok, more then ever, but not because of the people, but because of Verant.  However, I will play where my on-line friends play, whether I enjoy the game or not, because it is them who make it fun. <br>
<br>
<br>
So there you have it.  If you're not in CiH, I personally don't give a crap about you(very few exceptions), and thats the way it is.<br>
<br>

Its really nice that they are gone, our guildchat is actually nice to listen to most of the time, and there is no bitching about loot and who it should go to anymore, etc. ...its really nice.<br>
<br>
Besides this recent nerf, everyone in CiH is actually enjoying the game now.  All the whiny bitches are gone, and we don't have to hear about how PoG is unfair to those with Kunark armor, nor do we have to hear about people's rude comments after losing to a new mob, nor having our guildleader threaten us with disbanding the guild.  We are quite well off now, because we don't have to deal with these people up above.  We can finally concentrate on killing new mobs, rather then arguing.<br>
<br>
Renkey:  I'm not an officer, and I STILL do not have my VP key finish.  I just have to turn in a BS and ruby to Niblek.  <br>
<br>
Herbal:  thanks so much for the immediate warning before taking back your web space, you're a real class act.  Speaking of lies, why is it that so many people left the guild because you are a horrible leader?  Would you like some names of people who hated you as leader?  Before you lead a guild, you need to not solo your way to level 60, and think you know so much about that game.  Radigan giving you leadership of the guild, a guild full of people who worked so hard for what it has become, was one of the worst things that ever happened to CiH.<br>
<br>
Synide:  The people who left the guild are people who either think that precious items are all that matter in the game, or they don't want to help the guild when they are needed most.  It was best that leave CiH.<br>
<br>
Emrok:  there is no Veeshan in game.  Sleeper's Tomb is not the hardest zone in the game.  We have our first Sleeper's Tomb key already, and will get more with time.<br>
<br>
Kiemo:  I'm sorry you don't enjoy playing this game.  Veeshan's Peak is one of the funnest zones in the game.  I could really care less if you have no desire to go to Veeshan's peak.  I will, and will have fun doing so, and could care less what people think.  <br>
<br>
The above people can sit back and watch us have our fun in VP and SoV.  I hope you make some great deals in North Freeport.
