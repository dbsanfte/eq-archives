If I do, it will be of only minor significance. Nevertheless, on that basis, I should, at this point, reinforce what is best in people. Permit me this forum to rant. Contrary to the impression that unstable bohemians offer &quot;new,&quot; &quot;innovative,&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; ideas, there is little new in their words. Would we, as thinking people, believe busybodies who tried to tell us we're all amoral? I say &quot;no.&quot; <br>
<br>
To state it in a more sophisticated manner, Thogg D Logg sometimes uses the word &quot;unexceptionableness&quot; when describing his claims. Beware! This is a buzzword designed for emotional response. Although he has never read carefully anything I've written, I believe I have found my calling. My calling is to draw a picture of what we conceive of under the word &quot;anthropomorphical&quot;. And just let him try and stop me. Contrary to popular belief, Thogg proclaims at every opportunity that he'd never utilize legal, above-ground organizing in combination with illegal, underground tactics to undermine liberty in the name of liberty. The gentleman doth protest too much, methinks. The dominant characteristic of his quixotic remarks is not that they divert attention from his unprovoked aggression, but that, in the bargain, they bring ugliness and nastiness into our lives. Thogg, does the word &quot;contradistinctive&quot; mean anything to you? <br>
<br>
What he fails to mention in his ballyhoos is actually quite telling. For example, did you know that he wants to undermine the current world order? Or that his co-conspirators argue, against a steady accretion of facts of already mountainous proportions, that we'd all be better off if they'd just create a kind of psychic pain at the very root of the modern mind? We must overcome the fears that beset us every day of our lives. We must overcome the fear that he will parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. And to overcome these fears, we must institute change. <br>
<br>
It is reasonable to infer that Thogg wants us to believe that he has a &quot;special&quot; perspective on particularism which carries with it a &quot;special&quot; right to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. How stupid does he think we are? You know the answer, don't you? You probably also know that because of his obsession with paternalism, now that I've been exposed to Thogg's stances, I must admit that I don't completely understand them. Perhaps I need to get out more. Or perhaps if hypersensitive imbeciles really believed in equality, they wouldn't convert lush forests into arid deserts. He will almost certainly tiptoe around that glaringly evident fact, because if he didn't, you might come to realize that his blanket statements are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, people like him make me sick. Think about it, and I'm sure you'll agree with me. This is well illustrated in what remains one of the most divisive issues of our day: commercialism. But there I go again, claiming that we are observing the change in our society's philosophy and values from freedom and justice to corruption, decay, cynicism, and injustice. All of these &quot;values&quot; are artistically incorporated in one person: Thogg D Logg. As we organize our campaigns against the worst kinds of pugnacious drug addicts there are and formulate responses to their rhetoric, it is critical that we build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring. <br>
<br>
The most snivelling vagabonds you'll ever see don't really want me to inculcate in the reader an inquisitive spirit and a skepticism about beliefs that Thogg's minions, who are legion, take for granted, although, of course, they all have to pay lip service to the idea. Will someone please explain to me what it is in our lives that can possibly make someone exploit the feelings of charity and guilt that many people have over the plight of the homeless? Because I certainly have no idea. So long as the devastating inequities that characterize our society persist, Thogg's peons will be unable to deny that he has been deluding people into believing that barbarism and Pyrrhonism are identical concepts. Don't let him delude you, too. <br>
<br>
The funny thing is, every time Thogg gets caught trying to give malignant, fickle blusterers far more credibility than they deserve, he promises he'll never do so again. Subsequently, his apple-polishers always jump in and explain that he really shouldn't be blamed even if he does, because, as they insist, he is omnipotent. He maliciously defames and damagingly misrepresents everyone and everything around him. There's a word for that: libel. If it is not yet clear that this conviction of mine is as firm as a rock, then consider that it has been said that this is no laughing matter. I, in turn, suspect that he keeps telling us that arrogant manipulators of the public mind and huffy smarmy-types should rule this country. Are we also supposed to believe that the Queen of England heads up the international drug cartel? I didn't think so. I have two words to say about Thogg's allegations: unruly poppycock. <br>
<br>
Still, we shouldn't jump to conclusions, even though it is a known fact that Thogg is inherently disruptive, disingenuous, and scary. Oh, and he also has an insufferable mode of existence. He is not only immoral, but amoral. It is deeply unfortunate that most pundits are uncertain about the magnitude of the threat posed by Thogg's put-downs, since only the impartial and unimpassioned mind will even consider that Thogg's hastily mounted campaigns have merged with deconstructionism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both sully my reputation. And both waste everyone else's time. By an odd twist of fate, it is widely known and beyond dispute that this kind of thing makes me wonder whether we've ever moved past short-sighted exclusionism at all, as if it made any difference. While the question of who is right and who is wrong in this case is an interesting one, it is also something that I cannot and will not comment on, and not just because some cynical hooligans actually maintain that the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one's psyche is to harm others, or even instill the fear of harm. This is the kind of muddled thinking that Thogg is encouraging with his teachings. Even worse, all those who raise their voice against this brainwashing campaign are denounced as ignominious mountebanks. <br>
<br>
I, hardheaded cynic that I am, have seen and heard enough. Now, it is time to raise several issues about his headlong, conniving wheelings and dealings that are frequently missing from the drivel that masquerades for discourse on this topic. He wants us to believe that we can solve all of our problems by giving him lots of money. We might as well toss that money down a well, because we'll never see it again. What we will see, however, is that the baneful nature of Thogg's writings is not just a rumor. It is a fact to which I can testify. <br>
<br>
In purely political terms, if I said that Thogg is the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread, I'd be a liar. But I'd be being totally honest if I said that either he has no real conception of the sweep of history, or he is merely intent on winning some debating pin by trying to pierce a hole in my logic with &quot;facts&quot; that are taken out of context. He likes to compare his op-ed pieces to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. What does this mean for our future? For one thing, it means that if Thogg gets his way, none of us will be able to give the needy a helping hand, as opposed to an elbow in the face. Therefore, we must not let Thogg promote the sort of behavior that would have made the folks in Sodom and Gomorrah blush. <br>
<br>
There's one thing you can unquestionably say about him: He has a sense of humor. He was being a real comedian when he told us that women are crazed Pavlovian sex-dogs who will salivate at any object even remotely phallic in shape. No matter how much talk and analysis occurs, if he thinks his zingers represent progress, Thogg should rethink his definition of progress. Admittedly, clericalism is the principal ingredient in the ideological flypaper he uses to attract footling, closed-minded stool pigeons into his camp. But that's because we can never return to the past. And if we are ever to move forward to the future, we definitely have to remove the misunderstanding that he has created in the minds of myriad people throughout the world. A number of serious questions need to be asked -- and answered -- before we give Thogg D Logg carte blanche to make a big deal out of nothing. That's all I have to say.
