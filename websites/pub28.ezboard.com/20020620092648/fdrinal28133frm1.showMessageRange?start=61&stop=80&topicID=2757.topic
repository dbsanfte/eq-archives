No amount of howling on these boards is gonna change a thing, one way or the other.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, GM's have to handle another /petition almost every time a Kunark Dragon is killed, because an MB group ports in and blasts the dragon while someone else is nearing the ability to attack it by more conventional means, you can bet yer butt that the Dev team WILL hear about it, and a nerf is FAR more likely when we make their jobs more difficult.<br>
<br>
And people ARE gonna /petition. While some of you may find those Kunie Lizards trivial, the loot isn't. Priced a copy of Malo lately? Or a CoF? Neither is the reward of actually killing one of these guys once in a while. Neither are all the Quest pieces. Oh yeah, folks will /petition.<br>
<br>
And why would an MB team do this, if it's so trivial? Why do high-levels farm green MOB's anywhere? 'Cause they can, and 'cause it's easy money. On one Dragon kill, a 6-man team can split as well over 100K plat for a few minutes work (and with ports and MB a few minutes is all it takes). Contrary to popular opinion, there ARE some greedy folks in this game, and almost ALL of us are attracted to an opportunity for an easy XP kill with a large payday attached.<br>
<br>
So here's my guess: If Wizzies DO make MB'ing Kunark Dragons as regular an activity as they COULD, a nerf will likely find it's way into the game. If not, the Dev team will probably never hear about it, and neither will Wizzies once the memories of specific incidents fade.<br>

Aye, there are greedy people in the game, but in my time I've only met 2 maybe 3 greedy high level wizards.  It is in my experience and in the experience of a lot of wizards that the difficulty to get a level 60 wizard and the responsibilities that come with it weeds out the loot-whores and the d00ds after the over a year trek just to get 60.<br>

<br>
Heh, I guess you don't know who has killed all of the kunark outdoor dragons the last 3 or 4 spawns eh? Heck, even some of the dragons inside VP from what I understand. How many times of them doing it does it take before it officially becomes monopolizing of these spawns? And I can guarantee you that when they do it, they aren't letting anyone there loot it besides themselves. They are being farmed for high level items, period. On this server a CoF or RBB sells for 60-100k. Green scale sells for 100k or more. Get lucky and get a copy of sunstrike or torpor and you have just got yourself another 100k on this server. When you have 6 people that are all on at the same time that can make 150k or more from a single kill that takes less than 5 minutes to do and takes no risk, you don't think that will become common? If a wizard has manabutn, and sees those mobs up, all they have to do is give a call to the other ones that have manaburn. Those guys dont have to look for a ride since all of them can just gate themselves there. Go stand near your friend the dragon that doesn't attack you because you have good faction. Press manaburn at roughly the same time. Dead dragon, collect yout 150k+. Yeah, if I was able to collect items like that for no risk, I certainly wouldn't do it either. You are right, if i were able to kill for a CoF with no risk every time it was available, I wouldn't do it. nope.  give us a break. 6 wizards without manaburn arent going to kill one of these mobs with no risk. 10 wizards without manaburn wont kill these mobs with no risk. 10 of any class without manaburn wont be able to kill these mobs with no risk. the only class that can kill these mobs with no risk with 5 people is the wizard, and only because of manaburn. anything else you people are talking about doesn't apply. <br>

<br>
Personally, I don't see ANY problem with wizards being able to manaburn dragons into the ground.  Good for them!<br>
<br>
After all, manaburn isn't exactly a trivial ability to obtain, is it?<br>
<br>
And if single groups of wizards are ks'ing dragons from guilds, my advice to the guilds in question would be to start showing your wizards some love. A lot of wizards have been snubbed in the past for &quot;not being useful in groups&quot;...get them levelling to 59 and working on their AA exp, so that they too can do this.  <br>
<br>
And to the wizards in question who ks'ed Gore: the dragons will be back up before you know it, you can kill them then. You all know the difficulty of getting together a raid, as opposed to a group (especially since there is a port to almost every place dragons roam).  Develop some honour and community spirit, and give other people a chance.<br>
<br>
For goodness sake, don't start screaming for nerfs based on one line of mobs; because when it comes, I'm betting a nerf on MB *wouldn't* be confined to just Kunark dragons. <br>
<br>
It would be across the board, and would mess up a great ability for a class that waited a long time to get it (for another prime example, see Enchanters and Dire Charm).<br>

<br>
Sylvann, you really put the 00 in dr00d.<br>
<br>
Go work on your own AA skills and stop calling for nerfs.  Manaburn making an encounter like Gore trivial is meaningless since, for any guild with 5 or 6 manaburning wizards, Gore was already fully trivial 6 months ago with 5 or 6 regular players.  I don't care if it takes the regular players a minute longer, trivial is trivial.<br>
<br>
In short, give a shot at thinking before you open your mouth.<br>

I know for a fact that the &quot;holy trinity&quot; all have plenty of room to complain. If you don't think being considered one of the most important classes for raiding in the end game doesn't come with its own form of hell, then put down the crack pipe and go back to your quad-kiting. I personally see room for improvement for pretty much every class in this game. I also think nerfing manaburn is one of the worst things VI could do...it made the game fun again for a class that traditionally has been a bitch and a pain in the ass to play and level up. I'll stop now before I go off on a rant-I don't want to fill up five pages with text. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udmitrythewizzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dmitry the Wizzy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/12/02 10:58:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2757.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webprofessor.org/avatar/liberty.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A CONSPIRACY</span><hr size=1> By the WAY!

Manaburn sucks really.  If anything it should be upgraded.  Upgraded you say? Hell yes! If it weren't for Kunark Dragons and Old world stuff like the Fear Golems or whatever, this AA skill is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> almost</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> completely useless.  With manaburn I can expect about 6 to 8k dmg if I don't crit...for ALL OF MY FREAKING MANA!<br>
<br>
Put that in perspective while killing an uber mob...with a full manabar I can do more than double that.  The only real benefit I have is mobs with half a million HP that I can manaburn right away and med to full cause i'd be waiting for aggro to build up anyways..... OMG 6k free damage on a 500khp mob yippie!<br>
<br>
You fucktards really think a bunch of manaburn wizards need loot from kunark dragons? you fucking kidding me? You do it for kicks, that's it...or maybe to score a spell or two that a buddy might need.  Kunark dragons are killed 99% of the time for spells only anyways, they aren't really uber mobs anymore...far far from it.<br>
<br>
Please dr00ds and whomever else get your heads out of your asses before you call nerf.  Kunark bosses are gimped by all classes already, wizards are no different.  What a waste of time this thread is. <p><html>

<br>
OK lets deal with this. The question you have yet to answer is why its any different if its 6 wizards, or 6 of varied group of classes. Where do you draw a line? What if those 5 wizards needed a tank to pull, would that then be ok? What if they needed a chanter to stun the mob for a bit, would that be ok? What if they needed a cleric to keep them healed a bit, would that be ok? Still just six people.<br>
<br>
The problem is you are confusing your argument. You clearly dont have a problem with 6 people of varied classes taking Gore down, if you did then you have not stated so. But you do have a problem with 6 wizards taking gore down. The key question that no one has answered, here is why? What is the big difference?<br>
<br>
Shaman are capable of soloing dragons, why arent you crying for nerf? That is the real question here. Everques has bigger problems then mana-burn, and yet you guys obssess over this one in paticular, and in a matter that is totally out of context. If we even accept that manaburn unbalances the game (something that I dont), we still cant escape the fact that there are several other examples of this outside of wizards. <br>
<br>
You guys want to isolate manaburn and argue about. Unfortuanately, this precludes you from looking at the big picture.<br>

&lt;and&gt;<br>
And for those that keep comparing them to exp groups or groups of normal makeup with the ability to kill stuff, that is something that is totally different. Those groups aren't going to be doing it with no risk involved. Manaburning these mobs, however, is No risk<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
OF FER GOD'S SAKE! Do you even know how a wizard fights? I will state again: EVERY WIZARD FIGHT IS LIKE THIS.  We do our damage fast, and either kill or be killed extremely quickly.<br>
<br>
No risk?  Rather subjective term. End Game Mobs? Also subjective. Just because YOU have a risk involved with killing something doesn't mean that EVERYONE has to.  If this is your basis for judgement I want every melee nerfed back to lvl 10 because they can farm out orc belts to give to their twinks to power level them, monopolizing  and trivializing these camps which are &quot;End game&quot; level bosses to some.  Bah.<br>
<br>
I went from level 34 to 35 without getting hit ONCE. Half that time i was soloing. Doesn't sound like i had any risk, better nerf my 34th lvl spells! they are too powerful!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I am pretty sure that if it was an ability that allowed 5 rogues to all just get near the dragon and press a hotkey simultaneously to instantly kill the dragon that these same discussions would be going on.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, it isn't. Rogues, melees, and for that matter most other classes do their damage over several rounds of combat. Wizards do theirs in very few. (I can drop most even mobs with 3-6 spells, solo. can any melle drop them in 3-6 rounds, solo?) Mana burn is an extension of that wizard's natural ability... but quicker, with less mana efficiency.<br>
<br>
If 5-6 mana burning wizards are constantly KS'ing dragons with this, why not try petitioning THOSE WIZARDS instead of calling for a nerf? THEY seem to be your problem, NOT MB.<br>
