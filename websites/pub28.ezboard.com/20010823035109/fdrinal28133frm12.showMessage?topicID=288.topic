YOU DO REALIZE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING</span><hr size=1> Give me a break here.  Why do you think ezboard has put this new community chest, etc thing up?   To make money.  Do you think they will get rich with it?  I don't, but even so, they aren't asking for much, and they even just lowered the prices.<br>
<br>
So why does everyone have to run out and get a program to basically make the community chest program useless?  <br>
<br>
If you morons keep doing that, then there will be NO message boards around.  <br>
<br>
I'd love to stay at home working on webpages all day long as my job, but i'm a geek.  The only problem is that there is no money in it.  Why?  Because everyone has to find away to get something for free.  No one clicks on banners anymore, let alone read them.  Or in other cases, have programs to turn them off, so they don't get seen anymore.  So now ads are useless.<br>
<br>
And what are people doing?  In the extreme cases, they are going to pay websites.  Asking for donations.  Some way for them to keep giving you services.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  I tried out one of these programs that disabled the pop ups, until i thought about it.  It's just not right to expect these message boards to be free.  And it's not like they are asking for a ton of money.<br>
<br>
So, all I really want to say here, is think about it.  Nothing in life is for free, and if it doesn't get paid for, it WILL eventually be gone.<br>
<br>
But i'm sure most people don't care.<br>
<br>

What the heck does that have to do with keeping these boards commercial free and running?   I mean, you do use this site right?  Just keep thinking that all is this is free and then look puzzled when you hit this site and it isn't there any more.   Take a picture and send it to me while your at it.  For free.  <br>
<br>
Many of these sites are only around because someone took considerable time and effort to put them together.  At the least you could not mock them when they ask for a modest donation to the cause.   Someone tell me where I am going wrong.  <br>

<br>
The thing is, and the reason most places are charging now, is that these sites cost money, and a fair amount of it to host.  The internet is not free.  That whole idea was a pipe dream born on a wave of Venture Capital.   Do you think these pages are hosted on someone's home PC taking all these hits over a 56k modem?  And even if it was, do you acknowledge that such a system cost money to set up and more money to keep running?  I never understood why people expect services to be free just because they were on the internet, like it was some giant information receptacle that magically appeared.    When in reality it is billions of dollars of hardware maintained by highly skilled(and highly paid) people on the backend, so lesser skilled(still highly paid) web designers create something on the front end for us drooling masses to enjoy.  <br>
<br>
And I got news for you.   Libraries charge fees too.  Unless a business takes in money, it won't be around for long.  As long as a site doesn't get too many hits any joe schmo can keep it going.  But when they reach a certain critical mass, like these, your upkeep cost go up drastically or the site comes down.    My 2cp.<br>

I also use a program that suppresses the ads but I still threw the flame board that is Drinal.com a buck.  A buck towards keeping this site ad free and running is worth it imo.  If nothing else for the sheer amusement that our server brings upon itself in the flames sections.<br>
<br>
In fact I would contribute another buck if we could get long winded ass Balrak to make sense for once with a nice simple short flame.  They are so long and t-t-t-t-t-tired that I no longer read them but just skim through.<br>

But seriously, back then it was crap compared today, now people are trying to make money at it, so you get quality.  You can still get the same free stuff you did then, but NOW you can pay for BETTER stuff.  That's the choice.  <br>

This is totally wrong. If you pay or not does not change a single bit for YOU in regards to EZboards if you use a FREEWARE program to stop the pop-ups!<br>
The question here is which choice is better for EZboards, not for you.<br>
Furthermore you said yourself that you CAN pay for EZboards. See, I do not have to, so why should I? Name 3 good reasons to pay. All you can find is one, and one reason is not sufficient in this case.<br>
Another thing you should keep in mind is, why EZboards got so popular. Wasn't it because it was for free? And now that they got a large bandwith of users they want us to pay for it. Kinda lame imo. There is another company that tried that, namely Nullsoft with their product winamp. First it was freeware, then shareware (or whatever) and after they found out that other companies' products got more and more popular and after they lost a lot of users they switched back to freeware. It does not work in our society and it won't work in the future. <p><center>

/rofl  <br>
<br>
Are you from a communist country?  You are saying everything should be free.  How absurd is that.  <br>
<br>
<br>
btw:  The large bandwidth isn't why they started charging.  It's because of the market of banners went down the tubes, and to stay open, they had to do something.   when they let you pay $15 for 6 months (This is for a WHOLE community)  This is $0.0016  for EACH user for this board.  MY GOD!  WHAT BASTARDS.<br>
<br>
WTF?!  When you go to work and the boss decides not to pay you, I'm sure you'll bitch and think he's wrong, which he would be.  That is what you are asking EzBoard to do.  Work for free.<br>
<br>
Give me a f#$(*%(^ break, please<br>
<br>
<br>
If you don't have the money, then fine, I understand that completely.  BELIEVE me, with a newborn here, I DON'T, so I eeked out what I had left in my paypal account for ezboard, cause I DO appreciate what they have done for the web community.<br>
<br>
<br>
btw: EQ  didn't charge people during BETA, so why are you paying them $10.00 a month? <p>_______________________<BR>

That assumption is wrong on your side. You have to ask it in a different way:<br>

How does a good example relate to communism? Where did I say that everything should be for free? I just showed you an example where a company tried the same as EZboards is trying now and I told you that it did not work.<br>
I never said that they should not try to earn some money but they should not expect that everyone pays for it as long as you can have it for free. I think it is up to me what I do with my money. If you want to pay 15 bucks, do it. I prefer to buy a new cd with it or invite my friends to a drink. Furthermore I pay 10 bucks per month to an organisation who helps to improve handicapped and retarded people's living which I think is way better spent money than to pay for EZboards. I won't discuss this further as I think it will only lead to personal accusations. You have your opinion, I have mine. <p><center>

a.  Ezboard never worked for free.  Someone else was just paying (banners/ads)<br>
<br>
b.  And if you are working for someone for free (someone else footing the bill) and then people stop footing the bill.  If you are doing a good job, and your product is worthy, I bet the people will still pay.<br>

Switch to what?  One of the crappy free boards?  I don't personally like that option.  I'd rather pay for the quality.<br>

I might have, depending on the quality.  I was very close to buying a UBB board, which is WAY more than 50 bucks.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  How does a good example relate to communism? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think it was a horrible example personally, but i didn't want to get personal.  Winamp has ALWAYS been free, and the problem with trying to charge for anything, is that everyone already had a free version that they could still use, that was a good product.  <br>
<br>
That's like saying, if honda gave away free 2000 hondas, but started charging in 2001.  I bet people would keep their 2000 hondas as long as they could before ever thinking of buying a new one.  But what if they took away the 2000 hondas, so your choice was to go get a crappy nova, or to pay for a new honda.<br>

You are damn right, it's up to you to do what you want with your money.  That's not what i'm saying.  What i'm saying is if you DON'T want to pay for any part of ezboard, don't go out and get a program that disables the popups on ezboard, that's just unethical.<br>

btw: somewhere in your post, you said how this will never work, in your analogy.  That's funny if you ask me.   Seams quite a few people are stepping up to the plate (not on this board obviously)  but on many others, and people are paying for what is a good product.<br>

I don't pay any money to ez-board (and don't plan on it either), but I also don't disable their ads, and even click on them about half the time so that they get a &quot;hit&quot;.<br>
<br>
The internet is changing.  It has to change.  It has to become profitable or like all businesses it will go away.  What I find amazing, is that I am living during the time when the internet is actually being born and am able to see it going through its various initial stages.<br>
<br>
Ez-board is a good tool, actually damn good for the price.  Anyone who doesn't either pay to disable the ads, contribute to a forum fund to pay for the board, or click on a link every now and then shouldn't bitch if the &quot;free&quot; forum goes away due to lack of funding.  What's funny, is those are the people who will probably bitch the most.<br>
