Anyway, Balrak.  You act like you're some kind of high and mighty cleric.  NEWSFLASH Anyone can play a dwarf cleric to 46 and ninja loot EM armor in hate.  I've seen you in game a few times, and I laughed everytime.  Because I can't believe someone like you has the balls to continue to play this game.  All your 9 paragraph flames don't amount to shit.  Because everyone hates you.  They hate you.  Is it in your skull yet?  THEY HATE YOU.  So log off and cancel your account.  Or start over, and learn how admit to the fact that you can be wrong sometimes.<br>
<br>
Don't _even_ try to fucking flame me, Balrak.  Because I'll bring your ignorant ass to shame.<br>

Yeah, I head all that before, you must of been a victim of mine in the past who obviously just can't seem to accept the fact I'm better then you.<br>
<br>
Rant, rave, really what does it all mean? Well for starters your to chicken to post your real name. Not that I really care, you're just another victim of mine who thought apparently you could bully people around. <br>
Trouble is, you thought wrong. Take a number, get in line with the rest of the twits who try to twist the story around. I heard about your ninja looting experience to, funny maybe I should mention that? What's the matter, cat got ya by the tongue now child? <br>
Ahh but then this is really getting old, can't you at least try to be original and think of some new flame? Then again when the blackhole represents your intellect, I guess it's hard to think of something new to capitalize on. <br>
<br>
Oh, as far as 46, true it is easy, that must be why you haven't made it to that point, 46 is a difficult lvl to obtain for someone like yourself Mren. Oh you were right about one thing, I do have the balls to play this game and tell people like you off. To typing 9 paragraphs, I know once again you envy the fact I can at least type that much, for you the less fortunate I feel pitty for. Maybe one day you to will be able to think of enough to say, I know it's very hard for someone like you but keep working at it, maybe one day you to will be able to accomplish such a task. <br>
<br>
Not all hate me, only those ignorant enough to take advantage of other players like you and the dozens out there hate me. Why should I stop playing because you don't like me? I don't care what you think, nor feel towards me. That sounds like a personal problem you have Mren.<br>

All you clerics suck ass.  Your whole fuckin job in EQ is to kill undead, heal, and REZ.  Yet when I die, I can't find one god damn cleric to REZ my ass, even after offering thousands (yes thousands) of plat and other items, plus free tports there and back, and SoW both ways.  Hell, all you guys have to do is say yes.  We do the rest!  But you don't.  So all you fuckin clerics can go to hell for all I care.<br>
<br>
I died (due to a griffen train in Easts Wastes) about an hour ago.  So I was running through Icecladd going back for my corpse, and I see that there is a 54 cleric in the zone.  So I ask him nicely if he could quick zone over (ONE FUCKING ZONE!!!) and give me a quick rez on the other side (YES, I WASN&quot;T IN THE MIDDLE OF EASTS WASTES...I WAS AT THE FUCKIN ZONE!!!) and guess what his lazy pathitic cleric ass told me?  Same answer I get EVERY other time I ask for a rez....  &quot;Sorry, I'm logging soon..&quot;  Then he has the fuckin nerve to tell me &quot;Good luck on finding a rez.&quot;  What a fuckin asshole.<br>
<br>
If your not going to rez people (one of the three jobs a cleric has on EQ) then don't play a fuckin cleric.<br>

Oh well, your loss not mine. Maybe someone will feel bad for you and pay for a hooker to come your way to break you into manhood when you turn of age in about 20 more years. Who knows, guys like you take alot longer to mature in adults.<br>
<br>
Boofy, before you go flaming all clerics I specifically recall one night spending hours and hours after the servers dropped people and the gms were not ressing. I recall spending that entire night running all over the world ressing everyone who asked for free. I can understand your frustration with clerics in EQ. I'll be the first to admit your right there, there are a few nice ones though. This was one of the biggest rants I have ever had were with clerics, if your semi close to someone who needs a res, do it don't make an excuse, your a cleric that is your duty. So I feel the same way as you do, but don't come here spouting about all clerics, just the 80% who are like that. Most often it's the pwr lvl'd ones who are like what you explained or they're the type like Mren and his friends whom I've obviously struck a cord with. Waahoo, I ticked off yet another peon.<br>
<br>
There used to be at least on MM a pact between clerics, for one you always res'd another cleric *and their alts* and the second was, anyone who was part of this pact would also be willing to assist anyone else with a res, I once ran all the way from Nfp to guk to res a guy because a cleric within the zone sitting at the zoneline didn't respond when asked to res, he just stood up and gated out after the guy asked. So I showed up, ran from fp, res'd the guy, and didn't even take payment when he offered simply because I was so angry by the other cleric. Oh yes I did get the guys name and you bet your ass I gave him a mouth full. So you see Boofy not all are bad, but yes I will agree again there are many who are greedy little pricks who don't help out. Those are the ones I flame out.<br>
<br>
I was on last night, I never got a tell from you to res you, all you had to do was ask. I'm not a mind reader and don't know when every single death occurs, next time try to be more extensive on your search you may be suprised that a cleric is willing to travel many zones to help someone who is in real need. <br>

You're a retard to put it blunt, and to many people I am. Glad we see on an eye level now. =c).  The fact still remains the same, I don't ninja my armor from hate.  Yet you do.  I have backstab, why would I use an epic LOL I can backstab myself?  Oops because it increases my help on raids with my guilds, and others in exp groups, or people who need help w/ some orc.  I kill the mobs faster.  Why would you need an epic?  How about when you're doing an exp group and the wizard dies and you're lom.  Would you rather right click you're flail, or med up?  How about anywhere, I guarentee, every cleric says they want to use the right click to save themselves 600 mana.  <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Synide allow me to refresh your memory, why would I need an epic when 99% of the time I never let anyone die? I leave that 1% margin in for people like you whom I purposely let die. Life of a cleric, isn't it grand. Tick them off and just remember who it is who is healing you, how long do you think you'd live without a heal in a raid, I would wager in your case, maybe 2 seconds if you're lucky.<br>
<br>
You see what Synide has failed to remember is I have a log from a conversation we had the other week, when I upfront and openly sent him a tell and challenged him in game to a duel. Right there and then, I wanted no excuses he was to meet me asap, but you see it was you Synide who declined the duel. Let me open that log up now and quote from the little shits own hand that typed these words to me word for word. <br>
<br>
Balrak:I know how much you missed me, so here I am. Now mr macho what was it you had to say to me, please by all means tell me. You're an amature work on the boards says enough, by all means say to me now what you there, I'll be waiting.<br>
*yes I know I left a few words out oops was in the process of healing some low lvls at the time. My bad.<br>
Guild: OMG BAL ROFL<br>
Synide:First, fix your grammar up a little but and I might be able to help you<br>
Second, let's duel<br>
*finally you have the courage to say something to my face, it's a miracle!!!!!*<br>
Balrak:Oh sorry I was busy helping newbies, duel you? surely I'll enjoy that<br>
Synide:When and where?<br>
Balrak:Now in hmm, where exactly am I, hmm SK atm *being arrogant is so fun*<br>
Synide:After i get my rezs (by sutekh who has an epic hehehehehehehehe) I'll come duel you<br>
*you see someone can't play a rogue not only did he die once but twice, now who's the retard newbie? Two deaths at once? Boy you suck Synide, don't go about calling people newbies when you yourself are one*<br>
Balrak:Get to SK now and I don't mean ten minutes from now. I mean NOW, I want to make a fool of you so I may get back to what I am doing you've already wasted enough of my time, now I will show you just how pathetic you are.<br>
Synide:I haven't declared a duel yet, you have to be in same zone and do /d<br>
(Hey synide unlike you, I know how duel works)<br>
Balrak tells guild:lol he said he needs to get res'd by a cleric who has an epic because he died twice, *I guess thats a weak attempt to try and make me angry, lol if he only knew I could care less* what a fool. So he won't duel me right now he said after he get's his exp res's even though he is at his body and has his gear he's to worried about exp. Besides it makes for a goode excuse from a knave like him to bow out of a challenge, he's about the most pathetic player I've ever met, he just doesn't have the balls to take me on. I've also told him it's alright to forfeit because at the present I'd rather be helping you all out on epics then waste more time on another fool who will lose. Yet another animal being led to their slaughter.<br>
Balrak:LoL, you challenge me I accepted now you decline, so I see how it is. As I thought, haha. You have declared a forfeit then. <br>
Synide:Yes, I bow down to the king<br>
Synide:Take a picture log it and have fun on the boards<br>
Balrak:/laughs, I just may if you act up again<br>

Balrak tells guild: LoL, he said when he gets in the same zone he will but he didn't forfeit since he didn't accept, I informed him he was the one who started, he was the one who challenged ME to the duel just now, meaning he did in fact ACCEPT a duel and now he's to afraid to face me so he has now declinded his own duel for the reason being he KNOWS Balrak has defeated Synide in a duel to the death to be broadcast all over the world. Now wouldn't that just be a kick in the balls to a little smart mouth child who thinks he's all that on the boards yet in the game he's just shown how weak and vulnerable he really is to those who he knows are far better then he.<br>
<br>
Now ya see I could go on to further make Synide out to be the spineless coward he is but I think that I've proven enough. Someone said in a post elsewhere to show proof, there it is. Can't argue with facts. You see I had no reason to come out here and drag it in the mud but hey I told ya I would if you persisted, the people who hate ya are probably loving this one Synide, man you must be as red as can be from being made a mockery of the way I have made you to be. I'll even bet you wish you had never started with me. I am sure you're saying GD this guy just doesn't give up. Maybe I went to far this time when I first began to spread a false lie about him just to be the tyical ass that I am, I bet you say that to yourself daily.<br>
<br>
Here's a quick line for you Synide, Balrak says, &quot;I am the game, you don't want to play me, I am control, no way can you shake me, I am heavy debt and no way can you pay me. I am the game and I know you can't take me!&quot; <br>
*loves that theme*<br>
<br>
Funny Synide, you're such a big boy aren't ya, you really think you're all that. MUHAHAHA. Yeah I just called your bluff that day son, trouble is I wasn't bluffing nor am I now. You may think I'm crazy, I think I just don't have the patience to be nice to an asshole like you and others on here who are like you.<br>
Your father must of never spanked you as a child when you did wrong, well lemme tell you son, when theres order in  life and you can't have things your way all the time, its only then that lifes a bitch. You see unlike 90% of the population I am one of the few who just take peoples crap and will get in your face no matter how big or small and tell you how it is. You talk alot of bs, but you never will have the balls to back that mouth up, I on the other hand do. You picked a fight with the wrong dude.<br>
<br>
This is a game and I am having fun with it, so don't think some little sh*t like you is going to come here or in the game and talk low of myself or others and think I won't come back on you. People did that to me in UO, they were PK'd daily and their houses were robbed on that game more times then you could shake a stick at.You see they were the pkers but they tried to pick a fight with the wrong guy. Same with Diablo, anyone stupid enough to try and PK me ended up with a nice Auto monster death. To any of you who played Diablo1 I am sure you remember townkills, autodeaths and of course the best was monster kill. I play by the rules but only do I bend the rules when I have others trying to do the same to me. Now I think I have shut your sorry as$ up yet again. So you see, you want the truth, YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!<br>
I just violated you Synide, now whatcha gonna do?<br>
/yawns at Synide and his cronies<br>
<br>
Yours truly, <br>
<br>
Balrak-The guy would care care less about a self proclaimed elder rogue wannabe named Synide and his cronie friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mren </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/3/01 6:50:51 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Synide forgets to easily</span><hr size=1> Balrak.  I'm not going to read the whole wannabe flame.  But consider this.  Deaths happen, whether or not you let them, they will happen.  And, I would not want to invite a cleric on an important raid if he does not have his epic.  Why?  Hate raid + wipeout = clerics camp.  Cleric comes back, no mana.  What does he do?  You betcha.<br>
<br>
Dying makes you a newbie now?  Okay, everyone 50+ is a newbie.<br>
<br>
And, what's the sense in dueling besides settling a dispute.  Looks like between you and Synide, you want to find out who's -better-.  Not a better player, just better.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for your guild, man.  They have to listen to your egotistic remarks.<br>
<br>
Btw, I don't think anyone would want to invite you to a raid anyway.  So getting epic -is- a waste of time for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/3/01 10:10:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Synide forgets to easily</span><hr size=1> Mren = Community supporter, you really want to fook with him Balrak?<br>

<br>
A very good friend of mine,a monk she is was pulling in KC last night for ST, apparently they were clearing it all and there was a hand group in the process of moving in so she didn't want to pull a train past them to fd and split, so she began to pull the CY. At least this is how I heard it happened.<br>
<br>
Well numbnutts and his group or two groups were taking her pulls, she said she was pulling by you all so what do you all do, you sit RIGHT in the middle of where she pulls and her two pulls agro you. Which I can't blame a group for defending themselves but I WILL be damned if they are told to watch out or move their asses out of the way of a major pulling route. Then it's their stupidity *or their ignorance to take pulls from others* then to sit there. Well I guess you all were fighting one so she was trying to pull the other one off you all. She does so only to have you all turn and KS it from her. She said to please backoff apparently in the fight, so what does the rogue boy wonder himself do, he says, &quot;bite me&quot; <br>
<br>
Now I know this lady, I know her well. She's a dear, very kind, very sweet and polite and a damn fine monk. What you did was uncalled for, a true sign of ignorance. You see Synide and Mren I'm an asshole to peckers like you both because you two pricks brought it upon yourself to wanna fuck with me. However, last night this lady did nothing to ever provoke, she didn't cuss you out, she simply said please do not take my pulls, so you reply with a bite me. I'll say this, you better not let happen again and you, ya fat little fuck, I like gnomes to an extent, but your a garbage picking little grubby ass who has no sense or morales. Guess what, I can play that game to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw that helm I won, UMM it's not bad, I've seen and had better, it's the barney look I don't go for it. <br>
<br>
Don't give excuses either Synide, I heard from about 5 others about this as well. So just don't try to make an excuse. All I can say is I wish I were in KC last night because I'd of given you one pull you wouldn't of been able to KS. <br>
<br>
Mren, did I ask for your RL personal life history? Your married with two kids eh? Well grow up then and stop acting like a two year old and more like a parental figure. Aren't you supposed to be setting an example to your children, or maybe the problem is your on here when you should be spending that time with your kids. I'm not wasting more time on you either, oh and no dying doesn't make you a newbie but in the case of Synide well he thinks he's all that so yes his deaths make him a newbie. I just had to rub it in his face. He likes to call people newbies, well now who's the newbie? Stop trying to twist what I say to your benefit you fool, you will come up short everytime. <br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Synides groups KS peoples pulls in KC last night, these people do not flame them out rather, ask them to please stop only after previously being warned about pulls coming through the CY, which as we know many people pull by here. So what does Synide do after this person asked to please not take her or others pulls, he says bite me. You know, sure it's just a pull, the problem here is this, it was the attitude and ignorance shown by you that was the problem. That was just uncalled for and not needed, I am not sure if she petitioned you, but its stunts like that and people like you who do need to be banned. You have a potty mouth on you Synide, one of these days you'll learn.<br>
 Quoting Synide here:<br>
Mren = Community supporter, you really want to fook with him Balrak? Didn't think so<br>
<br>
I'll be the judge of who I want to &quot;fook&quot; with son not you. Next time, you mind your own business and don't answer a question for me. Your answer was incorrect anyhow.<br>
<br>
Balrak-The critic at heart <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/5/01 2:10:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hey tough guy</span><hr size=1> Balrak, give it up.<br>
<br>
We didn't KS she trained us. It was a CT raid to help Arcaanis (sp sorry :P) his epic.  Also Sumiaka completed his epic with the second stone.  Good deal.<br>
<br>
I didn't say 'bite me' as kilrog said she quoted.  I'd like to see the screenshot, please.  I don't use the term bite me.  Personally, I don't find it worth the time or anyone elses times to bicker over 1 green dog that trained across us.  I didn't engage in the fight.  <br>
<br>
But who did she pick, public enemy #1.  Synide.  Easy target to blame and flame.  Easy enough.  I can take it.  But it's that simple, I didn't KS her mob.  If she thinks I did, then she can.  I personally hate KC, all of it.  I was there because glumner told me to help kill a mob.  Balrak, I don't have time to reply to your senseless flames.<br>
<br>
Synide<br>
<br>
Balrak, don't say it was my group, I wasn't leading, nor did we have the intent to KS, we were in a hurry to get to the mob. I'm sure they didn't want to waste time while one of your members was training through.  <br>
<br>
Something helpful in KC, while pulling build up agro, that way you don't train across ppl, do about 200 points of damage and that works well and stay close to the mob while pulling, sometimes they lose agro range and agro people who are sitting.  <br>
<br>
That's what I do.  Karnor's is a nut house.<br>

<br>
I was standing there in the CY with about 25 other CT members when your friend starts bringing her pulls right into the middle of us.<br>
<br>
After bringing 2 dogs into the room, one aggros on us.  WE kill it. Dropped in .09 seconds and no, I don't think Synide had time to even touch it.<br>
<br>
Your friend then screams not to KS.  Unless Synide said &quot;bite me&quot; in a /tell to her..it wasn't said.  I checked my logs.;)<br>
<br>
Whatever problems you may have with Synide are your business, your opinion and you are certainly entitled.<br>
But when the name of my guild comes into play...it's mine as well and the facts will be told.  I'll be happy to post the log if you wish? :)<br>
<br>
Have a nice day,<br>

What was so frightful and disgusting and quite petty was the language spoken to her when she politely informed you all pulls would be coming through.<br>
<br>
Two dogs, bah who cares, not like you can't get another two dogs, as I said it wasn't the KSing part that upset her and others, it was the language used by Synide to her directly. That's what brought me here, it was simply uncalled for. I don't want another excuse made I read the logs, sent to me by a few people who were there, that's all the proof I needed to come here and light into that person who was guilty.<br>
End of story, I hope other then that your raid went well but next time pick a better location to begin organizing the raid then in a central pulling location, it's called being mindful and respectful to the groups nearby who pull through there, it's just a matter of being polite. G'day.<br>
