There was a little learning curve today for most, and a few misaps that created mass deaths.<br><br>First Queen dies, instructions were not followed by all and lost a lot of people dead in first 10 seconds.  No one lived long enuff with the adds to loot... it rotted.  Second time getting ready for Queen, after the King was dead and room cleared, Someone Lagged ghosted into queen room and argoed it all,  all dead again before King epic piece was awarded.  Looted by a monk for MQ.  During rezes at the first locked door someone was rezzed to far down the stairs... all dead again.<br><br>All this will kill the nerves of most people after a long day.  29 people decided to stay and attempt queen 1 more time.  King was cleared with ease, room was cleared easily.  All moved into positions and followed directly perfectly.  cleared queen room but all of 2 mobs.<br><br>We went in and we handed her ass on a silver platter.  Was 2-4 deaths total.  Everyone did everything correct and we came out with pride and glory.  I received the Ancient blade for my epic.  Thanks EVERYONE that came today.<br><br>Was a fun day all in all, lots of people their for the first time, lots of people walked away with a learning experience they can share with their guilds and friends for other attempts. For those that go back with me, next time only gets easier once you have done it in the pass.<br><br>I won't name names, I just say thanks to all, and I hope all had a good time and loot distrubtion was fair.  I am a strict raid leader, and I don't hold back.  Everyone did their best and understands why I am so specific and direct on royals raid I am sure.  Room for error is zero, and movement and positions means everything and is very fast.  All did very well, we just had some bad luck, but the job got done!<br><br>If you have any pics ( I have a few but no website to post them ) and can add them plz do.<br><br>Be safe guys!<br><br>Dashaa 60 warrior <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udrenomar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drenomar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Jesus with down syndrome</span><br>  Posts: 521<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 4:20:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2934.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Royals - 1 Prince, 3 Kings, 2 Queens.... </span><hr size=1> guh rats! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy #@!%...I dinged</span><br>  Posts: 617<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/5/02 4:58:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2934.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Royals - 1 Prince, 3 Kings, 2 Queens.... </span><hr size=1> Hella fun as usual...wish I coulda stayed around to see the queen and king die again (get a little sick pleasure out of helping kill those mobs that are ally to me =P), but I wasn't even going to log on till late today and had promised to get some stuff done in the yard =) Needless to say, the sun was setting and rain clouds were hovering, so I had to go-should be able to make the next one, though.

I've only been in Chardok once before, and that wasn't even to the bridge. This was my first raid goin deep, and to kill the Prince once, King 3 times, and Queen twice on my first proper Chardok raid - a pickup one at that - shows the degree of knowledge Dashaa possesses.<br> Any high end guild wouldn't find it difficult doin what we did with ppl they have worked with and trusted for a long time, but to do what we did with basically a bunch of volunteers on a forum board, that's a pretty mean feat.

I have also attended a couple of other raids Dashaa has led, both pre-planned and just spontaneous.   <br><br>There are many, MANY over inflated egos behind the chars in this game.  We all know them.   They don't know it themselves....and therein lies the difference between Dashaa and all the rest of those who claim to be very knowledgeable, uber, the shit, or whatever you choose to call it.   He is.   His bedside manner is abrupt  (although is single group, he's not so bad).  So many people in this game want smoke blown up their pretty ass...if Dashaa tells you you did a good job,  or seeks you out for a raid, then dammit, you ARE good.   <br><br>He deserves people's respect because what he claims he knows, he does.  And he doesn't pretend to know stuff he doesn't.   Unlike many many who play,  lead, and then betray the trust of people who believed in them. <br><br>He doesn't stroke your ego?   Awww<br>He tells you you are a fooking moron, and does it to your face?  *gasp*  The truth sux,  doesn't it?    Maybe if people were told that more often,  (in RL too)  there wouldn't be so many morons running around.   <br><br>Truth be told, I know Dashaa doesn't think very highly of me as a player...that doesn't negate the fact that he is who is, and leads the way he does, and for that,  I respect him a great deal.  I'd go on ANY raid he honored me with allowing to attend.

Some knowledge ya, some balls to enforce rules and guidlines ya.  What really makes or breaks a raid leader is his/her followers.<br><br>In my eyes I am no better then anyone else that attended yesterday.  Some mistakes happened, but after I realized the cause of those mistakes I realized that no one was at fault.  I blow my top easily, I am a need to know person when something goes wrong and I want answears.  I got all the answears I needed yesterday, and NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON did a bad job.<br><br>People may look and say WOW, Dashaa is awsome... blaa blaa blaa.  Read the next few lines very carefully and then tell me who the awsome people are.<br><br>I said at the beginning of the raid I wanted <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  no ping pong</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  There was 38 people on this raid in total.  There was hardly any, if any ping pong at all for any of the fights.  Not the shamans, druids, wizzies, clerics, mage, no one did anything wrong in this area.<br><br>I don't have a hotkey <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Assist me now</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> bullshit on my raids.  I expect all attending to have /assist off and start attacking as soon as I attack.  Once again there was next to no issues at all regarding this.<br><br>The raid leader only has control over 1 character.  I was not sitting behind the monitor of 30+ characters yesterday.<br><br>Positioning is always difficult when people do things for the first time.  Yesterday I had 30+ people learn what had to be done for their first time doing chardok royals and once they learned it, second time around was a piece of cake.<br><br>The last thing that made yesterdays raid a success is one simple thing.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  No one give up.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Sure some people had to go and I respect that totally.  RL &gt; EQ for sure, and not everyone can play 10 hours a day.<br><br>What really gave me the respect is the tells I got.  People saying lets do this man, lets kill this bitch, I am here till I have to go to work Monday morning, I am not leaving until you get your epic piece. ect ect ect.  Some spirits were down due to the mishaps that were beyond control.  But no one wanted the raid to end with failure.<br><br>That is what makes a good raid leader, and great fun in EQ. <br><br>If you were able to sit down with the top 10 guilds on Drinal and ask the raid leader who was doing Queen for the first time for each of those guilds what do you think the results would be?<br><br>Sure maybe easy for those guilds now.  Lets look at it this way.  If I take the same 30+ people down to chardok again how hard is the Queen gonna be?  Not very frigging hard.<br><br>Most guilds have trouble doing the Prince and King.  Those were just mobs to kill on our way yesterday.  Not even a consideration of failure there.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  we came out with pride and glory<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  That goes for everyone who attended this raid.
