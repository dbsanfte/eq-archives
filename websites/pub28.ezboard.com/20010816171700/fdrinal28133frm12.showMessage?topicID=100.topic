The BEST BP in the game dropped last night, Berserker BP, in PoG and a players friggen twink got it even though there were 3-4 PRIMARIES(warriors) that should have got it before.  I cant even believe Icarus would PUT his Secondary, Leland,  in the auction.  Not to mention he is a foul mouth little punk that just complains about everything on EVERY single raid.  CS should take action on him, period. Oh and also, sure hope he gives up that Incardine BP to the guild (im sure he will say he needs it for invisi :P)  OK OK, its off my chest...but grrr that bothers me.  Just shows how truly greedy he is.<br>
     Second - Prissa and her thieving.  I knew Prissa was a guy when I first met him for 2 reasons.  1 - No REAL life female I know would EVER be the blonde wood elf (that is the FIRST sign of a man playing a woman.  They want the prettiest so they get their way)  2 - You can tell by the way they talk. <br>
      There are SO many men playing women characters that INSIST they are female. Hey guys, get a life.  You can justify it any way you want, but the point is you have some serious friggen issues.  If you are a guy playing a female chartacter just to get better items, etc etc then please quit.  and lastly, if you are a guy plaing a female STOP CALLING OTHER GUYS SWEETIE, HUN, CUTIE ETC.  Think about that, your seriously disturbed.  Also, NO, it is NOT roleplaying.  I dont know why it bothers me so much, I guess I just despise ppl lying to benefit themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaspell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aspell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://angelfire.lycos.com/images/animate/atomspin.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#939393>(2/8/01 1:51:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Icarus and &quot;women&quot; in Everquest</span><hr size=1> <br>

I would not say that all blond characters are males.  I personally chose brunette because that is the color of my hair in rl and my close friend chose red hair because that matches her.  So it is possible, that some females have chosen blonde simply because they like the hair color.<br>
<br>
So a good question is, did you choose your main character that looks closest to you or what influenced your decision on the main character you play?<br>
<br>
I started as a half-elf Ranger because I am petite in real life and wanted to be taller.  I also chose the platinum blond because I liked her eyes the best.  It did bother me though to be that lacking of clothes until I discovered banded armor. <br>
<br>
But in the long run, I finally ended up with my main character as a wood elf druid because I fell in love with all the abilities of the druid and now I am back to being height impaired.  :)<br>
<br>
Also, have you noticed that most Human Paladins are attracted to wood elf druids in EQ?  Is this a class or race thing or am I seeing something that is not really there?<br>
<br>
Also, a good way to distinquish if an EQ female is a real female is that they stop and /ooc for directions.  And if they get lost, they admit it. (Said jokingly.)<br>

I picked a blonde, blue eyed character for my main because that is what is closest to me in RL.  I wanted an &quot;evil&quot; character, so I picked a DE SK.

one of the core principles of my guild since it was formed was primaries before secondaries.  everyone had to pick a primary character prior to kunark, and you can only switch primary characters now if the secondary you are switching to meets the guild requirements for that class.  anyway, i don't know the story here, but that policy is very important to me, and items going to twinks over primary characters gets me extremely pissed off.<br>

Secondly, it's always been my opinion that people's personalities are as distinctive as their gender.  What I mean by this is that being able to tell someone's gender by their communication style, manner of dealing with conflicts, methods of approaching people, etc. should all be as evident in game as observing someones gender via physical appearance.  Granted there are limits to the extent of this, but one of the facts I've realized through college and life is that there are certain identifiable gender differences which cross cultural lines.

OK, now id say about 33% of all the Characters in the game are female, yet about 90%-95% of THOSE female characters all swear they are Female.

<br>
This has to be one of the most narrow-minded and homophobic comments I've ever seen.<br>
<br>
I'm male, and I play a mix of female and male characters. I'm not screwed up, I don't have &quot;issues&quot;, anymore than someone playing Tomb Raider. It's just an avatar on a computer. My first female character was a high elf, because I wanted to be a high elf magician and couldn't stand the way the high elf males looked. My second female character was because my girlfriend and I thought it would be fun to roleplay twins, and she didn't want to be a male, and well, the woman wins. :)<br>
<br>
Granted, I also don't flirt for equipment, and now that I don't really roleplay, talk as I normally would (IE not calling males &quot;sweetie&quot;) and don't make a secret of it - although, even when I was really heavily roleplaying a female, I would always answer truthfully if someone asked my gender out of character. I think the only &quot;friggin' issue&quot; someone who flirts for equipment has is known as &quot;greed&quot;. Because it works. <br>
<br>
Is flirting for equipment okay if the player behind the character IS actually female? My disgust goes to those who give away equipment to IG females hoping to get a little cybernookie. They rather deserve to be taken advantage of. It's akin to giving that cute chick at the video store a $100 present to try to get her to go out with you. Pretty pathetic.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind, though, more women play this game than any other... I know a LOT of real women in the game as well. And some of them even play the blonde wood elf. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#939393>(2/8/01 7:05:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Icarus and &quot;women&quot; in Everquest</span><hr size=1> And I still don't see what CS has to do with it. Fact is it wasn't a guild raid. The majority of the raid was in CS, but that's it. When it had been a guild raid, it would have gone to a primary char. Period. I wouldn't have entered the lotto with a secondary char though but this is my point of view and everyone has different views. I am happy with my indicolite BP and if I ever get a better one (whichever that may be) then I am even happier. One single item doesn't make me a better warrior after all. That's all I have to say about it.<br>
<br>
Oh, for those who care: I play a female char. Why? well, males all look gay in EQ. At least most of them. After all it is my money I pay for the game so I have every right to do with my char what I want as long as it doesn't break any rule. Playing a female char although you are male, doesn't break any rule. So what? Everyone who asked me if I am male or female got an answer. And I didn't answer with female. The only thing that bothers me are those morons (usually male) who ask me for a GG or a sow in FV while I am waiting for a rez. And you say that guys playing female chars have mental problems, eh?

Ummm, yes...thats RIGHT. And HEY!!!!  I'm not pregnant! When I was married my husband and I really DID play together! I have RL friends that play the game and have given me things....but I can guarantee you it's out of friendship and kindness... not because of graphics. <br>
<br>
Not that any of that is your business, nor do i care what your opinion is....I just don't understand what you are trying to accomplish here?  What are you trying to say?  Women should choose characters that DON'T look like themselves???  /boggle <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#939393>(2/9/01 7:07:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Icarus and &quot;women&quot; in Everquest</span><hr size=1> Quote: <br>
Secondly, it's always been my opinion that people's personalities are as distinctive as their gender. What I mean by this is that being able to tell someone's gender by their communication style, manner of dealing with conflicts, methods of approaching people, etc. should all be as evident in game as observing someones gender via physical appearance. Granted there are limits to the extent of this, but one of the facts I've realized through college and life is that there are certain identifiable gender differences which cross cultural lines. <br>

Could you provide, please, more info on how males and females exercise conflict management differently - and how it is gender specific. Do you think a female housewife may have a different form of conflict management than one that works in a male dominated environment? Or how about a female who works in a female dominated or mixed environment (e.g. teams where they utilize certain rules of engagement when communicating). Please expand how these will carry over to dialogue in game. <br>
<br>
Could you provide, please, more info on methods of approaching people. Do you think males or females alike who have had an extensive communications background may approach people differently than those who come from say ...an IT background or ...those who come from different upbringing (e.g. finanacial and social classes). And please distinguish in each case how a male would be different from a female.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with your outlook. I am not sure that it matters in a roleplaying game. But if it does matter to people I ask you this:<br>
<br>
1) I have used swear words in cases where I thought it would emphasize or add irony to a statement - does this make me a male or female?<br>
<br>
2) I have been accused of using a dictionary when making forum posts- does this make me male or female.<br>
<br>
3) I am self serving, self-sufficient, financially independent, extremely career focused and agressive (at times to a fault) - does this make me a male or female?<br>
<br>
4) I picked the frumpy looking blonde human char because I couldn't find my way off the platforms in Kelethin as a wood elf, and something killed me right off in Faydwar as a High Elf (and I didn't want to look like the girl on the box), does this make me male or female?<br>
<br>
5) I may choose to manage conflict either through a meaningful attempt at advocacy &amp; inquiry , yet if I do not believe I am communicating with someone in this game who is of age/insight to participate - I may just choose to be confrontational - does this make me a male or a female?<br>
<br>
6) Despite all of the above I may choose to flirt, date, fall in love, nurture, be fascinated with a RL male. I may choose to never flirt in game - as I don't seek intimacy out of a game of toons...but I may have called someone Hon once in a while or /hug'd them does this make me a male or female?<br>
<br>
7) It really bothers me that we have a right wing dominated government at a federal level and in my state   - does this make me a male or female?<br>

Ic,Leland whatever you want to be called, you really are a true knave.<br>
<br>
I've heard of his tempers, I had the displeasure of being grouped with this little crybaby before and my, he was truely pathetic and such a kiss up, if there's one thing I hate is an ass kis$er.<br>
<br>
As far as he earning his due? That means jack sh*t<br>
when your in he planes or anywhere else. If there's a primary there that can use an item it's ALWAYS primarys over a twink, anyone that argues that's not how it is, needs to go back to diablo, that's the way it has been for the past 2 1/2 years that's the way it will remain.<br>
<br>
So I have to agree, that a twink getting and item over other mains was just sad. That should of never happened. You can bet in my raids it doesn't work that way. But then as if I'd invite Leland to a raid of mine, I think h*ll would have to freeze over and get about 20' of snow. <br>
<br>
Yes in case your wondering leland ' = feet, foot, ft. So yes thats 20 feet, I know you have such a low IQ as is so I thought I'd clear that up for you. Least I can do. Only thing I can figure your mother dropped you one to many times as a child or maybe you thought that thing in the wall you saw people plug appliances into was a good spot to plug your finger into, who knows. This is you we're talking about.<br>
PUN INTENDED. <br>
<br>
/smile at the birdies leland<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn't help myself there, I know I promised to try and post positive things the very few times I come to these boards anymore, but this was one I just had to flame on. But at least I bleep out the swearing, because I know kids may stumble in here, unlike mr fowl mouth there who can't seem to shut that hole in his head he'd like to think is a mouth. Rather I believe in giving birth they messed up, they pulled him out by the wrong end, maybe that's why he thinks with his other &quot;head&quot;. <br>
<br>
G'day all and have fun, leland, if you don't like what I said, you can kiss my rosey red american as$! I don't care what you think about me, I'd rather be a foe then an ally to a two faced child who thinks he's all grown up. Theres the door son, don't let it hit you on the as$ on the way out,back to barney and friends for you.<br>
<br>
Just remember hate leland, you came out here starting something, well now it's my turn to bash you for your ignorant ways. What goes around comes around kid, I'm just getting warmed up here.  *evil grins*<br>
muhahaha...<br>
