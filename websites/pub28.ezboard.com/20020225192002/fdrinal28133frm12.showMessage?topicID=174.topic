I do a /who in the zone, and I see Moonbaem (level 52 cleric) in the zone.  I /tell her if she could come to the zone and ITU me (Yes, very stupid...but it was worth a shot right?)  She doesn't even answer me..<br>
<br>
So I zone into Upper Guk, hoping I could get one there...do a /who in that zone....And guess who's there.... That's right...  Moonbaem.  Understand that?  She had to of passed me at the zone to upper inorder to get there first.  So, I ask her again for an ITU....no response..<br>
<br>
So I zone back into lower guk, hoping that maybe someone had just logged on in guk and could ITU...  Do a /who.....yep, you guessed it....Moonbaem, back in Lguk.  That means she passed me again inorder to zone into lowerguk.<br>
<br>
Someone remind me the casting time on ITU?  Can't take that much time.....<br>
<br>
Anyway, assassin group died cause I couldn't make it down there.<br>
<br>
Another short story:<br>
<br>
I'm in Karnor..  Someone trains Scryer to the zone....woot, he has Trident!  I begin kiting him using the pathing bugs to stay away from his 125pt damage per hit left hook, when who comes round the corner with 4 or 5 drolvages, including 2 bodyguards (Yes...fuckin bodyguards...he trained fuckin bodyguards from warlord!) a little dwarven POS cleric...His name will remain anon, because he is well known, and I have no intention of ruining his reputation...  Atleast the bodyguards made it quick and almost painless...  <br>
<br>
So after I zone back in outside karnor, I mem a few spells, and run in to retrieve my corpse.  Sitting right next to my corpse, is that cleric.  I ask him nicely if he could use his rez stick (yes, he had his epic) and give me a quick rez....  What does he reply you ask?  &quot;Sorry, logging soon..&quot;  Then he runs off into karnor.<br>
<br>
I would just like to say this:  To all you clerics out there....  Verant didn't put the level 56 rez on your fuckin epic for show, and after you fuckin train someone, show some god damn fuckin respect and take 2 fuckin secs and rez their corpse.<br>
<br>
/fuckin pissed off rant off<br>

However the info you did request, ITU is a lvl 14 spell for clerics, it also uses *hold onto your seats this will blow you awaY* it uses an insane amount of mana, like 40!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Whoa, told you it was a mana hog. No seriously, this is where the few good clerics have to put up with that crap. You have people who think all clerics are like that, I am here to say, not so and I openly flame any cleric that plays like that. <br>
<br>
It's simple, you're a healer/resser. Your job is to keep people alive at whatever costs and to res them when they die, trouble is that's to time consuming for the cleric with a greedy heart. What can I say, I know I don't do that and even if someone dies and it wasn't my fault I will res them if I see them fall or someone is there looting a fresh corpse. It's the whole reason being a cleric, those are your laws, abide by them or get lost and go play another character if you want to be so darn greedy. <br>
<br>
I can say this because I am the oldest cleric on Drinal and I to this day still help those who need it. It doesn't matter how old my character is, when I chose to play a cleric in beta, I knew what I was up against later down the road. Here I am several years later still doing what I do best, keeping those people alive that need and helping those who are desperate for help. May I add with NO price tag. Godspeed...<br>

Obviously you and your sources don't know what your talking about because I'm not 52, lol. Try adding a few more lvls possibly 8 more to that. <br>
<br>
Once again, you to assume to much, refer to what happens when you assume. As for used to charge for res's. I don't deny at one time I did, to defer the costs for the gems I had to purchase back in the days before the cleric recieved anything in way of gems or anything to cover the cost. This of course was well before you were anything but a hill of beans. <br>
<br>
You see unlike popular belief, back in the days most clerics who were noble ones were not rich, in fact poor as sin. So Lukaz, of course you'll try to shoot that down, but what it comes down to is this, I do rank the oldest, I am far more wise then you, and as far as a lvl is concerned, I don't need to be a lvl 60 to be said to be the oldest, as far as I am concerned technically if there is a lvl one who is older then I *not possible since I beta'd from the start* then I wouldn't be able to grace that honor. However you've just proven the lack of wisdom you do have. Since when has it stated in the laws of age that just because so and so is not a certain &quot;lvl&quot; that they are a newbie? I say this because I know many people who started EQ 2 + years ago and are not even 40 yet with their mains, they just don't live on here like some do. *coughs and looks at you lukaz* Really, enlighten me then, so lets put this in motion. Say I bought my account on ebay and I bought a lvl 60 wizard and I go against a lvl 40 wizard in killing things and I had to do it without knowing what spells did what, and not looking in casters realm or another web site as to what the spells do. Keep in mind I never played a wizard or I was a true beginner to the game. Who would kill a mob faster, that 40 who has played all 40 lvls or that 60 who bought or had friends pwr lvl him? I can tell you now that 40 will, simply because he or she would be using their most powerful spell, now the wizard who is 60, would be clueless and probably be using a lvl 8 spell and wonder why does this dd suck so bad. That's a brief example, but the point is taken.<br>
<br>
I also find it funny, I post a reply. Not flaming anyone directly but stating my opinion and I have to laugh at how fast you flame me. You see was it that maybe I pointed out a flaw which you were guilty of and you just assumed I was gearing it towards you? Obviously this is true, because I made no mention of a name in my reply. Therefore common sense tells myself and others here, you indeed took offense to what I replied in against because you were guilty of such a thing Lukaz, why else would you come back with a rude reply, when nothing was said to you directly or indirectly. I'd add more, but I think I said enough on the topic. I just think you're jealous you only wish you were half as good as I, funny it's often jealously that leads people to despise others, you apparently show great envy and jealousy towards me. I find that to be most humorous of all.<br>
