-What gives us the right to judge you? Your charecter is named after a rapper. Rap sucks, it takes no musical talent, all it is, is a bunch of "thugs" with 10 million dollar homes chanting about life in the hood and how they are gunna "fuck some bitches after the show", therefore i have the right to judge you, because i have seen enough to make me sick.<br>
<br>
"do i need to be black for me to think that?" Yes, because tupac always talks about his "niggaz" etc.. if you were white it would be worse, but rap sucks once again. <br>

GOOD JOB!!! You've learned to read AND write. Such a good boy<br>
<br>
/clap<br>
<br>
/hands you a snack pack and juice box<br>
<br>
Now, adjust your helmet and be a good boy and use your blankie to keep the drool off the table-wouldn't want to make a mess on the table like the one we can all smell in your pants. "<br>
<br>
Wow. That's just... childish. Still if you wish to play that game I can accomdate you the same as your pleated cheeks accomidates a donkey c*ck when you act as a stand-in for your Ed Asner back hair having jizz rag of a sister. <br>
<br>
Shut your Herpes blister dappled cock holster. Didn't your mother teach you it's impolite to speak with food in your mouth? I always chastise her with a nice Rubber glove across that ass that looks like she just spent 3 hours sitting naked on a gravel driveway when she spouts off. Lovely.<br>
<br>
If I took your brains, your genitals, and your guts, and made them into a ball they would roll around in a gnats navel like a BB in a freight car.<br>
<br>
You slimy, pubic hair on your head having, afterbirth of a gutter raped prolapsed uterus ungulating gelatainous pile of Janet Reno's monthy discharge's virus's ooze. You and your little suburban redneck turned gangster boyfriend One-nut, erm... pak, can just step off right now. FFS your flames provide as much heat as a wet match. Jesus, your trade skills take up more space than when you give me a piece of your mind you retarded ass chimp. Do you check the toilet to make sure that clump of three cells that constitutes your feeble brain didn't get shat out after a good dump? <br>
<br>
I'm tired of all you little pissant whiners crying and asking why people pick on you when you insist on playing the game. If you can't take the heat, GTF out of the kitchen. I won't take it easy on you, because unlike your mother I don't give serviceman's discounts. Now go back to drinking dog jizz off your grandfathers colostomy bag, becuase you aren't even on my level. Teletubbies is more your speed. You remind me of that Corky kid from Life Goes On. You're cool and all, but in the end, you're still a retard. <br>
<br>
So next time you pitifully jam something up your mud whistle and wonder what your true sexual identity is, think of me. Because that's what my every post can do to you, if I get bored and come back here to smack you around again, you little Oz prison rape victim. Sit your punk ass down, or I'll trade your ass for a pack of smokes. (At least you had the balls to step up. Good man! rofl)<br>

While I'll admit there is a certain creativity to your posting, it honestly seems like most of it was formed by writing down every foul word you could think of on a little piece of paper, throwing it into a bag, and pulling them out one at a time. I had to go back and re-read the Christmas post someone from Tunare pointed out to make sure it wasn't a total rehash. Same theme, different sentance structure. Really-after the first such rant, they all seem the same.<br>
<br>
Refering to someone's mother and sister as a slut/whore is so cliche, its not worth any more comment than this sentance.<br>
<br>
The gnat's navel thing was an interesting analogy-quite possibly the most creative thing in the whole post. /golfclap<br>
<br>
You've already commented on the tradeskills thing-I retorted to that comment before you even posted it in the first place. Move on. You're boring us all with it.<br>
<br>
Hmm-don't remember seeing anything saying I thought I was being picked on, was just basically pointing out that I considered you a slack-jawed moron. The line about Corky from Life Goes On DID make me chuckle though-thanks for that. Though I was disappointed to see that you took the two comments people pointed out as being somewhat inspired in your Christmas rant-Teletubbies and Oz/pack of smokes (and, honestly, I thought they were the *first* time I read them) and recycled them. Tis a shame that I've read two rants like this from you and am already seeing you repeat yourself.<br>
<br>
Though you *are* correct about me not being on your level, it's just unfortunate you've confused which of us is higher on the chart of evolution.<br>
<br>
And, I guess, thanks for complimenting me for standing up? Honestly, validation from you was the LAST thing I was looking for when making that post. If I had been, I would have been like Echo and posted a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/ftunareflames.showMessage?topicID=2985.topic">&quot;looky what I did Emodius, yeay me&quot;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->thread over on Tunare (link reposted in case people missed it from my earlier post, or just didn't feel like going back to look for it). <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

<br>
Do NOT feed the trolls!<br>
<br>
I can sit here and post monkey on a keyboard ranting, but I chose not to. Why you must ask yourself? Well the simple reason being that I know who I am, and I respect myself. I like who I am, so why degrade others to make myself feel better. This is just a technophiles version of &quot;my daddy is stronger than your daddy&quot;. I am guessing that someone got bored and told all their EQ buddies &quot;Hey watch how much trouble I can start on the drinal boards&quot; Must have been during the time most of us were at work getting a paycheck that doesn't have the McDonald’s golden arches on it. Well, I know I am going to get flamed for this but does this fact bother me? No. Because I once again stress out the point that I know who I am what I am and how damn good I am. So why should I care what you say. And for all of you out there who kiss your mother with that mouth, you are just so nasty. <br>
<br>
P.S. <br>
<br>
Aren’t these the same guys who were posting calling Arrora a spic ho? LOL I am guessing this is one of the slang terms Skippy and Bobby learned on their school field trip to the &quot;hood&quot; get over it. I am Hispanic... notice the proper term...Hispanic. I did not come from Spain. I came from Chicago. My family came from many countries. I do not fall into your stereotypical views of Hispanic women. Because I guess you never been to a Hispanic country / territory. I am speculating you cannot imagine that most of the Hispanic women I know and have in my family have graduated with honors ..own their homes or businesses and can use the English language properly, and in all honesty have a better accuracy of verbosity than shown by your mates here to us. So go about shouting about each other’s genetalia or calling everyone names, it’s just going to prove my point. You must not like yourself, respect yourself or thinking you are any good. Because any self-respecting person would not treat another being with such low graded idiom. <br>
<br>
In closing I would like to remind everyone that trolls should not be fed. I think in your RPG manuals it reads that trolls could only die by fire. So I think we should let them drown in their own flames.<br>

Trade skill guy. Thanks for the kind words. yes I was serious. usually when people get flamed they just got done laughing at someone geting "Pwned" and when it comes their turn, they can't take it, and get pissy in RL like a little insecure b*tch. My sole purpose is to entertain. I am glad you are mature enough to not get all upset in RL and make petty baby threats that you can't back up like the retard who wrote this:<br>
<br>
"One ended up with a worn out slut with 5 kids ,and the other person got jumped in a club for opening his mouth which no longer opens anymore =) "<br>
<br>
Neither of those is going to happen to me. If my mouth opens, it isn't shutting unless my ass is kicked (and even then it won't), and that hasn't happened since the doctor whooped me as a baby, and I'm looking for his a ss now. rofl. Also if my mouth opens I back it up, unlike you. My mouth opens because there is a reason. If you are scared of that, and it intimidates you, tough. I'll do you like I did any other punk who wants to match wits, muscle or whatever against me.Thanks for playing. Such big threats over the net. Grow up have a good laugh. You take this too seriously. That crap may work in your high school, but boy, you ain't sh it. Looks like your p enis size wasnt enough.<br>
<br>
anyway /wave drinal. Hopefully I kept you from getting bored at work today, you did me, for about 5 minutes at least.<br>

These disturbances come together to create a pervasive pattern of behavior and inner experience that is quite different from the norms of the individual's culture and that often tend to be expressed in behaviors that appear more dramatic than what society considers usual. Therefore, those with a personality disorder often experience conflicts with other people and vice-versa. There are ten different types of personality disorders that exist, which all have various emphases. <br>
<br>
There are as many potential causes of personality disorders as there are people who suffer from them. They may be caused by a combination of parental upbringing, one's personality and social development, as well as genetic and biological factors. Research has not narrowed down the cause to any factor at this time. We do know, however, that these disorders will most often manifest themselves during increased times of stress and interpersonal difficulties in one's life. Therefore, treatment most often focuses on increasing one's coping mechanisms and interpersonal skills<br>
<br>
Histrionic Personality Disorder<br>
Symptoms<br>
<br>
A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: <br>
<br>
<br>
-is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention <br>
<br>
-interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior <br>
displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions <br>
<br>
-consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self <br>
<br>
-has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail <br>
<br>
-shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion <br>
is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances <br>
<br>
-considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are <br>

You don't know anyone like me in RL. And that would never happen to me in RL. Just like I don'<br>
t know you. Chances are though, you spouting off your innane little opinion would get you your ass kicked faster than my conduct in RL. I'd worry about myself, if I were you. In any event unless youre going to do it yourself, you just sound like a little 5 year old kid, who I like to call "the informant". They inform people of things to make themselves seem more powerful, or to veil weak threats they have no hope of backing up, since they are soft. Draw from that what you will.<br>
<br>
I know I have been deemed personality disorder free, but aparently some of you love to live vicariously through urban legend and lore. Still, being stupid isn't a crime, so in your case lice, you'll be ok. Just keep living in your littel fantasy world. Im not the one who will get beaten to a pulp heh. Anyway I chalk you up to the typical internet lamer who makes ass kicking threats. Veil it like a coward anyway you want, but you look like a tool.<br>
