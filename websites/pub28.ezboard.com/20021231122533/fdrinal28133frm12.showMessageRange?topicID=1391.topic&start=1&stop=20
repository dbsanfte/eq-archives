<br>
MINNEAPOLIS -- Randy Moss spent the night in jail facing a possible felony charge after being arrested for allegedly pushing a traffic agent a half-block with his car.<br>
<br>
  <br>
 Moss <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The arrest could keep the Minnesota Vikings' star receiver out of Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks.<br>
<br>
The 27-year-old agent stepped in front of Moss to stop him from making an illegal turn in downtown Minneapolis, and Moss used his 2002 Lexus to slowly push the officer a half-block along the street, stopping when she fell to the ground, police spokeswoman Cyndi Barrington said.<br>
<br>
Barrington said Amy Zaccardi is a city employee but not a police officer and was not seriously hurt. Witnesses called the situation &quot;surreal'' but said it was clear Moss did not intend to hurt Zaccardi.<br>
<br>
Police arrested Moss on suspicion of assault with a dangerous weapon, a felony. He was being held in Hennepin County Jail early Wednesday. Barrington said the county attorney would consider charges.<br>
<br>
However, ESPN has learned that police intend to charge Moss with second-degree assault, a felony.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's going to be treated like anybody else,'' Barrington said.<br>
<br>
In an interview on ESPN Radio on Tuesday night, Barrington said the typical holding time of a person arrested on a similar charge is 36 hours, but that a hearing could occur as early as Wednesday.<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously the media will make this a high-profile case, but we will handle this as we would any civilian who was arrested on an assault case,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Late Tuesday night, a Vikings' team source told ESPN that Moss flatly &quot;denied doing what the police said that he did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Vikings issued a statement that said the team wouldn't comment about the incident until it had gathered more information.<br>
<br>
Vikings coach Mike Tice declined comment Tuesday, but the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Wednesday that a person with knowledge of the situation told the newspaper that it is highly unlikely Moss will play Sunday.<br>
<br>
Moss' agent, Dante DiTrapano, had been in contact with the player Tuesday but declined comment.<br>
<br>
Jerry Hullerman, 46, said he saw the incident while parked near the intersection.<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw a really decked-out Lexus pushing the traffic person along,&quot; said Hullerman, who was also interviewed by police. &quot;It was really surreal.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said the agent was facing forward while sitting on the front of the car with one hand on the hood and the other hand on her radio as the car pushed her along.<br>
<br>
After a few seconds, Hullerman said, the man in the car tapped the accelerator and knocked her down. &quot;She fell flat on her face,&quot; Hullerman said, adding that the driver didn't get out of his car.<br>
<br>
Hullerman said squad cars arrived seconds later and officers took Moss into custody.<br>
<br>
Robert and Delaina Nelson of Robbinsdale, Minn., saw much of the incident and called it one of the most ridiculous episodes they've ever seen. They also said they had no doubt that the driver -- whom they later learned was Moss -- did not intend to hurt the traffic agent.<br>
<br>
Rather, Delaina Nelson said, it seemed to be a &quot;cat-and-mouse game&quot; in which he wanted her to get out of his way.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was in the wrong, and she put herself in a dangerous position,&quot; Robert Nelson told the Star Tribune. &quot;I think if he had been a madman, he would have just run over her and kept going.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moss, 25, is in his fifth year with the Vikings and is the team's highest-paid player. He signed an eight-year, $75 million contract last year.<br>
<br>
He set an NFL record with 5,396 yards receiving in his first four seasons as a pro and is the only wide receiver with more than 1,000 yards receiving in each of his first four seasons. Moss has scored more touchdowns since his 1998 debut than anyone except St. Louis running back Marshall Faulk.<br>
<br>
The Vikings are off to an 0-3 start, their worst since 1967, and Moss caught just four passes for 16 yards in Sunday's loss to Carolina.<br>
<br>
Moss has been in trouble before on and off the field throughout his career. He squirted a referee with a water bottle in 1999 -- which resulted in a $25,000 fine from the NFL -- and verbally abused corporate sponsors on the team bus in 2001. The last infraction resulted in the team fining him $15,000 and forcing him to attend anger management classes.<br>
<br>
He had a scholarship revoked by Notre Dame in 1995 after being charged with beating up a high school classmate in Rand, W.Va. Moss pleaded guilty to battery and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He was allowed to defer most of the sentence until after his freshman year in college.<br>
<br>
He went to Florida State, where he redshirted his freshman season but was kicked off the team for violating probation by smoking marijuana. That got him a one-year jail sentence, which was reduced to about one month of time served.<br>
<br>
Virtually out of chances, Moss walked on at Marshall and quickly became a star.<br>
<br>
Last year, Moss drew criticism after telling reporters that he plays when he wants to play. &quot;There's nobody here on the face of the earth that can make me go out here and play football,'' he said. &quot;I can go out here on the field and suit up and stand on the sideline and play. At my highest level? I don't know. If I want to go out here and play at my highest level, I'll do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
He also has taunted opposing players and bickered with teammates. But after Tice was appointed head coach in January, Moss stayed in Minnesota during the offseason and worked out most days at the team's headquarters.<br>
<br>
&quot;By me coming here and working out with most of the young guys, I guess that's just showing them a little leadership and how bad I want to win a Super Bowl,'' Moss said in June.<br>

<br>
that really made me laugh. the police and judicial system never treat the rich and famous like the treat normal people.<br>
<br>
aside from that, moss' quote on i play when i want to play is very out of context. i believe he was asked about whether kory stringer's death had affected his playing and he said no because he plays when he wants to. <p>~~Teauvian~~<BR>

<br>
1. hes obviously very talented, he may be an asshole but he scores touchdowns<br>
     - my opinion on that is no matter how good you are dragging team morale down is whats gonna kill you, he could score 400 touchdowns this year but they wont win the superbowl till he learns he's not god's gift to humanity.<br>
<br>
2. the vikings dont want him on any other team, they wont trade him or release him because they wont get anything worth having to play defense against this guy.... i mean they could trade him to the bengals but who are they gonna get?  i swear to god they almost made the mascot mvp of their last game cause it looked like no-one on the field knows where they are much less what they are doing.<br>
    - once again it comes down to attitude, i run a guild, i play football, i keep patients calm in my RL work.... NOTHING can be done without a little co-operation, its impossible to accomplish anything especially winning a national championship in a team sport if your whole team doesn't get along.<br>
<br>
anyways yeah they probably wont suspend him, but if they do maybe its time they start showing randy moss that theyre not gonna put up with his gangster antics no matter who he is, hes gonna get fired if he doesnt start being a real human being and treating others nicely. <p><IMG SRC=http://ffpicserver.mine.nu/Signatures/destsig.jpg>

Go ahead folks, try it.  Find some random person on the street thats walking through an intersection, and slowly force them, with your car/truck/van/bike/etc to go wherever you tell them and see what happens to YOU.<br>

I'd venture to guess he was stoned off his ass at the time, and thus, kept driving when he ran over the traffic cop.

With that said Moss is still an excellent receiver and Minnesota's best player which is why they won't cut him.

It's damn sad this piece of crap gets away with this. Regarding his talent, yes he shows flashes of greatness but if he was all that, the Panthers wouldn't have had 3 interceptions from balls thrown to Moss because Moss is too scared or too lazy to be a &quot;Player.&quot; And how can you dare put him in the same breath as Rice? Rice is a class act guy, with one of the strongest work ethics in the NFL and goes above and beyond for his team. That makes you great!<br>

And who is SLP? Talking about Carolina Panthers, the team that embarassed the Vikings and shut down Moss in both their meetings (2001 &amp; 2002 seasons).

The media doesn't elaborate whether or not the vehicle was already moving and she essentially injured herself by jumping in front of a vehicle that was unable to stop given the distance remaining /reaction time. <br>
<br>
Moss is playing because he has not been convicted of a crime and the NFLPA will sue the asses off the Vikings for (stealing this one from the Dems) RUSHING TO JUDGEMENT. Moss may be found innocent. You know there is this thing in America we used to adhere to but the media and sub intelligent viewers now disregard the presumption of  INNOCENT until PROVEN GUILTY in a court of law. <br>
<br>
The DA said last night they cannot prove he intended to injure the officer so would be unable to reasonably expect to get a felony conviction from this. And honestly that is the correct call.. The felony charge is intended for criminals that are intentionally trying to seriously injure an officer.<br>
<br>
OFMG some of you are fucking stupid. <br>

1/2 a block is NOT bumping into someone that jumped out in front of you.  If me, your or any other 'non celeb' did this, chances we would be out on bond and waiting to stand before the judge.<br>
