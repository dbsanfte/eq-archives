I have been out with the flu and was recently made aware of this false and childish flame by my guild leader.<br>
<br>
     I have been asked to refrain from flaming back even if it's deserved and called for, by my guild leader. So I will instead speak the truth on what happened during that particular Nagafen raid. <br>
<br>
    Two points I am going to make very clear.<br>
1. I was very unhappy with the way the raid was being run. Both myself, as well as numberous others on the raid who sent /tells to me made that clear. I did consider dropping from the raid however making it back through bugs w/o sow and w/o training the zone was nearly impossible. I stuck with it *even* after the raid leader called for the enchanters to mana sieve HER ( referring to Lord nagafen, a warrior class dragon).<br>
<br>
2. I did NOT ask, call or demand our group's druid and only healer to gate us out. 1 mintute before we were to charge our group's druid said this was taking too long and she needed to go now so she could log out and make get to her job for which she was already late. Apon casting she then said for those who want to stay better disband ( she made it apparent she was evacing out and not gg'ing. This left enough time for me to /ooc the group was getting gg'd out. Last thing I heard was we're going in 45 seconds.... then charge....loading please wait and we were out. The druid promptly /q out and the last bit of news I heard was the groups that went got slaughtered.<br>
<br>
    The facts. One, the raid itself was one of the worse ran raids I had ever been on. I am pretty familar with the buffing/general attack plan on handleing vox/nagafen. I'm not flaming the leader, for all I know it might had been his first raid. However I would have been more then happy to offer advice if the leader was willing to accept it. Seccondily, I did not agree with the druid gating the entire group out. Yes, I did not disband nor did anyone else from that group. We all knew we would have been left to continue the raid w/o a single healer. And many of us had been on successful raids before and no one had an ouch of confidence in the raid leader, especially after calling for the enchanters to mana sieve a mob which has no mana. It's not hard to see why those in that group did not disband and just took the gate out. Right or wrong, that could be debated.<br>
<br>
    Boofy, whatever comes of this, I hope you get what you deserve from your guild leader. I heard she was not pleased with your behavior and since it was made apparent to me this is not the first time you viciosly attacked someone with false claims in game, I  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uphoenixxspiritwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phoenixx Spiritwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#939393>(2/7/01 12:08:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Con't</span><hr size=1> I will ensure your name will be blacklisted for immature, childish behavior and for posting flames that don't hold an ouch of creditability.<br>
<br>
    I'm also rather disguested with the responses by some who know of me. I have been playing this game almost since day one of it's release. I've built a crediable reputation as a good guy which always treated everyone if he or she was a rl friend. My guild is equally crediable. We had one of the oldest running guilds on Mithianiel Marr ( Lost Alliance), a guild which was known to always go out of it's way.<br>
<br>
    So before you go off believing some rant about or this person or that person who did this or that, you may wish to raise the question of crediability of the poster first and leave the truth to be decided by the full story, not just one side of it.<br>

<br>
2) You should of disbanded the group.  You could of saved everyone else from leaving and formed a backup group atleast.<br>
<br>
3) You need to learn how to lead a group.  Letting your druid evact out means you had no control over the group, which is just &quot;Newbie&quot; mistakes.<br>
<br>
4) You have the weight of eveyone's death and time spent for REZ's on your shoulders.  With your group, we would of stood a better chance at defeating Nagafen.  Instead we lost.<br>
<br>
5)  The raid was going fine.  Min. deaths with FG's, and no complaints.  The ONLY problem was the amount of LD's which has NOTHING to due with how the raid was put together, carried out, or ended.<br>
<br>
6) If you had a problem with Naggy being Mana Sieved, you should of informed Hunkung of the situation, and Hunkung would of understood.<br>
<br>
Phoenixx, because of your's and your groups actions, I seriously doubt that I will have as great a problem of being invited on a raid as much as you will.<br>

<br>
But I will respond to two things.<br>
<br>
     First, attempting to flame me for an event I had no control over is utter bs. If you think disbanding the group was the way to go, perhaps it was. However, I spent much time trying to convince hunkung that if our group was going to survive and do any kind of real damage that we needed a cleric. It took several tells/suggestions before he finally brought one in. And that was a cleric which soon disbanded because she thought the raid was taking too long leaving our group with a single healer once again.<br>
<br>
     Secondly, to try to use the group's departure from the raid as the reason it failed, and to blame us for the time involved for CR is again childish and immature. Any raid and any member going on a raid knows CR is often inevitable part of the whole raid process. It's an obvious attempt at trying to cover up your raid leaders inexperience and lack or preparing a good raid. You want to learn how to run a good raid. Start with a competent leader. Gell of Crimson Twilight lead some of the best raids I had ever been on. So when the call to mana sieve a non magic using mob was called, my confidence hit 0% as well as many others in those leading this raid getting the job done.<br>
<br>
     Now before you get all red in the face and ready to write another barrage of flames, sit on your hands for a moment and realize that though the gating out last mintute was inappropriate and wrong ( and I am sure the druid likely regrets it now), your attempts to flame me and hold me responsible for the overall failure of the raid is equally wrong.<br>
<br>
      You have the truth and I am not going to further engage you in senseless posts to try to twist your story to make it sound as if I intentionally ruined your raid. If you wish to try to smudge my public image, there's nothing I can do to stop you. However, alot know me and many would vouched that I have always put forward my best efforts to try to help those that needed it and would accept it. I have yet to hear anything positive about you. You seem to have a reputation for shooting your mouth off faster then you think and I believe your first post reflects that.<br>
<br>
       Feel free to continue to stir up trouble in hopes someone out there is listening. I've defended myself and spoke of what happened. I'm sorry if you can't see beyond your own immaturity.<br>
<br>

You were going to die anyway.  Why not take it for the raid.  A few thousand extra hp's to displace among tanks could of saved our asses, plus a few extra DD's might have helped to drop Naggy.<br>
<br>
Who cares if you didn't have a cleric?  Are you that much of a pussy?  Just run in, swing till you die, and stop complaining.  You were getting a rez anyway right?  You could of done something, but you didn't.<br>
<br>
If you had any intelligence, you would of disbanded the group, reformed with out the druid.  Big loss.  My group didn't have a cleric.  Yeah, I could heal, but I dropped before I got one heal off.<br>
<br>
Now read this very carefully:  Naggy attacks random people.  And unless your a fully buffed tank, your gonna drop as soon as he aggro's on ya.  So what?  Here's a senerio:<br>
Naggy hits you for 225<br>
Naggy hits you for 225<br>
Naggy AE's for some huge amount of damage<br>
Cleric begins to cast heal<br>
Naggy kills cleric<br>
Naggy hits you for some more damage, killing you.<br>
<br>
Come on Phoenixx...  Everyone goes into a Naggy raid pretty much expecting to die.  Don't be so nieve thinking that a cleric in your group is going to make that much of a difference.  Naggy fights are 2 or 3 mins long if you win.  That's maybe 1 or 2 heals that cleric get's off (If that) before Naggy kills the cleric.<br>
<br>
Come on...  That's why the casters are supposed to bind themselves near the dragon lairs.  Raid leaders are 99% sure that the casters are going to die.  Casters aren't worried about dying.  They go into the raid knowing that they have a really good chance of it.  They just know it's a team effort, and even though they die, what they will of done while they were living (most likely DDing Naggy) will reflect on a dead dragon later.<br>
<br>
Phoenixx..  I think your just a wuss.  Nothing personal, but I think your just to chicken to die.  Like you knew this raid wasn't put together well enough for you to just sit back and do nothing.  You knew you had to fight, and you got scared.  Your a wuss.<br>
<br>
Sorry man.  Call me whatever you want.  Your still a wuss.<br>
<br>
Boofy<br>
<br>
P.S. Alot of my guild members (Edge of Sanity) were at that Naggy raid (Including the raid leader Hunkung) and they disapprove of your actions that night as much as I did, so I fear you will be very dissapointed when you hear how I have been &quot;punished&quot;.  Realize Phoenixx, that what you did upset nearly every Edge of Sanity member out there, including Hunkung.<br>
<br>
Just admit man...You were and are wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uemberhawkwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ember Hawkwing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#939393>(2/8/01 9:51:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Boofy</span><hr size=1> Let it be known that if you are a representative for your guild then I really feel sorry for Edge of Sanity. <br>
I am addressing two issues here:  <br>
<br>
1)  What you said to Cerridwin one night was one of the meanest, most vicious things that anyone has ever said to anyone in EQ that I have heard so far, and if she had not been new to EQ and had known how to take a screenshot of the conversation that night, you would have been banned from EQ.  (It was a bannable offense.)  I have personally known Cerridwin for 20 years and she is the nicest person that I have ever met so far in my lifetime.<br>
<br>
Your guild leader may not have taken action against you, but let it be known that unless you make a personal apology to Cerridwin, I will personally notify every single person/guild leaders/guilds that I know and let them know that a boycott of you and your characters is being put in place.<br>
<br>
2) Maybe Phoenixx made a mistake by not staying that night but the way you went about blasting him and the name calling is by far worse than him not staying and also there were a total of 6 people in group, not just two.  I stayed behind without a group before and it took 4 hours for me to get my body back when everyone else took 2 to 3.  I had to call on a Necro friend to get my body back for me.  Groupless people tend not to get the assistance that others with a group get.  I was also told that the Druid hit gate and he only had seconds to do an ooc.  Hard to hit disband, type message and notify others about staying or going when you see the gate being cast.  And yes, I would have been worried if I saw someone say mana sieve a mob that had no mana.  It would show me that they were trying to run a raid that they had not been on before or they would have known more about what they were fighting.<br>
<br>
I have quite a few friends in Edge of Sanity and I will not hold the entire guild responsible for your actions, however, remember that we are not the only guilds that read messages here and members do reflect what a guild is made of and what it tolerates from its members.<br>
<br>
I hope you will take my words of caution to heart and become a better person but if not then I am sorry for you and you will reap what you dish out in the long run.<br>

<br>
it was stated numerous times that members of grps had to leave and it was taking to long to kill naggy....you have to realize people in diffrent time zones, diffrent work schedules, etc..have RL things to do...i know i cant call in to work the day of my shift and tell them my naggy raid is taking to long, or go in tired and say i was up all night playing EQ, if you need to find more people to grp with and raid with in a time schedule that you play in.<br>
<br>
the grp said they were gatting long before the charge, although i think there was time to disband there was also more advanced notice to people to redo the grps and not charge right away<br>
<br>
i could tell from the onset that they were not going to kill naggy, i was listening to the public chat channels in sol b..mana sieve naggy? thats nuts, wait thats vox..i dont blame the people for leaving, they had to sleep or go to work and hours of CR probably wasnt what they wanted to do at the end or beginning of the day.<br>
<br>
although i dont find it good raid ettiquitte to gate out, if you go on a raid you better damn well make sure you have the time to finish it, it also should have been brought to the attention of the leader what errors he was making(i mean hey he did try to let some people have some fun right?), i no my grp was trying to help in /ooc with some strategy.<br>
<br>
the flames here do nothing really but piss people off and cause bad blood<br>
<br>
what have we learned..people have a diffrent balance of EQ time and RL time, and these times are sometimes not consistant with another persons time zones..plain and simple let it go..the dragons will be there another day to raid and kill<br>

<br>
Fear raid. I got death touched by cazic thule for 7 Damn times.<br>
<br>
You know, It was funny the first 3 times, but It was just annoying the last 4.<br>
<br>
You have to expect to die. If you got your resistances up to  200+, then you wouldn't have to worry about AE damage.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO ME.<br>
<br>
At level 52...the last time went to a nagafen raid, I didn't Die...My Resistances were as follows.<br>
<br>
Magic = 245<br>
Fire = 190<br>
<br>
Enchanter casted rune IV on me....<br>
<br>
Cleric had buffs on me,<br>
shamen had buffs...<br>
<br>
<br>
I had alot of hit points, but I didn't lose a single bubble, because I kept my resistances up.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for gating out when you people are charging in....that's just messed up and you know it.<br>
<br>
YOU DON&quot;T SCREW PEOPLE OVER LIKE THAT.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's why boofy's pissed off. Because you screwd him and everyone who stayed over. He had to find a necro to summon his corpse, then get a resurection....and he and many others could have saved hours, if you guys would have just bit the bullet, and decided to help.<br>
<br>
<br>
From my past experiences, you've been pretty cool Phoenixx, but gating on a raid is not cool. Those people you raid nagafen with will be the same people that you raid traknon and VS with....and they won't take you on raids if you gain a reputation as a person who chickens out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope next time you don't make the same mistakes.<br>
<br>

You say he is bad leader for letting his druid gate out.  But my question is: What is he supposed to do? If the druid had to go to work then they had to go to work (food money is more important than EQ), that is beyond Phoenixx's control. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=yana>Yana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#939393>(2/9/01 1:02:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame Phoniexx (sp) You fuckin bitch!</span><hr size=1> Hey, just one question in all of this ???<br>

<br>
and yes when i go on raids i expect to die, sometimes it happens more then id like, but hey thats life...and i make sure that i have a full day to stay, sometimes it takes longer....i remember pre-51+ having to do cr in fear for a friends failed raid, i lost 3 levels dragging everyones corpse to the zone in, then had to explain how to get rezzed out when your looting your shit.<br>
<br>
like i said, his group maybe didnt do the best thing to do to the raid as a whole, but they probably did the best thing to each of them as idividuals, people have RL stuff to do, work.school.life in general, and spending another few hours doing CR after a failed naggy raid would have been very frustrating to them..yea even with the grp i dont think naggy would have fallen...it would have just been 6 more people that needed thier corpses, and more money laid out from the raid.<br>

<br>
If a person has to go, they don't wait till the last minute on a raid. You tell everyone, I have to go, while they are buffing, or retreiving corpses...that's the real way to do it.<br>
<br>
They picked the most in appropriete time to go. but that's just my view. I mean, in most cases, the person know's they have to leave for a while...say you have to go to work at 6am....well if you're raiding, and it's 5am, then you better go. Don't wait till 5:45am to say, hey guys, I need to go to work...bye /casts gate.<br>
<br>
Tell them at 5am when you aren't fighting anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm done.<br>
