<br>
People are aware that I am not best friends with Matona ever since she decided to snipe a benefit raid which was being formed for the sole purpose of showing the Old World Dragon Raiding populace's appretiation for one of the longest running raiders, Kammolin.  Matona was informed that this raid was being run, knew that it had been posted and was a special event, and decided to run her raid anyway.  She also lied about Kammolin telling her she could run her raid regardless.  But this is not what I was going to talk about.<br>
<br>
My first encounter with Matona was on a failed Vox raid I led.  We spent an hour trying to wake her up after a nasty CR so that we could retrieve her body from the pits.  We did not succeed and ended up having to leave her there.  I felt bad at the time.  If I only knew then what I know now.<br>
<br>
The following is a log of a conversation held with Matona a couple of weeks ago, about three weeks after the above failed raid.  For background, the Vox raid in question had been publicised on a number of boards, including UGoD.  This should serve to illustrate a number of Matona's... erm... less likable features.  Times are in GMT (8 hours ahead of PST).<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:14 2001] You told matona, 'I am forming Vox now'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:14 2001] Matona tells you, 'AFK Message: Vox at 1pm est, leave a message after the beep:)'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:18 2001] Matona tells you, 'omg'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:20 2001] Matona tells you, 'wtf'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:28 2001] You told Matona, 'It was posted'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:28 2001] Matona tells you, 'AFK Message: Vox at 1pm est, leave a message after the beep:)'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:31 2001] Matona tells you, 'i read the fuckingboard last night, galuv had dibs'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:38 2001] Matona tells you, 'i talk to galuvian he say he cant go'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:54 2001] You told Matona, 'He went last night and failed.  You went last night and failed.  so I go today and succeed *8)'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:40:59 2001] Matona tells you, 'i didnt go'<br>
<br>
This was, apparently, a lie.  Matona tried and failed to lead a raid the night before.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:43:42 2001] Matona tells you, 'gl anyways though'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:43:47 2001] You told Matona, 'Want to join in?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:43:54 2001] Matona tells you, 'your kidding right?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:43:59 2001] You told Matona, 'no'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:44:03 2001] Matona tells you, 'not a chance'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:44:06 2001] You told Matona, 'ok'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:03 2001] You told Matona, 'I know that you are a liability, you go LD or fall asleep at the keyboard at bad moments and are a bugger to CR for but I'm a generous soul at heart'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:16 2001] Matona tells you, 'lol ok thnks so much'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:21 2001] You told Matona, 'any time'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:37 2001] Matona tells you, 'most people are going to be here at 1pm est'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:55 2001] You told Matona, 'Well I posted the raid would be european time zone i.e. early US afternoon so that's fine'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:45:56 2001] Matona tells you, 'you might as well take over because youll just stand here and shout until you get ure way anyway'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:46:06 2001] Matona tells you, 'yeah i just read it, and one person signed up'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:46:22 2001] You told Matona, 'Was only posted this morning early US time so not many people have had a chance to read it yet'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:53:07 2001] Matona tells you, 'sorry two people'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:53:17 2001] You told Matona, '?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:53:21 2001] Matona tells you, 'signed up'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:53:24 2001] You told Matona, 'so?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:53:50 2001] Matona tells you, 'so imgoingnow'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 16:54:02 2001] You told Matona, 'given that the last raid I tried to run on Naggy had 20+ people signed up and you ran a raid anyway I fail to see the significance'<br>
<br>
There then followed a very, very long pause.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:07:47 2001] Matona tells you, 'its not gonna matter today'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:07:53 2001] You told Matona, '?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:07:59 2001] Matona tells you, 'neither of us can get enough clerics/chanters right now lol'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:08:15 2001] You told Matona, 'Wasn;t planning on going right now though.'<br>
<br>
And after this people started turning up.  Just a trickle but enough.  And almost all of them because I had been sending tells all the way to Permafrost where the rest of this conversation took place.  The next bit is a tad dry but included because I am not going to be accused of editiing out relevant info.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:24:57 2001] Matona tells you, 'we can combine people that want to go'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:25:02 2001] Matona tells you, 'and go'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:25:16 2001] You told Matona, 'Won;t work.  You were right.  Defintiely not enough people yet'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:25:46 2001] Matona tells you, 'nepherius is logging back on at 130pm est to go, ytin is supposed to do the same'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:25:56 2001] Matona tells you, 'and i can get dhkar to go, thats three chanters'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:26:03 2001] You told Matona, 'levels?'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:26:07 2001] Matona tells you, 'above 49'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:29:40 2001] Matona tells you, 'can prolly get a 60monk to pull also'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:29:52 2001] You told Matona, 'very bad idea'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:29:58 2001] Matona tells you, 'to pull lair imean'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:30:10 2001] Matona tells you, 'had ranis do it before he 58, went fast'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:30:14 2001] You told Matona, 'If vox agros on the monk he will be TLed out.  As I said, bad idea'<br>
<br>
I logged in an alt to announce the raid in Freeport and relogged Trewayn.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:41:13 2001] Matona tells you, 'not enough cleric, no matter who else oyu get or how many alts you log on to shout'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:41:31 2001] You told Matona, 'thank you for your concern.  It has been noted'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:41:55 2001] Matona tells you, 'see your being a rude arrogant prick attitude is what makes me stat these raids in the fist place'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:42:09 2001] Matona tells you, 'now i will make what groups i can and come out there just to fuck iwth you'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:42:16 2001] Reporting last 10 lines in chat display concerning Matona.<br>
<br>
Heh, just love that &quot;/report Matona&quot; command.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:43:19 2001] You told Matona, 'Actually, that was a firm but polit reply.  You were obviously looking for any excuse'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:43:34 2001] Matona tells you, 'thats it'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:43:46 2001] You told Matona, 'makes no odds really.  '<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:00 2001] Matona tells you, 'sureit does,ill just keep agroing dragon so u can go'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:02 2001] Matona tells you, 'itsnot hard'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:09 2001] Matona tells you, 'your such a feeble minded prick'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:18 2001] You told Matona, 'True, and I thought you would do that last time which is why there was a GM watching the proceedings'<br>
<br>
&quot;Last time&quot; was the previous week where something similar occured.  And yes, there really was a GM watching simply because I thought Matona may try to do something questionable.<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:32 2001] Matona tells you, 'dont really matter if i do lol'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:44:59 2001] You told Matona, 'anyway, this conversation is now at an end.  I reported your last few lines of text.  Please refrain from any more harrassment or I will just pop you on ignore'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:45:36 2001] Matona tells you, 'yadayadayada if you really did report, i have all logs of our conversations/your openly harrassingme on shout also that we can turn in'<br>
[Fri Jul 20 17:45:58 2001] You told Matona, 'Fine by me, go ahead'<br>
<br>
And that is where the conversation ended.  The funny thing is I allowed Matona to join the raid anyway after this and even had her in my own group.  Anyone who suggests that this was because I wanted to make absolutely sure I knew where she was and what she was doing is probably blowing things up out of all proportion.  Probably.<br>
<br>
We still do not know who trained the bears in the pits onto the raid party after Vox died, wiping out the entire raid.  Matona was nowhere to be seen when we started the CR.  Neither was her corpse, if she even died.<br>
<br>
Now, given that Matona has openly admitted she lets her boyfriend use her account I have no idea who I was conducting this conversation with.  It may have been Lisa.  It may have been her boyfriend Chad.  There is absolutely no way for me to tell.  One thing is certain, though.  One of these people is  *EDIT* Don't want to be accused of libel *EDIT* who I would not trust to run an xp group let alone a full raid.  As there is no way of discerning who runs the account at any one time I simply tell all my friends and guildies to steer clear of any raids run by the Matona character.  It is always better to be safe than sorry.  The funny thing is, those of my friends who I have not been able to talk to have all reached the same conclusion.<br>
<br>
At least now the rest of the server seems to be coming around as well.<br>
