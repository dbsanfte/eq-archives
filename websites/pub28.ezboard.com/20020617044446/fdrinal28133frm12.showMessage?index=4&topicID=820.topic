In game 3(I think) of that same series back in 96 one of the russians thugs on Detroit (Konstantinov maybe) checked Adam Foote away from the play and grabbed the back of his head, and rammed it into the glass. Foote got up with blood pouring down his face looking for a ref to call a penalty (easily a double minor). Since it was away from the play, the ref's didn't see it and didn't call a penalty. I'm pretty sure it was in Denver, which means it had to be game 3 or 4 (Detroit had home ice that year). Yes, you are so right to praise Konstantinov (if that's who I'm thinking of that did this). That's pure class to ram a guys head into the glass with your hand when you know the refs aren't looking.<br>
<br>
The Draper incident was in game 6 of that series I believe. Yes Lemieux's hit was cheap, but Draper was a dumbass to have his head down next to the boards when he had the puck anyway. He was asking to get hit. Anyway neither Lemieux or Konstantinov are playing for those teams anymore. Konstantinov is the one that got paralyzed in a limo wreck, right? I don't remember who Lemieux plays for now, but I think he's still playing for some eastern conference team (not New Jersey).<br>
<br>
Now, you say the entire Av's team is cowards because of one players actions? Even though that player has not played for Colorado in at least 3 years? Get over it. Players like Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Chris Drury, Milan Hejduk, Rob Blake and Adam Foote are pure class. Both teams have outstanding players and most of them are classy guys. I respect Yzerman, Shanahan, Hasek, Larionov and I don't hold Konstantinov's cheap shot on Foote against the entire team.  One players bad decision should not reflect the entire teams reputation, especially if he doesn't even play for that team anymore. Move on. <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>

As for the rest of the players?  Forsberg, commin right into the playoffs after a season injured.....that boy has talent.  Heydue, or heidue, or whatever....  Had the most shots for the avs in the wings series...not one goal...  Boy needs some practice...  Drury.... scores when we need it...good for OT...but shit, not for anything else...  Adam Foote.... STAY out of the penalty box...  As for the Wings...  They aren't to bad...  42 saves a game doesn't mean that Roy is an awesome goalie....  it means Avs defense blows.<br>

He was a dumb ass for having his head down? <br>
<br>
That condones having your jaw broke? We arent talking a bloody nose here, we are talking he got mulched. Not even close to the same thing.<br>
<br>
Did a single person ever say..we are sorry he did that to Draper? I sure dont remember ever reading it. I know if I did something to a person that inflicted that type of damage, I would have been the first in line to say I was sorry it happened.<br>
<br>
O well..I guess there are 2 sides to every story.<br>
<br>
If ONE person from that org would have stepped up, then I wouldnt have a problem with the Avs. Matter of fact I would respect em as a winning type franchise. They have a few players I am sure will make the hall someday and Joy Boy Roy is arguably the best of all time.  But they didnt step up. I am sure the Broncos would have apologized for doing something like this. The Romo spitting in the face incident had an apology and no physical damage was done. Colorado has one team I respect...Nuff said<br>
<br>
Bottom line..<br>
Your team got their arse spanked..the better team won. <br>
As soon as the blisters subside, they can have a celebration for being runner up in the conference. Damn that shut out must have hurt.<br>

<br>
You said it was a cheap shot...but you also brought up the bloody nose which was an attempt at saying..Detroit started it by doing this bad thing.<br>
<br>
Palming others faces, spraying the goalies face with ice when he is down, etc..it is all part of hockey. Getting minor injuries is probably what makes the game so exciting to a lot of fans.<br>
<br>
But the serious stuff makes ya stick your head up and say WTF.<br>
I think it was Dale Hunter that gave that check during the playoffs a few yrs ago after a goal was scored. Dislocated/seperated the players shoulder. He received a 21 game suspension the next yr.<br>
<br>
If a Vladdy or ruff type player had been the one hit, then  an arguement could of been made for what happened. But it was a little guy that plays clean hockey who got railed.If Sakic(or even a much less talented but clean playing Av) had been the one with his face mangled, you would understand where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
In EQ terms it would be training a low lvl grp and giving em a TPW then saying...they shouldnt have been there. They hadnt ever been guilty of KSing ya or anything, but just happened to be in the wrong place. No legitimate justification to say... Serves em right... rather than..I am sorry and can I help ya in any way.<br>
<br>
O well..you have your views and I have mine...just as you have your team you enjoy. I just dont happen to think very highly of the Avs franchise. You on the other hand owe the Avs 2 cups to Det. If we didnt have the ability to light Roy up like a rented pinball machine, he would never have ended up with the Avs. They wouldnt be half the team they are without him between the pipes, and I would be his biggest fan myself if he played for my team..although the Dominator looks pretty damn good right now.<br>
<br>
I will give YOU props though Jing...even though I dont agree with ya about the Avs having class(I acknowledge their talent), you have the kahunas to stand up and speak on behalf of your team. I am sure you will have plenty to cheer for in the next few yrs when Det has retired a number of the superstars on our team. There wont be many teams out there that can run with the Avs then.<br>
<br>
I am finished with this thread...it was nice to vent some emotion over my bitterness. Although Draper isnt my fav player on the Wings(Stevie Y is), I think he is THE best player whose contract was bought for a whole dollar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hooty<br>
<br>
BTW<br>
I know a couple of Wings players in the last 10 yrs havent been the cleanest of players. Chelios was hated by all Wings fans till he came here... cause he does play dirty. But damn he roxors when he is playing for ya. Vladdy also was known for some crazy antics. But he could also deliver VERY solid CLEAN hits as well. I think it was Brindamour from the Flyers in the cup finals a few yrs ago that he put out of the series with a solid clean hit at center ice. Every time he was on the ice, the other team always had their head up. When he was grped with the rest of the Russian 5, they could move the puck better than most any unit  known in the last 10 yrs. It was very saddening when that accident happened. It was also a big loss..at the time he was a better defenseman than Lidstrom IMO.<br>
<br>
The craziest Wing I can remember in my 13 yrs of following  Wings Hockey was Bob Probert(coke head himself). No  self control whatsoever . The Probert-Domi fight will go down as one of the best of all time. His time as Heavy Weight Champ of the NHL was something else. It was Bowman who wanted him gone I think...and we have been a much better team since we went to finese solid hockey and no goon-only players.<br>
