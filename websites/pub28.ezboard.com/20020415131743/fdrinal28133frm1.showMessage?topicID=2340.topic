<br>
Now...my name is Ralithaine and i hunt primarily on ORC HILL and CB entrance. I have just VERY recently hit 10lvl, and some of my concerns is this...its seems as tho i am only saving money to buy my spells and very mediocre equiptment. There has to be a way to make more PP. CB belts like i said has only givin me my spells and robes and a weapon. (gossamer robes @ walrus tooth) all the rest of my equiptment i made (raw silk and INT rings). And now im gettin close to 12 lvl and im finding that i wont have more that 14PP to work with (considering i have 12GP now...sigh). So, in reference to that...is there any places around where i am...or maybe far from where i am that i can make &quot;quick&quot; platinum? By the  way i am an Enchanter...didnt mention that earlier. I noticed all the more experienced players bidding things in 2kPP range???? At first i thought they were &quot;physically&quot; buying them at playersauction.com...but when i asked they said it took time. But if you look at them and there CONS...they were only yellow to me???? and im not goin to mention the &quot;awesome&quot; equiptment they had...sigh.<br>
Sorry, but i have another question...this is basically a strategy question. I have heard that it is good to travel in a group, but to me it seems that i dont get &quot;any&quot; training in my weapon and my pet just stands around. I have only grouped 1 time and i found that lvling was &quot;impossible&quot; and loot was rare. My question is for &quot;EXPERIENCED&quot; players...Since you have been playing have you ever decided to go solo with an enchanter? If so, did you ever attempt to solo his career? And if so, did you find benifits or hinderences? Like did your weapon and DD spells skill sharply increase or was it a pain in the &quot;rear&quot;? Sorry the post was so long and drawn out but i really need an inteligent answer before i decide what im gonna do. (And the PP thing is REALLY boggin my brain) I went all the way to WC and fought Willo Wisps from 6lvl all the way to 10lvl and didnt get ONE greater light stone like my friend told me to do for quick PP and faction....cry.... pleeeez help me)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 8:19:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2340.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ridgenet.net/~opticman/tincanhead.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I have i guess newb questions</span><hr size=1> 1)  Those people bidding on 2kpp items that conned yellow to you were probably alternate characters of higher level characters.  Sometimes their main character is way off in BFE, so it's easier to use an alt to do auctions.  <br>
<br>
2)  I wouldn't worry so much about PP right now.  You'll be more helped by improving your playing skills than by buying nice items.  If you want, however, you can explore the fascinating world of making jewelry.  This, I think, is how most enchanters get their money.  You may also want to try fighting orcs in high pass.  Shiny brass idol drops there, which is usually in high demand by higher level characters, so you can sell them for 50-60pp a pop in north fp.  And just so you know, I don't think I ever had more than 100pp at any given time until after my SK hit about level 45.  That was a long time ago, though, and even though he's level 60, I don't think I have more than 1kpp on all four of my characters combined.<br>
<br>
3)  It is possible to solo enchanters, as it is with all the classes.  Enchanters are one of the tougher classes to solo with, but if you know how to play one then soloing with them becomes fairly simple.  However, there is no doubt that enchanters are made for groups.  Groups work so much faster with a well-played enchanter in them.  You'll also find that the higher level you get, the harder it will become to get exp fast if you're soloing.  I started an enchanter a while ago (think he's lvl 21 now), and it seemed that exp started coming faster in groups starting around level 12ish.  <br>
<br>
Hope this helps =)<br>

<br>
As a preface, I’ll tell you that I mainly play a level 60 enchanter, although it wasn’t my first character.  So while I’ll have some basis to talk to you as an enchanter, I didn’t play the early levels at the same time I was learning how to play the game in general.<br>
<br>
Almost everybody in the game has gone through what you’re going through, especially regarding money.  At low levels it’s almost impossible to earn enough to not feel worried about how you will buy your next set of spells.  I remember feeling like you do, that I just couldn’t imagine having 100 pp let alone the thousands that people were paying for items.  I will say that it gets better, but not until much later in the game.  I think I was level 35-40 before money started becoming less of an issue, although it never goes away entirely for most of us.<br>
<br>
And as to those people you see with awesome gear and lots of money at lower levels, be assured that they didn’t obtain that gear &amp; money with the low level character.  Many people, myself included, buy gear with money we earned with our higher level characters and give it to our lower level characters.  It’s called twinking.  Some people think it’s bad to do it, but it’s a very common practice.<br>
<br>
As for buying your next spells, two possible options for you would be to kill skeletons for bone chips and try to sell them to players, or to repeatedly deliver mail from felwith to kelethin.  Both options are boring, but they would eventually let you get your spells.<br>
<br>
As for grouping, I also remember being very reluctant to group.  My very first character was a ranger, and I was almost lvl 10 before I ever got in a group.  It was a disaster.  But grouping, especially for an enchanter, is almost essential, especially as you increase in level.  Enchanters don’t specialize in doing things directly.  They don’t fight well.  They don’t nuke well.  Their pets are of limited value.  They can’t heal. What then can do, however, is affect their environment, and they do that well.  One of the keys to being a successful enchanter is making sure you have plenty of environment to affect.  one orc + you doesn’t leave you very much to affect, but several orcs + five group members + you gives you a lot to work with.  Basically, I’m saying that enchanters are poor soloers, although it can be done at lower levels, but awesome in groups.  But learning to be an effective group is harder then learning how to solo.  Just make sure that the loot is being shared fairly.<br>

<br>
If you need cash, the best thing to do is find things that con green that carry weapons.  You can get up to 5gp for some rusty weapons, and it adds up pretty quick when you need spell money.  Also, another option is to start grouping in North Ro/West Commons/South Ro and kill Dervish Cutthroats.  They drop bronze, which sell to vendors for a few pp at a time.  <br>
<br>
Once you are in your mid-teens, head to Ocean of Tears and slaughter the Sisters of Erolisi.  They almost always drop a purity belt, which sells to vendors for around 5pp each, plus they can drop close to 1p in cash.  Once those go green, swim across to Spectre island and kill the gargoyles into your lower 20s.  They drop up to 3 stackable eyes, which sell for around 11pp each, and they drop them a LOT.  Don't worry about the wood elves hating you, because you can likely just illusion into a high elf (if you arent already) and sell at the top of the tower on the island just next to &quot;Sister Island&quot; where the Ancient Cyclops spawns.  BTW, when you finish killing gargs for the day, be sure to keep at least 1 up.  The skeletons on the isle are placeholders for a garg spawn, but luckily the gargs kill them on site, so leaving at least one up guarantees at least a full spawn when you return.<br>
<br>
As far as spells, once you hit lvl 12 and get Languid pace, you should always have a slow spell up while you are solo.  You don't have many hit points, and your pet has even less.  A hasted pet and slowed monster will be much easier for you to kill, but still expect to jump in and tank (take damage) for your pet.  Whenever you pull a monster, pull it with slow instead of tash (unless it is known to be really resistant).  Let it hit you, then back away slowly to let pet get aggro.  Once he's got it, toss your DoT (damage over time) spell on the monster, then engage the monster with melee/nukes.  Use root to keep the monster in place, because it makes it easier for you to step in and tank for your pet, then step away when you need to bandage yourself.<br>
<br>
You'll be mid-20s after the gargoyles go green, and from there you can choose to head to popular places like Lake of Ill Omen or South Karana, but you'll know your limits of what you can handle if you decide to continue solo'ing.  At level 29 you can hand your pet an extra weapon for him to dual wield, which increases his damage output by around 70%.<br>
<br>
If you have specific questions, feel free to look me up in game.<br>

You get more later, but those are the ones you have available to you.  They don't stack, so make sure you use the highest level one you have.  The lvl 1 and 4 ones are fairly useless, but once they start doing more damage, it helps.  <br>

Your direct damage spells are totally unefficient as far as mana-to-damage, so dont over nuke unless you really need to.

<br>
As a high elf Enchantress I solo'd until level 16 because I could never get a group before that. Until I got level 16 I pretty much stayed in the faydark continent. If you are level 10 now you can probably go to steamfont hills and kill the skeletons there or even some elementals and other things. You will of course need to be really careful because things can get out of hand pretty fast when they start to run away.<br>
<br>
At level 16 you can go to Lake of ill omen (you will want to go to FV anyways to get your first mana regen spell &quot;breeze&quot;) and fight at the mill area. I would suggest grouping also as an enchanting class. My experiences have found grouping in dungeons to be far more enjoyable for myself than grouping outside or solo'ing. =)<br>
<br>
Another thing that may help you with your money problems are to sell enchanted bars of silver. (I think you get enchant silver at level <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You can buy the silver bar for under 6 gold and then sell for 7 to 10 gold each after you enchant it. This will take time of course as the spell is 60 mana a shot and at level 10 you don't have all that much mana, but it is an option.<br>
<br>
As far as your being bound in Gfaydark and fighting in the commons area, I would suggest to get rebound in freeport so that when you die, (Yes we all die sooner or later) you won't have a huge distance and a boat ride to get back to your body.<br>
<br>
I also would advise against killing the sisters in ocean of tears because of the faction problem. If you are a high elf which it would look that you are because of fighting on orc hill and CB entrance you will have a heck of a time getting back to your guild to train and such when you are back in the high elf city. =)<br>
<br>
I really hope this helps some, and I hope that you also can understand how frustrating it can be to get a random tell from someone you don't know who is anon asking for a spell you can't even cast. More so when you have found someone doing something bad and they don't like the fact that you know.<br>

I will usually go anon and say to them in a tell that I don't have any money, but could I still get the sow or teleport or clarity or whatever, and they then say that no I can't because they need however much money for it. I then tell them that is a fee they are charging and not a donation, and if I am feeling particularly malevolent I will set up camp right near them and offer whatever buff they are doing (if I am capable of it) for free until they leave. I find that one ALWAYS annoying. I remember in the early days that I had the choice of charging for sow and other buffs, or offering them free. I chose to go to places folks of higher level than me would congregate and say that I was offering sow for free, but that donations would be gladly accepted so that I could afford my next spells or whatever. I gained a LOT more cash that way than by selling them for 10pp each. Sure some wont pay anything, and you would get the 2 gold and whatever type donations, but then sometimes someone would come up and tell ya they really appreciated the way you handled that and hand ya something big (at level 14 i got a 50pp donation once WOW, and another time I got a full backpack of fine steel weapons--Thanks Sean hehe).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, as for cash, everyone that is an actual new character at that level that does not have higher level friends that twink them and whatnot, goes through the same cashflow problems you do. Good luck to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
But for a new player, go for sister isle for pp.<br>
<br>
And listen to what Nodda said, I never had any till I was 50, and even now I only have 1400pp across a great mmany characters, the money wont come till later, but it will come. I say late 20's go to frontier mountain giant fort..thats where my newer characters started making money.<br>

As for the enc, I agree w/ Psykoth in OOT kill the sisters (Woodelves suck) and then goto the Gargs.  Good way to keep your cash flow for your spells, not getting lots but it's defintely enough to buy your spells and perhaps some gear.  <br>

<br>
You may also go to the Temple of Cazic Thule, lots of older players use it as a powerlvling ground.  You have two choices there, A. when you are in your early 20's (actually about 16+ if I remember right) you can get a group there and the mobs drop fine steal weapons *bring a good number of backpacks*.  Most people don't care about the fine steel stuff.  If you find someone in their powerlvling, it is likely they will have no issues with you looting the fs.<br>
<br>
Great way to fund yourself, wish I knew or thought about it when I was that lvl <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just be careful those lizards can create hella trains <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Or, if you go to Cazic and have spare cash, offer to buy FS weapons from people for 3 or 4 pp.  Load up, run out to Ogguk, illusion up, sell them to vendor for 5 pp or so.  You need cash up front, but you pull in more in the long run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for making jewelry, usually the big sellers are:  HP/mana gear, resists, wis, int, str items.  A few bards/chanters buy cha gear but hit point/mana and resists are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in high demand.<br>
<br>

<br>
Really though Steamfont does drop the lower valued gems too. If you think you may want to start in the jewelry thing then saving those gems may be a good start from the steamfont hills. Now if you really want to kill something that came out of faydwer, then go after those gnomes that make you give up pretty robes for broken pens! -lol- (The higher level enchanters know what I mean I'm sure)<br>
<br>
Another idea is to go to Unrest and run back and forth to there from Kaladim. That place drops a lot of weapons and armor that those pleveling normally don't loot/want. Of course that pretty much isn't safe to do until about level 20ish or so, the run can be rather hazardous. The entire donation for mana thing in my opinion is quite silly. Give me money when I do something good like make you jewelry, not because I sit down memorize a spell and cast it on you. -lol- Or even just right click an item that gives you an effect!<br>
<br>
Speaking of that off topic, has anyone ever tried to loot that rod that right clicks clarity in inventory from hateplane and not been an enchanter? I'm curious as to if it would work from say a wizard's inventory.<br>
<br>
I will say this though Ralithaine, you can be either really nice or really selfish. Both will end up with items in the long run, but the nicer people tend to enjoy the game longer as they have the friends to help them out. =)<br>
