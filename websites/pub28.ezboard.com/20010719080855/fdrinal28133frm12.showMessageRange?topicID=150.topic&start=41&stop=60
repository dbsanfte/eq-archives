<br>
Bannion you said:<br>
/quote<br>
I let him borrow my tunic till he got his from seb. <br>
<br>
Well, a week later I asked for it back.<br>
<br>
/endquote<br>
<br>
Was the contingency on the loaning that he get his from seb within a week? How did you get to the point of wanting it back that week? Did you get notifciation from him that he got his from Seb or were there other circumstances which caused you to want it back? Not that you don't deserve your own item back but what prompted the request? e.g. he made you mad, or you started to feel uneasy about the loan etc.<br>
<br>
Did the conversation go well when you initially asked for it back or did it spiral immediately in to an unproductive fight? Could that fight have resulted in any form of (maybe not acceptable) retaliation? At which point did he put you on ignore? Was it after you guys exchanged words? Did he know you were going to four zones or were you already on ignore due to some other unproductive discussion?<br>

Of cource, each time I ask him where he is, he tells me. Why do i ask? because e-bay thraxx is always anon. Each of the 4 times I tried, he logged when or before I got there. Its interesting that thraxx is now saying that he did his imaginary trade with me and that he did it 2 days earlier as he has tried to tell me he did it with an Alt, that I don't even had this past Sunday. I posted this Monday. Thraxx, how many lies must you tell before you start believing your lies? How far is too much. Evil Bannion? Please, you took an Item I agreed to let you use. Trevize, Domoguul, Vert, and seandar (different guilds) all saw me let you use the tunic. You whined to me the day I asked for it back that you could never win one. I have never used my guild tag or that I am a cleric to get anything done or to get me anywhere in this game. I don't have a soul on my ignroe list. I don't have enemies that I know of. I have made the error of trusting an ebay fool like you. I can live with that. No matter how hard you try, you will never make people hate me because I don't cheat people and I don't behave like you do.
