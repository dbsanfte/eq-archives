Synide read</span><hr size=1> Really Synide, would you like to tell me how you really feel about me now? LoL.<br><br>Let me quote what Synides last post to me in a previous thread was, here goes: <br>Oh ya, nila and sutekh took time to come help me in Charasis with my corpses. So fuck you balrak :p. <br>end quote<br><br>Remember, birds of a feather flock together, Synide it's funny your associated with a certain person there. Hence that rhyme makes perfect sense, now whats my point, well read on.<br><br>I forgot this isn't the free world, we can't come and have our own opinions on something here because Synide, or someone else, likes someone. So, that means we all should love them to. I forgot, what was I thinking to actually subject myself to a democratic policy and be honest with my opinion. Mind telling me what a flame board is for then?<br><br>A complete and total pun was intended there and making a mockery for which everything Synide stands for. As to &quot;fucking you&quot; as you so gracefully put it Synide, I'm sorry  I only step on the good foot and do the bad thing with the pretty ladies, not with men. Apparently you think all men like other men. Thank goodness I learned about the birds and the bees when I was younger, your just a prime example of how evolution skipped over you. How's it feel to live a life as just a boy, never more? Muhaha, grow up child and remember, next time you tell someone to do something, once again think before you type and speak, your brain and your hands are just digging you deeper and deeper into that hole you created for yourself. <br><br>You see simply put, you act like a kindergardener. You see all they do is call each other names but how often do they physically fight. Synide, I won't engage in a name calling dispute anymore, I enjoy sitting back letting you make a fool out of yourself and if I telling it like it is, angers you? Well guess what, name a time when I ever gave a shit about what you thought or what anyone else here thought about me when I came out and addressed a problem, it's often those who sound the alarms that get criticized, trouble is, I don't really care what you think about me, let me sing you a song or rehearse this rhyme. Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never harm me. Think about that next time you try to provoke me into another kindergarden name calling session.<br><br>I do admit, some days I am in the mood for a good debate and what better place to do it on then a EQ board. Right now is almost one of those times Synide, long day at work, come home sit down, have dinner then see a simple minded post such as yours. Really, I do sometimes think they should rename this board to Drinals Comedy Hour. Some of the fighting I see that goes on over a game is just to much to bear, to see adults who behave worse then a 2 year old. Mind you many do not here, but there are the select few and I must admit sometimes I tear into people, but when you step back and look at the big picture I often laughed and said, all that for a game? <br><br>Oh I have to laugh when I log on and I get a tell and people say HEY what's up, and I reply with a hello how are you? How did you know I was on. There reply usually is, ohh someone said it over guildchat, I have to laugh at least I did one thing, i've been a major impact on a community, some may like me some may not, I am not here to please everyone nor will I ever begin to try. It's about me taking that 989 each month and getting the most out of it. That's what counts. To the person who said I am the cause for the world gone bad? LoL, really, now tell me did you document that to? I am the cause to plague and famine, that's pretty funny, I never did read that entire post, I couldn't help but roll over and laugh so hard. I was almost begging for more, I printed that out and took that into work and put it up outside my office door and made sure everyone read it, it was sort of the memo of the day. It was truly amusing, then when a employee asked me where it came from, I explained that was from a game and someones description of me. She looked at me and began to laugh, as did I. Of course I had to shrug first. Take it for its face value and by all means happy flaming, but at least try to be grown up about it. Though I admit sometimes it's easy to sink to the lvl's of certain people here. *glares at Synides name, just to name one out of the dozens here*<br><br>I can't put Balrak there since I was speaking out of context from a role playing state and character.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulukasz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukasz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/920/07/29200752.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/01 6:08:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flaming, poetic or childish antics? Synide read</span><hr size=1> Childish antics you say.  Well, what would you call writing 2 page long manifestos about how everyones immature and you're an everquest (and beyond) idol/god.  I see you got into DAoC beta most likely.  Are you gonna be playing that 2 years into release with an average (being generous) character proclaiming how everyone should bow to you as you are an ELDER from phase 3 beta and justifying all your frowned upon actions with it?  <br><br>Anyways somewhere in that bible  of a post you said &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot;. Funny you say that because it makes absolutely no sense. Did you notice how he said that they came to help him with cr? So are they assholes or is Synide real nice? Well, just to answer my own question both of those assumptions are wrong. Sutekh and Nila are great people, and even if you didn't mean to badmouth Sutekh there and just tried to continue your spat with Nila (which is apparently your fault, but you don't think it is as you are justified by being an everquest GOD), you did attack him. Just had to point that out. Notice how im writing this like an instruction booklet and pointing everything out so you hopefully know what I'm saying. On to a second point... <br><br>(ctrl+c ctrl+v)<br><br>I've seen you around in EQ maybe 3 times in 2 years, and every single time you have managed to be a total asshole. I remember you cussing out newbies in Butcherblock when my cleric was lvling up there. I remember you kill stealing in Cazic. In fact, I was gonna come help the group you were harrassing as my rl friend was in it, but you left before I got there. Then there's the scattered idiotic ooc's I've heard with your name in front. <br><br>I can repeat the same thing over and over in new topics too.<br><br>edit:  Whats the point of this thread anyway?  Are you saying that Synide is immature because he hates you, is that it?  Hahah, I'm stumped<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulukasz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukasz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/920/07/29200752.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/21/01 6:15:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umaximusjudicar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maximus Judicar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/01 6:46:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Dear Luk</span><hr size=1> Blond dorfs suck! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umaximusjudicar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maximus Judicar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/21/01 6:47:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/01 10:17:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dear Luk</span><hr size=1> I came, I read, I laughed.<br><br>It was stupid, but thanks for the laugh..<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/22/01 12:40:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dear Luk</span><hr size=1>      Now that I actually read that.

Needless to say, dying became a common experience.  However, most of that death was to avoid training the group of pick-up raiders so they wouldn't die and lose exp or give up and leave early.  (This multi-death-per-night-sk-mother-fucker only had 1 train pulling PoH ever, except the night that AL was up there at the same time and were camped in such an area that their pulls would go through sw camp and our pulls would go through their camp the fucking morons)<br><br>this is leading somewhere, so bear with me and just enjoy the story<br><br>I think about the sweating palms, the piles of empty mtn dew cans around my desk, playing deep into the early morning hours, lack of sleep, the tells about 'pull xxx mob for my armor,' and the rest of the shit...all in an effort to get the people who went on those pick-up raids as much armor as I could possibly get them.  I recall clerics like Balrak up there, winning a piece of armor, then 5 minutes later saying 'I have to go,' and gating out.  Those were the best, because I didn't have much of a fucking choice about gating out when I wanted to or not.  Usually the raid would end before pullers could clear to the opposite corner (magi and enchanter stuff...that was always the goal) because too many clerics who didn't need stuff from opposite corner would log out (the exceptions are clerics like Saran and Soulus.  There were more who would try to stick around as long as possible, but those two I remember).  That pissed me off even more, because those enchanters worked their asses off as much as any cleric for a hell of a lot less reward (another good one was an enchanter freaking out over Niltim's Grimoire pg 376 while the cleric for his group said 'heh, cool' about getting a pair of boots after he had won a bp)<br><br>That's all a non-issue nowadays, tho.  A thing of the past.  No big deal.<br><br>What I want to know is, 1) How the FUCK did the Balrak that I remember get to be the best fucking cleric on the server?!<br>and 2) When the hell did he become such a fucking <br>know-it-all?<br><br><br>oh yeah, and thinking you can get away with flaming friends of mine like Nila because she's too good to respond in kind is a big mistake to make.  I'm so pissed to see this shit-stirring bs that I'm swearing in the post.<br><br><br>nodda<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 406<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/22/01 6:44:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> A) You wrote more than 1 paragraph and that is not legal here.<br><br>B) He thinks men are the superior race to women, and clearly has issues with women as a result. He is serious about this, and struggles to comprehend anything anotherwise.<br><br>C) I believe every one of those weird &quot;stalking&quot; stories I have seen other women write about him in here. Basis the whole 2 conversations I had with him, he apparently does live his life fully in the fantasy world and takes his relationships in EQ very seriously. He talked **extensively** of love lost etc. and for a while I thought he was talking about a real life person, but it was EQ. He did not even know me when he began the conversation and it was very misplaced.<br><br><br>With that information, I  assume that he is fairly insecure, probably not social in real life, and probably not well grounded in the outside world and true relationships. Use that information draw your own conclusions, but I usually just skim his posts and try to avoid flaming him because most of the time I feel sorry for him.<br><br>RE: Sutekh I have had 2 encounters with him, one as a newbie, and one through this web board. Those brief encounters proved him to be of good/sound/kind character. It is clear however that Balrak is speaking out of &quot;motive&quot; rather than knowledge, so the inflammatory comments about Sutekh can't be taken at face value. They are more about Balrak's inability to rationalize his on line affairs.<br><br>RE: &quot;Best Players&quot; The *best* players I ever met in this game, I can think of 6, a few are in Kindred now the others are in varied guilds. They were/are respectful, kind, risk-taking, articulate, attentive in game, always focused on doing the right thing, mature and fun. They are more often found giving away loot than bickering over it.  They would not do such things as leave a necro in neriak for 3 hours waiting to buy coffins, talk about people sucking their dicks in guild chat, speak to people out of disrespect,and make up bullshit or handle problem resolution though public web board. They are adventuresome and quick to make smart decisions in game. They smile in the face of failure and motivate people towards success. Guess everyone has their own idea of what is a good player. For me it stems much further than who can stay up the latest at night. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 4/22/01 7:15:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulukasz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukasz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/920/07/29200752.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/22/01 9:51:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Oh I took the time to finally read that garbage pile of a post, and I noticed you said you've had a major impact on the community, Balrak.

It's ever so obvious in your feeble attempts to try and tarnish myself or those in the past whom you've have a hatred for. I also find it ironic it's you the same people who post on here on a daily basis. Think before you reply back.<br><br>Really, by all means keep them coming, you only show how silly you kids can be over what, a game? Lol, now that's true comedy. Tell me, if I have no life as you proclaim there then count on your fingers *I know its hard to do, but at least try to remember your number tables* and tell me, how many times in the past 8 months has my name shown up in EQ? Now count how many times you were booted off EQ within that same period. I can bet you were kicked from the server more then I was even logging in. I know from past experience EQ didn't kick you very often. So, now who doesn't have a life? Oh and before you try and think of something half-wit to say back, realize this, and ask yourself how many times you ate at your computer while playing EQ. Once again, who has a life? <br><br>Now with that said, I have no further need to address those following issues brought to my attention by a group of simpleminded knaves. You may say what you like and what you will, the fact is I didn't need an excuse to stop playing EQ like most of you, IE: I am broke, school grades are down, family life is in the gutter, my girl/boyfriend are leaving me and so on *to those who blasted me who fall under this category, tisk tisk*. EQ simply bored me and I find life outside the game to be far more enjoyable these days, maybe you  should try to do a search on mail order brides, because the only way you will ever meet anyone *god forbide the poor lady or guy* will be through an online mail order bride page. <br><br>Now go take your petty gossip and spread it elsewhere, in the meantime I will enjoy my life outside of work and away from a computer, as it's obvious Synide and Luk, I thought you said you quit EQ? Well then what are you two bums doing here? Before you run your fat lips again, I may say this, I don't play EQ, that doesn't mean I quit. So don't bother with the trying to claim I am the cat calling the kettle black, difference here is, I never did quit, I just took a very extended vacation from time to time. I play at my leisure when I feel like it and I am not pressured by anyone to do anything. Refresh my memory though, didn't you two losers quit? So again I ask, why are you here? If you quit then you have no need to be here, unless, ahh yes, you two are guilty of what I just addressed. I find it funny, you like to say how I or anyone else who you do not like have no lives, well then again, why are you here? Is it because you live your life on a posting board and have nothing better to do, other then search for porno and jerkoff at the same time as viewing these boards? You must have the fastest hands in the world both of you.<br><br> Now if you will excuse me, my lady wishes to spend time with me and I think I wasted a perfectly good two minutes here. Bah, you people who like to spread rumors and gossip on here just aren't worth anymore of my time this evening, perhaps in a few more days  when I am at work and in need of a good laugh I will return. Till then, tah tah kids.<br><br><br>Disclaimer; I stress very hard here, this post was ONLY intended for those people such as Synide and Lukaz and whoever else who likes to come here and try and make up some really boring flames towards me or others about legit topics, just because they don't like me *or someone else*. Chances are I kicked their asses in EQ at one time or I called their bluff and made them step down to me. Either way, it's obvious that they are all full or more hotair then a hotair balloon. That's not something they should be proud of, I guess I was the guy who came along and had to pop that balloon and let out air. I'm such a meanie.

That's what I enjoy about you, my dear Balrak.  You're so poetic, it brings a tear to my eye.  I enjoy these boards while I'm bored, I'm semi-retired from EQ.  I still log on once I'm bored.  <br><br>These boards, have become a part of my minor life at home.  When I'm procrastinating (remember I have no life, as you say).  My grades aren't good nor are they horrible, 3.0.  I'm sure you went to harvard and succeeded with a 4.0.  But then again...<br><br>Let me check my give-a-shit meter.  I live a simple life, wake up, go to school, skate, and then go home eat dinner.  I have plenty of free time to go around, whether it is flaming your whining, wannabe elder cleric of drinal cock sucking ass, or doing homework.  <br><br>You make me giggle and tee hee, all the fucking time.  That's why I enjoy these posts, and now that I can actually stand reading your worthless pile of shit, much like I'm posting right now.  It even makes it that more enjoyable.<br><br>There is a point, when you flame totally respectable people, in this example... Sutekh and Nila.  Two of the nicest people in EQ, no doubt.  I don't care how many marriages, how many times she's 'used' her husbands, which is bull shit.  She's still one of the nicest people I know, she doesn't flame, nor have the decency too. <br><br>So two of her friends and maybe 3 if you include nodda(a synide hater jeje jk ;), who come and stick up for her.  You go around flaming people, when you're the one that deserves to be flamed.  You're a ninja looting, cock sucking mother fucker.  You have no sense of this game.  You prove that when you ninja loot on hate raids.  <br><br>You're not a hero, you're just a zero.<br><br><br>Synide 'go fuck yourself Balrak' Furiostabberofevil<br><br>P.s.

Hmm, funny, I don't recall that, you assume. What's is the mother of all fuck ups within the world, other then your mere existence. It's undoubtedly your ability to assume as well.

The only one I am flaming has been you, and your reject friends. Why if I didn't know any better your trying to provoke others into a flame battle with me because you yourself can't handle a one on one flame with me. That's a sign of your weakness, you've shown it time and time again. I also think your I don't give a shit meter is broken, because if you really didn't care you'd not be here defending, well trying to defend yourself. So to you and your little bitches here who are actually defending you....ROTFLMAOAASDMFCALY.<br>I'll let you try and figure out the meaning of that, you obviously have the spare time to do it.<br><br>Now, lets read between the lines. What you said there Synide your 3.0 is actually a 0.3? Ahh but I would be sinking to your lvl name calling wouldn't I? Does this offend you, I know for a fact it does, and I know it gets under your skin and drives you mad. It just annoys you that ever since mom and dad made you grow up, you can't have things your way. Well to you I say, welcome to the real world kid. However, unlike your spoiled ass childhood, when you fuck with someone now, you get it back plus a 10 fold, you see shit hit the fan mother fucker and it hit it real hard the day you tried to badmouth yours truly and many others I know in EQ. Who as I know are reading this right now laughing like there's no tomorrow. They told me about some some kids on the server who just needed put in place, so they looked to me and they looked no further. /cheers to you all<br><br>See Derris, I told you there was this stupid little punk with his merry band of pussies on Drinal who thought they were tough guys, that is till they met me. My how they were pussycats in the game when I was around, just like a bunch of cowards, all full of themselves on the boards, when it came to crunch time the little shits ran away from me. See was I right or what? Povar all of a sudden is such a bad place now is it? You just have to deal with some rude gms, but how often does that happen? This is a daily thing when in game with some of these people. Pretty sad isn't it or as I say, just childish and funny how people like Syn and his friends claim to be adults, then why don't they just grow up then? Spreading rumors, making up gossip, trying to provoke. These are things pre-school children do. Pun intended to those of the select few here who obviously on a daily scale practice such things.<br><br>Now Synide tell really stop holding back tell me how you really feel about me, that way I can sit here at work and just laugh away at yet another pointless victims rejected excuse for a flame towards me, Zenia and anyone else who ownz me? First off, learn how to spell. /shakes his head   Ownz is spelled with an S, not a Z. You need to learn english before you post some flame at someone, may I suggest english for Dummies and flamer wannabes, like you. Now who just OWNED your sorry ass in a flame.<br><br>I had to laugh when I was thought to be Getalongguy, now someone thinks I am Clubber? LoL, that is pretty funny.
