<br>
Well a level 60 druid who was there was not given the bp it went to a leve 54 who is a SECONDARY char of another person who bought the brestplate for his secondary by ueing points his primary had earned. <br>
<br>
sorry i will never see a secondary get items bassed on what that person has done with there primary at any raid i run its not even fair to the other people there.<br>
<br>
Now if the secondary has earned the point put in the time fine i can understand that but this was just rediculous.<br>
<br>
this is a prime example fo why point systems SUCK once you have al you want for your main char you just level a secondary and then you take your primary to the raids to gain points so when your high enough to go you KNOW your gona get what you want your primary got all the points saved up after he had all he wanted<br>
<br>
Now dotn go flameing me this is not a flame of CiH if the guils like the point system and no one within it disagreed fine but i personly think this is a prime example of why tunare people just hate point systems  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufeline123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feline123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/24/00 7:43:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The exact reason i wont use a points system .</span><hr size=1> first, the so call secondary Character is actually Primary<br>

i did nothing to flam anyone i mearly pointed out why we feel points systems dont work <br>
<br>
the druid in question may be the best player in everquest.<br>
<br>
i just dont think somone should be able to rack up points with a primary and save them so when there twink his the high 50s they can jsut BUY items for them <br>
<br>
IF the secondary char earned the points be atending raids i would have no problem with then useing them towards anything They want. <br>
<br>
MY point was to show that the point system is suposed to reward a players char for atending raids <br>
<br>
WHEN it can jstu as easily be abused to twink a secondary you see?<br>
Now a levle 54 is by no means a newbie i never said so never thought so i just was pointing out the flaws in the idea of letting someone buy anything for a secondary with points earned by there primary <br>
<br>
will someon PLEASE try to tell me where i said anythgin derogatory about the druid in question or flamed them at all ? <br>
<br>
I DID NOT <br>
<br>
But to say anyone who has a bunch of points racked up cause they take there primary to raids all the time in between playing secondarys then they can use the points to brign the secodnary to a few raids then buy whatever they need <br>
<br>
My point to this whole post was that just cause person a has two chars you should not let that person stor up points that BOTH chars earned and use them towards ONE char if you do that the above situation of a retired raid only level 60 and a twinked secondary can coem about <br>
<br>
<br>
THe druid in question DID have the MOST CIH kkp points there and in there guild earned the bp by ueing them. <br>
<br>
I never said she did anythign wrong or taht anyone was riped off just that to my thinking there is serious flaws in the point system<br>
<br>
SOrry if anyone took that wrong<br>

<br>
Those of you who posted aginst thogg's personal opinion might be alittle high strung and maybe should check your self out.  are you really happy with your system?  if so great, keep up what you are doing.  if to you it is 110% fair that god speed to you.  if you think there might be a problem with it, then start a post your self like thogg did.  maybe make a suggestion too.<br>
<br>
<br>
i personally felt that another druid who attended the raid should have gotten it.  i feel it for my own personal reasons, and i dont care to share them with you.  had this of been my raid i would have done loot differently.  but that me.<br>

It's also a way to make sure that lottos are somewhat fair as to how much a person participates, but yet still gives all a chance to win an item.  What char it goes to is a persons choice if both char's are planes levels, they must state before a raid who they'd be in for.  It's by no means perfect, but works well for a group that works together often.  If you've been to one raid and have one point, you name is in lotto once, if you've spent your points and have none you can't be in lotto, and if you have been to 20 raids and not won an item you have you name in lotto 20 times.  It tends to spread the god items equally, and it makes people decide ahead what they really want, not what might be nice.  As you would spend your points up for something that might be nice and then nothave any for that item that would really rock for you.<br>
<br>
Those are some benefits to it.  Dyscord does play far more then Raena, and has been her only played character at raids for several months now, at least 6 months.  But where she decided to spend her points would have been well thought out and Giddo's also, he chose to not go in for bp and to use his points accumalated at the time for his fa quest.  So both have chosen what they wanted.<br>
<br>
No system is perfect by any means, but it does work well in a large guild where all want, and can use many of the items that drop.  Each will chose what they're saving for and not likely go in for items till they have the points for what they're saving for and it drops.  This is by no means details of the full point system, jsut some of the benfits, points system detials can be read on our guild page, and i'm sure there's  many other fair ways of doing it.  I might like your seniority system, i don't understand it at all now, all i can tell from it is that i may be able to say on all raids, Well i'm only 60 bard and i've played longest so it's mine?  I'm sure i misunderstand it.  Good luck on whatever system you chose for your raids ). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=noddaduma>Nodda Duma</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://img13.webshots.com/photos58/375/63/3756315sgoKarRjba_photo.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/24/00 9:41:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img13.webshots.com/photos58/375/63/3756315sgoKarRjba_photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thogg?  who?  tmd?</span><hr size=1> You picked the wrong person to dis, Thogg.

Once again, I find no satisfaction. Once again, I find that THogg's supporters have cooperated closely with clumsy violent anarchists on several projects. Let's get down to business: THogg is trying to exhibit a deep disdain for all people who are not closed-minded testy sybarites. His mission? To deny minorities a cultural voice. I'm not the first to mention that it's irrelevant that my allegations are 100% true. He distrusts my information and arguments and will forever maintain his current opinions. All such combinations of audacity with ignorance would be supremely ridiculous but for one consideration: If we take THogg's inclinations to their logical conclusion, we see that when you least expect it, THogg will monopolize the press. His conclusions often lash audiences of odious corporatism enthusiasts into wild storms of applause. No wonder that he is like a pigeon. Pigeons are too self-absorbed to care about anyone else. They poo on people they don't like; they poo on people they don't even know. The only real difference between THogg and a pigeon is that THogg intends to threaten the existence of human life, perhaps all life on the planet. That's why his allies are unified under a common goal. That goal is to mortgage away our future. <br>
<br>
If we let him destroy the lives of good, honest people, then greed, corruption, and oligarchism will characterize the government. Oppressive measures will be directed against citizens. And lies and deceit will be the stock and trade of the media and educational institutions. <br>
<br>
If THogg continues to spit in the face of propriety, crime will escalate as schools deteriorate, corruption increases, and quality of life plummets. There is no contradiction here; even though nihilism is sustained by rigid ideological categories, you mustn't forget that if I recall correctly, if he wants to stigmatize any and all attempts to raise several issues about his rash modes of thought that are frequently missing from the drivel that masquerades for discourse on this topic, let him wear the opprobrium of that decision. Everybody loves a good game of hide-and-seek: find the person, find the hidden item, or in the case of THogg and his misinformed emissaries, find the hidden agenda. There are no two ways about it; by allowing him to advertise &quot;magical&quot; diets and bogus weight-loss pills, we are allowing him to play puppet master. Some people say that that isn't sufficient evidence to prove that he is secretly scheming to work hand-in-glove with the most execrable yokels you'll ever see. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there, for anyone who isn't afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that his nutty memoirs take rights away from individuals whom only THogg perceives as antihumanist. He then blames us for that. Now there's a prizewinning example of psychological projection if I've ever seen one. We must not miss our chance to prescribe a course of action. So I give you this letter. I hope it helps.<br>

Since you seem to have started a trend of sticking your nose into places IT DOESN'T BELONG, I figured I would jump in and add my two cents as well.  First off where do you get off commenting on all of these things that don't affect you in the least?  Are CiH people making comments on public message boards about your loot distribution system and how its not fair in their opinion?  Nope, haven't heard a peep from any of them.  So why is it that you feel compelled to comment on the inner workings of their guild, when you don't hear any complaints from any of their members?  Seriously if stuff like this is bothering you so much that you have to make comments like this on public message boards you need to go outside and do other stuff than worry about EQ all the time.  You are not the savior of fairness, or the messiah of equity, so just STFU.<br>
<br>
Every CiH member is a good person, and they are all fair in every sense of the word.  You need to get off your high horse and take a good look at some of the reasons they have implemented a system like they have before you start criticizing it.  First off this list of rules didn't just fall out of the sky while everyone was fighting over some Kewl L3wt one day.  These rules have evolved over the course of almost a year on the MM server with input from many many people that play there.  The rules are there so that everyone going into a raid knows ahead of time how loot will be distributed, and that it will be done fairly, and it will not be subject to the whims of the raid leader. (BTW who the fuck made the rule that the raid leader gets to make all the rules?) Not only that, but because everyone will get points for their help, EVERYONE gets a reward from going on the raid.  At first I used to think like you about points systems.  I really didn't like them in the beginning, but after watching them in action, and taking the time to evaluate its effectiveness I assure you it is a very fair way to distribute the limited loot drops in this game.  It really is one of the better ways to spread the wealth around to the people that are doing the hard work for their guild.  There are many other factors that go into determining who should get what other than primary/secondary status and level, and this system is a very good attempt at taking them all into account.<br>
<br>
You also fail to see the flexibility this system gives to people that have more than one high level character and the benefits it has for the guild as a whole.  This system allows people to bring with them the character that will have the MAXIMUM benefit for the guild on a particular raid regardless of which character the individual enjoys playing the most.  I hear over and over how people that have high level clerics can NEVER bring their other characters on raids even though they enjoy playing other classes more.  This system eliminates this conflict because the individual can bring the best tool for the job to the raid, and still get stuff they want for the character they enjoy playing the most.  Not only that, it rewards the people that have put in the time leveling up a second character FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GUILD!  And because people are rewarded points based on the number of raids they attend all of the gear they EARN is rewarded based on the amount of work they put into helping the guild.  <br>
<br>
No one is getting a free ride here as you seem to think.  As a matter of fact with a system like I just described in place, where EVERYONE knew the rules ahead of time, it might have allowed you to get the first warrior epic quest weapon on any server.  Instead you decided to with hold information about what you were after, and stack the deck in your favor because YOU DECIDED you deserved something more than someone else.  Now you might very well have deserved to get the item you needed, but your attempt at hiding the true nature of your raid backfired and bit you in the ass.  So before you start pointing fingers, ripping into other people and telling everyone how unfair someone else's system is you should probably take a look at how fair the &quot;rules&quot; you currently use are.  BTW I don't see members of CiH coming and posting on public boards about how they were screwed out of a piece they needed for an epic quest weapon like I have seen other people… You have enough problems of your own to fix before you start crusading against CiH and their &quot;unfairness&quot;.<br>
<br>
Let me also give you some advice Thogg, and I suggest you write it down.  In the future think before you speak, don't stick your nose into other peoples business, and if you have to say in your post &quot;Now dotn go flameing me this is not a flame of CiH&quot; then you are probably going to get flamed, and shouldn't post it in the first place.  You came on this board and started making comments on how another group of their OWN FREE WILL chooses to conduct themselves even though it doesn't have ANY affect on how you live your life.  Mind your own damn business and STFU.  You post crap like this on message boards and then act shocked when everyone reacts negatively to what you have to say and you feel like everyone is out to get you.  Did you ever stop to think that maybe it was YOU that had the problem here and not EVERONE else in the world trying to make you look bad?  This entire thread is here because YOU started it, so stop trying to play hurt and pissed because everyone is reacting to YOU.  And for the love of God please get a GD spell checker and use the damn thing, I am now stupider for having read your post.  Thx, and BTW STFU.<br>

Here's a quick review: He is thoroughly mistaken if he believes that it's perfectly safe to drink and drive. With an enormous expenditure of words, unclear in content and incomprehensible as to meaning, he frequently stammers an endless hodgepodge of phrases purportedly as witty as in reality they are sex-crazed. Only the most flighty thieves you'll ever see can feel at home in this maze of reasoning and cull an &quot;inner experience&quot; from this dung heap of loathsome careerism. Woe to the crotchety pouty-types who force us to adopt rigid social roles that compromise our inner code of ethics! <br>
<br>
Kerney has it all wrong; everybody is probably familiar with the cliche that he has yet to acknowledge this. Well, there's a lot of truth in that cliche. Put simply, there are few certainties in life. I have counted only three: death, taxes, and Kerney doing some ornery thing every few weeks. His canards deserve to be criticized because they attack everyone else's politics. If I understand his policies correctly, then given a choice of having him violate the basic tenets of journalism and scholarship or having my bicuspids extracted sans Novocaine, I, for one, would embrace the pliers, purchase some Polident Partials, and call it a day. <br>
<br>
Did it ever occur to Kerney that maybe I don't think it would be unfair to say that I myself will not play his complacent games and parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire just like he does? Dream on. I mean, really. In theory, this will become even more obvious in the years just ahead. But in reality, he operates on an international scale to justify, palliate, or excuse the evils of his heart. It's only fitting, therefore, that we, too, work on an international scale, but to drive off and disperse the nit-picky publishers of hate literature who persecute the innocent and let the guilty go unpunished. Kerney's arguments would be a lot more effective if they were at least accurate or intelligent, not just a load of bull for the sake of being controversial. My goal for this letter was to listen to others. Know that I have done my best while trying always to deal summarily with the most nugatory bloodsuckers I've ever seen. Let an honest history judge.<br>
