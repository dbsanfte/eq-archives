Has &quot;close&quot; to a full spellbook, have all the necessities (Malo, Torpor, Tigir's, Focus) and the platinum to purchase Khura's Focusing before a server transfer.  In addition, the elusive Levitation and Everlasting Breath...just to impart my need for this char to be complete.  <br><br>Well, recently, I found out that a friend of mine has been playing on Drinal, is level 60, and although I started a newb character to level up and eventually group with him, I just REALLY miss the skill I had with a shaman, in addition to the class itself. <br><br>I've been &quot;shamaning&quot; for 2 1/2 years, been on many PoH/PoF raids, led more than my fair share of Vindi/HoT/numerous class epic raids, in addition to successful Gore/Sev/Tal raids.  On Lanys, for a family-guild (of which I was a leader of), these are rather large accomplishments.  Completed epic, full SS gear, in addition to some other amenities on the char that were obtained via my steady group from the bowels of various dungeons.  <br><br>So, now, I've reached an impass.  Whereas I left this character behind about four months ago (career change brought my attention to where it needed to be), I now find a desire to pick him up again, however, I would like to do it with my RL friend.  Prob is that he is fully equipped and I'd come with nada.  Also, he is a warrior, and re-aquiring gear for him would be more difficult than for me.  Granted, I wouldn't play the shaman anymore on Lanys anyway, however, my questions are:<br><br>1) What is the availability/desirability of nekkid Barb Oracles?  <br>2)  Re-aquiring gear: worth the time/effort?  I know what I will impart next may sound shady, however, would selling all his/twinks droppable gear for plat, then sell the plat on playerauctions to fund some plat on Drinal be sound?  <br>3) What is the guild status on Drinal?  I know its a split server, however, many ubers?  How many guilds in WToV?  I don't know if I can bear HoT again...lol.  I think I prefer piss yellow chain to forest green.  I've done the &quot;cutting teeth&quot; guild stuff before.  <br>4) Raids: scheduled?  I notice a section down below, however, whenever I log in (rarely) to Drinal, I always see at least one: &quot;Is there a raid today?&quot;.  <br>5) General advice: any other things I may have missed?  <br><br>Answers/options would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the long winded post, but this is synonymous to a huge move/life change...lol.  Thanks in advance.<br><br>-M.

Get yourself some armor that looks like something and dont let people inspect =) start off with some low wis gear so you have the mana to not fu*k your group if they accept you =) otherwise shaman is a big + IMO<br><br>2)I am not really one for the playerauctions stuff, however, maybe you should look into a straight up server to server trade for plat? Never know if you'll find someone looking to move to your old server, and can make a deal etc.. However, in your situation yea it does seem like a waste to just leave everything behind, but perhaps rather then get dirty by selling on playerauctions, see if you can get one of the newbs to give you their plat they are selling on drinal, for your plat on your server, never know, but essentially its the same, and you can keep your self respect =p<br><br>3) Well, I'll admit I dont know as much as many about guilds on drinal, but we have a few &quot;uber's&quot; but no FoH material here. Cats in Hats is generally recognized as our number 1 guild, and I believe criminson twilight is up their as well. I also know Vice does WToV , however beyond that I dont really know.<br><br>4) Raids ha.. well basically, they are scheduled when people want to =) Generally speaking, raids are scheduled amongst guilds, and can often conflict with other plans because are not announced publically. Example:<br>Guild X Plans to raid &quot;west commonland orc camp&quot; on May 12, however, Guild Y also plans to raid &quot;west commonland orc camp&quot; on may 12, and no guild made it &quot;public knowledge&quot; so Guild X enters to find Guild Y and a big &quot;WTF&quot; match runs out. ETC Generally, only open raids are posted. I believe that UGOD is a better forum if your looking for them, perhaps someone could supply you with a link, I dont have one handy. (UGOD = United guilds of drinal , a MB)<br><br>5)Nothing you have missed really, except some advice? Dont look to get into an uber guild, especially naked, competition is pretty fierce, because like I said, there arent many. However, there are alot of cool people on drinal, definitly a good server to come to, and perhaps you should check out some of the mid level guilds, because I think thats where alot of people find their niche... gaming is about fun, not all about being uber. (though for some that does lend to fun factor) <br><br>Anyway, Hope I helped, and I wish you the best of luck. Any more questions feel free to ask <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urullan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rullan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I eat da mudpies!</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 9:49:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Possibly switching to Drinal...seeking advice/options</span><hr size=1> make a mage <p>Rullan Darkheart<br>60 Ogre Warlord<br?of Drinal<br><br><b> DO YOU WANT A VICTORY! </b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urashnar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rashnar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>,,I,, O_o ,,I,,</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 12:18:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Possibly switching to Drinal...seeking advice/options</span><hr size=1> lol <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94210>Rashnar</a> <BR>King's Court<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzytalius71.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zytalius71</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 4:06:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Bring him over</span><hr size=1> Well Ma...

With a suit of Rygorr / sentry gear  that is decent basic stuff, you can then move on to bigger and better stuff. However, since you have a good friend here, I am sure he can help you out which will be even better. Can get Thurg stuff from there, or planar gear. Most of the guilds that actually do the planes for the gear would be thrilled to have a level 60 shaman there to help them out, so I am sure it wouldnt be an issue for you to get decently equipped. Hell, you could probably get planar gear with just yourself and that warrior friend of yours. Anyhow, there are guilds of most types here on Drinal, and it is easy to find a spot that fits you. Good luck. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229714>Aktunka Wormflinger</a><BR>Lvl 60 Troll Shaman<BR>Drinal<BR><img src="http://aktunka.iwarp.com/kermit.gif"border="0"></a> <BR>"Once ya go green, you'll see what I mean!"<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uomanytecoldeyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Omanyte Coldeyes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage God</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/02 6:32:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sbchuzzah.com/images/flag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Possibly switching to Drinal...seeking advice/options</span><hr size=1> Make a ranger <p><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.geocities.com/omanytecoldeyes/Main.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/2002/02/17/flamingtext_com_1014000946_31569.gif" border=0 alt="Omanyte's Profile"></a><br>Omanyte's <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19962">Profile </a></BODY></HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwarrikthewarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warrik The Warlord</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.truepath.com/imagenetic/usflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/24/02 10:32:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3099.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ,</span><hr size=1> <br><br>If you have a friend on drinal, why hasnt he asnwered any of these questions for you?

Rather exactly what I was looking for.  I could, undoubtedly, farm some low end chain (Ry'Gorr) for everyday use, then use that to farm some of the lower-end, yet still sellable items.  Froglok Crowns, for example.  Spend a day in there with myself and friend, with 7 newb mules each sitting there, equates into 16 crowns.  Not bad for a common drop which could certainly afford me some managable gear.  <br><br>Also, I like the idea of the server transfer of platinum over playerauctioning it.  <br><br>-Rullan, unless you're willing to PL me to 60, no hope at a mage here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>-Zytalius, you'd better help...you're the a-hole that brought me to this decision <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>-Xylors, /agree.  I certainly need to research raids should they usually be &quot;in-house&quot;.  And, my intentions would need be made perfectly clear.  My former guild had their troubles with loot h0rs, (well, dirty, fucking loot h0rs as Lanys had a distinction:   You know, the ones that join your guild just for loot, then make up some shitty excuse to leave the guild because they milked you and want out.) and I would not place that on anyone.  <br><br>-Omanyte, dying is one thing, dying every five minutes is another <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>-Warrik, I believe Synide answered your mini-flame<br><br>-Synide, thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>-Bensonx, no Remove Curse/Greater Curse in my book.  Guild was &quot;family-style&quot; and were only just successful with Vindi when I departed.  For the Kunark &quot;ubers&quot; (Gore/Tal/Sev/Trak/VS) we were exceedingly competent at, which as aforementioned in my first post was remarkable for non-uber guilds on Lanys.  HoT was cake for us, so I suppose we were just breaching Velious ubers, no Luclin.  <br><br>Final question:<br><br>Someone I had spoken with, in game, mentioned that a they have a character in transfer queue for close to two months...do server tranfers take THAT long to complete?  Naturally, I'll research on my own, however, if anyone knows for certain, please post here.<br><br>Thanks again, peeps!  And, maybe I'll see you soon.../rawr!<br><br>-M.

I started a char on drinal back when it was a green server to play at times when prexus was down or I needed a break from the big stuff. As I played here, I began to make friends, so over the months gradually split my time between servers. I transferred my cleric &quot;twink&quot; to drinal when she was 39 (she'd been on a shelf for a year, never played, so why not...) so that I could help my current guild out and have a char that I could play with my friends here, (Guess who that twink is  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) as my current char on this server was but 17 at the time. I found I enjoyed playing a cleric very much, and desparately needed a break from the high end game, so I found myself playing here more and prexus less. During that time, my prexus guild went through a roller coaster ride and recently disbanded so most of my friends there had scattered to different guilds or quit the game. So, I decided that one or the other servers was going to be my home... and as I am very happy here on drinal, I chose this server. I moved my 56 druid (full kael quest gear, lodi shield, shield of the white dragon, 2 items shy of epic, and much more nice equipment), 46 necro (full netted kelp, tolapumj robe, pre-nerf CoS, jboots, Zland's heart, and more), and my 27 rogue (shadow rager/bloodpoint, mrylo gear, etc..). Keep in mind though that this move was within the last month... my cleric is 60 now, in a guild I'm happy to be in, and has made friends and earned a reputation on this server.<br>I left some low level chars on prexus to visit friends with, and I actually have some friends considering a server move as well. <br><br>So, no... I didn't leave with a bad rep (many were sad to see my druid leave the server, and my new prexus main, a 35 warrior, is an honorary member of a 55+ guild because of my history there with many of the people that formed it from the break of my old guild), I'm NOT ebayed, I wasn't drunk, I've never cheated or frauded anyone, and I was already established here on drinal when I made the move. To me, to be where I am happy, it was well worth the money spent and the work to get the chars re-equipped.<br><br>Oh! and the moves (I moved 3 chars over 2 separate moves because I had to make space for them) took no time at all... the first took 2 days, the second one, the char was on drinal the same day I put the app to move in.<br><br>Hope this helps  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;)
