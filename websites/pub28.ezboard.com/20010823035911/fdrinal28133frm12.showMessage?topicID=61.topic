What am I supposed to do?  Stay and piss one person off?  Leave and piss off my entire guild?  I made a bad choice and I stayed.  I should have left.  At least Boto had the balls to tell the guild it was wrong and he wouldn't come. But when he asked what happened I told him flat out what I was doing, supporting the people that sniped your raid.<br>
<br>
In Verts defense she did what she felt she had to do to help Kurk get his blade.  She had no right to agree to merge YOUR raid with Clan Skallagrim's.  Call me a sell out, I had nothing to gain by staying, ther then helping Kurk.  Call me a liar?  I told you I knew it was wrong.<br>

Dunno what else to say.<br>

I dont even read this fucking board due to all the flames here, so no, i dont see who schedualed what or when.<br>
<br>
the worst part is here where you acuse your &quot;friends&quot; to sell you out, jesus christ get a grip, i never known one person alone that can manage to get so many enemies in such a short time as you, YOU NEED TO remember that this is a game, not us.<br>
And ps: Zenak, you low time looser, you join cs on raid after raid for your damn epic, and we never even got as much as a thank you, you even tried to trick one of our rangers out of one of their epic items due to greed then come here acusing us of sniping.<br>

I go on raids everyday if I can regardless of guildtags if Im invited.  I even go on yours *gasps* when i can.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's a differnce between you and I.  When you got your FA, I was there, and didn't ccall you greedy blah blah blah.  But now, when you actively try to obtain items for my FA I am greedy.  *shrugs* I don't see how else Im using people to get my items.  I understand you flaming me i guess, I just wish you'd reconsider.  I have been to 90% of the chardok runs with nothing to offer me.  Countless hate trips, fear runs, etc, etc...  <br>
<br>
You have been a friend to me on this server, and I hope you'd reconsider before abolishing our friendship over some silly raid.<br>
<br>
Maar runs CS very well.  I respect him probably more then any guild leader i have ever dealt with in the past.  To be honest Maar and I have bumped heads on a lot of things, he does not do what I say.  He listens to me and makes his own educated decisions.<br>

<br>
i have even defended you against others who thought you nothing but an egoist. as a result i lost 8 guild members after a hate raid because they felt i should have supported them instead of you, even when i felt that they were wrong and you were right. since i stood up for what i felt was right ( you on that occassion ) instead of guildmembers, they left, their parting words were &quot; anyone who defends and likes shaere is wrong&quot;<br>
<br>
you know what shaere? they are still wrong. i like you and respect you, even now as you flame me and my guild. i have learned alot from you, you are one of the finer players in the game, you have pulled alot for me when i needed you and you do try to help alot of people alot of the time, including me and i will never forget that, no matter what flames come my way.   <br>
<br>
as to today's raid specifically, i honestly did not know that you had a raid planned at all, late last night kurk told me that he wsa doing chardok at around 11 am pst to get his blade and that you were gonna help and be the puller. i thought great kurk has been trying forever to get that damn epic so i will come and support him. i told him that all of king's court who were free would be there to do a chardok raid to help him. at that point i knew nothing more about &quot;YOUR&quot; raid or that you even had a raid, i merely thought you were gonna be the puller for us as you have done so well so many times before and for which we always appreciate your help.<br>
<br>
then i log on at 10 am pst this morning to get ressed, buy gems and get gear ready for the chardok raid. i check things out and i see several clan folks gathering in chardok. i immediately tell maar that king's court is going there at 11 am pst to do the queen and to please not do chardok. maar responds that he has his people there and are ready to go and sees no one from king's court ready to do chardok. i explain that people are not there yet cuz we had said 11 am pst. maar made it clear that the clan was going in. at that point seeing kurk's chance at a queen blade falling away yet again, i suggested as allies that we combine and help each other. maar agreed. <br>
<br>
now let me make this clear. maar and all clan people have been at all times respectful and courteous people. ( in fact clan has stepped down for me in hate before when i had 6 groups ready to go and they were already up there. )  he was very nice and helpful. we did not argue we did not fight, we negotiated a compromise to accommodate both guilds. we did it respectfully and well. it was in my view a win win, allowing both thogg and kurk a chance at the queen blade.<br>
<br>
now at this time i still had no idea that you had planned your own raid, i was still under the impression that you were our puller, not the leader of a raid you had planned. so when i combined raids, i thought i was combining king's court's raid with clan's. i would never have presumed to speak on your behalf or combine your raid. in fact had i known at that time that you had planned a raid i would have deferred to you or helped you as i have done many times before. for my ignorance and misunderstanding i am truly sorry and apologize.<br>
<br>
later after you sent me some angry tells is the first time i had any idea that you had pre-set to do chardok for yourself and not as merely the puller. at that time i probed to determine the truth. i learned that you had posted your intent to do chardok your self and that you were organizing the raid. at that point i sent you several tells explaining the situation, explaining that i did not know and inviting you to resume leadership of the raid. i was prepared to defer and step down even at kurk's expense once i learned what had happened. but you did not respond, either cuz you had me on ignore or you had switched to an alt. when kurk asked to you come you said &quot;fuck you&quot;. basically you did not wanna talk or listen to anyone, even though only an honest mistake had been made. <br>
<br>
even though as a whole the server does not respect reservations, i would have respected your chardok raid had i known you were doing one and i would have deferred had you shown up with your people and started your raid and i would even have helped you do your raid if you wanted kings court's help. but since you refused to communicate with me, i was left with a choice. continue with clan as i had agreed to do or leave out of some sense that you had been wronged. i chose first to try to fix it with you, when that did not work i chose to support my guildmate in his epic quest as it is long over due and deserved, and i chose to work with our ally the clan who has been nothing but helpful and cooperative with us. i am sorry if that choice disturbs you. i am a human being i make the best choices i can under the circumstances with the facts i have in hand and i do my best. i do not apologize for that. i do apologize that i stepped over your raid unintentionally and unknowingly and i would be happy to make mends for that some how.<br>
<br>
i would also like to ask that you direct your ill will and comments ( if you must do so at all ) to me and me alone. i am the leader of king's court and i made the decision and i negotiated with the clan, any and all mistakes are mine and mine alone. the people who stayed, stayed because i asked them to, they stayed to help kurk, they did not stay to betray you, they did not stay to sell you out. i am 100 % responsible not king's court and not its members. if you have been wronged and i admit now that i know all facts, that you could feel wronged, then i take all blame and responsibilty. do not blame individual king's court players for my sole actions. blame me or better yet blame no one and recognize it for what it really was : poor communication, lack of complete knowledge and a simple mistake. <br>
<br>
finally as to my enchantress skills, well you got me there... what can i say, i try my best and often do well and many other times i suck and suck bad. hell my directional skills are non -existant and i cant auto follow worth shit and everyone knows i will drown in 2 inches of water without eb on. yes it is true, i am not the best player in the game, in fact far from it, yes it is true that i have yet alot to learn and yes it is true that i have appreciated and respected the skills of those players such as your self who have patience with me and from whom i have learned alot. <br>
<br>
also fortunately for me, i do not measure my success as a human being by my gaming skills ( good thing too!) instead i try to be a good leader for my guild as best i can, i try to do right honest and well by all i can, i try to help my friends and i try to be best the person i can be both on the game and off to those i care about,love, and consider as friends. and while i am not perfect and i do make mistakes, i try very hard to be a good person. and on that measure, i feel just fine.<br>
<br>
closing with your tagline <br>
&quot;peace&quot; and i mean it friend <br>

<br>
Remember, shaere this isn't the fucking military, get a grip, shit happens, maybe it doesn't happen when you're offing heads in war and killing ppl.. this is a fantasy game, you die you come back you try again, it isn't RL so don't take it like it IS.  chill out and have fun, be sarcastic, btw all those bridges you burned down, they'll brb up as usual.  all of you tunare ppl flame each other but still chill.  I admit the minute thogg/pmr 'sold out' to CS (cuz thogg has a power syndrome and wants to be better than cih)  other 60's started 'selling out' and you're damn right they were selling out, because they saw 1 member who they were friends w/ and not the WHOLE fucking guild, aleal admits to me there's a lot of idiots in the guild -- So why the fuck are you there? cuz you want to be more powerful than anyone else?  It isn't going to happen , sorry.  Everyone should stfu and play for fun not power greedy asshole's bitching and whining jesus christ, you don't invite ppl on raids then kick them off(thx boto/shaere).  This server is a fucking dump, we all flame each other(including me, i won't deny it).  shaere, thogg, aleal just stfu and go chill out on a raid and be happy.  Shaere if you weren't such an ass you might see the light sometime but it seems like your head is too dimmed for that eh?<br>
<br>
Chill the FUCK out all of us should just make a fucking effor to get along, this server hasn't done anything notable since SoV is out.  2 guilds have killed trak, vox/nag taken down, you see vindicator slain, dain? Yelinak? Naw -- cuz we aren't organized, you see any of the *hard* epics complete like Mages or wizards or SK's, I see 1 SK thx and gratz voroth for putting some effort into something. I've been on pickup raids w/ Thogg or Shaere leading, and they got no where fast, why?  Shaere fucking yells at everyone like a boot camp general, Thogg just gets unlucky and can't keep ppl organized really.  Thogg wants to quest for belt he gets yelled at, he made an attempt and offered to lead an uber mob raid -- he gets flamed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualealthewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleal the Wiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~fuellg/bobspinanim.gif height=10 width=10 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress Fingerwiggler</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#939393>(12/31/00 12:12:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:  no bastards, just folks trying to help each other</span><hr size=1> For the record, there have been idiots in every guild ive been in, and sometimes, im the idiot *shrugs*. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uh0tr0d.showPublicProfile?language=EN>h0tr0d</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gifzboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#939393>(12/31/00 1:16:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Blow it</span><hr size=1> out your ass.<br>

Unleess you were one of the snipers. In that case, I have nothing to say to you. I do not know you, I do not care to now.

When you actively do it tho, replace someone elses raid, or try and beat them to it, or hurt their raid, then youre wrong.<br>

Maar is lying out his ass, as many people are.<br>
<br>
IF he was planning a week in advance, there wouldve been more than 6 people ther,e no? And some there said they were just asked. Maybe your just defending him cuz hes your mate, and I understand that.<br>
<br>
Do you really know what youre defending tho? Honestly? Do you know what Clan skall is all about now, what it is becoming. Think about what you left, and what would make you flame when on mm.<br>
<br>
Now look at what I am flaming about, and what you are defending, or flaming against. <br>
<br>
Maar lied. to mee thats huge, cuz hes your guildleeader. IF by some act of God, he didnt lie, then it means alot of his guild lied to him, or lied by not telling the truth, or not saying anything, he was deceived or duped. And as guild leader, he takes the flak, and the credit for your guild. <br>

Surely you jest.<br>
<br>
I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he has no idea what he is talking about, and that is why he posted those things about me.  To set the record straight this is what happened.<br>
<br>
Accusation 1:<br>
<a href><b><i>you join cs on raid after raid for your damn epic, and we never even got as much as a thank you</b></i></a><br>
<br>
Well That was the day I had the raid planned, and your guild got there first.  this was also after you had told me CS didn't want to be known as farmers in Hate, and I could have the next Inno pop.  When I confronted you and you found out what my reason for wanting to kill Inno were you offered for me to join your raid and roll on the item.  It was the second to last piece for my epic. (and still is).  I shouted and OOC'd thank you to the entire zone after I looted it, and when Trevize sent me a tell to confirm I had looted it I thanked him.  Should I have made a post on the boards thanking you here?  Sent a tell to everyone in the guild?  What more could I have done?<br>
<br>
(Editors note: This situation seems strangely similar to the Chardok event.  You knew what was planned, beat us to the zone, and compromised by allowing a few of us to come.)<br>
<br>
Accusation 2:<br>
<a href><b><i>you even tried to trick one of our rangers out of one of their epic items due to greed</b></i></a><br>
<br>
This is the one I have to assume you have no clue about, but I will admit it was a strange situation.  I was fighting the zone with my Necro when I find out you guys have a Hole Raid.   No problem the guys didn't even mess much with my spawns as they passed by, all is cool.  I find out you are going to be going for Jaleil as well.  The Druids and Rangers both get the item in their quest that is needed for Jaeleil the Insane to spawn.  Rangers have to spawn him, Druids have no use for the item after they have created the hardened mixture with it.  You had 2 Druids in zone, Trevize still needed his bowl, he hadn't made the mixture yet.  Desireed offered to give the bowl in for me so I could get a second hammer, and then I could quest for the Earthcaller without having the VS stone or having to redo a decent part of the quest.  I said great, and got a ride and you CoTH me down.  Somewhere along the way the Ranger you talk about decided he wanted to use her bowl to get his hammer.   There is no doubt in my mind he hadn't even known it was possible until I asked Desireed and she must have said something to the guild.  I got down there and was informed you were going to give it to the other ranger, said ok, I guess I'll go.<br>
<br>
You see it is possible to do the quest for either of us without this step, but it would have given me my Earthcaller about 30 mins later, and I am pretty sure the Hammer is still rotting wherever that other Ranger put it.<br>
<br>
I guess you're right, I lied and tried to trick your ranger out of something... Sorry about that.<br>
<br>
And as far as your claim you don't read the boards goes, seems kind of funny how fast you found this thread. Your post was barely a minute past mine.<br>

Guildmembers found this thread and told him about it, but they never once saw Shaeres intent to do Chardok on Sat?  Odd.<br>
<br>
Also I will concede that calling it a snipe could be a bit harsh.  It is really a matter of perspective, if Shaere had been there first with a group and Maar showed up to find them there I am sure you would have been upset as well...  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukurk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#939393>(12/31/00 3:35:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Woah!</span><hr size=1> I usually don't respond to posts like these cause I know they are never interpreted right...people believe what they want to believe.  In any case I want to clear the air on what I see as a major misunderstanding.  I showed up at Chardok for a raid to be lead by Shaere on Saturday morning.  I informed Vert I was going on this raid late the prior night.  Somehow this was misconstrued as Shaere was being a puller and not a leader of a planned raid probably cause I only told her &quot;I am doing Chardok with Shaere tomorrow around 11:00am tomorrow come if you like.&quot;  There was no planning of sniping a raid...there was no prior knowledge of any other raids going on in the zone at the same time.  This was never going to be a King's Court raid.<br>
<br>
When I got into the zone around 8 people were there...Aleal Munch and Maar to name a few.  I thought these folks were on Shaere's raid.  I had no idea Shaere won't play with Maar or anything like that...and I did not know there was a CS raid about to happen either.  Then I got a tell from Shaere as I'm sitting there waiting for him to show up.  I don't think I need to go into the details cause they weren't pleasant but basically now I'm being called a raid sniper and Shaere won't respond to my tells.<br>
<br>
At this point I got two options: leave the raid and try to talk to Shaere who won't listen to me...or do the raid I had been waiting for.  I had already been judged and executed by Shaere before the raid even started.  I chose to push on.<br>
<br>
I won't mince words...you are ABSOLUTELY right I went to Chardok to finish my LAME EPIC WEAPON.  The only reason why the other members of my guild showed up was to support me in this.  Chardok has been a thorn in my side for around 10 raids...over 100 hours now easy.  Its a poorly designed hell hole and I was sick of it after 3 attempts let alone 10.  I truely appreciate the people who came to my aid and am very sorry about all of this mess.  I'm not putting my friends through this BS anymore either...I'm done with this quest.<br>
<br>
Shaere I think you jumped the gun on Kurk...I was not out to foul up EQ for you or for anyone.  But without even sending me a tell you had already made up your mind about me.  I'm sorry you didn't feel you could trust me after all the time we've played together. I apologize to my guild for putting them though another 12 hours of crappy trains and corpse recovery.  This is a game, I get enough crap in real life to deal with.<br>
<br>
I can only speak for myself here...I still don't know how this became a King's Court/Clan Skallagrim raid.  I do know that AFTER you sent me the tells and stopped talking to me I found out that Clan Skallagrim had a raid planned as well.  I was at the zone for an hour when I found that out.  By then half of King's Court was upset that we &quot;sniped&quot; a raid and the folks that did show up (I think there were about 6 of us there) just wanted to help me finish the damn quest.  You can interpret that as greed I guess and its easy to do so after the fact.  What I don't understand is why you made your determination about me and Munch and Vert before anything was started and without even talking to me about why I was at Chardok...cause I was waiting for you!  I don't know what you were told, but I have told you what I know of what transpired.  I guess that all I have to say on this matter except that I'm sorry to all those involved who felt they got betrayed.  I'm also sorry I ever started this quest.  Semper Fi<br>

/Played<br>
Owned<br>
<br>
, does it have anything to do with days played, and how you have alot more days played then Maar, or anyone on Drinal? if so, let me fill you in, even though its laughable to even respond.<br>
<br>
Maar alone have 130+ days played, not counting the levels on other characters ive helped, I also pay pr hour to my phonecompany, around 1$ pr hour, so i dont leave Maar online in fp when i go to sleep so i can use /played to brag lol.<br>
Also, i work from 10 to 12 hours a day, spend time with my GF and friends, and try to socialize in rl, you should try it. Those braggin about their play times are either loaded with cash and dont have to work, or they are sitting in front of their computer all day, eating and bitching, using what we call tax money.<br>
<br>
CS and Maar have been in EQ since release, so have all the officers, we had 2 complaints for sniping so far in almost 2 years, and guess who acused us for it??<br>
<br>
and on a side note, how the fuck can ppl call you friend??, when you judge them on a daily basis on how much they adore your raids and how they always have to agree with you.<br>
<br>
Face it, without the people around you, which have just as much eq excperience as you, and alot even more so, you cant do shit in eq, and your flaming more and more on these boards every day.<br>
<br>
what i see is that you dislike the organizations the guilds here do, because they make your &quot;fanbase&quot; shrink, so you come here to stir up shit.<br>
<br>
Also, you used to send me tells when you had a raid planned, and i always steered clear then, try that next time again, so i may know. If we change our plans to not crash with yours, just remember, its for the people in your raid we do it, and not for you. <br>
<br>
You are the first person ever i manage to REALLY dislike throughout 2 years of eqing, so you deserve some credit though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to the few of KC that stayed in chardok, you show backbone, and dont let 1 man and his acusations get you down.<br>
<br>
Also, Shaere, please, i beg of you, stop these stupid flames, people want to play eq, and not be here typing replies to stupid posts, altough all that do reply, me included, makes this go on.<br>
<br>
Also, i wont post more replies to Shaere, those who know me, knows what i stand for and dont take shit like this serious.<br>
