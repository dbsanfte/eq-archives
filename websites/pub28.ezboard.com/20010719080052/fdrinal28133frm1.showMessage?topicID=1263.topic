<br>
My names Furle, and I just signed up on the Drinal server.<br>

My Q:  What is the best class for a newbie to start with?<br>
<br>
I'm a long time MMORPG player.  Just got fed up with glitches on the last game I played and am looking to set up shop on EQ.<br>
<br>
Any assistance/advice would be GREATLY appreciated.<br>

See you all online,<br>

You get a little Melee and a little casting.  But as a warning, as things stand now, hybrids are NOT the choice for upper level playing.  A pure class (warrior, monk, rogue or cleric, wizard, enchanter types) are more desireable at the upper levels.<br>
<br>
For ease of learning, a woodelf ranger or dwarf paladin would probably be good to start with.  I would say an Ogre SK also (probably the best hybrid class in the game), but playing an Evil race can be difficult if you aren't experienced in how to fix factions.  <br>
<br>
The ultimate learning character and is easily soloable is a druid...  2 months ago I would have said NOT to make a druid because there are too many of them at the lower levels, but lately I have seen a drift away from them.  /shrug  Not sure if it's just incidental to my travels or a real shift.<br>
<br>
You may want to choose a hybrid and play the character up to about 10 or 15.  Then decide if you want a melee or caster.<br>

I had no clue what I was doing when I built my char and once you get to level 20 or so there is no turning back if you don't like losing a lot of time invested.  <br>

To save you from my mistakes, I'd recommend checking out starting stats of the various classes at eq.castersrealm.com beforehand. <br>

This would probably strike some people as strange because I was playing a human paladin BEFORE they fixed the hybrid exp penalty.<br>
<br>
I leveled my paladin to 20 twice (once on a friend's account and then again on my own) in less than a month of real life playing.  And I did not use any &quot;exp quests&quot; or powerleveling to speed up the process, that was straight up playing.<br>
<br>
Just out of curiousity, what does everyone else think about that?  Is it easy to play up to 20 your first time, or was it just that I had people guiding me?  Is it easier for a melee to level (not talking about powerleveling), or what is the scoop on that.. good place for input since the newbie will be reading.  =)<br>

I spent about half 1999-2000  on business travel so the time I was able to play was precious to me. (Sometimes sneaking down to a local internet cafe in San Francisco and paying 10$ an hour to play)<br>
<br>
I remember doing stupid things though that consumed a lot of time..Like when I decided to go shopping in east freeport and a dog named (scrappy? can't remember) ate me in the basement of a store. I couldn't figure out how to get corpse from the basement after that.<br>
<br>
Then there was the time I decided to go sight seeing on the neat boat from e.f.p after that and wound up on sister island - someone was being attacked so I blasted a nuke on the mob (I was level 4 mob may have been in the 20-30 range). Lost corpse in the ocean somewhere after that. <br>

As with any situation where you have thousands of people interacting, your going to have some flare ups.  It's part of dealing with &quot;the public&quot;.<br>

I avoid those that I know cause problems and seek out those that I know are good people, and I enjoy my time on Drinal very much.  The funny thing is that those that have a &quot;reputation&quot; for being a problem causer don't seem to bother me all that much even when I am around them =)  <br>
<br>
I can see where some can rub others the wrong way, but I think that they don't mean to do it, and honestly they become defensive because others jump them instead of trying to help them understand how they stepped on someone else's toes.<br>
<br>
Don't run away, every server has it's problems with people's toes getting stepped on.  Lots-o-people = conflict  That's just the way the world works!  Less_people = warm_and_fuzzy  But then how fun would EQ be with just 100 people on a server?  I wouldn't enjoy it as much.  I like grouping with different people all the time even if it means learning to deal with people's idiosyncrasies.<br>

In general an allround class, i can solo if i can't get a group.<br>
<br>
However, a shaman is a...lets call it a defensive class which means he stands in the background helping the rest of his group. The cleric is the most defensive class of the game but also the most needed!<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want a to play a class that really bears a group or a raid, pick a warrior, enchanter or a cleric...but there are backsides to those classes as well. When playing those classes at higher levels you will find that you have obligations to your friends and can't always do as you want. I have seen too many clerics wither away from the game because of this.<br>

<br>
paladins get to heal, are always needed on larger raids. <br>
<br>
your best bet is to make a lvl 1 and do a /w all 50 60 and talk to people about what they like and don't like about their class, why they picked it etc. then try it out, if you don't like it at first stick with it till about lvl 8 or so then decide if starting over your char would be worth it.<br>
<br>
it took me 4 chars to decide on a wizard, I got that wizard to 50 and then I went back to playing my monk that I stopped at lvl 4 and found out at higher lvls it was more enjoyable. <br>

everyone class and race can be a success if you like what you are doing.<br>

<br>
all in all, i believe best thing to do is start with a hybrid as a few have already stated, or perhaps a warrior, but hybrids give you a taste of the tank and the casting side of EQ, rangers are especially fun at lower levels i hear...Anyway...get in some groups with people, watch how they play their class, see for yourself what different features you like and dont like for a class<br>
<br>
As far as the races go, you can pretty much read a book by its cover...Trolls ogres and barbarians...theyre big...they like to tank stuff and have a helluva lot of hps...humans..dorfs, they kinda fit in the middle, they seem to both be very sturdy races...elves/erudites...skinny with pasty complexions...these would hafta be your casters..Gnomes and halflings...well..i never give them much thought because they scare me :D<br>
<br>
However dont base your character on whats &quot;recomended&quot; I probably have one of the sorriest excuses for a class/race combo in EQ but i've never been told &quot;No you may not join this group because youre a pansy wood elf warrior&quot; well not yet anyway :)~<br>

Just do what makes you happy and its cool ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubigbadsouless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BigBad Souless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(2/15/01 7:52:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Druid</span><hr size=1> I highly suggest a human druid. The only downside is the vision which can easily be rectified by quite a range of items: Glowing stone band, greater lightstone, glowing wooden crook, staff of the observers and later, a crown of king tranix. <br>
The druid will allow you to experience everything the game basically has to offer: Teleportation, excellerated land travel, healing, buffing, charming, summoning, nuking, meleeing, soloing, grouping and of course, expert twinkage. The druid who actually knows how to play his class is just as valuable at level 1 as he is at 60. <br>
Why human? Well, they are the most balanced. Aside from the vision impairment, the stats and nuetral nature of most npc's towards you makes a human very easy to play. (They also look kick ass in full fear armor as well as Elder spiritist.) <br>
The starting point being queynos hills is also a great newbi hunting ground in which you can proceed to the karana's and eventually freeport and oasis. <br>
The ease of leveling is something I am no longer sure of. It used to be, back in my day, that a human druid was one of the easiest char's to level regarding lack of penalties, etc.. With the new adjustments, I am not so sure, although I think they still level very fast compared to their counterparts. (Half-elves, wood-elves(wussies and look like crap in almost any gear) and halflings(nasty feet,yuk)<br>
Anyway, I hope this helps. Good luck and remember, it's just a game *grin*. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ureeko1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reeko1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#993300>(2/15/01 8:03:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid</span><hr size=1> I would probably not start on this server.  It seems to me that it throws people off a whole lot.  I've been tossed off more on Drinal in the few months it has been up than I was on Mith Marr in close to a year and a half.  Not to mention it's green again which just means even more people will be on it.  The people on this server do seem more bitter than other servers, but that isn't a huge deal.  There are still some very nice people on Drinal, like everywhere else there are the good and the bad.  Drinal itself is not old but it stems from two very old servers.  A good portion of drinal is high levels who have been playing for a long time.  Not to say it's a terrible server, but the connectivity issues and the fact that everyone else has a 2 year head start would probably make me chose a different server if I was just starting out. But, if you had a friend on Drinal or you really wanted to start on Drinal then don't listen to me, and just start on Drinal :)<br>
<br>
As for a class, I'd suggest a warrior if you can play for large amounts of time at a sitting.  Casters are probably harder in the first few levels.  But beyond that, they are much more expensive to start out.  I know with my cleric, I was poor as heck for a very long time because it's hard to buy both the equipment you need and the spells you need wehn you are just beginning.  If you can manage large chunks of time to play at once a warrior is good since you'd be able to group.  If your time is erratic and cannot get large chunks at one time a caster is a better bet.  <br>
  <br>
The EASIEST character to level without any help is a necro.  But I would not suggest a necro to start out.  Mostly because of the research end, but also because they are limited where they can go, and rather expensive to start out. <br>
  <br>
So if you are able to get large chunks of time to play I'd suggest starting a warrior, because they are realitively easy to start and don't need spells.  I say you'd need a lot of continous time to play for a warrior becuase they have to group and groups command a large time sink (well only really in high level places like Seb where it's a pita to get replacements).  But also it could take a while to find a group sometimes.  If you can't get a lot of continous time to play my suggestion would be a shaman.  Shamans can group when they want to and still solo very well.  They are not bad to start out, as they can fight through the lower levels pretty easy.  They also don't have to worry about research because all their spells are buyable. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ureeko1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reeko1</A> at: 2/15/01 8:18:52 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1263.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessage?topicID=1267.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessage?topicID=1246.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=1263.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1263.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1263.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
