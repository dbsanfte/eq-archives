Thogg to me I think a wedding means a little bit more than having an excuse to have people go and get your FA pieces. Since we took sky, and you were planning to do the spiroc lord (for your FA), you march right on over to Chardok to get the other last part of the warrior FA. I dont know what to say here dude.. That's pretty pathetic there I would say, just think about it for a while.. <br>
<br>
Im only a kid dude and if I said anything that offends you, or anything that looks like it might start a fight, I didnt mean it that way, sometimes things just come out as we dont intend them to.

He bitched and bitched and bitched when Wuden won Willsapper (13/20 effect:75% slow) on boards and to GMs, that it made shamans &quot;worthless and not needed&quot; and that it was dropping way too easily, because he knew he would never get one.  A week later or so it was nerfed and made no drop, and the effect was nerfed to the equivilent of Togor's Insects. I'm just sick of him atm, and I dont wanna put up with his BS..

if you want to vent (and just that), open the window and shout it out to the neighborhood. Believe me, it works pretty good although it needs some practice to find the right volume level for it (well, and maybe you should check the time because it is uncool at 3am).<br>
Now to be honest Jorpster: 75% slowness on a weapon is overpowered and you know it. 75% slowness would mean a 40% speed buff on the warrior BP and as we just got invigorate (sp) VI itself thought that a speed buff for warriors would be too much of unbalancing. You know that I respect you and Wuden, but before accusing Thogg to be a lamer who is just whining because he doesn't get the shit you got, think about it. I would never say that a 1/1 warrior only weapon is overpowered because I would hurt myself when they nerfed it. I would be so damn quiet about it and enjoy my soloing arts. But I am not Thogg and everybody feels different about it.<br>

i saw a bugged weapon brought it to verants atention and they admited the value was entrered wrong in the spdat.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if you guys had plans to camp it for your guild.<br>
<br>
i raised the subject before anyone on this server EVER HAD ONE on the main verant board.<br>
<br>
Wuden did NOT TELL ME ABOUT IT YOU MORON i told HIM about it being in there. at the time i did not know where it droped but i did know the exact stats.<br>
<br>
You can ask wuden yourself when he won it he sent me a tell and i said ya its 75% slow thats bugged its way to high <br>
<br>
I wasnt even there when wuden got his. i dont care about what armor or items you got.<br>
<br>
 even if I had goten it myself before anyone else i would have posted about it being way over the top.<br>
<br>
BTW never get one? i could get one any time i want its not that rare its not that hard to get and i can get more then enough people to raid dragon nec any day of the week.<br>
<br>
This is exactly why we dont get along you and many cih think your gods gift to the server. No one lese can do what you do or anything that you can. Your wrong and there nothing you can do i cant.<br>
Cih in whole is good people its a few arogant ones who are the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
as for the terok post i never lied once nore did i make anything up <br>
<br>
my whole post was 1 if he was banned valindor had a reason and 2 they cant bann you with no reason<br>
<br>
1 valindor had the logg looked at by a programer who said there could be some tampering. but that ie might not have been.<br>
<br>
2 he was ORDERed to bann terok by HIS superior at verant.<br>
<br>
3 he wanted to belive terok but he has to do what hes told<br>
<br>
4. You people wanted him fired for doing his job and thats just BS.<br>
<br>
so where did i lie in any of that? nce again you twist shit to make me look like  bad guy i never was glad that he got banned i mearly defended valindor in saying that calling to have him fired for doing his job is bs.<br>

So what you are saying is that while you were hacking EQ files, you noticed a over-powered weapon that no one on the server had and you reported it to Verant.  Reporting a broken weapon is not justification for hacking.<br>
