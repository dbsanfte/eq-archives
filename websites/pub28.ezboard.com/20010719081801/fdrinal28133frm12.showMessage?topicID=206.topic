<br>
Yes I was thoroughly sickened and disgusted by Dogguk's posting. Why? Because I worked 2 years to build a character to have it torn down in one forum posting. Two years after work, sacrificing weekends with friends, and learning how to play my enchanter each step of the way, there was no such luxury of powerleveling for new people. I tried to talk to him in tells on 3 separate occasions where we had fairly reasonable to non-reasonable discussion. The first time I was placed on ignore and recieved a forum flame. Someone who had a chance to find out why I had to leave at 4AM from a raid or what the motivation was in Chardock decided instead of talking to me to post it in here. <br>
<br>
He was not right to have done so and I am quite certain he knows that by now. Dragoonr you are not right for posting fiction, Julian you aren't right for posting in here that I am a man for no reason and propagating rumours because you didn't have your way either.<br>
<br>
For Christs sake believe it or not I do have a fucking life, and you tossed 2 years and a huge chunk of time I took away from it down the drain with a forum posting that was for the most part a glamourized piece of fiction designed to support the whining of a pissed off person. Well guess what? That made me mad *shock*. I was even accused of being a flamer then and I had never flamed anyone at that point. <br>
<br>
I reall chalked this up to some kind of bad karma anyway for a forum posting I made at level 20 which could have been better handled through some other avenue. So I took my losses deleted char and decided to move on to new things...except I decided for a change I was no longer going to sit on the sidelines and watch people screw others out of the game. I was going to put my 2cp in for a while- I thought it was wrong to bring the Divinius Verita's fights in here, I thought it was wrong to accuse Frizzy of stealing - I thought it was wrong to accuse Phoenixx of gating. What I got back for voicing my opinion was a little swarm of brats on me again.<br>
 <br>
Stop fucking with people like you are a 8 year old kid. (Or are you?) Go play the stupid game. Everyone doesn't get along - people are screwed daily this way that way. The only reason you bring your case in here in the first place is because you feel like whining and brinigng focus to the issue instead of standing up like an adult and fixing the shit yourself.<br>
<br>
I didn't support you - get over it. If you post in the forum people may not support you - doesn't mean you hop in line to attack them next.<br>
<br>
What it boils down to is that all of us in game do not have our way each and every day - and all the parties who have posted in here to date are guilty of the same thing. That does not say it excludes me. I know it really ticks you off that I didn't support Bannions post, that I think it is a joke that slinker and bro flamed frizzy etc. Apparently my renegade desire to stop seeing other people get screwed like I was was just not enough so you assholes just turned your attention to me. <br>
<br>
You say it is because I post too much, but let me show you something:<br>

<br>
I did not say a word for 16 days. 16 days I said nothing. My character has been deleted for four months. You would think you people have accomplished enough for having me delete my character (for no real justified reason). <br>
<br>
This isn't me &quot;posting too much&quot;. This is you &quot;cajoling me back&quot;. <br>
<br>
Here is your chance. Starting right now, 7AM central. Can you refrain from making a posting about Tatianae Fatecaster? I mean shit what have you even posted about me that I have done &quot;wrong' in game? What made me a bad player? You can't even give explicit details - you just are like a bunch of grade school kids who developed a fucking rumour and decided to propagate it amongst yourself then a few bold people let it carry over in to here. And you wonder why I would make reference to you guys as if you &quot;as a group&quot; are a problem? <br>
<br>
I dare you to try not posting about me. I dare you that if you choose to post you be honest with yourself and the community with your accusations. If you can't live up to the challenge then I dare you to &quot;stop wondering&quot; why the hell I post back. You think I am here to aggravate? I sat silent for 16 days. That is aggravation? Your logic evades me.<br>
<br>
So starting now is it possible for you guys to focus on the game or anything else?<br>

<br>
Let's see who the first poster is about Tatianae. &quot;They&quot; are the ones who are obsessed with keeping this going not me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/21/01 4:37:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubalrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balrak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#993300>(5/21/01 7:47:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not im sympathy here but</span><hr size=1> Tat, Tat, Tat, I'm not here to bid anyone sympathy but let me ask you this, why did you quit playing an enchanter? I didn't finish reading the entire post, do to RL time restraints, lol. Anyhow, did you quit playing because someone came out here one day and flamed you? You really think people believe most of what they read here? Do you not realize anyone can say anything here and for the most part I look at it like this, I let you the viewer decide, but if people decide to believe in some lame lie and rumor some child is posting then so be it. Their the fools and the gullable ones who would read into something posted by someone who obviously has the rep for making things up. You see the road we are walking on now? <br>
<br>
Tat, when some child came out here and posted I ninja looted my cleric helm from hate long ago, they never once sent me a tell, at the time I wasn't even aware it was posted here. Rather then this person who I never had a beef with before talking to me, he came here and posted the biggest damn lie I ever saw, and many knew it to. Funny part was, he had NO IDEA what really happened because he wasn't even involved furthermore he was only pissed because it was his friend who was bitching, and as far as hate raid coming to a hault, you may blame your mighty Shaere and also how about asking him why he began kicking people out of the raid who had nothing to do with what happened but because they were in the same guild he takes it out on innocent people. Ohh but you see there's more then meets the eye there, afterall it wasn't me who was punishing the innocent there, rather it was the raid leader and his piss poor cry baby friends who in the past were not rolling on items because mr Shaere was just giving the shit to them and NO they didn't have 2 pieces left on their set, they came up with 0 planar armor. <br>
<br>
Back to my story to you Tat, in the end did all that stop me? Ok so some people actually were stupid enough to believe that knaves post, let them. Their dumb enough to believe some known pathelogical liar then more power to the fools. For me, I was and still will be damned if I will let someone come here trying to hurt my name or anyone elses for NO REASON. Do you think that for once, I'd quit playing because some little 4 eye'd two bit asshole said something about me here? Here's a hint, it's call hell will freeze over before that time happens.<br>
<br>
Actually Tat, I am suprised you let some post out here bully you into canning your enchanter. I will give credit where credit is due and Tat, as an enchanter you were really good. I am very suprised to see you let some post out here make you quit. You see there are 2 classes in the game that a group MUST have, they are 1. A cleric *a GOOD one* 2. An enchanter *again, a good one*. So Tat and anyone else here who is dealing with the same crap, remember that. Because when those people are putting together a group and they can't get their buds to come, guess who they come crying back to, to get you to group. Funny how they really act all nice then and try to be your best friend. I've had this happen many times, when they needed a cleric to break a camp and no one else would do it because it was to risky. Enough said.<br>

So tell me Qalar. When did I group with you and it didn't go well?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 504<br> <font color=#993300>(5/21/01 8:28:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> All message postings are 100% correct. Therefore my statement that Qalar was spotted having cybersex with Julian is true. <br>
<br>
And so you contradict yourself. In one statement you say that there are claims about me in here so therefore I am a bad player. By the way show me the claims - you think Julian saying I am a man has anything to do with my capabilities? Dragooner just made shit up to support him. <br>
<br>
The only times I can think of that I ever left Guardian was when my cat was having one of her (all too frequent) seizures. I left the group when we exited to find a replacment for the group. We were sitting by the globe getting ready to re-start. <br>
<br>
Hmmm there was also one time when someone said &quot;Why doesn't the enchanter just leave&quot; when I essentially told him he was an asshole for calling someone an asshole - but you were 100% &quot;definately&quot; not in that group and we actually managed to work out our differences.<br>
<br>
So that really just leaves the incident where I had cat problems. So my cat flopping around with bodily fluids being released on my various parts of my furniture is indeed far more important than staying to locate another enchanter or replacement for their group while they are sitting out by the globe in trakanon.  Don't really remember Dragooner being in that group though, but maybe I have a bad memory on that.  It would indeed make the statement &quot;Tat left the guardian group due to a &quot;problem&quot;&quot; True without lying.  I'm sure you leet players would have just put your pet to sleep sooner so you can play EQ more because they need an enchanter, but I have made a conscious decision to keep the cat as 99.9% of the month she is happy.<br>
<br>
Well there are times when I just have to log off and I have to tell people no I am sorry I can't join their group, but I'm sure that is a problem with you guys too.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there is a lot of stuff that has happened over the course of two years in my game that I could say were both fun and not so fun. I could say the same for you, Jorply, julian et al. But only one detailed event has been presented in here about me and it was Dogguk and it wasn't accurate. It was enough though to not make it worthy of playing my character any more for though. He refused to take it down. He waited 3 months to confess it wasn't accurate.<br>
<br>
Well then there is the whole issue that I don't agree with you guys flaming everyone and the redundancy of the attacks on people in the forum. You can flame me for that now - but that has nothing to do with the game and how the good days and bad days were for two years. Just happens that it was enjoyable being able to say what I actually think about your flaming assholes and Tatianae is dead so there are no ramifications any more.<br>
<br>
You state that what the forum says is true and then you tell me I am weak for letting it impact me. So &quot;people&quot; believe these forums - yet I am weak to be concerned that they beleive these to all be true?  Give me a break that is the whole issue and 100% reason to just get rid of a char, it is that or sit around and deal with the negative ramifications of the first derogatory forum posting.<br>
<br>
Why play a char whom has to be picked on by everyone for the rest of their career due to Dogguk's posting? I must say it has had it's entertainment factor just deleting then following knowing that now I am totally immune to what you do from here. You guys are just following up flaming a non-existant being.<br>
<br>
Qalar has grouped with me once as a rogue (maybe more but I wouldn't know your alts). Qalar has no knowledge of me personally. Qalar states these forum postings about me are true. Qalar does not determine this from empirical science - he does it based upon the social structure and his circle of influence. All very good reasons to be weak and delete a char. <br>

<br>
Anyone who knows me will tell you that leaving EQ at anytime for Real Life reasons needs no explination at all.  If you're going out that night with some friends, going to baseball practice(me!), going to school, or anything, just say that you have to go for such and such reason and log off.  Its that simple.  If someone can't respect that, then they take EQ way to seriously, ok?<br>
<br>
The only time I ever saw you in EQ was while I was playing my rogue and joined your group with Nodda's twink Orphus I believe.  Some mob ran off with SOW(thx Nodda sucking) and trained tons of mobs on us around the entrance to the zone out area.  So I pop up in NFP and ask Orphus to see if the way to our corpses had respawned yet, and a couple mobs had, so I started running my rogue there to pull us.  Then I get a tell from Nodda that you had tried running down to our corpses like 6 times or something and died each time.  Then I hear something in group chat...&quot;well, there goes level 54&quot;  or something.  I just shake my head at how someone could do that, lol.<br>
<br>
I don't really give 2 shits about what people say about other people on message boards, so I only judge you on that one time deal, and therefore I think you don't use all the marbles in your head, if they are there.  And then I see the drinal message boards basicly spammed with pages and pages of your crap, and it kinda just confirms what I thought.<br>
