                   Clerics have changed drastically.  I first played a cleric because of their versatility, they were awesome undead soloers and were good at grouping.  Maybe you didnt play everquest back then, but there was a time when kunark, velious, and luclin didnt exisit.  During this time, clerics had undead nukes that were 95% as efficient as the greatest wizard nuke of the time (ice comet).  Clerics were one of the best soloers from level 44 to level 50 and could solo for nearly as good as group experience with a clarity.  <br>
                  Now lets fast forward 2 years+, clerics now have an undead nuke that is worse than their live nuke.  All the places with undead that are blue to 60 and not surrounded by living mobs are in zones with horrible ZEMs.  Clerics are replaceable by druids or shamans in 90%+ of the level 60 aa zones of choice.  In these zones, clerics offer less to groups than druids or shamans.  Along with having a lower amount of utility spells they can add to the group, they also contribute a signifigantly smaller amount of DPS. Even with flowing thought 15+ MC 1, a level 60 druid is able to surpass the damage I can add to the group, as well as providing other utilities.  I will not even go into the power that a shaman has over clerics and druids, when i play multiple characters, 90% of the time I play zzod a 60 shaman.  The power of a 60 shaman is amazing, which is why you dont here them talking about the heals because they dont want a nerf =P.<br>
<br>
    I agree that the cleric changes should not have went live without the druid/shaman healing changes but the changes for clerics arent signifigant enough to cause nearly as much uproar as it is currently causing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy #@!%...I dinged</span><br>  Posts: 1074<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 4:08:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=57>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Copied this from another thread on these boards since this thread made more sense to have it in:<br>
OK...everyone needs to read this very carefully.<br>
<br>
Clerics aren't pissed about the CHeal-lite. We were mad when it was being given with NO viable potential for 99% of the clerics in the game to get exp outside of a group. We were excited about the Cheal-lite being given out, except for the rare exception....and once we saw the other things given to us at the same time, we really had no complaints (well, some still did, but that's gonna happen anywhere /shrug).<br>
<br>
The people whined and moaned that clerics actually were able to do some damage in melee. Totally ignoring that in a group we were still well below any other class (15DPs or so), that our DPS never scaled up (level 56 in planar level gear would do basically the same damage as a level 60+100 in VT gear, though the crit nuke AA would add a little to the 60s) and that the extra DPS was nessicary to offset the awful damage we would take soloing.<br>
<br>
All they saw was some cleric meleeing when he should have been healing (because he got a new toy and wanted to spend a night playing with it /gasp) against a high AC Luclin mob outdamaging a ranger because of the unresistable proc being &gt; than mitigatable melee damage. If those two had run to Seb and fought two frogs side-by-side, it would have been a different story.<br>
<br>
Fine...when the new druid heals go into game, I'll run parses of the difference in DPS and healing ability ratios of a druid and cleric. <br>
<br>
The druid (60+50) will be in Seb Guard when grouped with all 60+50ish characters. The group will consist of druid, monk, shaman, enchanter, warrior and rogue.<br>
<br>
The cleric will be in LowerZig with all level 56 characters. His group will consist of cleric, enchanter, ranger, monk, sk, mage.<br>
<br>
Then I'll take that info and use it to start petitions and scream nerf for the new CHeal-lite after I post it on every class board and community board I can find.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I'll just be happy that my friends got something to help round out their abilities and maybe give them some options when they are deciding where they are going to adventure for that evening. Nah....can't do anything like that.  <p><table border=1>

<br>
Had a little time to play with my happy happy hammer before work today. Discovered another issue altogether that makes soloing far more difficult for a cleric than it would seem. The god damn proc breaks your root. As soon as the mob runs it is panic city trying root and to nuke him down before he brings adds. Add = lost mob and maybe death if your not hightailing it out of there immediately. <br>
<br>
Seems they may have adjusted the proc rate slightly it seemed to proc more today than after yesterdays nerf. But impossible to tell without a parse. <br>
<br>
Windy thats fair enough comparison but the part that really hurts clerics is giving the heal to one of the most popular classes in the game. There arent infinitely more bards and necros than enchanters for one, two, necros I believe would prefer to solo anyways rarely see a necro wanting to group. Occasionally in Velks or something for fast easy exp. I dont have the statistics and just guessing but I would guess there is at least twice as many druids than clerics if not more. Talk about instant overwhelming competition. Thats the part that disturbs me. <br>
<br>
I honestly think if they want to fix high end encounters and this is just repeating myself is give them CH at 60. Simple problem solved. A 60 druid can displace a cleric in all but a few places in the game already and you remedy the shortage of high end healers on high end raids. For clerics give them a mana efficient 2k undead nuke and undead snare. Nothing earth shattering by giving both. Shaman fix their torpor and I think they would be satisified. Do this and very little imbalance is created. <br>
<br>
Giving a cleric a melee weapon and giving a druid a near ch has fixed absolutely nothing in the game. The near CH cant be used effectively in high end cch group. And cleric still cant really solo. Why is this so hard for you all to see? The actual reasult of this will be Druid is still worthless on high end raid, cleric stilll cant solo, druid can now take over most exp groups from clerics at 54 when they could just as easily and more efficiently be quading.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umadronedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MadroneDorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 8:15:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: &gt; Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Lots of necros i know like to group, its finding the group that is hard.<br>

Heh I find it funny, clerics say that druids take all the healing spaces, and druids say that they dont have a chancee to get a spot because clerics will always get spot...<br>
