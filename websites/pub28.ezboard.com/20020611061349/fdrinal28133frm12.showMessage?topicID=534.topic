<br>
I left of my own accord today at 9:30 pm EST. Following Clan's win on Telkorenar in West ToV, The Kindred, a very well known and honorable guild on our server, moved into HoT. Members of Clan were upset because they felt they were going to return to HoT for Dozekar. Understandable. However other members with &quot;seniority&quot; decided not to go which was gracious of them since with the numbers Clan had at the time they could have easily taken HoT. Now many who were disgruntled would complain as we all do.. I Myself am in dreadlands heading to KC....don't worry there is a point to this long winded story...... anyway... Certain members.. let's call them... A and B.... send me a tell in game for real names of these pricks... A proceeds to mock and attack those of clan who were upset about not goin to HoT. I spoke up and remarked &quot; It's understandable that they would be upset so why don't you show them some respect&quot;. Player A proceeded to attack and insult me.... now over the last few months people like this were begining to wear and tear on my patience.. so i /guildemoved myself from the notorious clan Skallagrim. Upon my leaving i amd sent close to about 30+ tells asking me why i left.... Player A decides to be a total liar and claim that i left due to Not winning the Lance of Thunder off Telk... <br>
<br>
Now anyone who knows me in game knows i Weild the Black Rock Maul of Crushing.. a weapon MUCH better than the lance of thunder.... my use for the lance is null and i wouldn't take it even IF I HAD EVEN BEEN IN TOV.. which i wasn't i was in DL... <br>
<br>
I try to explain that my reason for leaving was due to the complete lack of respect my &quot;family&quot;, as they like to think of themselves, showed me. No one deserves to be in any guild that has people that have no respect for the feelings of their fellow members. It's not fair and the game loses purpose then. <br>
<br>
Now.. I attempt to state these feelings on the clan message baord. Low and behold my board access has so swiftly been removed by some person.... we will not infer who that is yet... cause even i don't know....<br>
<br>
I wasn't even allowed the chance to tell my side of the story. i was simply denied. That's outright censorship. Clan officers with board admin ability OFTEN delete posts that speak negatively about how the clan is run or when a member leaves and is unhappy.. i have seen it done.. one minute a &quot;goodbye clan&quot; pos is there the next minute it's gone.  This is customary to how Nazi Germany was run....   <br>
<br>
So i am forced to post here.. hopefully many Drinal players will see this an Know once and for all the truth behind clan Skallagrim as now i have decided to cut my ties.. i do not wish to be associated with a guild that wishes to steal spawns in HoT from other guilds who were rightfully there or a guild that has no respect for anyone but themselves and even then their respect for fellow guild members is lacking.<br>
<br>
Now do not get me wrong there are MANY wonderful people in Clan skallagrim.. Those of you who DID show kindness to me ( you know who you are) i will miss you and forgive me for this but it must be done... no one else will do it....<br>
<br>
I spoke to Clan Skallagrim's leader player B.... oh screw it we know who he is.. the loving Kaldrani! /applaud............<br>
<br>
seriously now... I am told that my side of the story is irrelevant and that i will not be permitted to even have somone reitterate what i say in Guild speech.... basicly i get sent to an internment camp never to be heard of again.<br>
<br>
Ahem... i wil not be silenced.. i will not be ignored..<br>
<br>
I am a human being... and as we all sem to froget sometiems this is a game.. and behind those pixels and polygons.. REAL HUMAN BEINGS with real feelings and real thoughts exist... Clan seems to forge this fact often as how they treat their members.. i am not alone in this treatment many others have left earlier than myself due to these policies. <br>
<br>
To sum all this up... I left Clan Skallagrim cause they refuse to change.. and those in power or who hold seniority refuse to be respectful to anyone that is not bearing gifts for them. <br>
<br>
I care nothing for lances or loot from you i merely wanted your friendship and a place to rest my head on Drinal.... and once again i will go Lobo and enjoy playing the game again becaue Kaldrani, Player A.... and Clan Skallagrim are no longer a part of my life... <br>
<br>
I urge ANYONE who was planning or considering applying to Clan Skallagrim to think twice and weigh your options heavily.... because you might even quit this great game which has brought so many new and interesting people into our lives simply because they don't know how to be human.<br>
<br>
Once again i use general terms like they only because if i used a list of names it would be even longer post... There ae hose in Clan at this moment who are good people and are wondeful to play with.. it is sad they choose to remain in clan and soil their names even further... i will gladly still group with those kind people they know who they are.... i Urge them to seek another place as well... becasue in the grand scheme o things..<br>
<br>
Clan Skallagrim is like a Sinking ship... i am the first Sailor to hit the waves....<br>
<br>
thank you and Good night.<br>

What I cannot understand is why they post the dribble here, especially when it is not under rants and flames.<br>
<br>
Reputations can be created and destroyed on a message board.  Because you have difficulty with the guild you were in does not make anything you have said accountable.  Those of a lesser IQ may jump on your banwagon and agree with you just because you printed words.<br>
<br>
I am also not saying you are wrong.  You may be 100% correct in your views.  The problem is they are your veiws.  No one else should have to read this dribble or give a fook.<br>
<br>
People have to experience things for themselves and use their own minds to decide what's right  and wrong for them.  It's not like many people here really gives a fook what happen between you and your guild.  If they bared you from the guild website then you should be sending guild members that you think will listen to you tells.<br>
<br>
If you wanna flame there is an entirly seperate section for that.  You can ack like a dick/whinner/complainer all you want.<br>
<br>
As an fyi I know absolutly no one in Clan whatever.  I am just sick of seeing people piss against the wind when something does not go their way.<br>

If you actually read his post, he's trying to warn others from the same @#%$ happening to them.  I realize that might be to many words for you to comprehend but c'mon, get serious.  I've been in CS for a while now, and I saw this the first week I joined.  I have always respected Ashrahm and considered him a friend, whether he views me or not in the same way I don't know...I've always had a problem with the way the officers try to be nazi's and tell me when I can do something and where I can do it.  Gotten into a lot of  arguments w/ people trying to tell me what to do.  First off one should never have the send a guild officer a reply stating "Shut the @#%$ up and don't speak to me"...Been there done that.  It's bull-@#%$...I don't play my char that's in CS anymore because he's retired...I stayed in the guild because I have a lot more friends then enemies there, and would like to keep it that way...Oh well guess after posting this I will no longer be a member of CS.  CS has a lot of great people, but the attitude that follows the guild is something I don't care to be around.  Anyways....<3 to all of you...you know who you are )  Good luck CS on whatever you plan to do, perhaps opening your minds would be the first step.  Anyways...Seeing that Eldini has replied...You don't deal with the same @#%$ we do, I don't give a @#%$ How much you try to say you do, you have no idea.  You barely play as it is.<br>
In all honesty can you say that there is some assholes in CS?  There sure is,  I don't care to name names, they know who they are.  I'll be the first person to tell you I don't like you, and you Eldini, I liked.  Posting what you said in response to his post was immature and shouldn't have been said, you know that.  I don't care how much you like/dislike him everyone is entitled to their own opinions.  With CS it was always the sheep being controlled by the shepards, and I'm no @#%$ sheep.  I suggested things and got totally @#%$ ignored, so you know what, @#%$ that.  I'm not here to spend my time online w/ my friends to deal with the Assholes that try to make this game worse then it already is.  You'd be surprised at some of the idea's that can come from people, but when no one is willing to listen and get lied to that they are being listened to, why waste that 5 minutes of your life ever again?  This has happened to me multiple times, and others, but we just shrugged it off like it's no big deal.  <br>
<br>
Ashrahm brought up a good point, that most see, but some seem to be blind to it even tho it's right there in your face.  Behind those pixels that makes your character, is a person.  Don't forget that...Nothing more needs to be said from me, you want answers e-mail me default@theriver.com<br>
<br>
Edit:  As for Deedo, you always hated me anyways.  I remember watching you explain your hatred of me to about 6 other guildies as I was laughing my ass off.  Add me to your ignore list if I'm not already on it...<3!<br>
