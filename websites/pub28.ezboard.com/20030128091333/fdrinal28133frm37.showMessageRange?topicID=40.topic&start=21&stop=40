<br>
How do we solve this problem? I'd like to think that if people thought it through, they wouldn't come to the conclusion that killing future human beings (regardless of whether or not they are currently viable organisms) is the best solution. Do we make the government give vasectomies to all 11 year old boys, also paying for their reversion procedures? Of course not. People know what the consequences of having sex are. If they don't want to have a baby, they should use contraception. If they REALLY don't want to have a baby, they shouldn't have intercourse. It's not like there isn't an easy solution to the problem of unwanted children: don't conceive them.<br>
<br>
The question of bringing a person into a bad environment is really moot in my mind. If you, in your current situation, had to decide if you'd rather live a crappy life or die immediately, I'd imagine most people would choose to live and either make the best or attempt to improve their circumstance. Working to improve the lives of those people who live in poor conditions is another matter altogether, and one that unborn children shouldn't have to base their existence on.<br>
<br>
Also, although it's a very gray area, I really dislike arguments about whether or not the fetus is a human being when determining its rights. It will become a human being. We have environmental laws to protect our progeny's world, not our own. Making the argument that they aren't capable of living on their own is weak as well, since humans are incapable of truly caring for themselves for many years after they are born; does that make it ok to euthanize them should finances become too tight for the family? That is obviously an extreme, but as I said it's a gray area when attempting to make definitions.<br>
<br>
My point is this: none of the arguments for allowing abortions (aside from rape) takes into consideration the cause for &quot;need&quot; to have them, which is irresponsibility. If you think that is too politically incorrect, we'll have to disagree and move on.<br>
<br>
I'd like to re-iterate that I in no way condemn any person who has had an abortion. I'd like to ask people think about the consequences of their actions and take responsibility for those consequences when they arrive. The past is past; let's make the future better for everyone. <p><hr><font size=1>

<br>
I remember in debate....<br>
<br>
The only ones against abortion were guys...and on the subject of chemical castration for repeated sex offenders, all the women were against it.<br>
<br>
<br>
To me, women are the ones who have to deal with the mental anguish of the entire ordeal. They should be the ones to decide weather or not they want to keep the child. PERIOD....EXKLAMAYSHUN POINT<br>
<br>
<br>
Guys cant be raped...unless it's by other guys, and lets dwell on this for a moment.<br>
<br>
Say your walkin to your car guys....and some big dude forces you to the ground...hits you a few times...fractures a few ribs, finds some way to hog tie you....then takes off your pants, and sticks his dick in your ass.<br>
<br>
most of you wouldn't like it...briyan...I'm gonna guess that you wouldn't like it either.....<br>
<br>
Then a few weeks later, you realize that the big dude that anally raped you...has a little piece of him growing inside you...that you now have to take care of and love for the next 18 years.<br>
<br>
kids are hard enough to take care of as it is....let alone that everytime you look at the kids face, he reminds you of the guy that raped you.<br>
<br>
..............<br>
<br>
<br>
I can see the other side of this arguement, but I think as people, and human beings, we should help the person make the right choice based on how they feel individually...not just say &quot;abortion is wrong you are a sinner, and your going to hell if you abort&quot;. Cause that's not what the person needs.<br>

Uhh, no, most people don't that have abortions.  Most people that have abortions, are young people that don't understand the consequences and reprecusions of having sex.  I know that was one of the last things on my mind and still pretty much is.   Most guys that tell you different are liars.<br>

That being said, I think it's a woman's right to have the choice.  I know that if anything ever happened to me and I got pregnant, I'd like to know that the option was there (especially in the case of rape).  I'm not saying that I'd actually go through with it, though.  However, I'd have to say that I'm totally against abortion after the first trimester.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I just love the ppl who go to Planned Parenthood and protest outside...Planned Parenthood doesn't perform abortions (at least not where I live), which makes me wonder wtf these ppl are protesting about-safe sex? contraception? what?

The far right would see to it that we neither have birth control or abortions if they could. (then it becomes an issue of *why* they are against birth control and the only reason I see for such is because they are trying to shove their religious beliefs in to the face of the rest of the nation)<br>
<br>
I have personally never had an abortion and that is because I was lucky enough to be raised by parents who educated their children on birth control - sure they would have preferred abstinence until a certain age, but they planned for the unexpected and gave us the tools we needed to act sensibly.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utorunkes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torunkes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/19/02 10:11:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> when guys get a lil jerk before work, is that mass murder?<br>

If they do it even though they know they could catch a virus that would end their life. What makes you think the chance of getting pregnant would stop them? I AM NOT calling anyone stupid. What I am saying is that when plp are young, as I once was they are invencable. All the stuff that happens to other plp including getting pregnant will never happen to them. Using the not getting pregnant in the first place as an argument agianst abortion would work if we were all born knowing what we know at 30 hehe. In the real world though it doesnt work that way. Yeah in my perfect worl every child concieved will be to a happy finacially stable couple that will love and nurture them for the real of their lives ( I will also always look 22 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p><a href="/http://gyia.20fr.com" target="_blank">

They do. If a brain is dead beyond all measurable activity, and the body is surviving upon intensive care, they WILL turn the machines off.

<br>
I DO believe that life is precious, valuable, and really miraculous. Anyone who has had as much medical training as I have can agree that the human body is the most magnificent artwork imaginable, all the way down to the intracellular signaling pathways. <br>
<br>
I DON'T believe that a person's convenience, comfort, financial stability, environment, or freedom of choice should overrule another person's right to live. <br>
<br>
I DO believe that an unborn baby is alive in a valuable sense, from the moment it is conceived. If you disagree that it is alive(which I must say I hope you do if you are pro-choice, in light of the alternative), then let me ask you this: why is it that when unborn babies are unwanted, they are termed fetuses, but when parents become pregnant who plan to keep their child they call it a baby; they name it in the womb; they buy it toys and clothes; they dream of its future. It's a dangerous double standard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulothielanderwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lothiel Anderwynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/20/02 8:19:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Oh, and without derailing the topic, I was just pondering this: why is the left/liberalism/democrats usually associated with pro-choice, and the right/conservativism/republicans usually associated with pro-life?

See, i have a disease called Endometreosis. I was told there is a very small chance that i can still have kids...but 9 times out of 10 i would miscarry. So if i ever did get pregnant, of course i would never have an abortion...but that is my choice. Each person is different, and is in a different situation.<br>
<br>
You can say that people dont know the repricutions of sex....most of them do, they may not fully understand them, but they do know what they are. Also, you cant just yell and preach at people and tell them how god awful sex is. Sex is part of human nature..it is gonna happen whether you want it to or not. Most peopls will power isnt that strong. Once you get those emotions flowing...and well...etc etc...anyway, its not always nec. a &quot;wham bam thank you mam&quot; either...and even though some parents are young, some of them really are ready for parenthood, it depends on the person. It depends on their maturity lvl..and what their financial situation is. Rape is totally another story. When rape occurs....and a baby is created...to me, that choice is totally up to the mother. <br>
<br>
Anyway, im rambling...i guess what i am trying to say is that i am Pro-Choice. Even though it isnt something that i would choose, i dont have the right to make that choice for someone else. <p><HTML><P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="848BC8"><B><I>

Ironically, all the christians that came here did a 180, and decided that others had to do what &quot;THEY&quot; thought was right in the eye's of god.<br>

they may not like abortion, they may think it's a sin....and it might be... but pro lifers need to remember that in america people have the right to make that decision as long as it's not against the law.<br>
