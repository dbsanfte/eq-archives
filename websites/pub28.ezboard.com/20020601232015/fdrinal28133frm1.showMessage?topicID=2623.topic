It has implications across the board in the technology industry. This is a perfect example of what can happen when an ignorant senator is blinded by the entertainment industry. Click on Read More.<br>
<br>
<br>
The SSSCA outlaws anything with a battery that does not meet with certain standards for digital security technology, also known as digital rights management. For a long time, the entertainment industry has been pushing for this sort of thing; first with DRM enabled hard drives / storage devices as well as portable media players. Sony led the charge early, making one of their first MP3 players compliant with some of these standards.<br>
<br>
After the DRM enabled storage device movement was struck down back in 2001, the entertainment industry went to work finding a senator who was a) sympathetic to their cause or b) easily blinded. After finding a friend in Senator Hollings, they got to work on the SSSCA, the Security Systems Standards and Certification Act. It is an overly broad and far reaching act that, in a nutshell, covers just about anything electronic that a person can interact with; DVD players, computers, MP3 players. Really, anything that can be used in for the purpose of entertainment.<br>
<br>
A summary of some of the more important parts follows:<br>
<br>
SEC. 101. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN DEVICES <br>
(a) IN GENERAL.--It is unlawful to manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide or otherwise traffic in any interactive digital device that does not include and utilize certified security technologies that adhere to the security systems standards adopted under section 104. <br>
<br>
SEC. 109. DEFINITIONS<br>
(3) INTERACTIVE DIGITAL DEVICE. -- The term &quot;interactive digital device&quot; means any machine, device, product, software, or technology, whether or not included with or as part of some other machine, device, product, software, or technology, that is designed, marketed or used for the primary purpose of, and that is capable of, storing, retrieving, processing, performing, transmitting, receiving, or copying information in digital form. <br>
<br>
As you can see, this means just about anything digital that can be used to listen to digital music or view a digital movie.<br>
<br>
SEC. 103. PROHIBITED ACTS. <br>
(a) REMOVAL OR ALTERATION OF SECURITY. -- No person may -- <br>
(1) remove or alter any certified security technology in an interactive digital device; or <br>
(2) transmit or make available to the public any copyrighted material or other protected content where the security measure associated with a certified security technology has been removed or altered. <br>
<br>
The law does not block people from personal time-shift copies though, so there is *some* measure of fair use in the bill, though it does not specify that one can make a time-shift copy of a protected recording such as a protected CD. That section (SEC 103(b)) would seem to apply specifically to television.<br>
<br>
You can read the full text of the bill here. How does this affect you, you may ask? Should this bill pass and you build up your own computer instead of purchasing one from a Compaq or HP then you are violating the terms, unless you implement a certified security technology on purpose and why would you? If you have a computer purchased before the SSSCA is implemented, you may not hook it up to a network, like the internet. Open source software will be illegal as well as it can not be digitally signed and be open source at the same time. There goes the Linux / FreeBSD movement. Research into the certified security technology will be illegal as well for everyone, which includes schools and universities.<br>
<br>
While it is true that there needs to be some sort of secure way for the entertainment industry to conduct business online, this is not the way to do it. I do agree with the senator on one point and that is that broadband internet is being held back because of a lack of media content online. Sure, there are sites like newgrounds that may appeal to a percentage of the users out there, but they are hardly a driving force, hardly the killer app. The entertainment industry has the power to create the killer app, but they won't until they can do it securely. Alas, the SSSCA will certainly stifle the tech industry.<br>
<br>
Small computer shops like the one I used to work for will surely go out of business or be forced to sell branded computers, which will drive many out of business due to their much lower profit margin and increased instability. Companies that do not enjoy the favour of major computer manufacturers will take a giant hit as well. AMD, for example, is very popular among the OEMs and the small town guys as well as the computer enthusiasts but has yet to find a major in with the big guys. One could also look to the startups that have cropped up with portable digital audio solutions, a majority of them will be hurt badly.<br>
<br>
We thought the DMCA was bad, but it is a sunday picnic compared to the SSSCA.<br>

<br>
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. <br>
<br>
The Congress finds: <br>
<br>
(1) The lack of high quality digital content continues to hinder consumer adoption of broadband Internet service and digital television products. <br>
(2) Owners of digital programming and content are increasingly reluctant to transmit their products unless digital media devices incorporate technologies that recognize and respond to content security measures designed to prevent theft. <br>
<br>
(3) Because digital content can be copied quickly, easily, and without degradation, digital programming and content owners face an exponentially increasing piracy threat in a digital age. <br>
<br>
(4) Current agreements reached in the marketplace to include security technologies in certain dig- <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
3 <br>
<br>
ital media devices fail to provide a secure digital environment because those agreements do not prevent the continued use and manufacture of digital media devices that fail to incorporate such security technologies. <br>
(5) Other existing digital rights management schemes represent proprietary, partial solutions that limit, rather than promote, consumers' access to the greatest variety of digital content possible. <br>
<br>
(6) Technological solutions can be developed to protect digital content on digital broadcast television and over the Internet. <br>
<br>
(7) Competing business interests have frustrated agreement on the deployment of existing technology in digital media devices to protect digital content on the Internet or on digital broadcast television. <br>
<br>
(8) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary precondition to the dissemination, and on-line availability, of high quality digital content, which will benefit consumers and lead to the rapid growth of broadband networks. <br>
<br>
(9) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary precondition to facilitating and has- <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
4 <br>
<br>
tening the transition to high-definition television, which will benefit consumers. <br>
(10) Today, cable and satellite have a competitive advantage over digital television because the closed nature of cable and satellite systems permit encryption, which provides some protection for digital content. <br>
<br>
(11) Over-the-air broadcasts of digital television are not encrypted for public policy reasons and thus lack protections afforded to programming delivered via cable or satellite. <br>
<br>
(12) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible but will require government action, including a mandate to ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption. <br>
<br>
(13) Consumers receive content such as video or programming in analog form. <br>
<br>
(14) When protected digital content is converted to analog for consumers, it is no longer protected and is subject to conversion into unprotected digital form that can in turn be copied or redistribute illegally. <br>
<br>
(15) As solution to this problem is technologically feasible but will require government action, <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
5 <br>
<br>
including a mandate to ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption. <br>
(16) Unprotected digital content on the Internet is subject to significant piracy, through illegal file sharing, downloading, and redistribution over the Internet. <br>
<br>
(17) Millions of Americans are currently downloading television programs, movies, and music on the Internet and by using "file-sharing" technology. Much of this activity is illegal, but demonstrates consumers's desire to access digital content. <br>
<br>
(18) Piracy poses a substantial economic threat to America's content industries. <br>
<br>
(19) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible but will require government action, including a mandate to ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption. <br>
<br>
(20) Providing a secure, protected environment for digital content should be accompanied by a preservation of legitimate consumer expectations regarding use of digital content in the home. <br>
<br>
(21) Secure technological protections should enable owners to disseminate digital content over the Internet without frustrating consumers' le- <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
6 <br>
<br>
gitimate expectations to use that content in a legal manner. <br>
(22) Technologies used to protect digital content should facilitate legitimate home use of digital content. <br>
<br>
(23) Technologies used to protect digital content should facilitate individuals' ability to engage in legitimate use of digital content for educational or research purposes. <br>
<br>
