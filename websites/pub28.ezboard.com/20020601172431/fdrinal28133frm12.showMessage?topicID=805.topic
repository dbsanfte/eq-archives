You have turned on Endless Ranting! To turn off Endless Ranting, use /endlessranting off.*<br>(ooc: This is a list of stuff I hate about EQ. EQ rules though, cept I'm starting to get tired of it...someone help me!)<br><br>--Higher Level players KS'ing the Commonlands orc camps from your alts because &quot;It's fun&quot; or they want DF Belts for their alts. <br>Example: I was on an alt once at Orc 2 and this guy(I won't mention Santheb's name here...), who I think at the time was a 40-ish Monk just comes up and starts raping our orcs. So he tried to /duel us, and being intelligent we didn't accept. He lied about his level and said he was L20, so I brought out my 22 mage(before I recreated her cause her INT sucked, she was my main at the time), went to fight him for it but forgot to con him, so naturally I got owned in seconds...then one of our other guys brought his late-40's Wizard out and ran him to the zone line in a duel...but anyway. <br>Another example: I was at the West Commonlands orc camp killin' orcs for DF Belts, and I'd been there for an easy 35-40 minutes, and this L10 Rogue just shows up and starts taking orcs. I look at the guy and he's an obvious twink of a high level character. I talk to him about it, like, &quot;Hey fool, get off my orcs&quot; and he says &quot;I'm killing them for exp&quot; and I'm like, &quot;You can ask you know...&quot; and he's like, &quot;You wanna duel for it?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Me(I was upper 30's or low-40's then) Vs. You?&quot; and he's like &quot;Yeah&quot; so I'm like /shrug &quot;Okay&quot; and I type /d on him, he goes &quot;Hang on a second&quot; and he sits down and disappears. All of a sudden I see &quot;Soandso(I forgot his name...) has challenged you to a duel to the death!&quot; and I stand up and turn around and there's a Level 60 anonymous SK(??) standing there. I'm like &quot;Oh please, that's lame&quot; and just go back to killing orcs and then he switches back to his Rogue and starts accusing me of KS'ing him in /ooc and then trying to make my former guild look bad for it. I retorted with something about his guild(the Rogue wasn't in the guild, but the L60 main was, but he was /anon, but that doesn't stop /guildstatus hehe), and someone asked what guild he was with so I told 'em. Clan Skallagrim. Oh well. Eventually he left and the GM got to me like 2 hours later. /shrug<br><br>--Beggars. &quot;Does anyone have anything to spare for a Wood Elf Warrior?&quot; or &quot;Can u spare some pp for my spells plz?&quot;. Watch out for Bedan. Late one night he was raping the Qeynos gate with begging heh. There was also some guy at the gate(mighta been him) who was begging for stuff so my mage gave him a Summoned: Dagger heh. He came back a few minutes later and did a /rude to me. Apparently he learned that merchants won't buy summoned items. <br><br>--Druids. More specifically, how many of them there are on Norrath these days. It's mad impossible to find groups these days cause of that. Yeah, I've got a Druid as my main...she was made at the beginning of 2001 to replace my stat-handicapped mage(hey, I was a newbie...I didn't know INT was important for a mage and that STR was useless...sue me). Wish I'd've known how many of us there would be 16 months from then or I'd've probably chosen a different class. Oh well..<br><br>--Linkdeath. Hey, who doesn't?<br><br>--Linkdeath when fighting. Come back dead and say bye to your fresh new level.<br><br>--PST. There's a whole topic ranting on this a few pages back. PST licks balls.<br><br>--Frickin' QuickSpeak. &quot;can u plz/pls come 2 rings and give me sow plz???&quot; &quot;where r u?&quot; Basically, &quot;PLZ/PLS&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, etc, licks balls. Take the extra .05 seconds and type it right, geez. Maybe it's just me...but QuickSpeak(minus abbreviations like LOL and ROFL, etc, nothing wrong with those) is gay. I wish I could slap everyone that uses it(sorry if I know you[*cough* half my guild *cough*]).<br><br>--Getting tells for SoW, GG's, Buffs, Heals, and especially &quot;Thorns&quot;. It's alright to ask for it in ooc or shout, but please don't send tells asking for it. It's annoying. The way I see it, if anyone wants to come buff or heal or port you or whatever, they'll do it if you ask in a zone-wide channel. Too many times I've just zoned into WC or EC(yeah it's mostly only there...freakin' newbie zones) on my way to Freeport or wherever and I'll see &quot;Soandso tells you, 'can u plz GG me to BB?&quot; or &quot;can i get thorns?&quot; For my sanity, don't send tells. I hate being anonymous.<br><br>--Last, but certainly not least(more like most), is frickin' morons who misspell the word &quot;Incoming&quot;. I'm sure all of you have seen it, or even spell it wrong yourselves. Y'know, you'll join a group and whoever goes out to pull and they find a target, then you see &quot;INCOMMING a large rat, HELP ME KILL IT!&quot;, or &quot;INCOMEING a a giant spider&quot;(cause the moron has an &quot;a&quot; in front of the &quot;%T&quot;, which is lame because most mobs start with &quot;a&quot; anyway). Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Seriously, all of you who spell it that way, /slap. Get a dictionary.<br><br>/endlessranting off<br><br>Is there anyone else out there who's as anal as me about spelling and grammar usage?
