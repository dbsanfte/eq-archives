Could you provide, please, more info on how males and females exercise conflict management differently - and how it is gender specific. Do you think a female housewife may have a different form of conflict management than one that works in a male dominated environment? Or how about a female who works in a female dominated or mixed environment (e.g. teams where they utilize certain rules of engagement when communicating). Please expand how these will carry over to dialogue in game. <br>
End Quote<br>
<br>
Stereotypes are useful for quick categorization, but often break down in individual cases.  Of course, not all members of a gender are going to behave identically and anyone that thinks they do is being foolish.  I think gender based behavior is probably as much cultural as it is biological.<br>
<br>
I know of males that have female characters that I truly could not differentiate between a woman playing a woman character if I didn't personally know that player.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, does it matter?  I remember a cartoon where there's a dog sitting at a keyboard typing and the caption was, &quot;On the Internet no one knows you're a dog&quot;.  In EQ you really have no way of verifying things like gender, race, age, species (/laugh).  If someone picks a character that looks like a nubile wood-elf you really have no way of knowing there's not a dog sitting behind the monitor. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umorbeas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morbeas</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#939393>(2/9/01 8:38:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Icarus and &quot;women&quot; in Everquest</span><hr size=1> When you WERE married?<br>

Someone who's has a level 46+ can't be considered a tweak....tweak is level 20 and below hehe...maybe a little higher.<br>

I don't think it's fair that someone would have their secondary take it though...Unless their secondary was also on the raid.<br>

Your chance at loot is directly proportional to the time you put in, he is putting in the time in that char, he deserves the same shot at loot as the rest.<br>

I always knew there was something wrong with you :P So you have in RL blue skin and some weird eyes completed with white hair ? damn :) you really should go to a DNA lab and fix that shit :)<br>
<br>
Btw:<br>
<br>
I am playing a female char although being a male in RL...I always try to RP my char to the best and many ppl had the impression I was actually one till they asked me and I told em I was a male IRL.<br>
<br>
One point...This is a RPG game,to which most of us add the Powerleveling part too. Whatever you may say I have personally not met yet anyone in the game who plays a female and speaks d00dish to each other. Everyone plays the RP to a grade, it is just important to be honest to ppl when they ask your gender IRL.<br>
<br>
My opinion and what I personally feel. Speak up for yer own :)<br>

twink/main or primay/secondary or however you want to call it has nothing to do with level.  it's which character you choose to play the majority of the time and which character it is understood will be considered for loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#939393>(2/10/01 7:48:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: =/</span><hr size=1> There is nothing more to add to Shada's post :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#939393>(2/11/01 5:41:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: =/</span><hr size=1> I look like my char!!!

He played leland as if it was his fucking main, won his lotto, won/earned his planar armor.

Maybe you call others this because you yourself are one and or idolize being of such a sexual nature later when you actually mature and get a sack of your own. *help us all when that time comes* <br>

I see you hop on band wagon when they go out a posse hunt flaming people. It's kids like you and your friend that really do seem to put eq into the gutter for most people. You see, you whine, you rant, yet you never seem to make a d@mn bit of sense. The only thing I see you doing is playing someones little b*tch and following up on other flames towards or against people. So stop being a follower. Go make your own enemies, stop trying to butt your nose into business it doesn't belong in. Because this is one fire that will burn you if you get to close to it. <br>

Yada yada, I know your gonna kick my butt, your going to blackball me, your going to threaten me, I suck, I'm a newbie, I'm a d*ck, I'm gay, you're going to ruin me in game, you know my enemies really hate me, my friends really love me, go figure. Yup by all means send me these tells, I'll enjoy the good humor they will bring. I could use a good laugh here and there, but then as I said, you're just a follwer, you can't think for yourself so I guess I will have to wait till your brain developes from the pea it is, to the grape it may become, before I actually get to see these threats in game.<br>

Hey Doofy, when will you get these bridges built? If you need finances to purchase Verant, I am sure I can be of some help as a sponsor. I just ask one thing, I get a monster kill option available to me so when I run into idiots in the game I can zap them and they take exp hit AND all their armor would drop and /ooc free armor to first newbie who hails me.  <br>
