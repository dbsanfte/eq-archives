It's not anyone elses problem you can only play for an hour.<br>
<br>
Nobody is encouraging you or anyone else to exercise their freedom of speech.  If you want to put people on ignore do it, if you dont like being told to STFU, to bad, your the one that came here with some self righteous attitude about who should be allowed to camp what and where because you only have an hour to play.  Oh and guess what... your attitude of &quot;I'd pop you in the mouth&quot; is going to get you far in life, if you enjoy time in county lock up or getting your ass kicked on a regular basis that is.  You think that made you sound tough??<br>
<br>
You have to take responsibilty for your own limitations in playing the game, if you have a problem with how much time or how little time you can play, thats your problem, not anyone elses. You solve your problem by choosing an appropriate place to level your character based on level, zone useage, mob levels and grouping ability or solo ability of your character.  Stop expecting everyone else to make allowances for you.<br>

I said, my frustration applies to lower newbie leves, didn't say anything about chardok, KC or<br>
other zones. Now, you guys miss my second point which is<br>
is it fair just in terms of numbers for one guy to get satisfaction at the expense of many? A lot of you say yes and it just shows a very selfish attitude. I realize it may be fine in terms of legal aspect of the game, but morally it's repugnant because you put your own exp interest ahead of the interest of many others. (And if you didn't see &quot;Beautiful Mind and how does that apply to our situation, go see the movie) Second, I only said what I said about me hitting someone IN RESPONSE to a statement that was insulting to me and if you're one of the meek who turns his left cheek to the blow and lets insults rain down upon you like a river, well it's your choice. My choice is to strike back, blow for blow ok?<br>
About my time, I can damn choose where I want to play because i keep the interested of the group game alive. The same comment someone said to me about solo exp can be returned back to you. If you like to solo, go to underpopulated areas with lots of space to run and kite. In heavily populated places where resources are limited, you better learn how to share them fairly, unless you really want to later learn why nobody likes you. <br>
Hope this clears quite a few things for you guys.

<br>
First of all I'd like to announce I am now Uber... after all 37+ is upper levels :).<br>
<br>
Second, HHK is a treadmill zone straight out of the online how to get to 60 in 28 hour guides.  There's nothing there worth fighting over unless you're a smith, and the only thing that makes it worth camping is it's generally easy to find a group and once grouped you can shut off your brain and just grind.  If that's what you're into... go for it, not my style of gaming.<br>
<br>
There's typically an easy way to resolve issues such as this.  Ask the high level characters what they're after and help them get the hell out of there.If they're after faction, they don't need to kill the mob, just assist someone.  If they're after an item, help them obtain it.  <br>
<br>
It's amazing how easy it is to get pissed off at someone, and how equally easy it would have been to make a friend and perhaps even get some minor power leveling out of it.<br>
<br>
Add my whole guild to your black list, after all we farmed shadowed men for hours to get our temple faction up. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

Starnolan, your frustration (at the moment) might just apply to the noob zones, but what you are arguing about happens just as much if not more in high level zones too. If you are gonna get this annoyed over 40-something ppl taking your camp, then you might as well seriously consider if you really want to continue playing this game, coz i have bad news for ya. When you get to the same level as those bullying 40-something ppl, you will only find yourself gettin bullied by the 50-somethings. When ya hit 50, you will get bullied by the 60s etc... <br>
It's not nice, but that's the harsh reality of EQ, some ppl will be courteous, but there are a lot of ppl who won't give a damn about you. That may be a bloody selfish attitude, but it's human nature i'm afraid. On the bright side, we all started as noobs - everyone has been in your position at one time or another. It's part of the learning experience of EQ which we all had to learn to deal with in our own ways, and you will too. (I personally deal with it by takin names and gettin payback at a future date when i'm bigger and badder teehee).<br>

P.S. Starnolan, don't ever hunt in Velks when ya hit 50 if this kind of thing bothers ya, coz from my experience it must be the easiest and fastest place to make enemies heheh.<br>

<br>
-Who controls it?: Lets just say everyone thought the idea was good, whoever is a moderator for it could easily abuse it and put people they dont like on the list, just because they dont like them, or if someone they didnt like added someone they could ignore it.<br>
<br>
-Abuse, Example: I dont like player spinmem, so I add him to list, now this person reputation is ruined just because of something he didnt do, or a group of players does this<br>
<br>
-No Second chances: So you fuck up once.. or twice and your on it.. mistakes happen people change...<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
While I dont even like the priniciple behind this list, the overall idea of a blacklist is a bad one, and should be avoided <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50583">Madrone</a> ~ Dorfen Crusader<br>

My point:  sure, that one person is monopolizing a camp in HHK, fine.  I'm sure whatever they're doing, it's most likely not being done to piss you off.  They are doing it because they have a purpose in doing so, be it faction, experience, or maybe them goblin ears for the WFP faction quest.  Being higher level does not bereave you of the right to be in any given zone.  Most higher levels will in fact move on because there isn't much for them in lower level zones, but why in the hell would someone be blacklisted because they're &quot;too high&quot; to be in some zone?

Blacklisting is a very bad thing.  You really don't want to start something like that.<br>
<br>
2. Higher level characters have to farm greenies for all type of faction and quest items.<br>
<br>
Did you ask them if they were killing to regain thier faction with WFP?  Goblin Ears are one of the best ways to do that without hurting anyother factions.  <br>
<br>
And if they are camping an area, so be it.  Would you like it if a character a level below you told you to buzz off and leave your camp because his group would get better exp then you?<br>

Heya guys hehe.<br>
Well, Dandain to counter your first argument. Blacklisting<br>
already exists whether you like it or not. Consider all the guilds for example. To apply to one you have to have a reference from someone inside who can vouch for you. That's just a sample evidence that i could come up with on spur of my the moment. I have no problem sharing or giving up camp to newbies who can actually gain exp and loot as a group, because I remember what is it like growing to be one of those.<br>
Regarding faction and quests, it's just a matter of being respectful and ask simple question like whether i can please have the goblin ears or the hits on the mobs for faction. Done. Nobody is going to refuse you, especially if you help them with a bit of this or that. I'm not going to argue how everyone plays his game, yet the fact that there are play nice rules, means that there are limits to what people can do...<br>
Yes, there are other zones and as I have said above that depends on the time you have at your disposal to search and then travel there (maybe only to find over 100 people in OT for example and every mob dies within minutes of spawn)<br>
Well, again, only the most dedicated errr addicted <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  gamers will get through that phase to the top :-) Again, thanks for your thoughts everyone.

<br>
Morality and Political Correctness...  I think it's got 2 sides, ...<br>
<br>
1.  your money is as equal spent as anyone else's.  If you have a high level toon farming spiderling silks to make lameass leather paddings to make lameass Fine Steel to make whats actually kinda a nice earring, then tough shit... I'm gonna kill spiderlings... and I'm gonna kill every goddamn spiderling I can sick my Necro on.<br>
<br>
2.  I wont KS someone else because I am higher level then they are, I spend more time playing every day, or because I think my guild has more stature on the server then theirs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Blacklist people for equal access to mobs/spawns .... ROFLMAO uhhhh NO!   but KS them because I have more time/resouces/accounts/higher toons...   no, I wont do that either.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can have both.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Thus far all your posts have shown you to be unwilling to share much of anything, wether it be exp, faction, or otherwise.  This is unfortunate, becaue the one thing that Everquest does call for is a willingness to share.  You might be forced into this sharing, but you quickly learn to cope, or move on.<br>
<br>
You have stated that your only concern is high level folks (i.e. ones not likely to be gaining exp) in a low level zone.  I will reiterate the point several others have made, and which you hastely brush aside as not pertaining to you;  IT WON'T CHANGE!  Learn to deal with it now, because as you progress in level it will only happen more.<br>
<br>
Case in point:  Chardok/Sebilis AE groups call a large majority of the limited camps in these zones, and quite capable handle them.  The presence of an AE group means less chances at exp/loot for the rest of us.  Do you see us rant on about it?  Do we make blacklists of &quot;People Who AE&quot;?  No.  We might get annoyed, hell we probably bitch in guild or to our group, but we get over it, and move on.<br>
<br>
My suggestion to you is to learn to work with those around you, regardless of level, or prepare yourself for an unhappy experience in EQ.<br>
