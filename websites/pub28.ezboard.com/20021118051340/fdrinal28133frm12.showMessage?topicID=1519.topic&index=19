<br>
How do we solve this problem? I'd like to think that if people thought it through, they wouldn't come to the conclusion that killing future human beings (regardless of whether or not they are currently viable organisms) is the best solution. Do we make the government give vasectomies to all 11 year old boys, also paying for their reversion procedures? Of course not. People know what the consequences of having sex are. If they don't want to have a baby, they should use contraception. If they REALLY don't want to have a baby, they shouldn't have intercourse. It's not like there isn't an easy solution to the problem of unwanted children: don't conceive them.<br>
<br>
The question of bringing a person into a bad environment is really moot in my mind. If you, in your current situation, had to decide if you'd rather live a crappy life or die immediately, I'd imagine most people would choose to live and either make the best or attempt to improve their circumstance. Working to improve the lives of those people who live in poor conditions is another matter altogether, and one that unborn children shouldn't have to base their existence on.<br>
<br>
Also, although it's a very gray area, I really dislike arguments about whether or not the fetus is a human being when determining its rights. It will become a human being. We have environmental laws to protect our progeny's world, not our own. Making the argument that they aren't capable of living on their own is weak as well, since humans are incapable of truly caring for themselves for many years after they are born; does that make it ok to euthanize them should finances become too tight for the family? That is obviously an extreme, but as I said it's a gray area when attempting to make definitions.<br>
<br>
My point is this: none of the arguments for allowing abortions (aside from rape) takes into consideration the cause for &quot;need&quot; to have them, which is irresponsibility. If you think that is too politically incorrect, we'll have to disagree and move on.<br>
<br>
I'd like to re-iterate that I in no way condemn any person who has had an abortion. I'd like to ask people think about the consequences of their actions and take responsibility for those consequences when they arrive. The past is past; let's make the future better for everyone. <p><hr><font size=1>

<br>
I remember in debate....<br>
<br>
The only ones against abortion were guys...and on the subject of chemical castration for repeated sex offenders, all the women were against it.<br>
<br>
<br>
To me, women are the ones who have to deal with the mental anguish of the entire ordeal. They should be the ones to decide weather or not they want to keep the child. PERIOD....EXKLAMAYSHUN POINT<br>
<br>
<br>
Guys cant be raped...unless it's by other guys, and lets dwell on this for a moment.<br>
<br>
Say your walkin to your car guys....and some big dude forces you to the ground...hits you a few times...fractures a few ribs, finds some way to hog tie you....then takes off your pants, and sticks his dick in your ass.<br>
<br>
most of you wouldn't like it...briyan...I'm gonna guess that you wouldn't like it either.....<br>
<br>
Then a few weeks later, you realize that the big dude that anally raped you...has a little piece of him growing inside you...that you now have to take care of and love for the next 18 years.<br>
<br>
kids are hard enough to take care of as it is....let alone that everytime you look at the kids face, he reminds you of the guy that raped you.<br>
<br>
..............<br>
<br>
<br>
I can see the other side of this arguement, but I think as people, and human beings, we should help the person make the right choice based on how they feel individually...not just say &quot;abortion is wrong you are a sinner, and your going to hell if you abort&quot;. Cause that's not what the person needs.<br>

Uhh, no, most people don't that have abortions.  Most people that have abortions, are young people that don't understand the consequences and reprecusions of having sex.  I know that was one of the last things on my mind and still pretty much is.   Most guys that tell you different are liars.<br>

That being said, I think it's a woman's right to have the choice.  I know that if anything ever happened to me and I got pregnant, I'd like to know that the option was there (especially in the case of rape).  I'm not saying that I'd actually go through with it, though.  However, I'd have to say that I'm totally against abortion after the first trimester.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I just love the ppl who go to Planned Parenthood and protest outside...Planned Parenthood doesn't perform abortions (at least not where I live), which makes me wonder wtf these ppl are protesting about-safe sex? contraception? what?

I have personally never had an abortion and that is because I was lucky enough to be raised by parents who educated their children on birth control - sure they would have preferred abstinence until a certain age, but they planned for the unexpected and gave us the tools we needed to act sensibly.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utorunkes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torunkes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/19/02 10:11:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1519.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> when guys get a lil jerk before work, is that mass murder?<br>

That alone proves that any woman (child) who has gotten pregnant outside an monogonus realsonship cannot understand/comprehend the consequences of having unprotected sex.

They do. If a brain is dead beyond all measurable activity, and the body is surviving upon intensive care, they WILL turn the machines off.

I'm sorry that we don't live long enough to watch some species with slow breed times to change, but that's why we have writing, and future scientists will expand on our work.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, there is more to evolution than Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot;; people actually did research after it!!!; built upon it, changed it, removed inconsistencies that didn't fit with the evidence.  But the key word here is is &quot;evidence&quot;.  Christians argue from Belief, Scientists should argue from Evidence.  <br>
<br>
Arguing a point from the authority of the Bible is an infantile intellectual shortcut and is really only authoritative to people who actually hold the Christian Bible as an authority.  That much should be obvious.  So in your Bible study groups, arguing a point based on the authority of the Bible makes sense. <br>
<br>
And Hax: schools teach Einstein's THEORY of Relativity as fact as well.  As well as Quantum Theory, and countless other theories.  It certainly doesn't mean that that theory is 100% correct; it also doesn't mean it's incorrect.  But that's why we have science: to explore the mysteries of the universe and develop workable theories that explain what we see based on evidence.  Theories stick around because they fit the evidence very well, explain other behaviors very well.  I don't see Christians lining up outside of lawmakers office's protesting Relativity.  Why?  Because they don't have any &quot;evidence&quot; in their fucking Bible that says it's wrong. <p><CENTER>

I wont stop someone from talking about it, and despite my &quot;mental block&quot;, i still know pretty much what evolution is about and hey that's cool to each their own.<br>

You might wonder how i can claim to be christian yet still support abortion - I've always been taught that it's not my place to judge anyone. I know alot of christians are bad about the holier than thou attitude and telling people what they should and shouldnt do. Well i dont want anyone to force their spiritual or in some cases scientific beleifs down my throat so i try and show the same respect.<br>
<br>
So in response to kbern's question, even though there's &quot;evidence&quot; of evolution, i've never chosen to acknowledge it.

And no, i never use the bible as basis for debating, not that i dont think what happened in it is true, but because i dont want to ever misinteretate it (boy i butchered that word), and as someone said above, there's like hardly any factual evidence that any of it is true, it's all about faith etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arrora>Arrora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 825<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/02 7:49:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1519.topic&index=196>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Thank You Faman! Amen to that /sarcasm.<br>
<br>
- I belong in a mental institution, but you lack the common sense to realize that the Bible( OMG!) might not be 100% factual and holds no grounds towards explaining our ways of the world? Right you're a smart one. Like Faman said it's really a simple concept to grasp. Scientific theories have facts and have been proven. There is NO facts with the Bible because everything is said to be coming from the words of something no one has ever seen or spoken with( God).<br>
<br>
God also says Adam and Eve were created in his form. Well it's already been proven that we evolved from Chimpanzees, so explain that one. If you pick up any anthropology book the Evidence is there( please expand your horizons and you might learn something other than what mommy and daddy told you). Then where exactly in the bible does God explain the dinosaurs ect.? There's a ton of shit in the Bible that doesn't fit. It's nothing more than a way for some humans to explain the world instead of just accepting the fact that they don't know. It's easier for them to read a book and say this is the reason for the world instead of going out there, finding evidence, and proving it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shinro>Shinro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 304<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/02 7:55:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1519.topic&index=197>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.headcharge.com/new/sm_cover.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> I can use theoretical science to prove that a camel can pass through the head of a needle; doesn't mean it's factual. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=assassincobain>Assassin Cobain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/02 8:16:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1519.topic&index=198>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webdeveloper.com/animations/bnifiles/ball.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well it's already been proven that we evolved from Chimpanzees<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Yeah, I think this really shows an example of the comic book education that Arorra has.<br>
<br>
As Assassin has pointed out, it HAS NOT been provenn that man evolved from chimpanzees.<br>
<br>
The species Homo Sapien has many many DNA in common with Chimpanzees, and because we share similar physical characteristics, Darwin first said that hypothetically we could have evolved from apes.  This threw the church into a tailspin.<br>
<br>
They have found evidence of skeletal remains that show even more characteristics that are common between the hominids of this planet, but there is no direct evidence that shows conclusively that man evolved from monkeys.  Ever here of the &quot;Missing Link&quot;, this is the link that is missing that would connect and prove that man evolved from apes.<br>
<br>
You need to put down the &quot;Curious George and the man in the tall hat visit the evil abortion clinic where we can learn all about evolution&quot; comic book Arrora.<br>

Why are you comparing evolution to creationism in the first place? I was just saying that I don't believe in &quot;The Big Bang&quot; theory and the like. I would also like to see what your idea of evolution is Arrora? I believe in micro-evolution (i.e. a hummingbird with a longer beak being able to draw nectar from plants with longer flowers (pistils, whatever the frigan scientific term is) while the rest of the hummingbirds compete, starve, and die out because they can't reach the nectar, allowing these &quot;specialized&quot; hummingbirds to mate and their offspring to show these traits and live to reproduction age.) However I believe your idea of evolution is saying that one day a heard of buffalo ran out of food in their current setting and was blocked on all sides by vast bodies of water and mountains so they decided to squeeze out a pair of wings and fly to a more suitable climate. You're an idiot arrora.<br>
<br>
And faman why do you assume all christians are fanatic extremists? Do I persecute you for your belief that there is no God? Or whatever it is that you believe? First of all I never said anything about evolution not being a plausible scientific fact. And as far as christians believing the world is only 6000 years old you couldn't be farther off the mark. Days, months and years may have been much longer by the time standards of the old and new testament. You act as if we disregard the fact that the pre-cambreous and mezazoic and all those other era's ever existed. God didn't create humans til the 6th day, but those &quot;days&quot; might have been thousands of years in between.
