<br>
With ALL of Arrora's defences of the &quot;Evolution&quot; theory, and even with her attack on the &quot;Creationist&quot; theory, she is right and we are all wrong.<br>
<br>
It's all so much like when people thought the world was flat, or people thought the earth was the center of the universe.<br>
<br>
Pick up any book from those days, go to any school.  THey'll teach you right.  Earth is flat, right?<br>
<br>
You can call me names all you want Arrora, I read your links.  I even did the cross reference links for articles that were mentioned.  You know what each and every paper had in common?<br>
<br>
THE STATEMENT THAT EVOLUTION IS JUST A THEORY.<br>
<br>
THE STATEMENT THAT CREATIONISM IS JUST A THEORY.<br>
<br>
That's it.  Just a guess.  Just someone's opinon on how the old bones they found got there, and how they can be connected to life today.<br>
<br>
I went to a Christian college, and was force fed Anothropology thru the eyes of faith, and Accounting thru the eyes of faith,  Macro Economics thru the eyes of faith (a recession is part of God's plan for overall fiscal health and stability) and learned only one thing.  No one has a fucking clue, just because you read &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; doesn't mean there is some sort of parallel universe with evil witches handing out Turkish Delight hun.  Although I bet you could suck back a few boxes of that now couldn't yah?<br>
<br>
Just because you go to school Arrora, doesn't mean you're smart.<br>
<br>
Go back to reading Glamor, it'll help you more than that Anthropology book you have been reading.<br>

Evolution is not a fact its a &quot;theory&quot;. One of my best friends wife is an anthropologist who has her masters and is working on her PHD. She is smart enough to not assert that evolution is a fact. Yes there is tons of evidence that supports the theory but there are numerous holes in it as well. <br>
<br>
The funny thing is I think the theory makes a lot of sense(as most of the people here arguing with you do) and very well could be a fact. But until the day the newspapers run the headline &quot;EVOLUTION PROVED AS FACT&quot; it isnt.  <br>
<br>
The difference between science and religion is science continually looks for proof of why things are and what things are using something called the &quot;scientific method&quot;. Science never stops even when a theory is generally accepted as a fact. There is always some new scientist trying to disprove that theory and create some new reality or open our eyes to a reality that was always there that we never understood (IE the world being round instead of flat, or the earth revolving around the sun instead of the other way around, or the earth being the center of the universe, theory of relativity, etc) . Another friend of mine who is the dean of philosiphy at a local college could talk to you for hours discussing that last statement. Right now while there are many scientists hard at work trying to prove the theory of evolution others are hard at work trying to disprove it. Both sides have strong evidence even convincing evidence for those that are easily convinced of things. <br>
<br>
Religion on the other hand has one document or book. everything printed in that book is considered the gospel be all and end all of truth and reality. It sure is a lot less work than science. Now that sounds like an illogical way to base your all your beliefs but it works for millions of people on this earth. Who are you to say they are wrong or less educated than you? Maybe they have more important things to worry about. By the way scientists have found tons of evidence that supports many of the assertions in the bible (IE jesus lived, the red sea did part, and the jews were enslaved by the  egyptians). There is even evidence out there for the garden of eden, david and goliath, and the great flood and noahs arc. <br>
<br>
So no matter what you have learned you still havent learned the most important lesson of all. The more you learn the more you realize you know very little at all. <br>

If you don't want to believe that, then you can run around denying it, but it doesn't change the fact that it's true. Read up on it and you might learn something.<br>
<br>
- secondly, yes reading and going to college expands your mind whether you 16 year olds want to believe that or not. If you want to run around thinking you can be smart and not go to school or read I wouldn't count on it. Try learning math, simple science, almost everything that goes on in the world without reading a book or taking the ambition to learn about it. You'll be stuck with what mommy and daddy tell you for the rest of your life which is pretty damn sad.<br>
<br>
- Third, Barg. I don't deny that the stories in the bible could have truth.Out of all those stories though it still remains that there is NO proof of this so called "God" that the book is supposedly written for and about. For example look at Animistic cultures. There is proof remaining that their is some actual truth to the occurrence recorded by them, but it doesn't mean that's proof about their many Gods. Same for Buddhism. It has been shown that the founder of Buddhism Sidhartha Gautama actually existed, but that doesn't mean that the religion itself is factual. Logical reasoning can tell you that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sorbital>Sorbital</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/4/02 11:01:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=267>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/Weekly%20Grind/stealie_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religion and Science</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I specific said I was talking about the facts that surround the theory of Human origin( Not evolution).

<br>
Ok, let's take a look at this.  First,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I specific said I was talking about the facts that surround the theory of Human origin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So it's the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THEORY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of Human Origin, right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Humans evolving from Primates is about Human Origins, not how the world first began. The fossil remains are facts and have proved that we evolved from primates.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, in your next sentance you say that the fossile record <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PROVES</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that we evolved from primates.<br>
<br>
So, how can the THEORY of Human origin be a PROVEN fact?  It wouldn't be a theory anymore, would it?<br>
<br>
It doesn't even matter to me.  I don't even care if I came from a monkey, or I can from a test tube on some alien spaceship, or if some sort of Triumverate poofed me into existence.<br>
<br>
I have 80 years on this planet, if I am lucky.  The last thing I want to hear is people like you who &quot;know it all&quot; running around sqwaking like a chicken.  BOCK BOCK BOCK <br>
<br>
You weren't there.  You didn't see it happen.  You don't know.  End of discussion.<br>
<br>

He'll be like &quot;Umm, yeah, so I was wrong, and I got this shit job now.  Can you believe that shit?&quot;<br>
And you'll say &quot;Shut the fuck up and open the goddamn door.&quot;<br>
And he'll open the door, and Arorra will be there, inside, screaming &quot;No!  I was right!  I can't be wrong!&quot;<br>

And then this huge voice will come down along with a lightening bolt and say &quot;SHUT IT BITCH!&quot;<br>

And that will be the end of the stupid girl.  And then we'll all get twinkies and dance in the fields with Jesus.  And his new outfit, which he LOVES soooooo much.<br>

<br>
This is one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard, if your teacher is teaching this as fact he needs to fired, and you need your money back. (you even pay for this shit?!? If so, your dumber than first thought!) <br>
<br>
That is no more fact than the theory YES I SAID THEORY than that of dinosaurs evolving from birds. It boggles my mind that you feel these theories YES I SAID THEORIES, are fact just because of a few, YES FEW in fact, EXTREMELY few fossil(s). There are dinosaur bones all over the place, and yet we've found less than 10 remains/bones TOTAL in the history of archeology that could potentially show a link between humans and lesser primates? How is that possible considering the huge amount of time it would take to completely evolve into our current form- Should there not be TONS of evidence over the course of the last 100,000 years showing our progression?<br>
<br>
I've already stated that if we in fact evolved from lesser primates, why is there NOT ONE species between us and chimps alive today when they would be far superior to any other primate living today besides ourselves-- How can a monkey survive for so long, and a yet a being with superior brain, hunting skills, and tool/shelter making ability cannot?<br>
There is a HUGE gap between us and chimps. You can talk DNA % all day long, but look around, that 8-10% difference is unfathomable . Beyond that, who's to say that a monkey much smarter than a chimp, but much less developed than a human, is still just another species of monkey? That proves nothing. <br>
<br>
If you and your whacko teacher are 100% certain of human origin, why am I not reading about YOU in my anthropology class about the greatest discovery in human history? Unless you posses a time machine, there is no possible way for you to be preaching this shit as fact. <br>
<br>
The more you talk, the more I am convinced you evolved from a lesser primate, in fact, maybe your still evolving. <br>
<br>
<br>

OK, Sorb, you gotta explain to me what the hell God has to do with accounting? I've taken many many units of accounting and not once did the concept of the LGA enter into it. Sure, I can see Satan's involvement, especially in fund accounting -- but Yahweh having a take on someone's statement of cash flows is just a tad beyond me.<br>

You saw the republican viewpoint here PICTURE IT!<br>
<br>
~1. Walking around with tape on our legs? Who's reality is that? Can you imagine what that would really be like to be that opressed?<br>
<br>
~2. Having no choices for family planning - family planning is almost always removed from countries with dictatorial leaders. They do not want women using birth control, it would empower women too much.<br>
<br>
~3. Having unwanted babies.<br>
<br>
~4. Most importantly, having all welfare programs privatized so that elitists can &quot;opt out&quot; with whatever excuse they come up with about how the organization is run - particularly important to note that they don't want &quot;child welfare&quot; shared by the nation - and that &quot;child welfare&quot; is what will keep those &quot;unwanted babies&quot; fed, clothed and educted.<br>
