heh does that cover 3 of the most common CSR related petitions that Verant was so UNwilling to waiver on until now?  And those 3 cover all levels...<br>
<br>
<br>
There are reasons why a lot of things never changed in EQ and the dawn of AO an DAoC are not some of them.  EQ subscriptions meant next to nothing in VI's consideration of this ... except in relation to what they projected FUTURE subscriptions to be.  Honestly,  DAoC didnt have enough time to make a global impact on EQ sales, did EQ have reason to worry about competition?  Sure, you bet they did, but making 4.5 million a month instead of 4.52 million a month is NOT going to get a shitload of people fired especially when so many people are subscribed on multiple month payments.  How many people didnt even have a EQ payment due until 4, 5, or 6 months after Camelot came out?  A lot... how many people do you know that left for Camelot and CAME BACK!?.  Someone at Verant finally <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LISTENED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  we'll know if that's true when they continue to do things like the caster balancing and other tuning we've seen lately.  <br>
<br>
It's feedback from people that said I dont care what you do, I sure as hell wont buy your games in the future (as all of SWG team has a collective heart attack because some cheesedick on EQ team makes a bad call) so kiss my ass!<br>
<br>
But then again... thats just my opinion, I could be wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The people that make decisions like that look at things from a 50,000 ft level.  To an executive who doesn't play games, I'm sure it is very easy to look at the monthly subscriptions rolling in, as well as the record sales on the new expansion and say, &quot;Why do I need these guys making or updating old content?  People have been paying for it for years.  I'm already #1, so why do I need to get better?  I just made a ton of money off the new expansion, so my resources are better used cranking out expansions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, decisions like this effect those that use and enjoy the game, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> but</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from a business perspective, they are dead on.  The monthly subscriptions will keep rolling in regardless of if obscure quests aren't fixed, PoM remains broken, Vulak never spawns again, or if WW dragons assist giants from the scout quest.  Decisions like this can't be won with emotion, only dollars.  It's difficult to justify upgrading something that's already #1, because you can't argue that you'll gain <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> customers by having people make GM events or update old content. <p><p><p align="center">:[<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

My guess, (if this happened at all), is that the content team had their salaries hugely inflated during the times when EQ was kicking ass and really generated ridiculous sign-ups.<br>
<br>
The trend in the internet lately is to weed out the people who were given crazy packages because they were irreplaceable at the time. There hasn't been a new sign-up press release in a long time from Sony, and probably no need to pay a content person in excess of $100k per year.<br>
<br>
Just a guess based on the movements of our own company from $4BN -&gt; $70MM -&gt; $440MM market cap over the last three years.

<br>
i was 100% sure i was going to play shadowbane a few months ago but recently my attitude towards online rpg's has changed and i dont think ill ever buy another mmorpg again, ill play single player ones that look good but not an online one because it takes to much time to do what i play games to do and i play them to have the best shit and conquer everything, rpg's have to much political correctness bullshit in them, ill prolly buy planetside or something like that where i can log in kick ass and then log off, im playing starcraft brood war atm, i can play for an hour once in awhile and get off at any time, i can talk shit and be any way i want to be, kill my allies if i want to...its a blast where-as eq can suck big time, theres the sitting aroung, killing mobs is boring after awhile and chatting with people that you will never meet *and really in most cases you dont want to meet them isnt appealing to me* *everqqest is to much like real life imo, to much socializing and sitting around* <br>
<br>
everquest is the best MMORPG out and it will prolly be the best MMORPG for awhile but in my honest opinion most people would of been better off buying a different game.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uxylordraconia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xylor Draconia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/15/02 12:14:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2760.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/xylor/swirl.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Well no one is more anti vi then me. but you have to admit that some of the things that have been going in lately are slightly balancing the classes. for example if you read up on the fungi tunic supposed nerf then you read the post from absor on the eq boards (too lazy to look for the link, lookit yourself slacker!) he actually stated that lvl limits on items actually gives vi more flexiabilty with controlling a item more so then a flat out no drop trag is(which is better then before items where no drop or tradeable thastit). also casters have gotten thier mini focus items, which will slighty move them closer to being balanced. <br>
<br>
A theme along these lines came up last night in /gu and I will restate here what my hopes are for the PoP expansion. If VI makes it so that PoP provides multiple high end raiding capable guilds enough content to plow through that will last a entire week (patch/repops) without having to battle other guilds for the spawns. For example CT decides to kill sol ro, wait cant cats is doing him, ok then lets do bertxioulous (sp?) kindred is doing him, ok then lets kill mith marr then valla he is up cuz the other guidls are doing other stuff. Also a few more class AA thingies for wars wouldnt hurt either.  <p>********************************************<br> <b> <I> "They can try to bind our arms, but they can't chain our minds or hearts."</i><br>- Stratovarius<BR>
