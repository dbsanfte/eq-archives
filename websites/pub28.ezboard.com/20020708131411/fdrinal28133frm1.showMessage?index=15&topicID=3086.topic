Naa wont start that.<br>
<br>
I think his post was, vice is looking for mages.<br>
<br>
And it isnt  a mistreatment of a class, its what happens on raids. certain classes have certain roles, and certain players have certain roles.<br>

On an off note if anyone needs a necro, I got one that prolly is older than you all:P But hes only 29...<br>

That's a for certain.  I do have intentions of joining some guild in the future.<br>
<br>
Why I poke my nose into this is because it has been inflicted on some of my guildless, and guilded friends.  I am not afraid to open my month and state my opinion obviously.  So I shed some light on this from how I though of it.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against a no loot policy that guilds have in place for recuiting members.  But, when a guild *Needs* a certain class to be able to accomplish some goals and come looking for you, but want to treat you as the lessor person on such raid, again, all I can say is haha!<br>
<br>
Also, how I ended up on Drinal is due to the fact I played a level 60 necro on a pvp server and did not enjoy it.  So I went looking for a cross server trade for Warrior gear, and I found someone on Drinal willing to trade.  Before that I had several other level 60 chars and ditched em all cause I wanted to, and tryed to quit eq.  Lasted for 5 months before I was back at it again.  If you have ever seen me in game, you can take one look at my gear and realize I have never been to legends  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Let me say it once more just in case it was missed...<br>
<br>
player 1 tells some guild &quot;hi can I come raid with you guys?&quot;<br>
<br>
Some guild says &quot;Sure, but we have a guild members only loot policy&quot;<br>
<br>
Player 1 says to some guild &quot;Np, i am cool with that&quot;<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Some guild says to Players 1&quot;Hi, could really use your help raiding X, if you would like to come just be sure to undertand you have no chance at loot and will be treated like dirt&quot;<br>
<br>
Player1 tells some guild &quot;haha, no thanks&quot;<br>
<br>
Can you see the difference?<br>

Now if we invite ppl on raids, ussually we want them to join.  If you put ur time in, join the guild, you will get loot.  If you come on one raid expect to win loot over someone who has been in the guild for 6 months, you are on crack.  If you want me to buy you a couple stacks of pearls, thats fine.  But expecting loot when a guild has a fair loot system is ridiculous.  <br>
<br>
We don't treat our guild members/recruits/temps like dirt.  We need mages yes, we in fact want mages to join the guild, not temp for raids.  So we aren't looking to take any mages and abuse them and not give them loot.  Klaria our last mage was treated VERY well, and in fact is probally one of the best equiped mages on the server.<br>
<br>
As for mages sucking,  mages are a lost class imo, ive raided as a mage for longer than most of you have played eq.  We are most effiencet Rodding and cohing and dsing.  That is our role in a raid.  <br>
<br>
edit:  As for 'temps' on our raids who come to help and get no loot.  Some people want to see the big mobs in eq, and see stuff die.  Not everyones biggest ambition is soloing a spider in velk or killing frogs in velk.  Temps like to come to raids because they get to see things they have never seen. <p><center><img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/klaria/fullsize/silenius.gif" height="75" width="450" alt="Created by Klaria Keebler"></center><center>

Hahha i think not. We'll take our chances without you before you expect to win an uber item over core members of that guild. Wasnt for their knowledge of that certain zone and all the deaths/wipeouts you wouldnt even have a chance to see the zone.<br>
<br>
Its called working for your lewtz and starting at the bottom of the food chain. You have to start somewhere and cant expect to be in on s-hit when your just getting your feet wet. Those things take time. I am sure there are a few other people that have proven themselves to the guild and/or the points system etc... that deserves that more than you. There the ones dying week in and week out trying to better the guild with no expectations of loot.<br>
<br>
Have someone come to your raid and win your loot you always wanted and tell me how you feel about it. Come to end game side of it all, eventually you will understand.<br>

as you stated you are not in a guild. So let me tell you something. Guilds and their members dislike to invite total strangers permanently. Of our about 90 members we have three mages, two of them were just recently added. So a long while we ran around with one mage and could really need some more. If the applicant has a true desire to join that guild then it should be no problem for him to go through the recruitment process, which usually includes a no loot rule.<br>
An applicant to our guild starts with negative 80 points. He has to guildremove himself after the raids. Once he reaches negative 40 points he does not have to guildremove himself anymore. When he reaches 0 points, there is a voting on our &quot;possible recruits&quot; board and the whole member base of the guild decides if the person will be added or not. An applicant needs 91% yes votes. If there are certain concerns about that applicant he might go to an extended trial. If he fails the first vote for other reasons he does not get in. If someone fails the 91% extended trial vote, he does not get in. If loot is rotting then applicants are allowed to bid for it, but as long as full members are interested in that piece of loot the applicant won't have a chance to bid for it.<br>
I don't think that this is too much to ask for. Afterall the guild he applied to will provide him with loot once he makes it to full member status.<br>
About mages in high level guilds:<br>
Their job are modrods, modrods, modrods and maybe some summoned focus items. Sucks to be a mage these days as their role changed completely from the being one of the top damage dealing classes to a pure support class. I can understand people who quit their mage. What do you think how rogues would react if their job changed to permanently bindwounding the maintank? <p><center>

<br>
&quot;You [Dashaa] are correct insofar as it is not your place to say anything, as the subject is &quot;Vice is in need of Mages&quot; not &quot;Let's talk about Uber guilds of Drinal&quot; nor &quot;Let's talk about abused classes&quot;. Furthermore, it also isn't your place to imply that the epic or loot policies of some guilds aren't adequate to your taste or standards.<br>
<br>
Yet since the discussion has been lit, might as well continue till the original poster responds.&quot;<br>
<br>
kakaka puhaha hehe~<br>
<br>
Well the original poster responded and it was not his intention for this to drag out like this (duh~) kaka so I'll stop.  Though I'd like to argue further against Nidisa and Dashaa's points like some others have, I don't want to continue this any further unless it's brought to a new thread, for abovesaid reasons.  A pity, since I've already taken the time to read through the posts that I consider much of a waste of my time to read.  And frankly, hiding behind a facade of the knight in shining armor to cover up something is sickening (no, no implications to anyone, not at all!).<br>
