I feel like such a newbie now<br>
<br>
I made Gwenhyfar back in August of `99 over on Tunare.. she was such a cute lil newbie.. not knowing a thing.. just being happy killing polar bears.. (they were cutepolar bears too.. *cwy*) Before Kunark came out, I renamed Gwenhyfar to Elaysia because her name was in violation of some J.R. Tolkien book I had never read and got tired of people asking me if I was some panther.. soooooo then Kunark came out and I was in my high 40s. Then some drama popped around the corner and I took the first /movelog flight to Drinal.. I HATED IT at first.. until Odean made me his friend and he got me into liking the server.. then I joined Crimson Twilight and all was good.. Soooooo... then I had my name changed to Elaylie.. and now I'm a Shamanese Pwincess who twies to be fwiends wif everyone =) <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I feel like a newbie because I've been playing since August of 99 and I'm a level 55.. Gwenhyfar/Elaysia/Elaylie was my FIRST character EVER.. I have NO twinks! I see all these people with like 5 level 50+'s and they are complaining over not having epics, when I am just happy to have my epic and to be level 55.. some people need to lighten up and not be so greedy.. =)<br>
<br>
But I still wub you guys<br>
<br>
Elaylie!

Thus why your not one now. Ask around, Qalar makes CiH seem retarded being an officer. Let's recall the hold raid, I gated out of. Guy's I only have an hour or so until company comes over. Come on, we need you, were greedy bastards and want our epic pieces from the hole. Alright I'll come but only until another cleric logs in. Pull mobs, kill mobs over and over. Noriko logs on hi guild. Galana logs on hi guild. Clyssie logs on, hi guild. Carlon's still in the hole. Carlon &quot;come on it's been over an hour now, people coming.&quot; Hold on just this pull, pull a train... me &quot;fuck it&quot;. *gate* last thing I need is a corpse in the hole when I never wanted to be there in the first place. Fact is I was needed there as cleric_005 to heal. This game is the most pointless thing ever. All it is lists of values assigned to &quot;mobs&quot; which determines the values of a randomizer which is used for each spell, and melee attack. I can't believe people can take a game so seriousily. I supposed you only realize this after you take enough programming classes how simple the game is. Like I said I'm done, link deleted, just wanted to see what dumbass would respond, Qalar, Jorply, Slinker ect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 544<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/01 9:39:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Don't even bother Carlon - for them skill = having no real life.

second, barnak is the only one with the.. pog armor? or whatever? .. dude so what, and the officers have more stuff then other people, yeah well.. those officers kept cih together threw alot of shit and worked hard to get it to where it is today - if their reward is getting nice new shiny things then so be it, they only get 1 then the next person does, im pretty sure barnak was the first cleric in cih to get his epic which fucking *owned* every raid's cr - he deserves whatever he gets, and teroks just greedy so dont mind him *cough*<br>

you other people have some nerve saying anything about cih, first you all said it would never last, then you said it was all about hogging mobs, then it was all about something else, then another thing, blah blah blah blah BLAH, try playing on mithaniel marr for a year and see how utterly ruthless it was to excel your character post 50 with fucking people who wont say boo to you hogging spawns.. and camping raptors for 20+ hours to have aftathott and hobben come and start killing raptors with 0 downtime while you search for 1 or tow to kill =(.. /sigh .. wheres *my* epic ya stupid cunt<br>
