First you say you cybered my sister, then all of a sudden you decide that you were really talking about me?  My God man, make up your mind, oh wait, would that possibly be a feminine characteristic I perceive?  You call me 'gayish'?  Hrm, lets find the faults in that statement:<br>
<br>
1.  That isn't even a word, so learn english moron.<br>
2.  Wouldn't one's preference have something to do with their personality?<br>
3.  How does any physical attribue (save something surgeries changed....) determine if someone is (to use your made up word) 'gayish'?<br>
<br>
Please enlighten us with your omnisiscient wisdom.  I'm sure many of us would like to know.<br>
<br>
I have another question for your unwavering intelligence.  Do you realize how many people would (or read as should) break you in half for all those highly opinionated (also probably made up) statistics you related to us?  I hope, for your safety, that you don't say crap like that in real life.  Comments like those get you put in the hospital in cities, and get shotguns put in your face in the country.  Hrm, actually, please go make some comment like that about x ethnic group, or about x culture, in the midst of them.  Come back with to us with a report of what they did.  It is NOT cool to make blatently false, ignorante, stupid, what ever you want to call them, remarks about people.  You don't know them, you just assume those things.  (Remember what happens when you assume stuff?)<br>
<br>
Now, about why I play a female character.  The edit there wasn't directed to you Dhkar, so shut your trap.  Mr. walyenjennings if you want proof of that, I'll have the person who dared me send you a tell next time their online, just say so if you want that arranged, I would be more than happy to oblige you. <p>Aweilii Nicewolf the

<br>
As to Dhkar or as I generally refer to him Dcknthrd,you know what I mean Dcknthrd cant get the flag to raise eh?A little problem Hoisting the sails so to speak etc etc, when RbP started it wasnt long when some of the Best people who were 40+ at the time Left due to one of his usual childish temper tantrums.At the time I had thought they were mistaken and then the months wore on and Nope even more were leaving.Good people who help others and are quite frankly some of the best gamers in Eq.And then He started on the one who helped him create RbP,Jreis.That was enough,I got my friends and we left RbP that night having had enough of his alcoholic little tantrums.So a great mass of us left Rbp and its little Dish washing ,soap opera,cant get it up,alcoholic,general dipshit of the world GL and talked about starting a Guild of friends .For the next Month or so Dcknthrd tried his damndest to get alts on so he could,get this,Rant a challenge to Moon and Tan declaring he was wronged and I suppose due to his alcohol and debunct sexual gear.Twas funny when Erauder blasted him in arena finally having enough.<br>
<br>
Time passes on and what happens?Dcknthrd asks us for a possible Merger.Being as open minded as we are we discussed it an a meeting and voted upon it and then laid rules down for him.I personally voted nay.No way i would associate myself with the childish little twerp.He rejected it with no reason of grounding which I am sure he will defend later.<br>
<br>
I do agree with people above stating a Guild is normally represented first and foremost by its Leaders.Dcknthrd is RbP leader and that really says some thigs aboutit.If he has indeed passed it to Yumdar,then RbP does have a shot as Yumdar is one of the best people playing.I do however remeber him passing it quite a few times only to flame the new leader when he didnt like way things were going and demand it back.<br>
<br>
As to Moonbaem?A leader she was and quite good at it,willing to sacrifice hard won exp to assist us in Raids on which at 55 she couldnt go.Sounds crazy Dcknthrd? Thats because a selfish person as yourself cannot comprehend such actions.I dont feel sad for you of hate you.I pity you cause that is all youre worth to me.<br>
<br>
Also get the facts about  some people you have mentioned straight as you are starting youre own little rumor mill assuming things about us IRL.<br>
<br>
Well I am done here.Flame on little man.That in itself has duo meaning HAHA <p>Illmaetrae Kalanbryn

<br>
Ask Loopa, a fine DE cleric I met 1.5 months before joining RbP.  I remember the moment vividly.  She was sitting in the tunnel to our home Neriak, in Nektulos forrest.  Pondering only what, I could imagine.  I do a /w Loopa she was 2nd or 3rd level at the time, I dont really remember now.  We talked and after our 20 mins of discussion, I decided to give her all of my gear that was not nodrop and all the plat I had in my bank.<br>
She seemed like a great person and I hoped she enjoyed EQ as much as I did.  She still plays as far as I know.  Ask her or her guild GoTK.<br>
<br>
Yes, at that time, I had decided I didnt want to spend the time it was going to take to go where I wanted to with EQ.  Of course now I am playing again and I admit I was torn between wanting to play the high level game and other stuff.  Now after finally settling down on just enjoying the company of my friends and guildmates.  That does please me so.<br>
<br>
I am alot happier with EQ now, I just enjoy it when I am on and not really worry about whether I will get to where I want to.  I was kinda pathetic when I look back at my attitude before I gave all my stuff away.  <br>
<br>
I changed, change is neccessary in order to grow.  I grew alot after encountering you too Dhkar.  I saw my old self taken to the extreme.  I was never like you but you opened my eyes, even wider, to what this game should be about.  Not to mention I met alot of great people in RbP who are still in NC.  <br>
<br>
Yes some have left but that was my fault.  I blame myself.  I wanted to do a lot back then when I should have been concentrating on just doing things with the guildmembers.  That is my burden and if I hurt anyone because of that, I apologize.<br>
<br>
You say I led RbP.  How can one lead a guild and give it direction in 1 day?  As I remember it, you gave me the guild on a Sunday.  Monday we had a meeting and Tuesday you were pissed at me or whatever so I gave it back to.  Mabie it was a Wednesday.  It doesnt really matter now.<br>
<br>
Tell me Dhkar how does one fuck up a guild in one day?  I didnt do anything because that was not enough time.  <br>
<br>
When NC was formed I bascially said the same things I did at the RbP that I did at the NC indoc. meeting.  Now of course that direction was incorrect, I admit that.  Not neccessarily wrong just incorrect strategy.  My goal has always been the same.  To play the high end game of EQ. <br>
<br>
But I wanted to do it with people who also had little to no experience with that part of the game.  I wanted a guild to grow together to the high end content.  Is that so wrong?<br>
<br>
Noir Circle has the firepower now to do just that, we just need something to bring us all together.  Illmaetrae, imo, is that thing.  I figured it would take MORE than just someone who is online more than I, to do that.  It would take someone who I knew wanted the same things I did.  His vision of how to do it may be different than mine, but I dont fault him for that.  No, I applaud him and now follow his leadership, because that is the choice I made.<br>
<br>
You made a choice before Dhkar and you made the right one in choosing me just as I told you right before I gave you back the guild.  I would have just about bled my guts out for RbP.  I was prepared to do that.  <br>
<br>
I spent my own money, gathered my friends to my side and asked they help me with a website of a thing that probably didnt mean that much to them, but they saw it meant something to me and because I asked them, they helped me.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry you couldnt see the shit I did ON SUNDAY, the day you turned over leadership of the guild to me.  I, and others put a lot effort into RbP, you just couldnt see it.<br>
<br>
Now its all about just doing things with others in EQ.  I just want to hang out with a bunch of like minded people and shoot the shit and kill some baddies,  all the while having a coke at my side some form of deep fried thinly sliced potato substance and you know what, I am good with that.<br>
<br>
You know Dhkar, I never hated you.  I still do not hate you.  I dont trust a word out of your mouth, but I dont hate you.  I really liked your attitude, at the time, I just thought you were crazy, different than others.  I charish that.  People who are different is a good thing imo.  People who show thier own sense of individuality are the kind of people I want to get to know.  <br>
<br>
We could have been good friends Dhkar, instead you got drunk or whatever it was irl that was eating you up and fucked it all up.<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; No skin off my teeth, after all when I came back to EQ, I just told myself it was just a game.  It still is.  A game that I meet my friends at.  People whos real faces I have never seen before(mostly).  Mabie one day I will get to meet some of those people.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
When all is said and done in EQ.  Its not the person who gives things to other or powerlevels them or gives them advice on this or that.<br>
<br>
Its just the sense of friendship, acquired from the long times of being together, shooting the shit, laughing about this toon or crying over someones RL pain.  Its all that shit rolled into a blob called EQ where we will meet again and do it again for as long as it pleases us.<br>
<br>
Humans truely are social creatures, they NEED to interact with others.  My love of computer games (RPG type in particular) meshes that need with my passion.  What could be more entertaining?  Even if something better (game-wise) comes along, I wont leave EQ till the one day all my friends are gone and there is noone left to talk to.<br>
<br>
I feel, no I believe, the original RbP members pity you Dhkar.  I pity you also because you had a lot but didnt realise it.  <br>
<br>
Your RL problems, the constant warnings for harrassment of our players, your subsequent wanton reconciliation with us and our denial of your request to merge guilds<br>
<br>
If you dont see that now after all this shit has to come pass that it just isnt worth the effort then mabie you can move on.  I have moved on from this.  I only posted this to clear the air.  The air is cleared, imo.  Now everyone who reads, knows the truth.  Say what you will but in the end there is just the friends we make in EQ and what does it tell you that 99% of your guild left?  Wake up man, smell the coffee, take a sip of it and get the fuck out the door and do something because your just wasting your breath here.  I read and reply because it meant something to me once.  <br>
<br>
I keep replying because, well it passes the time and gives me a chance to refocus myself from the past that likes to creep up on me from time to time.  Happens to everyone.  Just have to remember the facts and get things straight in your head, Dhkar.<br>
<br>
If you have moved on then I applaud you.  Good for you!  But since you felt the need to post this here, mabie the past is creeping up on you.  Just take a deep breath, remember what it was like and try not to go there.<br>

We were just beating the crap outta each other for fun and doing stuff like one-on-one, teams of 6, Royal Rumble, etc.<br>
<br>
Four or five from RBP had been in the Arena the whole time minding their own business.  When the majority of us had left, these jokers decided it would be fun to gang up on three of my guildmates and camp their corpses.  They kept trying to go back and loot their bodies, but these assholes would just kill them again.  It took a /petition for them to finally stop.  Dhkar was one of the 4 or 5 who were /petitioned for camping my guildie's corpses.<br>
<br>
A month or so later I was passing through RM, and was asked for help by a low level character to help find their corpse.  I asked where they had died, and the person replied that he didn't know where his corpse had ended up because Dhkar asked for consent to drag it, but dragged it so that the person couldn't find it.  Turns out he had done this to about 4 other people in RM that same day.  Nice guy, huh?<br>

Way to set an example as a guildleader, you pos. <p><br><br>

Say someone is in a tragic accident (not trying to make light of that stuff) and afterwards they are still 'alive' but they have lost all mental capabilities.  If you say that person 'survived' then yes, RBP will 'survive' with him around. <p>Aweilii Nicewolf the
