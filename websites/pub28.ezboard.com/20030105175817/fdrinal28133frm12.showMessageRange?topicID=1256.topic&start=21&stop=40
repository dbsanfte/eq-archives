Even now my druid does quite a lot of the chanter healing.  Chloroblast and NT are usually good enough to keep the chanter up.  <br>
<br>
I'm still not against the improved heals for shammies and druids, in fact I very much want them to come about, they just need to give clerics something to offer a group.  Someone had the idea of a mob debuff that would keep a mob from chealing!  Geez, that'd be nice in CT.  Or even an improved Mark of Retribution or a Mark of Karn that actually is useful instead of the pathetic weeny ones we have.  There's lots of ways that clerics can be made more valuable in xp groups that can answer the need to increase the groups effiency that don't need to involve silly summoned hammers. <br>
<br>
Geez, paladins must be pathetic if that hammer out damages them!  Oh well, not like you group with a pally for their damage output. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/upindk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pindk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 10:51:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   &gt; Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Boa</span><hr size=1> I've had more time to play with the Happy Hammer. It's a novelty. I tried to solo a few places at zone line and its so inefficient still to solo you may as well root/nuke as it takes the same amount of time to tank a mob down as it is to root/nuke/med back to full. <br>
<br>
People have missed the boat as to why this is upsetting to cleric and if you all cant grasp it well then nothing more needs be said as you still wont grasp it. <br>
<br>
I actually think most people are smart enough to realize the short and long term ramifications of this but are more concerned about their PERSONAL gain so cleric get fucked in the ass without lube as a result. <br>
<br>
You can go on and on about how clerics have ruined the high end game. umm well no we didn't. VI did and the end result is a bunch of bored broke clerics that have no desire to continue to sit staring at a wall to get loot for everyone else and their brother and sister receiving little in return. Hell 99.9999% of the time a cleric cant get a half a blue of exp on raid another of VI major fuck ups. Not implementing a raid group exp system. <br>
<br>
At one point NC had 13 clerics 10 of which were level 60. I can think of 3 that even play the game anymore, one of which is a bot now. <br>
<br>
Cleric is an incredibly boring class at the high end. You want to see more clerics dump their cleric main and retire or go to alts as a main then go right ahead put the druid heal in the game. Dont come fucking crying to me for a rez when it all goes bad. <br>

Welcome to my Life!!!<br>
<br>
The Point is mute now, however pre patch, 30-40 DPS constant DPS was quite obtainable with Hammer/Pet.<br>
<br>
The spell was at 56, and guess what, 30-40 DPS is pretty damn average, perahaps even high for a paladin at 56, untwinked, with weapons normally aviable to him at that level (epic quality, or below) <br>
<br>
Also as most people know, SoL mobs have High AC/mitigation, guess what, It was an unresistable, proc, and Procs by weapon, can proc on a miss, so basically, it was a very straight damage line, no matter where you fought.<br>

I don't think the changes will decrease the necessity of clerics.  Granted I can't talk about the high end game but I think this applies there.  <br>
<br>
I've grouped a lot of places from KC to Seb to Kael.  I would never take a druid or shaman over a cleric.  Even with these heals.  Druids role:  Snare, Buff, backup heal, DoT/DD as mana permits (generally in that order).  Shamans role:  Slow, Haste (if no chanter), Buff, backup heal, DoT/DD IF any mana left over.  Now if I pick up a shaman (even with his uber 1900 heal) and expect him to be sole healer, I can't count on buffs, hastes or slows.  He won't have the mana to perform all these functions.  So if he can't haste, slow or buff reliably wtf do I want a shaman for?  At that point he's a weaker cleric.  Ideally I'd like both.  Same applies to a druid.  You just can't replace a cleric.  Now this applies to the lower game<br>
<br>
End game?  10 second casting time for a 2900pt heal.  Let's take Rumblecrush for instance (and he's far from end game but at least I've helped kill him).  A good tank at our guilds level will around 5k hps fully buffed.  2900 hps just over half that.  RC will eat 2900 hps too quick.  So the heal can't be reliably used in a CHeal cycle.  Spot heal?  At 10 seconds long I seriously doubt it.<br>
<br>
Now once again I can't comment on the end game so much but from a mid level perspective I don't think these heals will ahve that much effect on Clerics.<br>

And thats the complaint. It isn't going to change a god damn thing in the high end encounter. But is going to seriously damage a clerics ability to group from 54 to 60. The druid heal is a 54th level spell... Fuck if you want the end game fixed and do little to damage a clerics groupability give the dru/shaman and fucking CH at lvl 59 or 60. By 59-60 most people are AA'n in a duo spot anyways thus not affecting the game much.<br>
<br>
VI comes out with this hokie assed excuse that they wanted to fix the cleric bottlekneck for high end raiding and they know they are fucking clerics sub 59 so they throw some piece of shit hammer at us thats already been nerfed by day 2.<br>
<br>
I am telling you and cant emphasize this enough. Clerics sitting on the fence teetering wether or not to dump cleric and/or the game altogether just got a big push in the dump the game direction. The hardcore ones will go on as usual. But you know damn well after three years + now people are leaving the game in droves and this fuck up isn't going to change that for the better.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubrashnir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brashnir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 12:03:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0n86l/halo-nos_av.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ....</span><hr size=1> why would a cleric quit over a druid or shaman spell that *isn't even in the game*? <p><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0n86l/maesig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/upindk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pindk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 12:40:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ....  </span><hr size=1> Go read this and the several other threads regarding the Dmg this spell IS going to do to clerics groupability. Particularly sub 56 clerics that cant even get the hammer and solo. Which is laughable since I've had more time to play with it. <br>
<br>
Absor himself conceded that the whole reason they put the Happy Gimpassed Hammer in the game is they KNOW this is going to hurt clerics ability to find a group. This part isn't even an arguement. A few that didn't read the threads or did read the threads and just cant fathom it are the only ones disputing this. <br>
<br>
I contend that given how boring high end cleric inheritantly is coupled with difficulty grouping could spell the end of ALOT of clerics EQ lives. I can tell ya if its hard to group I'll park my cleric in a far off zone and leave him there and play a solo class indefintely. <br>
<br>
Like I said. Fix it dont try and fix it and break a bunch of other shit in the process. <br>
<br>
I am curious and please clerics only reply.. Would it upset you more to give a dru/sha a CH at 59 or 60 as opposed to a near CH at 54? 54 shoudln't be on a real high end raid anyways by 59 or 60 they can cover a exp groups heals in all but a couple of places anyways. <br>
<br>
If this is about fixing lack of healers for high end encounters then fix that and only that or give me a god damned hammer and skill increases that I can solo in Umbral just like a druid. Anything short of that you can just go fuck yourself with Zzod's donkey sized dildo. <br>

That doesn't mean that I won't get asked for FoS or STA buffs anymore, but they do not make a big difference (with all those item on melee with big stats so they are near max anyway). When you get anks with Primal weapons you don't even get asked for Avatar (our best stat buff).<br>
What we do is slow the mob to a gimp. Maybe debuff resistance and on Luclin mobs AC. The I can do the happy canni-show to get the 20% mana used back till next pull. Or I can go dotting, where Dots either don't stay till their max effiency (because mob is dead before) or I might get aggro because I dotted earlier (at this point my group might be angry with me if happened constantly).<br>
<br>
So what is the big difference between a shaman and a cleric in this case concerning boredom? Clerics buff too, the MoK/MoR, and heal. Sometimes they nuke. Thats group wise.<br>
<br>
On raids cleric buff/heal, shaman buff/slow. So why do all think clerics are so boring and shaman don't? Try to be the fourth shaman in a normal raid (no uber raid like VT bosses, I cannot say much about that). You think this is something other than pure boredom? No, we all have our small tasks in raids, which is fine with me. We all work together for a bigger cause. If you don't want to, stay out of it.<br>
<br>
(this is the same with all classes: Wizards nuke, Rogue Backstab, Warrior taunt ... blabla).<br>
<br>
I as a shaman don't want this shitty new heal they want to give us. It has no use in a XP group (if you have Torpor .. ok it helps for those who are lower Lvl or could not get their hands on that uber-rare spell, fix that verant, dammit), I will not get into a CCH (which is fine, I would not like to be, I did not make a cleric). All it can really do is heal AE damage out of groups. This ain't no patch heal (10 sec casting time). The shaman community would rather have a trimmed down version of the new instant heal clerics got with this patch:<br>
<br>
Ethereal Remedy<br>
Casting Time:  2.75 seconds <br>
Mana:  400 <br>
Target: Recover Hitpoint (975)<br>
<br>
Store bought of course, for 6pp<br>
<br>
Thats a patch heal a shaman could use to help getting a CCH started and smoothed out or heal AE damage.<br>
Make the shaman spell either cost more mana (500) or a bit longer to cast (3,5 secs) and we should be fine.<br>
<br>
And let those clerics have their fun with the hammer and new pet ... let them smash the mobs and forget to toggle of autoattack when mob enrages .. muhaha :-)<br>

Ignore me it's Friday morning and I am feeling cranky. Have cut out coffee for a couple of weeks and am tired and cross. Was really looking forward to that hammer as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Throne is a bit underpowered - adding the unnerfed hammer to our clerics MAY have made a real difference, and it was that I think I was looking forward to more than anything. Remember, it's not *all* about endgame guilds with classes and players in abundance.<br>
<br>
Not that either myself of the other 50+ cleric have any experience of this seeing as we are 54 and 55.<br>

BUT it was a small gnat compaired to the fucking exp nerf.  Clerics were getting around 40dps.  Compare that to a 56 Paladin w/average equipment and he is doing around 25-30.  That just wasn't right.  Granted you put a 60 Paly w/WToV or NToV weapons and his DPS jumps way up.  If you wanted a melee cleric you should have played a Paladin.  <br>
<br>
Sorry your hammer got nerfed, but my god you must have all seen it coming.  VI overpowered the damn thing.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you clerics what you expected at higher levels??  I mean your class is a badass buff/heal class period.  You also got Nukes, gate, Rez...  Everything a group OR raid NEED....<br>
<br>
Clerics are the cornerstone of any good group/raid PERIOD...<br>
