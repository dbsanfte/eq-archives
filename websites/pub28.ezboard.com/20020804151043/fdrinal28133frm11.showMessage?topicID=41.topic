As I thought, I inhaled through my nose, and the scent of death was woven in the air I needed to breathe.  My robe stained different colors of blood, once circulating through the veins of my foe.  I grew sick to my stomach, at the thousands upon thousands of enemy I have laid to waste.  The harmless bixie fluttering in Rivervale, the powerful yet vulnerable elephant that roams South Karana, the tree snake slithering in Freeport.  Did I have to bring their life to an end?  No, but I continued to bludgeon them with my staff.  No, but I continued to hurl large fireballs upon their frail bodies.  No, but I continued to manipulate the elements to attack, Attack, ATTACK!  <br>
     I stand now, 55 seasons later, many friend and foe lay motionless in my wake of fury.  Glimpses of mana drip from my experienced hands, countless journeys are worn on my feet, and my eyes sparkle like lightning and tell the story of a thousand tales.  I look back up at Jabanik still hovering upon my side, my best friend.  My tiny back is pressed against the rough walls of the mighty castle, elbows propped up with my small knees.  'We have been through a lot,' I tell my only companion with a heavy heart, and I shed a tear.  He looks back down upon me with a warm smile, but cold eyes, and does not say a word.  I rise to my feet, and see the veins in Jabanik's hands expand as he grasps the cold steel of his swords tightly.  It is time to continue to where I see no end, and we disappear into the depths of the castle together...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucolossis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>colossis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>SPACE MONKEY!!!</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 11:10:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Karnors Castle</span><hr size=1> nice ! <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62680">Sibian's  Pimp Gettho Loot.</a><center>

My faithful pet tries to valiantly defend me from the onslaught, but his efforts are in vein.  I watch his life drain before my eyes, and flee with sadness as I leave my only friend to die.<br>
Outside the dreadlands are a barren wasteland, and the golden sun quietly sets behind the ice-capped mountains.  An erie sensation overcomes me.  Flames dance in my left hand as water drips from underneath my fingernails of my right hand.  Each step I take molds a new foothold in the earth, and the wind is at my back in any direction I choose.  I sense the elements are trying to communicate, as if they are trying to forewarn me of a danger.  Yet the Tundra Yeti reluctantly look my way in fear of my pursuit, and the giants retreat to their strongholds in view of my presence.  I conjure a staff to assist me in my journey, and grasp it tightly with my right hand.  Water runs down the rough edges of the wood, striking the ground with force, and disappears.  Saddened by the recent death of Jabanik, I am hesitant to mold another pet, and continue to walk alone.  I set forth to the ruined druid rings, in hoping a kind druid would call upon the winds to carry me away... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uelynwinterspice.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elynwinterspice</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/02 10:49:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> Bravo old friend!<br>

Each step I take in the snow leaves a memento of my presence in the shape of a footprint, but those, too, fade quickly, as the winds and snow quickly conceal any evidence of my position.  The weather is bitter and cold, and I had abandoned my staff at the foot of Karnor's Castle because the frigid temperature was causing my knuckles to dry and crack.  Suddenly I have an idea.<br>
I sit in the midst of the giant wasteland, and search through my dusty spellbook, my legs folded under one another.  I eagerly flip page by page, in search of what would lift a great burden off of my back.  Finally, I find it, my 49th Season fire pet.  A provider of heat, an intellect at mind, and a warrior at heart.  I rise to my feet, and dig my Golden Efreeti Boots into the ground to better brace myself.  I close my eyes, and chant.  I bring my arms out to my sides, and stretch my fingers far apart.  Green electricity sparks from my fingertips, and grow in size.  The golden sun flashes brightly, and disappears behind the clouds.  Suddenly before me, it is a mass of gas and energy, and a fire elemental floats in front of me.  &quot;Following you, master,&quot; he explains, and with that he is silent.  The heat radiating from all sides melts the snow around him, revealing a floor of dead grass and mud.  His flames feel good against my skin, and I feel replenished by his energy.  We continue to the rings together, with his bright form illuminating the path for me.  I stride with a more comfortable aura, knowing I once again have a valiant companion by my side, and we continue over the ice capped mountains together... <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=291365</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udidrika2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Didrika2001</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.free-graphics.com/gallery2/3danimations/flags/tn_16.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><br><font color=#0000FF>!!!BEWARE!!!</font></br><br><u><b>I have multiple personalities</b></u></br></span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/02 10:38:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Your good - You keep each one short but interesting....

<br>
     I continue my walk with Gobn with hate in my soul.  An undying pain grasps my throat, and makes it difficult to breathe.  I travel with a glare in my eye, and a scowl is worn on my lips.  I look upon every mob that walks across my plane of view.  Death, destruction and chaos race through my head, and my brain begins to ache.  Why did I have this pain in my heart?  What caused my hands to shake so?  My stomach roared with hunger, and I saw Gobn grow more impatient with each stride.  I becaume frusterated with my headache, hunger and shortness of air.  A rage overcame me, and set a path to end all life to which was before me.<br>
     My eyes turned red with fury as I turned toward a Tundri Yeti.  I equipped my pet with two golden modulation rods, and the jewels imbedded in the metals shinned brightly.  I cast a Burnout spell with caused him to have the same sense of rage as I did.  &quot;Taunting attacker, Master&quot; is all I could hear as his voice traveled off towards the Yeti.  In a flash, my pet was mercilessly beating on the Yeti, and between the crushes and kicks, deep red blood poured from the side of the monster.  The sight of vunerability only pleased my pet further, and heightened his rage.  Within seconds, the Yeti laid lifeless, and Gobn turned his flame covered back to him, and faithfully returned to my side to rest.  I watched the ordeal from a distance.  I gained a sick pleasure in watching the savage thrashing of the Tundri Yeti by my pet, and it lightly lifted my spirits once again.  But it wasn't enough, and I thirsted for more blood.  Quickly, one by one, the population of the Dreadlands decreased, with my twisted smile growing bigger and bigger.  Gobn became more and more determined to please me with each kill, and his attacks turned into a frenzy.  He drew his happiness from my satisfaction, and I drew my satisfaction from their deaths.<br>
     Hours later, the carnage ends.  I collapse to my knees after exhaustion overcomes me.  I pant heavily, and my breath drifts from my mouth, floats into the air and disappears.  Gobn floats by my side, tired, but content.  Tears begin to flow relentlessly from my eyes, and I quiver uncontrolably.  The ruthless rage had once again overcome me, and I was powerless to defend myself.  It was the 4th time it had happened to me in my 56 seasons, hoping that my age would eventually overcome my weakness.  However, I still bow to this overwhelming force.  After reflecting about my regret of the matter, I carry on... <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=291365</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=41.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showNextMessage?topicID=41.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.threadControl?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11>Role-playing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
