And what you believe happened is almost correct. What actually happened (at least based on what we all discussed that night right after the roll) is that the ranger was going to come as a ranger to help fight. The group leader wanted us to get a  shaman though to add to the group to slow Lodizal so that we didnt get our asses handed to us since I dont think anyone there originally was over level 54. The ranger had access to a friend or relatives account with a shaman on it so he came as a shaman to help the cause, and it was already approved by the group leader that he would come as a shaman to make it possible for us to win, but he would be allowed to loot as his main character which was the ranger. This is when they rolled as ranger for him and he won the map piece.<br>
<br>
The problem comes in that the information that the ranger was playing shaman but lottoing as ranger was not properly put out there. Not everyone knew that this is how it was going down. So when you don't know that is what is happening and you see it happen, it obviously can disappoint ya. I really do sympathize with SLink though since I believe he had the rest of the parts for the mask (if i remember right) and I believe that if I were group leader I woud have probably made the item in question for only those folks of proper level to use the item to fullest extent. I wasn't leader though, and I can agree with the way it went down because it is up to the group leader to decide how loot is handled. If I don't agree with it, it is well within my rights to say I don't like it then I can just walk away and let them   deal with it themselves. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, first paragraph was how it went   down that night, so unless any information has changed since, the guy came as a shaman instead of a ranger to help out the cause based on the knowledge that he would be able to roll as a ranger. That sort of situation isn't so far fetched from what I have seen. Anyhow gnigght :p<br>

<br>
The player playing the 52 shamen, was the 34th ranger,(34 not 40), he was borrowing his &quot;budies&quot; 52 shamen. None of this was conveyd to the group of us beforehand.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem was defending this bad decision afterwards. Did it suck I lost the map to a 34 ranger? umm ya im 60 and waited a shitass long time to try to do this quest and would have won it. Another point being any other main character capable of assisting on a lodzial raid was   affected, not just me. Finally the general impression was we were lucky to be added to the entire situation, yet we brought a 60 shamen to the fight(i do not think 52 shamens can slow lodzial don't quote me on this) <br>
<br>
I am over this, I am not looking to start it up again but I guess Tat has it in for me, and does not care about certain things, and just wants to make people feel bad.<br>

<br>
       This topic was over when both Slinker and I brought it a end. We both would have done things differently under the same situation and the lotto would have definitely been held differently. A quick judgement was made and it was a poor one, case closed. We live we learn. There is no reason to continually harass myself, my guild or the ranger that looted the map. And if you feel you need to maybe you should go sit in the corner with your hands under your Arse because there's a certain level of maturity that comes from realizing your mistakes, apologizing for them and then letting it go.<br>
<br>
       Whatever other debate there is here is out of my control but as one as already said, take it to the flame board. <br>
<br>
      And to Mren who originally steered this thread off the topic that it was meant for, you get an &quot;A&quot; for the day. And &quot;A&quot; for the being the ass you are, time to grow up and stop being the instigator of things you weren't even involved in.

As for the ranger he is level 45 -50 by now (it has been a long time) and he is wearing an eyepatch. You did not come in here to talk about the topic of the ranger, you came in here to take yet another jab at Phoenixx guy months later by laughing at him. <br>
<br>
I've got an idea how about we compile an entire listing of the servers twinks who are wearing/have forn fungi tunic and heckle them for six months. After all I know monks who stood for months at a time in Seb trying to get groups to go down there so they can heal while fd and it is a level 55+ encounter. Can't imagine why they have a right to wear them either. Get their names, burn them at the stake, heckle them for months and then make sure we keep throwing rocks at them until they earn our trust. *please note sarcasm*<br>
