Even uninstalled EQ from my computers.  As of tonight Narvakhan/Amadagu (me) Khelidra (wife) Yuriko (daughter) Tehros (son) retired from eq.  Was a great almost 2 years for me.  I tried to say goodbye to everyone I know on drinal, but I missed a few that I wish I hadn't.  So in light of that I wanted to make a few special goodbyes....<br>
<br>
Tarnaris.... been a great ride Bones.. sorry I didn't see you in game, give me a call.  From unrest to the planes and beyond, we have had some fun no? /bow<br>
<br>
Serinalis...learned alot from you.  Thanks for showing me and for the adventures we have had.  I will always respect ya and call you a friend /bow<br>
<br>
Shaere.....Right or wrong, good or bad, I learned so much from you.  Whether I was watching as a lvl 34 Paladin in sol b as you lead the naggy wars or having you come save my sorry druid butt in fear/hate you taught me things I couldn't have learned otherwise.  Be well old monk I will always look up to you. /bow<br>
<br>
God so many names, I can't even name them all, I dont mean to stop short, just been a long night full of goodbyes.  Thanks to all of you from both Drinal and Tunare that have made this ride a great one.  Lots of reasons I am finally leaving, no reason to get into them because well, they are just one man's oppinions and I believe my time has come.  <br>
<br>
Kill the gods a few times for me :)  I wish you all the best of gear, the best of friends, the best of times and the greatest adventures.  <br>

*The old druid stands from his meditative position, makes a few symbols into the air as he speaks a few familiar words you have heard him use time and time again.  Before your eyes he is transformed into his usual wolf form.  Turning against the forest's horizon a smile appears amidst the bluish white fur.  With a final howl Amadagu calmly pads his way into the embrace of the forest's mist.  You find it hard to believe your eyes, yet you know, he has gone.* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueuthanasiawarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euth Anasia Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#993300>(3/28/01 10:19:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Farewell EQ from Narvakhan/Amadagu</span><hr size=1> Ama, you truly were, without trying to sound too cliche, one of the good guys.

We will meet again my friend and it has been an honor to meet you, group with you, assist you and help you out in the past. I also thank you for the help you lent to myself and everyone else out there you commited to helping. Seeing you leave seems to have a dark cloud hovering above many heads this day, along with your family I know my sweetheart really looked up to you and your family as players when I was not there to help guide her, for this, I thank you.<br>

We had fun Ama, we truly did and I look forward to it in the future once more, you know how to contact me, look me up some day perhaps we shall ravage the lands of another game in the future.

I've known you but a brief time really, but in that time I must say that I met one of the true good people that I've met in my 2 years+ playing this game. I seriously enjoyed playing with ya, and being a part of 'Souls', as it gave me and Teni a taste of what its like to be in a guild of people that do actually care about each other. <br>

We are both very sad to see you go, and will miss you and your family. You know, you actually made the big Ogre cry last night, when we were in the middle of finishing up our keys to HS. So I know you mean a lot to a lot of people here. I believe you always will. <br>

I can't tell you how much this Hurts old man, been a long time, a lot of Blood, sweat and Tears .. but a Ride I wouldn't have missed for the world ... From the Pally that wouldn't loot, the Druid that protected all, you have always had my up-most respect, and life long friendship.<br>
<br>
Never thought it would hurt to say goodbye to someone in a Game, but over the last 2 years came to know you as a friend, and grew to become brothers ... <br>
<br>
Yuri ... Gonna miss you, lil Brat  =p .. be good, and GL with School in the Fall hun ~hugs~<br>
<br>
Khel .. heh don't know what I am gonna do with you there to harass me anymore, will miss you hun, Be well          and look after Ama for me, lords knows he needs it  =)  xoxoxo<br>
<br>
Theo . Gonna miss you little bro, take care .. and make sure to drive your mom crazy for me<br>
<br>
Ama, aint gonna be the same without you bro, you always had my back, even when you thought I was in the wrong, you still stood by me, and caught me if I fell .. no one has ever done something like that for me, and for that I am truly greatfull to have known you ... I am rambling here, I know .. forgive this heh, jus having a hard time to figure out what I want to say ... Still even after talking to you on the Phone, I sit is Shock that my Bro, is truly gone ...<br>
<br>
I pray that Tunare see's Thee well and Helps give you the strength to see thy Family through all that is to come, No one will miss you more then me Bro .. no idea how we met, but I have gained more from your teachings and words then you shall ever know ... I will truly miss you and the Family you made me a Part of<br>
