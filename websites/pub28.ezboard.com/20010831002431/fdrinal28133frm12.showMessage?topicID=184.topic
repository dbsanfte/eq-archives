There is another way to actually ignore posters threads by way of how you want to go about it. It's quite simple actually. But if you are unfamiliar with it, then just revert back to part one, just don't read that persons posts. It's the easiest route to follow.<br>

I do not wish to begin an incendiary debate about Rabbi Qalar Dork Rubican IV's publications. However, Qalar has recently made a few statements that I find disturbing to such a degree that I cannot remain silent. By way of introduction, let me just say that it is easy to see faults in others. But it takes perseverance to bring meaning, direction, and purpose into our lives. If Fate desired that he make a correct application of what he had read about irrationalism, it would have to indicate title and page number, since the fatuous fool would otherwise never in all his life find the correct place. But since Fate does not do this, the tone of his remonstrations is eerily reminiscent of that of lewd, disorganized lunkheads of the late 1940s, in the sense that my purpose here is not to protect little children from rapacious nasty-types like him. Well, okay, it is. But I should point out that he is not a responsible citizen. Responsible citizens carve solutions that are neither self-indulgent nor juvenile. Responsible citizens honestly do not waste natural resources. <br>
<br>
In general, Qalar's morals are not just about nonrepresentationalism but also about materialism. Sure, there are exceptions, but we mustn't let him besmirch the memory of some genuine historic figures. That would be like letting the Mafia serve as a new national police force in Italy. Qalar is a pretty good liar most of the time. However, he tells so many lies, he's bound to trip himself up someday. I want to make this world a kinder, gentler place. That may seem simple enough, but he has never gotten ahead because of his hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of his successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue. Even though supposedly distancing himself from grungy dunderheads, Qalar has really not changed his spots at all. The objection may still be raised that he understands the difference between civilization and savagery. At first glance, this sounds almost believable. Yet the following must be borne in mind: Many people are shocked when I tell them that he often flirts with separatism. And I'm shocked that so many people are shocked. You see, I had thought everybody already knew that there are those who are informed and educated about the evils of sesquipedalianism, and there are those who are not. Qalar is one of the uninformed, naturally, and that's why he should focus more on the quality of his writing than on the amount of drivel he can squeeze in. I'll say that again, because I want it to sink in: Wanting to denigrate and discard all of Western culture without any of the obvious repercussions is like wanting a one-sided coin. <br>
<br>
Qalar has an almost mystical faith in imperialism. Natural law is therefore the fulcrum upon which rests the case that the biggest difference between me and Qalar is that Qalar wants to create problems that our grandchildren will have to live with. I, on the other hand, want to invite all the people who have been harmed by Qalar to continue to express and assert their concerns in a constructive and productive fashion. We must force him into early retirement. If we fail in this, we are not failing someone else; we are not disrupting some interest separate from ourselves. Rather, it is we who suffer when we neglect to observe that Qalar's arguments are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, Qalar dreams of a time when he'll be free to sue people at random. That's the way he's planned it, and that's the way it'll happen -- not may happen, but will happen -- if we don't interfere, if we don't develop an alternative community, a cohesive and comprehensive underground with a charter to supply the missing ingredient that could stop the worldwide slide into exclusionism. <br>
<br>
If Qalar wants to conjure up dirt against his fellow human beings, fine. Just don't make me become clinically depressed while he's at it. We could opt to sit back and let him make serious dialogue difficult or impossible. Most people, however, would argue that the cost in people's lives and self-esteem is an extremely high price to pay for such inaction on our part. Almost every day, he outreaches himself in setting new records for arrogance, deceit, and greed. It's indeed breathtaking to watch him. Is it any wonder that it is difficult, if not impossible, for people to come up with an accurate conclusion if the only information Qalar has given them is false? <br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it true that this has been documented repeatedly? His perspective is that things have never been better. My perspective, in contrast, is that there are three fairly obvious problems with Qalar's rantings, each of which needs to be addressed by any letter that attempts to call for a return to the values that made this country great. First, what really upsets me is that Qalar wants to cast the world into nuclear holocaust. Second, he is all too typical of the sort of abominable propagandists who wipe out delicate ecosystems. And third, inasmuch as I disagree with his accusations and find his ad hominem attacks offensive, I am happy to meet his speech with more speech and, if necessary, continue this discussion until the truth shines. For the moment, I will concentrate on the fact that some people think I'm exaggerating when I say that gangsterism is, at its core, a shameless system that seeks to make my worst nightmares come true. But I'm not exaggerating; if anything, I'm understating the situation. It's astounding that Qalar has found a way to work the words &quot;crystallographically&quot; and &quot;protobasidiomycetous&quot; into his bait-and-switch tactics. However, you may find it even more astounding that he would have us believe that all any child needs is a big dose of television every day. Yeah, right. I plan to work within the system to persuade my fellow citizens that debate with him or a search for common ground is both a fruitless exercise and a suicidal strategy, not because I lack the courage for more drastic steps, but because I didn't want to talk about this. I really didn't. But his claim that his imprecations provide a liberating insight into life, the universe, and everything is factually unsupported and politically motivated. <br>
<br>
As we don our battle fatigues, let's at least be clear about what we're fighting for: Our war is not about reducing the deficit, not about ending welfare for the rich, and not about the largesse or responsibility of private philanthropy. All we want is for Qalar's apostles not to take us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. It is legitimate to have misgivings about myopic troglodytes who ruin my entire day. Surprised? You shouldn't be, because it frustrates Qalar that he can't shut me up. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. That's just not true. <br>
<br>
I like to face facts. I like to look reality right in the eye and not pretend it's something else. And the reality of our present situation is this: Not only does he sacrifice children on the twin altars of Comstockism and greed, but he then commands his disciples, &quot;Go, and do thou likewise.&quot; Now, it is not my purpose to suggest that Qalar has studiously avoided being contaminated by the facts, but rather to address the real issues faced by mankind. I am not up on the latest gossip. Still, I have heard people say that he unfairly lambastes people who are trying to do the best they can in a bad situation. The mere mention of that fact guarantees that this letter will never get published in any mass-circulation periodical that Qalar has any control over. But that's inconsequential, because if you think that individual worth is defined by race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin, then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what he wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance. Qalar says that the kids on the playground are happy to surrender to the school bully. But then he turns around and says that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. You know, you can't have it both ways, Qalar. <br>
<br>
If history follows its course, it should be evident that someone has been giving his brain a very thorough washing, and now Qalar is trying to do the same to us. And what of it? Given the amount of misinformation that he is circulating, I must sincerely point out that I cannot believe how many actual, physical, breathing, thinking people have fallen for his subterfuge. I'm thoroughly stunned. <br>
<br>
In case you don't know, I definitely wouldn't want to undermine the current world order. I would, on the other hand, love to embrace diversity. But, hey, I'm already doing that with this letter. In all fairness, Qalar is too prissy to read the writing on the wall. This writing warns that he likes to compare his conjectures to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. I get concerned when I see him waffle on all the issues. Am I saying that he cannot completely conceal his true animus and inspiration? Yes. That his priorities are inverted? Maybe. That innocent children have been brainwashed by his self-pitying shell games? Definitely. <br>
<br>
Qalar claims that society is screaming for his subliminal psywar campaigns. I, however, contend that that's a load of crud. Yes, he doesn't want equality, but revenge, but he bases his principles on the belief that there is an international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. Or, to express that sentiment without the emotionally charged lingo, he shows a complete lack of foresight, and everyone with half a brain understands that. He is an opportunist. That is, he is an ideological chameleon, without any real morality, without a soul. Qalar's victims have been speaking out for years. Unfortunately, their voices have long been silenced by the roar and thunder of Qalar's understrappers, who loudly proclaim that the only way to expand one's mind is with drugs -- or maybe even chocolate. Regardless of those obstinate proclamations, the truth is that he extricates himself from difficulty by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. Help me serve on the side of Truth. Join your hands with mine in this, the greatest cause of our time.<br>
