Regarding Selling</span><hr size=1> Allright Guys...<br>
<br>
Many of you know me in game yadda yadda. Anyways, I have a question for you (Now that my account is finally working activley again) I sell extra platnium that I recieve on playerauctions.com at times. Sometimes if I see the rent or car payment is gonna be hard to make, the extra few hundred dollars can serve me well.<br>
<br>
So anyways, this guy comes to me in game and contacts me about buying plat... I kinda /shrug and he gives me the amount he wishes, and ends up sending $600 or so. I deliver, everythings good.<br>
<br>
Oh wait.. until now, a month later he decides to challenge the charges on paypal, claiming i never delivered the goods. So all the money on my account is reversed. I contact paypal, and all they tell me is I have to provide a tracking number or some proof that he recieved it. Which I obviously cant. They say that they discourage the sales of Imaginary items, because of this, and because the only way I can get my money is if he drops these charges essentially.<br>
<br>
Now, I get an email from this guy, saying if I dont refund all his money, hes going to contact an attorney and subpoena my information, at this point i'm so completley confused nothing makes sense.<br>
<br>
He didnt buy it off a site, he has no Item number, no URL, No Transaction number, all his transactions to me were just money, with no other info than &quot;50k&quot; etc. So how in the hell could he try and get an attorney on me?<br>
<br>
And I've heard EQ has -SERIOUS- Tracking issues, and its not like Verant is gonna tell someone, &quot;oh.. he bought plat? Sure lemme check if it was recieved&quot; <br>
<br>
Basically should I take this as a false threat or am I going to have to return his money?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>

Regarding Selling</span><hr size=1> Daammnn 600$.... how much plat could that buy? Thats like an entire account. While i'm no expert, sounds like you SOL since verant isnt going to vouch for you being that they dont support item/plat selling and if you told them you sold the stuff they would probably ban your account. Could always tell us his name so drinal knows what a bitch he is. I know a guy that sold several items and the buyer sent him a check, once the check arrived the buyer had already cancelled the check and the seller was screwed. Hope it goes better for you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usorbital.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorbital</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S & M</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 9:02:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/Weekly%20Grind/stealie_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A Question...... Regarding Selling</span><hr size=1> Isn't there a rule about selling EQ stuff for RL money?<br>
<br>
He is the prosecution and you are the defense, you will have to prove that you delivered the item in question.  He can prove that he paid you.<br>
<br>
The burden of proof falls on your shoulders my friend.<br>
<br>
1. Do you have his money?<br>
<br>
2. If you answered 'yes' Here is what you do...Wait until he has contacted a lawyer.  It will cost him money to 'retain' the lawer.  Most of the time, the lawyer writes you a nasty letter, you get scared and send back the money.  In this instance you are looking at small claims court, and it will be so much effort and expense to legally force you to pay him that he will give up.  But, start saving the $600.  If you get a summons, contact the lawyer and tell him you will settle now for $600 and call it even.  9 times out of 10 this will work, lawyer keeps retainer, and guy gets money.<br>
<br>
3. if you answered 'no', then learn from this lesson.  Don't sell EQ items for real money, if you do, get the other person to sign a waiver, releasing you from all liability.  like this:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hereby release _________ from any liability regarding the purchase of _________.  I have received the items and do not hold _______ liable for anything further&quot;<br>
<br>
This is, of course, overly simplified, but it's legal and gets you off any hook.<br>
<br>
Good luck friend!  Just remember, Cover Your Ass (especially with the Bryian(sp) guy around, never know what he may want to do to it...) <p><img src = "http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/newtag.gif""http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/New5.gif'></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulotozek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lotozek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 9:07:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Hmm</span><hr size=1> Well see.<br>
<br>
I understand that, But I dont see how a lawyer would even take a case like this. Because if you look at the facts, he cant even prove what he was sending the money FOR. One of the rules paypal has, is when you send money, you should have a Transaction Number, a Item Number, a URL, Etc so you can prove exactly what is what.<br>
<br>
He had none of htis, he just sent me the money, and the title was &quot;50k&quot; plat or whatever.  So I dont viably see how a lawyer could or would even touch this case.<br>
<br>
As to wether I have the money, I have money from other transactions, about 500 in my paypal account, but do not have 600 laying around, no. <br>
<br>
Basically, I mean if he got a lawyer involved (my mom works for a lawfirm) I just dont see how anything could be done. Because theres no way for EITHER of us to prove wether or not the transaction was processed, he cant prove he didnt get th emoney and I cant prove I delivered it, becuase with virtual items theres no tracking method.<br>
<br>
I'm so unsure what to do.<br>

Regarding Selling</span><hr size=1> Actually - Lotozek has changed the story around quite a bit. He (Lotozek) was the seller who told someone that he'd give him an item for 450 dollars. Flayed Barb Legs that he (Forelorn,Lotozek) had recently purchased from Cats (Lern sold them to him). Ask anyone who was on this weekend as he was &quot;having fun&quot; auctioning them (complete w/ link) in /market. The character that sold them was a 23 monk named Forelorn. He is also Lotozek - mnk, Devern - war, Megolian - dru, Zakab - bst. Lotozek admitted this to the person, as I've seen the logs. Lotozek decided that after the money was sent to him that he didn't want to sell such a rare item to the person that had already payed him. He also decided that he was not going to give the person back the money that he guy had sent to him. <br>
Now he's here trying to weasel out of any repercussions that may befall him. I'm sure the person in question will be pointed to this thread soon. So who's the real dirtbag?<br>
Nice try Lotozek. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulotozek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lotozek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 9:24:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Wrong Archane</span><hr size=1> Archane,<br>
<br>
Thats a completley different transaction. I was GOING to send that person (whose name not be named) his $450, but thats the money that I currently dont have access too. One friend warned me about this, that people could challenge any transaction they wanted and since theres no evidence I lose the money.<br>
<br>
Essentially when on the phone with paypal I said, &quot;So your telling me I could go buy something off playerauctions for $1000 dollars, then challenge it, and I&quot;d get my money back?&quot; And they basically said yeah, as long as it wasnt a reocurring trend.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to send that gentlement back his $450 dollars. But am unable too untilt his situation has been resolved. <br>
<br>
And this situation is Bullshit<br>
<br>
By the way, for those of you who dont support selling buying online whatever, the only reason I sell items or goods is because my Father had a stroke 2 years ago, that almost killed him, and hes still unable to resume work, so I have to try and help support my little brother, and my father, as my mom's salary is not all that much, and me and her have been at ends ever since his stroke.<br>

<br>
Even in the &quot;he can't prove anything&quot; scenario.  He paid you money for goods/services that he claims were not delivered.  This is a breech of a verbal contract on YOUR part.  You would have to provide evidence that you delivered the goods/services in question, or return the money.  That is called, &quot;Burden of Proof&quot;<br>
<br>
Lawyers will do whatever you pay them to do.<br>
<br>
If you are trying to rip off someone, then you should look in the toilet after you take a crap.  You are the thing swirling around in the water in the bowl.<br>

See, I respond once, becuase I misunderstand something you say and you respond that way.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck do we all even play EQ? I mean hell the game is stressful on alot of people, i've even had people tell me its a chore to log on now, allthough then i dont understand why they play.<br>
<br>
Last night in Bazaar I ranted like hell when i saw someone saying &quot;250pp per shot of KEI by Nexus bank&quot; I was just like what the fuck, what happened to the days both in real life and in game where people would just help one another? Where they would port, or sow, or breeze because theyw anted to help other people out.<br>
<br>
Look at EQ, Or in real life everyones out to take whatever you got, as long as its better than what they have. Its just such bullshit, all politics.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I've been wanting to test drive my new car to see how fast it could go, maybe i'll check out far over a median I can fly.... or how many times it rolls. Fuck it.<br>
<br>
Not like we dont all have enough real life issues, but when we start to have the same issues in a game thats fucked up.<br>
<br>
Maybe just say fuck it, and say goodbye to paypal, eq, playerauctions and give my account to a friend who knows, maybe time to sayg oodbye to other things too.<br>
<br>
Just so sick of it.<br>
<br>
I know the pieces fit, cause I watched them fall away...<br>

He gets home around 5pm and I sent him an email pointing to this post. If I were you I would contact him, because I do know for a fact that he has contacted someone from Hale &amp; Dorr.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usorbital.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorbital</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S & M</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 10:11:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/Weekly%20Grind/stealie_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_arrowdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fuck It</span><hr size=1> alright, i feel guilty. sorry bro. <p><img src = "http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/newtag.gif""http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/New5.gif'></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwex5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wex5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 10:13:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_arrowdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fuck It</span><hr size=1> Well, this is a mess.  I'm sorry to hear about your family troubles, I hope things work out.<br>
<br>
My advice to you:  Instead of selling EQ items to raise money to support your family, go out and get a job.<br>
<br>
It is unlikely an attorney would take this case unless he wanted to do some charity work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

I worked a security job for the past year or so and left about 2 months ago due to personal reasons, and have been unable to find a decent job since.<br>
<br>
I was the frontrunner for a Airport Security Soupervisor job which would have started me at 45 grand a year.... but I was edged out at the last stretch run by another gentleman.<br>
<br>
Same has been the story with a few of my job apps, i've been trying as hard as I can. Heh. Just sometimes life doesnt like you, ya know.<br>
<br>
And archane, i responded to him allready, I had only got one email from him before this, and simply had not had time to respond.<br>
<br>
I just dont really know what to do, but I do agree with Wex, its unlikley a attorney would touch this. As we are dealing with fictional items. Which cannot be proved to be delivered or undelivered. And all that matters in court is proof. Which neither side can provide.<br>
<br>
I'm contacting each side invidiaully and trying to work something out. But man I feel like i'm gettin fucked. I dont have the cash to do this, heh. I guess when mom gets home i'll let her know we'll have to take some cash out of my brothers college fund to meet rent. wont be the first I guess.<br>

If he has your item, then dont give him his money back until its returned. If I were in that position, I wouldnt even take the item back, I would just keep the money, let him keep the item he agreed to buy, and say &quot;see ya in court&quot; if he wants to rip you off. <br>
<br>
Also, do you have logs showing this verbal agreement taking place in-game? That might come up if lawyers got involved.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarcahne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arcahne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 10:51:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_arrowdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /sigh</span><hr size=1> The leggings in question were never given, Lotozek still has them.

I apologize for calling you a liar about changing the story about my friend Loto. You just neglected to tell that one. I'm sorry to hear that you are apparently being scammed, but that isn't any good reason to do unto others.<br>
<br>
The fact remains you agreed to the deal, got paid, and never turned over the item and haven't returned his money. This can all be verified by Verant or Paypal. I don't think he's trying to scare anyone, Cobain. I know the lady lawyer he is talking to (he used to date her). I think he just wants his money back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uassassincobain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Assassin Cobain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 11:07:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3722.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webdeveloper.com/animations/bnifiles/ball.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_arrowdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /sigh</span><hr size=1> I'm confused then, wtf is loto talking about if he's already been paid, and still has his item?

I'm trying to accomdate that as well, if nothing else i'm sure I can get in touch with him and just figure something out to where I can send him the cash as soon as this other matter gets resolved.<br>
<br>
And to Corbain, no, I dont ever have the logs turned on, but logs are a moot point anyways, as they can be tampered with and altered. Even if I had them they wouldnt do me any good.<br>
<br>
I'll just try to get in tocuh with both of the individuals and figure something out i guess.<br>

Only issue is if I'm gonna be around after tonight.<br>

You have two deals mixed up. The individual did send me the money for Flayed Bab Leggings-and when I went to send it back I found that because the other individual had reversed the transactions I no longer had any funds in my account, and was in a negative balance.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to get the situation with th eother individual solved so I can send the other gentleman back the money for the Flayed Bab Legs.<br>

Loto - if you need money right now so bad and sell EQ stuff so you can pay your bills etc etc - and you have to pay the rent, I read, instead of taking it out of the college fund why don't you give that guy the leggings and keep the money he paid you? <br>
<br>
I mean, unless you think that gear is worth more than paying your rent and having to take money from his college fund...<br>
<br>
