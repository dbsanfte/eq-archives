<br>
yes it does hurt his pride, but not of himself. It hurts all of our pride when a Guild Member dosent work with us to uphold what we have worked so hard for. No it dosent hurt Kald's or any of our Personal pride, but Pride in guild.  Pride that we brought CS out of hard times into a successful guild, hard ass work was involved in that process, and its because we have PRIDE in what we do.  If you buy a new car and you never clean it, maintain it, or look after it soon enough it will look and run like shit. Same with a guild, you have to get rid of the things that makes it work less cohesively, and we have to do some house cleaning every now and again, nothing personal, just business. If you dont want to raid then CS simply isnt for you, go to another lax guild that focus's less on raiding, there is nothing wrong with those, and some prefer those. Yes we have some members that are just there becaues they log on now and then to shoot the shit and we enjoy those players, but on the same token we dont see /gu I need this.... help me get that...... i deserve that from those members. because they know if they arnt at the majority of the raids, unless its offered to them they just dont deserve it. I for instance havent played much lately to RL, and i dont deserve to get something over a active monk.  The people that say you cant have a RL and be in CS are lamers... now you cant be in CS and 'have a RL&quot; and expect to be in the same loot tables as someone that is on every single night working their arse's off to get us to new places.  thats my 2 cp for now.. i'm sure i will contribute later =D. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usilvius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silvius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 8:03:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes Beaumains... you hit the nail on the head</span><hr size=1> Kald doesn't run around removing people who piss him off, getting kicked usualy starts with lots of people complaining about you, and then the officers have lots of talking and yacking, and then kald removes you because no one likes you. Beau I don't think I've *EVER* seen you on a raid, and I'll be the first to admit I have no life (but then really how many of us do here?) so I'm on almost every raid, and I'm usualy doing groups for a good number of them. <br>
<br>
It really irks me that people get kicked and bitch about how HORRIBLE Clan Skallagrim is, and how much trouble they were having, and how mean the officers were. If being in CS was such a terrible thing for you, why didn't YOU leave. All these CS is the devil threads seem to boil down to people getting kicked because they were seen for what they were (loot whores who want their epics so they can jump guilds after they get it) and were kicked before they could use and abuse the guild, and they want to make a big scene so people will think they're innocent. <br>
<br>
I admit in the past, I disagreed with some of the kicks and still remain friends with those people, BUT in Kald's defense that was a very shaky transition time for CS that couldn't afford any internal guild conflicts. Now, however, every kick has been of a useless jerk no one liked. 9 times out of 10 being kicked from Clan starts with the non-officers expressing their concerns to Kald and the other officers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umaar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior Stud</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 8:26:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes Beaumains... you hit the nail on the head</span><hr size=1> Damn Nadz, did you hear that?<br>

You were so occupied with finding a group in velks that I don't think you ever bothered to come to 1/10 of the raids we did.  Even when it was stated in /gu &quot;all come to wherever&quot;, you'd just park your happy ass in velketor university for a course in leveling 101.

Yeah getting removed from CS was a good thing alright.  Now you can go put your application in with CiH, and see how long it takes for them to remove you.

Is it your highest lvl character, the one you play the most, the one you enjoy the most, the one who looks cool. <br>
<br>
I see this all the time, play your main character but what one person may percieve to be a main another person may decide otherwise. <br>
<br>
For example, say I am a druid and I get all the way to 60 and realize I hate my class, so I make a bard, play him to 50 decide nah, not for me. So I make a Paladin and I am lvl 30 but I love the class. Which one is my main? The two others are higher lvl but they are not enjoyable to me. Doesn't this mean I have to play a class to appease others? I did this once before, it's called a cleric and I'd never do it again. I personally feel a persons main character is the one they either feel like playing at the time OR most often the one they really enjoy playing the most. It's no suprise on the other servers I perfer being a bard and beastlord myself. I play them over my lvl 60's and 50's. <br>
<br>
See where I am coming from on this? People play the game for fun, the minute someone tells you that you have to play this character just because, well to me thats no fun and hence I would not play that class because you're paying to have fun, that joe from the eastside is not so how can he or she tell you what you have to play. However, be considerate and yes when you join a guild you should obide by their rules or not join at all, that simple.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udeedoskydancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deedo Skydancer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.the-web-ac.com/annubis/eqbilder/vamp.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>dildo skydancer!</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 9:08:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.the-web-ac.com/annubis/eqbilder/Note.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yes Beaumains... you hit the nail on the head</span><hr size=1> well said balrak <p><center><a href=http://kastir.lunarpages.com border="0"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nluwen/deedosig2.gif" border=0></a></center>

The problem lies where people apply with one character and never play that character and want to use the guild to equip their twink/main.  How would you look upon it if someone applies with a lvl 60 cleric which the guild needs at the time and instead, all you see from the person is a lvl 52 paladin whom said person wants to equip with guild resources. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/Everquestakirotag/JAROUTTAG.html"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FF0000>Drinal Ally</font></span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 10:05:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yes Beaumains... you hit the nail on the head</span><hr size=1> haven't we seen like 5 guys all from CS removed for the same reasons by kald who then posts it publically on this board.

Since Jarak and that hopeless gang left/were booted, we learned our lesson and take good care not to hang on to people that don't fit in the crowd in CS<br>
<hr><br>
<br>
Giljabitch you don't know shit about me, you never fucking played the game when I was around to know who the hell I was. you trolled the message boards and added your 2 cents as an officer to make official calls. I dedicated 5 months of my life to that guild with 95% raid attendance. I'm unable to show up in PoA for a week due to real life situations and I start getting bitched at by you and other officers. same with Nadin, that's when we started confronting the officers about our problems with the guild. since none of you seemed to care, we figured we weren't that important, so we left. many other reasons lead to that decision, and the ones that had a chance to read those sent me tells and said "I understand what you're saying, and I've been wanting to leave CS too, but i'm only level 52 and I can't get in an uber guild like WL or CIH till I'm 60, I'll have to stay in CS untill then"  and one of those people are posting defending CS on this thread right here.<br>
<br>
after the month of being unguilded, then finally deciding on submitting an application to CiH, I got accepted, and a bunch of CS members asking me to help them get into CIH... same ones that are hardcore hypocrites defending their guild on the message board for brownie points I guess<br>

For CS, and in the case of said cleric, that's easy. The roster has a little tag next to your character that says 'main' and all your alts get listed under it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 1:29:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reply:  EQPsychic</span><hr size=1> All I gotta say is &quot;when everyone but you says you're wrong...ya usually are&quot;.<br>

Now I Cause about half of the bullsh*t that goes on in guildchat if im on. Why haven't i been kicked out, Well the whole guild is wonders that all the time and so do i, and thier have been many posts on Getting rid of me. Im guessing im kept around cause im pretty damn smart if i get off my ass and act, I'm the guild scapegoat, i'm funny at times, im charismatic and seem to get along with most people, i've got a backbone and im loyal like a seeing eye dog.

Rofl.  People comparing an EQ guild and its leader to the third reich...  whatever.<br>
<br>
When I played EQ, I was in CS.  For about 6 months, and believe me, it was the best 6 months of playing that game.  Kald may be demanding at times, but he gets the job done, and that's what guild leaders are there for.  Being nice gets you friends, but it leaves things unsettled.  Kald has to be the bad guy sometimes, hence the stupid flame posts we see.<br>
