<br>
Turning your backs on what you claim to stand for, or your 'friends' does.<br>
<br>
What is a friend? I ask people.<br>
<br>
They reply, people we play with often and have fun.<br>
<br>
Why did you join a guild? To play with friends.<br>
<br>
Your definition qualifies that guild not as friends.<br>
<br>
If you played for months with a certain crowd, went thru hell and back with them, and you join a different group of mostly strangers who have done Jack squat for you, to never talk or play with the certain crowd again, but oh wait. You joined to play with friends. defined as people who you played with alot. <br>
<br>
Clue you in. they were never your friends. they didnt know you existed. But all of a sudden, theyre your friends.<br>
<br>
People throw that term around loosely. There are more people who use other people in game than there are friends.<br>
The meaning is lost.<br>
<br>
And when you join this new crowd, to do new AND exciting things, it dont make you a sell out. But when you help them do things you used to be against, things you left your old server to get away from, you are a sell out.<br>
<br>
When you help them snipe, lie, steal, ks, train, whatever. YOU are a sell out.<br>
<br>
I dont call you a sell out because you joined a guild to do stuff.<br>
<br>
Its because you turnd your back on everything you stood for, or claimed to stand for. Because you dont wanna make waves, and not get loot.<br>
<br>
When someone who said they were &quot;my friend&quot; is with a group that snipes or kses someone, you are a sell out. <br>
<br>
because we left tunare to get away from certain things. Like the guild might makes right mentality. The &quot;we did it because we can&quot; mentality. You USED to respect others wishes or plans to do raids. But now that you are in a guild, your beliefs change? Morals need not apply? left your integrity at home? All of a sudden you are ignorant and didnt know?<br>
<br>
Bullshit.<br>
<br>
You dont wanna make waves and upset your new&quot;friends'.<br>
<br>
Sigh, I say alot of things in anger, and can cause alot of problems. I am very frustrated. <br>
<br>
The people who I used to laugh and cry with, went through the good and bad times with, I see one day, and they dont evn know my name. Because they have new &quot;friends&quot;.<br>
<br>
And when I see one of my old &quot;friends&quot; in a guild, and I see that guild snipe(meaning they decided to not respect someone elses plans, and just hurried up and beat them there because they are greedy), I say wtf. Didnt we use to stand against that sort of thing? Didnt we fight for the masses? Didnt we use to throw our fists into the air, shaking them as we condemned those sort of actions?<br>
<br>
And they want to say &quot;hey man whats up.&quot; You betrayed what we did, what we played for, those you played with, what they stood for. That makes you a SELL OUT. You sold out your friends, morals, principles, beliefs, whatever and just went with the flow. Dont rock the boat because you wont be able to do trak or pog, and get loot.<br>
<br>
You define friend as someone you play alot with, and have fun with? Seems your idea of friend changes a lot. Because oh, how quickly we forget.<br>
<br>
I realize that alot of people dont care about any of this. They just wana kill stuff and get loot. But I do care, and I guess thats why I am so angry all the time.<br>
<br>
The tunare player all split up, turned backs on each other, and went whatever way would get them loot.<br>
<br>
Dont try to tell me we cant do open raids and stuff, we always did.<br>
<br>
So to all my former 'friends'. By your definition, all the people I played with,  I am not your friend. Dont try and say hi , or wave to me. You sold out. You seemingly just make new friends wherver the loot is richest.<br>
<br>
And I am sure you know by now, I take judas very seriously.<br>
 I spit on you and yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 139<br> <font color=#993300>(2/14/01 7:49:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> Gee Shaere, I don't see how you had any friends. You never once waved back or were cordial to me in the many times I have seen and raided with you.<br>
<br>
In general you don't wave back or act cordial to anyone who tries to be so to you. As a matter of fact I got over it the first time you decided to have a hissy over how many buffs you recieved, but you are repetatively harsh on people - burn me once shame on you - burn me twice shame on me. <br>
<br>
I guess the few people who get to see that side of you are lucky.<br>
<br>
I don't have any clue what you are talking about up there - but there is definately no crying/laughing that I have seen - just poor communication and an overdose of beligerant , totally uncalled for, authoritarianism. For a while I thought you were improving - but I was totally wrong for trying to believe that was possible. <br>
<br>
You have a lot of energy  - that is about all I can see now &quot;energy&quot; - the rest is hype. Golden rule do unto others - that is your motto from what I can see, however, the only area where that Golden Rule doesn't apply is when you speak to people like they are 12 year old morons....nope nope bow down to the master in return. <br>
<br>
Leadership in the modern day is not that archaic. Authoritarianism was proven to be a failure. People in Y2K communicate, listen, and recieve feedback - not create read only forums so the boss can speak and no one can reply. <br>
<br>
I could go on....before you start brow beating anyone else take a good look at yourself. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 2/14/01 7:54:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualealthewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleal the Wiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~fuellg/bobspinanim.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress Fingerwiggler</span><br>  Posts: 377<br> <font color=#993300>(2/14/01 1:17:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Take a look at Tunare these days, I don't think you will find much of a difference.  It was a culture shock for a lot of us to get used to the idea of a Guild-only mentality.  There are definite pro's and con's, more then I care to discuss, but what it comes down to is it is ultimately different here then it was when we left Tunare.  People are trying to find their own happiness and probably don't care that it conflicts with how you think they should find happiness.<br>
<br>
Other people play this game besides you and are gonna have fun doing the things they want to do and how they want to do them.  When I joined CS, they had done nothing more then the planes.  Now they are doing all this cool stuff and certainly under the gun by you and others.  How is that selling out for loot when I don't exactly need alot from the planes?  When I joined, most of my friends were in there, Xilith, Cartique, Seandar, Cinadwen, PMR, etc...  These are my friends, some of them I have been with for a very long time, some since they day the Tunare opened.<br>
<br>
While I guess you feel like people turned their back on you, you know I will still be there to help you even though you constantly berate me and my friends on the boards and in game.  I know you are a good guy at heart if just a bit to fanatic.  Calm down a bit and we can all have some fun.  It is a game ya know, I lose scope of that sometimes myself... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uh0tr0d.showPublicProfile?language=EN>h0tr0d</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gifzboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#993300>(2/14/01 3:02:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> let me rephrase</span><hr size=1> saying you are against something, fighting it.<br>

I didnt like the way the server was going myself, so instead of trying to fight the inevitable, I simply left.<br>
<br>
People from Tunare tryed to bring the Tunare way with them, but it failed, so most people from Tunare adopted to the ways they saw this server was going to be. Aleal wanted me to join CS with him, I told him that I didnt want to becuase I saw the CS way was the anti Tunare way (my god on their website it states that if you are in a group with non guildmates and a guildmate wants a group, then you should kick the non guildmate out of the group so you have room for the guildy - thats just sad!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Are they sellouts? In a way - yes. But they all had to choose a path on this server that allowed them to continue to enjoy playing while still accomplishing their goals. For most that meant forgetting the way it was and adopting the way it is. <br>

<br>
These are true quotes: <br>
<br>
Response A) I want to get my epic it's the only way I can.<br>
Response B) I'm a tank - tanks need a guild - I could get in the guild.<br>
Response C) I am using him for raids<br>
