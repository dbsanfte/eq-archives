I wasn't there that night and I don't believe in camp stealing.  But there would be a reason for these actions, but not an excuse.  The night before Felain had camped scout and she asked us all to come and we were enroute with 12 people in the zone and another guild, not saying names, came in and handed in the tools to make it spawn, stealing it from the person who was camping it for the last 3 hours.  We were very upset over that and I think the actions of that night were because we tried being civil and nice with the other guild and they didnt "play fair".  There is no such thing as a camp, it is whomever engages the mob first.

And in fact only 22 secs before the druid harmonizing actually aggroed.  And she did not announce she was there and things should be halted, no she sent Felain a tell.  Nothing could have been done to stop the capt being pulled at that point.<br><br>And I dont think you should cling to a guide that is stupid enough to reveal a state of an account to a third party.  A guide that does that has really managed to blow her chances.  And hopefully she will not be around for very much longer.<br><br> <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/kald.jpg"></CENTER> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubamthin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bamthin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/18/01 4:18:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A shameful day for CS in Western Wastes</span><hr size=1> Here's the time I petitioned and here's Felain's response to me.
