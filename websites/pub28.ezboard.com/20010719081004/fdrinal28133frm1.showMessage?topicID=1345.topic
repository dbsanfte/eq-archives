<br>
Im sure this is just another one of your lame attemps to get ppl to feel sorry for you. Lets see, since I was in Dark Shadows with you (heck even before that on Tunare)  You &quot;threatened&quot; to quit at least 20 time, literally, that I can remember.  Actually, it wasnt a week of EQ without the PMR &quot;im quitting&quot; epsiode.  Then all the ppl that dont know you would say &quot; Oh no PMR, we love you.  You rule. Dont quit PLEASE&quot;  blah blah blah blah blah<br>
<br>
Im tired of you always trying to be the center of attention.  I remember at least 5 times with Dark Shadows when you would say something in guild chat or something, and noone would respond cause they were busy or whatever, and you would say, &quot;Do you all hate me?  You sure you want me in guild?  I can leave if you no like me.  Really, just tell me if you dont like me&quot;  Then of course someone would have to bite and tell you how cool you are and to stay.  God, you were worse than Kith. <br>
<br>
Just leave the game already.  Dont sit here and say your gonna go back to Tunare to get ppl to kiss your ass yet again.  We all know your not going anywhere.  Your just fishing for more ppl to &quot;pet&quot; your ego enough til it wears off and ya make the same &quot;threat&quot; in another week or so.  LEAVE THE GAME AND SAVE US THE SOAP OPERA.  Go back to Tunare and let them deal with your adolescent behavior.  <br>
<br>
Just for the record, every person I have talked to feels the same way about you.  Sure ya have a few friends here and there.  Ill give ya 2 reasons for that :<br>
<br>
1.  Even a blind squirrel cand find an Acorn.<br>
<br>
2.  Your an enchanter with an Epic<br>
<br>
Now Honesty, stop posting to try and get people to feel sorry for you.  Go back to Tunare please.  Im sure you will be welcomed there (of course until you pull the same B.S. there threatening to leave and go to Drinal :P)<br>
<br>
Farewell to PMR/CMR/EMR - The biggest Primadonna I have honestly had the pleasure of never meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  This is the first post I have ever done here.  I havent played the game in like 2 months.  I just had to comment on this because she/he just needs to be stopped.  Funny thing is, when I chatted with an real life friend that is in Inferni with her Alts (over the phone), she pulled this same thing claiming some level 1 in Freeport said they didnt like her.  So she told them that she would leave the guild if they didnt like her etc etc etc etc.  Friggen pathetic.  <br>
<br>
K im done.  (I cant wait to see if PMR responds to this)  I already know EXACTLY how she will reply if she does.  Itll be something along the line of :  You dont know me. Why you hate me?  Im gonan leave.  yadda yadda <br>

<br>
I did say before i post this message, i tell you Dean MUST need to be sorry for me for very sure, why i say that i don't think you would like to understand, i think you will just say i put out some crap again to let people flame dean. so sorry i am not, but if you are think about this, than i tell you NOT.<br>
<br>
You can say anything that come from your mind and post here, but went you are not so understand someone i wish you better stop and stand up to see what is the people meaning. Friendship is hard to get and went you need people belive you, than you will need to do a lot of thing to let peopel trust you.<br>
<br>
Why i alway post so long message, because i am not good at english i don't know how to explan what i want to say, but i type that in my mind out to let people understand, if even not aleast i did used time and post what i want to say. <br>
<br>
Other thing yes i say i quit game for A LOT of time as you say. yes i did because some reason by myself and by other, But if you are so hate me not wanted to see me in the game, than i hope you tell me the truth what did i make you hate me so much? what is the matter between you and me than? if here have something is wrong from me, i will really want to understand and fix it. i don't like to keep the matter grow up bigger.<br>
<br>
I was in Tunare yes, right now i am in drinal i say i want to leave this server. but why you angry about this? you say out i got Epic and i am enc than people like me, maybe this is the reason but aleast is not all people say that for me.<br>
<br>
I got no idea what you say about a level 1 Char and what. But went you login to some New player hunting place and ooc or shout about who know pmr or emr or something i don't think here will have anyone say some mean thing for me. i have new player char also i like to chat with them they don't know a lot of thing and i can trust them as a friend and do something with them. yes also i did buffed them <br>
<br>
post in here is not mean flame you, i would not do anything action like flame, i just explan that for you. stay in center as you say yes i am alway stay in a center for my friend and also some people hate me, but if you miss understanding you can ask me my english is bad but i think if you ask me anything i know i will answer you also.<br>
<br>
In this few day i got some people send me some very mean tells for me, but when i type /who the ( char name ). here is /anon mode. if you are going to say something that mean for other i hope you can show other the true face of you, why you needed to say something for other and need to use other char not use your main char for say that. you afraid anything of this i can not understand why some people action will like this. but i did listen for that some people send something for me. i did not put anyone in ignore because i need to listen for them.<br>
<br>
If you have anything want to say mean for me or nice for me is also welcome. if you are wanted to talk i am here i will talk with you when you have time. went you know and call my name pmr that is mean you are already my friend i will fix the matter for you. even you are just want to make me sad.<br>
<br>
I think i type too much agian. so sorry all. bite me if you want ..... softly...<br>

<br>
It can be really cool when you spend the time it requires to develop enough self worth to be able to put this type of high drama public love affair info aside (and out of public view).<br>
<br>
This means doing such things as putting aside all the passion involved with being sucked in to the &quot;well he treats me bad and acts like a moron - but I love him&quot;  phenomena...It makes me feel a little sad for you to see that. I am not sad for you because Thogg treats you with disrespect, but because you &quot;allow&quot; yourself to be treated that way.  <br>
<br>
Waking up and setting goals for yourself is key to making self worth happen. Examples could include: financial independence, education and career (e.g. paying your own bills)...until you have done it long enough to be able to know who &quot;you&quot; are. I don't know your circumstances in life...and why you have yourself in that position...but independence can &quot;always' be obtained and sometimes it just takes a great deal of work and creativity to overcome obstacles (e.g. poverty, dependent relatives, countries which require you to seek political asylum etc.) I will say it truly is that &quot;independence&quot; that makes you feel good enough about yourself to start making better choices in relationship partners....you can survive just a little longer single and be happy while you figure out what you really want from a relationship.<br>
<br>
Just set 1 goal for yourself...wake up and say dang I'm going to make xxxx happen today, this month or this year...no matter what it takes. Cultivate some independence do things that make you like &quot;you&quot; irregardless of what anyone else thinks.<br>
<br>
Mutual respecting relationships are enjoyable, these forum posts are not healthy (your's and Thoggs)<br>
<br>
Also, just my opinion &quot;real life&quot; men tend to be much more intimate, real, and are forced to face more consequences for their actions than virtual ones across a wire.....therefore can be more gratifying.<br>
<br>
All I keep seeing in all the historical posts between you and Thogg is a woman who hasn't developed herself enough to think she is worthy of a more private, respectful relationship. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 3/3/01 11:25:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucourtinae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Courtinae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/01 11:20:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Read if  you are my friend .</span><hr size=1> AS always, Well said Tat<br>

If you can't understand it, don't read it.  I can read it just fine.  Yes, it's not perfect but I can understand it.  She's trying to send a message out and this might be &quot;just another cry for sympathy&quot; but somewhere out there she cares for you too and this is probably why she's doing this. <br>
<br>
No I'm not kissing ass I don't even know her.  But too many people on this board make a comment without observing all sides of a situation.   <br>
<br>
Yes I have no room to talk because I hardly know what's going on with PMR.<br>
