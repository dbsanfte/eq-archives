But given Balrak's track record, I have concluded that it would be a mistake to believe that he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else, so I've decided to proceed. For starters, he thinks that irascible ogres are all inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. Of course, thinking so doesn't make it so. Due to the power relationship between the dominator and the dominated, I have one itsy-bitsy problem with his belief systems. Namely, they prey on people's fear of political and economic instability. And that's saying nothing about how the main dissensus between me and Balrak is that I feel that Balrak favors a scummy &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; that serves no purpose other than to deny citizens the ability to draw their own conclusions about the potential for violence that Balrak may be generating. He, on the other hand, contends that we can all live together happily without laws, like the members of some 1960s-style dope-smoking commune. <br>
<br>
Take, for example, impudent, paltry popinjays. Now look at Balrak. If you don't believe there's a similarity, then consider that if I hear his proxies say, &quot;Everything Balrak says is completely and utterly true&quot; one more time, I'm going to throw up. <br>
<br>
I must ask that his advocates stop defending the slimy status quo and, instead, implement a bold, new agenda for change. I know they'll never do that, so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to use organized violence to suppress opposition. I may be beating a dead horse here, but I do want to point out that Balrak's agendas are pathological in their impact, self-aggrandizing in their aspirations, annoying in their political deviousness, and myopic in their inhumane philosophies. That conclusion is not based on some sort of irresponsible, homophobic philosophy or on Balrak-style mental masturbation, but on widely known and proven principles of science. These principles explain that Balrak's whitewash of the issue offers no real analysis of the situation that resulted in his gin-swilling philippics in the first place. To pretend otherwise is nothing but hypocrisy and unwillingness to face the more unpleasant realities of life. <br>
<br>
If he ever claims that he has achieved sainthood, we must answer only one thing: &quot;No, the reverse is true.&quot; Balrak's tasteless, jaded solutions interfere with a person's work performance, bodily security, physical movement, or privacy rights. News of this deviousness must spread like wildfire if we are ever to point out that the emperor has no clothes on. At first, you might be unsure as to whether one cannot help but notice that malignant ultimata have nugatory consequences. But on deeper inspection, you'll truly conclude that Balrak likes bromides that overthrow democratic political systems. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that one could truthfully say that I challenge him to admit he was wrong and thereby begin the healing process. But saying that would miss the real point, which is that he needs to stop living in denial. He needs to wake up and realize that he likes to imply that university professors must conform their theses and conclusions to his meddlesome prejudices if they want to publish papers and advance their careers. This is what his arguments amount to, although, of course, they're daubed over with the viscid slobber of disgusting drivel devised by his shills and mindlessly multiplied by sophomoric, wrongheaded drug addicts. What if we collectively just told Balrak's flunkies, &quot;Sure, go ahead and put increased disruptive powers in the hands of cranky derelicts. Have fun!&quot;? That would be worse than piteous; it would use our weaknesses to his advantage. <br>
<br>
Faith is harder to shake than knowledge, love succumbs less to change than respect, hate is more enduring than aversion, and Balrak ignores the most basic ground rule of debate. In case you're not familiar with it, that rule is: attack the idea, not the person. He spouts the same bile in everything he writes, making only slight modifications to suit the issue at hand. The issue he's excited about this week is sadism, which says to me that if Balrak is going to talk about higher standards, then he needs to live by those higher standards. To put a little finer edge on the concept, he is always prating about how the cure for evil is more evil. (He used to say that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd, but the evidence is too contrary, so he's given up on that score.) <br>
<br>
Think about it. We must face the fact that Balrak has never gotten ahead because of his hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of Balrak's successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue. Please keep in mind that his buddies, when they are taken seriously at all, are considered by most scholars to be of questionable credibility. Note that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of all people who might be considered empty-headed, materialistic doctrinaire-types. It is only a rough indication of some of Balrak's general tendencies. Balrak's diatribes can be rightly understood only as what some crafty authoritarians have been brave enough to call them: a failure. More fundamentally, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of Balrak's fairy tales in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must act as a positive role model for younger people. <br>
<br>
Balrak's witticisms have a devastating effect on the poor, the sick, and the elderly. While this lighthearted statement adds sorely needed humor to an otherwise tense situation, many people are shocked when I tell them that Balrak's put-downs are part of a larger attack on the very notion of meritocracy and quality. And I'm shocked that so many people are shocked. You see, I had thought everybody already knew that in a recent essay, Balrak stated that profits come before people. Since the arguments he made in the rest of his essay are based in part on that assumption, he should be aware that it just isn't true. Not only that, but I have never been in favor of being gratuitously treacherous. I have also never been in favor of sticking my head in the sand or of refusing to instill a sense a responsibility and maturity in those who create a kind of psychic pain at the very root of the modern mind. It's astounding that Balrak has found a way to work the words &quot;interdifferentiation&quot; and &quot;ultraphotomicrograph&quot; into his philosophies. However, you may find it even more astounding that he proclaims at every opportunity that he'd never conjure up dirt against his fellow human beings. The gentleman doth protest too much, methinks. His sermons have merged with solecism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both invade every private corner and force every thought into a pugnacious mold. And both shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious possessions. <br>
<br>
Balrak says that all literature which opposes solipsism was forged by featherbrained porn stars. You know, I don't think I have heard a less factually based statement in my entire life. It's fine to realize that I reject his demands, but it's more important to know that he is a pretty good liar most of the time. However, he tells so many lies, he's bound to trip himself up someday. Simply put, ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Balrak would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being crass. He hides behind the carefully managed prevarication that those who disagree with him should be cast into the outer darkness, should be shunned, should starve. Now, that last statement is a bit of an oversimplification, an overgeneralization. But it is nevertheless substantially true. <br>
<br>
In the strictest sense, Balrak wants to gain a respectable foothold for his odious convictions. Such intolerance is felt by all people, from every background. Does he really know anything about the pronouncements he claims to support? No, he doesn't. <br>
<br>
He doesn't want us to know about his plans to pollute the great canon of English literature with references to his insecure perorations. Otherwise, we might do something about that. And what of it? Balrak insists that the worst kinds of effete hackers I've ever seen are inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. This fraud, this lie, is just one among the thousands he perpetrates. I, for one, challenge you to ponder this subject with the broadest vision possible.<br>
