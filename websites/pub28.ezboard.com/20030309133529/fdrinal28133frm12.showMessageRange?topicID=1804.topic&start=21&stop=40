The worst thing you can do is assume be glad to talk to you about why I left. Can't answer for anyone else butwill tell ya why I did. O and if you seem to care soo muchthis situation been wondering why no tell from ya?<br>
<br>
O well, maybe its just me forgetting how much you have grouped with us, guilded with us, struggled with us when we only had 10 peops in the guild. I must have forgot you know all about HCoN and you have so much good advice to give us from all your hard work in the guild.<br>

One of the cons was that some muckraker would feel the need to come here and air our business to the world.  Fine.  This was the hardest decision I have ever made in this game, and for you to insinuate that it was made because of greed is not only completely untrue, but it is insulting as well.  Nothing I have EVER done in my EQ tenure has been motivated by greed.  <br>
<br>
My decision to move on was motivated by the desire to do and see things in game that I personally felt a family/casual style guild like HCoN would not see for a long time, if ever.  This is not to say that HCoN's structure is bad, just that a few of us were beginning to outgrow it.  HCoN is a GREAT group of people, all of whom I have been proud to say have stretched the limits on what a smaller guild can accomplish.  I am proud of each and every member of HCoN and what they have helped the guild become. As the leaders, we very easily could have changed HCoN to be the type of guild we wanted it to be in the end.  We could have changed the rules and selectively recruited to get the guild to the point that we could start taking down anything we wanted at a moment's notice.  This we could have done, but we would have alienated 80% of the membership in doing so.  So what's better; changing the guild from what made it great and what most of the guild was happy with, or having the few that wanted change move on and seek thier own happiness?  People have said that we failed as leaders to move the guild in the direction we wanted.  Maybe so, but to me part of the responsibility of leadership is knowing when you become a detriment, and when its time to step down.  I felt it was the right time.  If I was wrong, thats something I'm going to have to live with.<br>
<br>
Sure, we could have given more warning, and worked better to ensure a smoother transfer of leadership, and for that I am sorry.  Every one of my former guildmates knows I still support them and will help them in ways I am not going to discuss here.  I have complete faith that those who chose to remain behind will do a superb job of picking up the reins and will continue to lead HCoN to greatness. <br>
<br>
The bottom line for me was that no matter what words the pixels are arranged into above my character's head, I still consider the friendships I have made in HCoN and with people in other guilds to be sacrosanct.  I would do anything for any last one of them, and they all know it.  Some of them are still upset with me, and that tears me up, but I hope they all know that I still consider then all friends, even if they do not consider me one anymore.<br>
<br>
This was alot more than I was going to post here,  but when i start rambling...  <br>
<br>
To sum up: <br>
<br>
To HCoN members.  You know what I have said, and you know why I chose what I chose.  I am sorry if it caused strife, but I know in my heart that you are all strong enough to pick up where we left off and continue on strong.  It was an unbeliveably painful decision to make over a game, and increasingly harder because we dissapointed friends.  Good luck friends, I am only a tell away if you need me.<br>
<br>
To everyone else:  M.Y.O.F.B.<br>

A guild that can kill Vindi regularly can move to the stage guilds like Unc and GotK are at now relatively easily-you underestimated yourself and the others, I think.<br>
<br>
Xanier, like Ray, I had the least problems with. I've talked to you in the past and I know you were frustrated at times. If you had left by yourself, I wouldn't have even mentioned it, as it was, you had the misfortune of being lumped in.<br>
<br>
Wexler...you did alot for the guild, but never seemed to accept the truth, which was: they did alot for you in return. Not many guilds would go out of their way to equip a pally in good enough gear to be able to MA most mobs, and not many pallies would have the skill to do so. Unfortunately, you seemed to let that go to your head and felt that you were better than the people who helped get you where you were. Always liked you as a person, and you're a damn fine player, I'm just glad I didn't have to deal with you directly as a guildie. Your ego could fill volumes. And to borrow from you, when you start paying for my net access and my EZSupporter fee, you can tell me what to post, until then, I'll keep happily bumping my post count.<br>
<br>
Fumarin-LOL-whatever.<br>
<br>
As for my involvement, you don't have to be a member of a guild to be affected by their actions. People you know and are close to can be affected by the actions of others and it can affect you as well because of that. And yes, these are my own opinions, formed from what I've seen and heard. What's the old saying? Don't like the heat, stay out of the kitchen? /em turns the oven back on.<br>
<br>
To the members of HCoN...don't worry, you guys are stronger than you realize and you can and will do some amazing things in this silly little game. If you ever need help with anything, send me a tell, if I can do so, I'll be there. <p><table border=1>

Not everyone is driven by the virtual onwership of zeros and ones that you are.  For the record, and I know there are people from UC here reading, I couldn't care less if I ever receive another piece of loot in this game.  I have done what I have done to be able to see and participate in the relatively few challanges left in this game.  Loot is secondary.  Scratch that,  loot is not even secondary or tertiary.  Loot is a means to an end.  In HCoN, I have always been one to espouse the fact that loot on guild raids should go to the people for whom it would make the guild more powerful.  Some don't see it that way, others do.  If I become a member, and UC someday decides that Some_relatively_uber_drop_001 should go to me because that makes the most sense to the betterment of the guild, than so be it.  If they don't, Im not going to lose sleep over it,<br>
<br>
Higar, I have no doubt that HCoN has very few limits when they decide to gather together for a common purpose.   I have personally been amazed at some of the things we have done.  However, the constant exploration of new higher-level content and encounters requires time, numbers, effort, motivation, sacrifice and practice.  HCoN has exhibited every one of those traits, but very rarely at the same time. This is not a fault, but a natural result of a generally open, friendly casual guild.  Your obervation that "when we get in the mood, shit dies" (which, by the way as of last week graces all of HCoN's web pages and message boards typed in an elvish font in the top banner) is exactly descriptive of HCoN.  Some of us were just in the mood more than others, or at different times than most others.   <p><center>

Higar - Always someone to stick up for a friend, and is always going to back his people ... nothing anyone says or does or even sugests is going to change that.  I know for a fact becuase I am the same fucking way ... yea it gets us into trouble, but so be it ... if it is something you beleive in, then it is something worth fighting for.<br>
<br>
HNoC peeps, namely Ray .. cause I dun really know any of the rest of you ..<br>
<br>
I talked to you a few times in game, never really got to know you but know you been level headed and a fair person every time I have come across you in game.  While I agree with most of the things you have said, the 1 I am afraid I am gonna have to call you on is loot ... Now I got loot, get prolly more then my share at times, but I put in the work.  Plain and simple there is no other reason in EQ to play then loot ... period.  Now people are gonna flock to this, a CiH player talking bout loot ( let the flames fly), others are going to say they are here cause they play for their friends and dun care bout loot .. etc etc etc.  Bullshit .. everyone wants to get some item in game, everyone wants to get more hp / mana, everyone wants to see the new effects on items, better haste, weapons .. all that shit.  You say you wanna see the high end game .. www.fohguild.com .. www.afterlifeguild.com ... www.tritonguild.com ... all the screen shots and loot photo's ya could ever want of the highend game bro.  Keep it reall and stay honest .. YES you may not care totally bout getting loot, but the drive is there ... if it wasn't why would you have epic, or anything else that takes more then 1 person to get?  Not flaming you .. jus sayin ya need to stay honest and keep that cool head ya got, it works for ya ..<br>
<br>
/shrug jus my 2 cents, honestly could give a shit bout what people go to what guild .. tags never have or will determine who is and isn't someone I call a friend <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Let me say that differently, after re-reading it ...<br>
<br>
The main driving force behind EQ is loot, the reason for logging in may be to see a friend or what not, but the main reason we all continue to play, plain and simple ... is and as long as EQ remains the way it is, will always be .. loot <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wex5>Wex5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S & M</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/23/02 12:14:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1804.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Stuff like this is a shame</span><hr size=1> Higar man you have absolutely no clue do you?<br>
<br>
You claim HCoN overequiped me?! have you looked at my magelo? Other than a vindi BP can you name one other item the guild got for me?  I'm in full SS because I busted my ass in hot on open raids and led open hot raids when the majority of the guild either wasnt interested in going or lacked substantial levels to attend.  On the few guild hot raids that i did get my gear, I was subject to the same loot rules as everyone else, random number generator.  The people that helped me get the majority of my equipment all followed me.  If for some reason HCoN decided I should delete that friggin BP, I'd do it.<br>
<br>
This game is about loot, anyone who says its not is full of shit.  If I wanted to hang out with people i'd go to a bar.  Don't get me wrong, I care a great deal about the people i've met and consider my friends, but i dont log into a chatroom every night, i play a game, a game that has goals, i'd like to reach those goals.<br>
<br>
Am I cocky?? Your god damn right I am.  I'm cocky in game and I'm cocky in RL.  You can ask anyone that knows me.  Why is my ego so big? Well in RL, its none of your damn business.  In this game its because I pride myself on being able to do things that other people are too frightened or incompetant to do.  Sue me, I like a fucking challenge.<br>
<br>
The people that left with me make me a better player, they are all great people and it really bugs the hell out of me to see you flaming them.<br>
