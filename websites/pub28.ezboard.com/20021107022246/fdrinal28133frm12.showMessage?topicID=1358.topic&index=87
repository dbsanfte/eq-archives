in fact, I haven't argued with it because I didn't see how on earth rewarding the people that worked hardest - would be either greed nor unfair. I know it's like this in CT, but in Vice you don't get penalized for having good equipment. People with good equipment is the ones that does most work, why would they be put down ? I belive that everyone in a guild should be equal, and I feel sorry for the people you penalize for their equipment and dedication.<br>

<br>
hard for me to tell, it was decided before I took over vice / before I was officer. None of our current officers are best suited in any way, they have gotten same treatement as any other member....the way it should be.<br>
What I do know for sure - is that there have *NEVER* been any arguement nor discussion about loot in vice. It's so comfortable I'll never trade it out. I know you have had that, and you've lost some good people over it too. Last person we lost for loot, was 2 days before we started the system - and that was a cleric that left because she didn't get dains head.<br>

We were buffed when we arrived, while you had 15-20 people in WL. They buffed as well ? As people can tell, you don't deny my logs, and hence proving that you were not even interested in even talking about it. Wereof we sat there - ready to pull, but I refused them to pull tormax since i were talking to you, so they were forced to do nothing. I won't pull a mob while talking to others, I never did. It was a slap in the face when you guys pulled it anyway, the 20 people did die to tormax, and assisting tormax as he passed - I got one of your guys on target. Doesn't matter how you put it, you did train us intentionally. But we don't whine about it, we just use it as ammo when its called for as in moments like this .<br>

Azureblade doesn't deny it.  The logs don't lie, and if he DID deny it, it would show me what kind of person he really is. I don't need to lie and I don't see why AB should need to, I rather put things in my point of view and see where it takes me. I log everything, because Im a real mess RL. I need to look back on things and see how things happened. In this case I just took out a few lines of officerchat.<br>

<br>
I don't really understand lots of the things in this last post of yours, most seem to be attacking arguments you misunderstood.  As I said before, point-based loot systems encourage greed because a point system tells people to attend raids for personal gain in the form of points, instead of attending raids for fun and to watch guildees progress.<br>

And YES I still wont help Vice people due to the fact 1 person reflects there guild... hold those people accountable for there actions. People that deguild themselves all the time... people looting loot thats not there own kill... people telling others that they felt like training other people... people that crap talk there own guild on these boards are still in your guild ! now come on I know we all have asses in our guilds but to allow these people to continue to do this crap over and over and over and over and over again is so stupid its funny and retarded at the same time.<br>
YOU want to be respected as a guild? then show some action toward these people or do you need the classes so bad you cant afford to lose them?<br>

As for Birckan...he was booted from guild for cussing an officer. He deserved every bit of what he got imho. I dont know who pissed in his cheerios, but they have permanently stained his bowl it seems, he has been a total asshole for about the past 2 weeks. If you Play, Talk, Act like an asshole, dont get pissed when someone calls you an asshole.<br>

Great advice Kaleigh!!! However, what do you do when you're minding your own business in say, I don't know, Sleepers Tomb when you pull MotG and Pipe and some rangers come in, manaburn and use offensive discs and killsteal your mob? Should we leave zone immediately to get away from Vice? Will that solve the problem?<br>
<br>
How bout when you show up to kill a mob and Vice comes in and sits in the pull path so you can't pull it while they gather more people? Should we just leave to get away from Vice then, too? <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>

Other than that i dont know what to tell you hon. *sigh* Most of the bigger problems that people have with Vice, im not around when they happen.<br>
<br>
Birckan, You have alot of growing up to do. If everyone yelled and screamed EVERY SINGLE TIME something wasnt done right....then no one would be in a guild. If an officer is doing something you dont like, GC IS NOT THE PLACE TO BITCH ABOUT IT. Talk to officers in private. YOU HAVE ABSOLUTLY NO RIGHT TO BERATE AN OFFICER IN GC. You told an officer &quot;Fuck You&quot; when he gave you an order. I am glad they booted your ass for it. Vice is better off without people with that kind of attitude. <p><HTML><P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="848BC8"><B><I>

Reading the posts made by the people in vice sickens me, you're not innocents, you don't have goddam halos over your head, sometimes you fuck up, everyone does, so stop acting like you've never done anything wrong and that everything that happens is everyone elses fault. Also, as soon as people lose their officership in vice (which happens way more often than it should), or everytime someone is booted from vice, the whole entire guild acts like they never even knew that person, and then they start flaming them on these open boards to boot, shows how much of a &quot;family&quot; vice really is. Vice was the first real guild and only real guild I've ever been in, and when it was first started it was the most fun I've ever had in EQ. Also, it was a powerful guild even though it was small and people played the game to enjoy each other's company and to have fun, and above all else vice was a respectable guild. There were no flames about vice, there was no personal vendettas against vice, no one defended vice cuz no one ever had to. There is a simple reason for that, we weren't in a pissing contest with every other guild on drinal, we didn't kill mobs because we wanted to prove we were better than someone else, and when we did kill them we didn't taunt other guild about how we killed a mob with 30 that they had trouble with with 50, and do you know why? Because we didn't give a shit about other guilds, our motivation was purely recreational, that's what this game is supposed to be. Sorry to badmouth you guys because a lot of my very good friends are in vice, but you need to stop worrying about other guilds and straighten the shit out in your own guild, I wasn't gonna stick around be a part of vice driving itself into the ground. I left because I couldn't do any good for vice anymore because I was too fed up with fighting and arguing with everyone rather than just playing the game and having fun. Vice was a stronger guild in february with only 20 members than it is now with 120 members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udreamriderrh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DreamriderRH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/02 7:53:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1358.topic&index=116>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: guys, wake up</span><hr size=1> Why the hell am I thoggs lubba? please change that  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usulinecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suli necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Love God</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/02 8:15:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1358.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: guys, wake up</span><hr size=1> Hey you know what you did to earn that title.

<br>
Yea, I have just gained information about your attempt in a point system. Lemme just put it like this, you have no idea how we do it - and you weren't even close to do so. At least - you are aware on the fact that its a HUGE amount of work, since when you were left with the system (since the first officer said &quot;too much work&quot; - you felt that it wasn't worth the effort. That doesn't mean it doesn't work or is based on greed, it means you did it the wrong way.<br>
 Speaking about systems that doesn't work, I keep getting tells about an officer in CT that won 2..*TWO* dain heads in officer decitions - before almost everyone else had the remote chance to get as much as one. Is this a system that is based on greed from officers or is it equal for all ? Or even more important, is this true or false. I would like to see an answer for this pls. I'm getting a MAD amount of tells in this about stuff that happened in CT, so please keep going =)<br>

You wont find it written by me anywhere. We had one person that did it and he no longer play EQ. However... I'm happy that someone takes pride in their guild, I hope someone feel pride in your guild some time soon.<br>

I was there for Lady N...after the resists were revamped it was almost impossible to resist her AE. Going in to fight her and not being ready for that would kill anyone. <br>
[/qoute]<br>
<br>
omg, you wiped again ?<br>
I have yet to resist her AE ever, neither on Kutch OR Svarte. There should be no need to resist it, its a very weak AE that spins you a little.<br>
<br>
[qoute]<br>
Kutch you must've cranked up the Bjork playing in the background when I mentioned you guys still have ninjalooting newbs in your guild. Where's your answer for that? <br>
[/qoute]<br>
1) I don't listen to bjork shit.<br>
2) I'm a strong beliver in that everyone should get a second chance. I call it straightening up people, and it has worked wonderfully so far.<br>

No rannier... YOU are in an asshole guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ( but you can only tell if you are a non CiH member )<br>
<br>
[qoute]<br>
Are you serious! I told Kaldrani to fuck off everyday. I must have told Morb to fuck off a million times. You kick Birckan because he cussed at an officer. ROFL!<br>
[/qoute]<br>
<br>
Birk is a good and skilled guy, he has done a lot for vice and even tho his mouth speaks bad words sometimes, it makes him no less skilled and dedicated. I would take him back any day if he wanted to fix that single part. This is a thread about you guys having questions about vice, leave birk alone.<br>
<br>
And yea, I belive a guild gotta have a comfortable guildchat. It's worth removing a few people to enjoy your time online. Officers shouldn't be questionned in guildchat, at least not in vice where officers don't have ab's advantages. We are equal to a member, except we work harder.... so least we can as is to be treated nice by our members. And dreamrider... good luck on your journey ( thx spires, I always said that word wrong ), hope you find a guild that takes you in.<br>
<br>
And no, I didn't start this stupid thread. I will answer whatever question asked, by anyone. We all share server, and we will have to deal with that. I always thought I was an honest person that made things easier for both my guild and other guilds when we bump into each other. I always try to solve problems in a civil and mature manner, this is how I make a difference. I will, however, try to prove people wrong if they complain about something they do just fine themselves. Noone is any better than the next, but at least I'm willing to admit it, and I try to improve. But neither CiH nor CT/WL seem to be very interested when I talk to them, and if we treat guilds like they treat us - we get hanged. Maybe your impression of vice is wrong ? Maybe it's twisted by the fact that we take up another slot in the server - and it will mean that you loose a silly mob now and then ?<br>
<br>
Everyone fails a mob. <br>
Everyone swears at eachother. <br>
Everyone hates in some way, the other guilds.<br>
Everyone would like to kill the mob guild X just killed.<br>
...Everyone shares the server, vice ain't a family, Drinal *is*. You don't have problems with Vice, you have problems with Drinal.<br>
