The leveling a char to 50 and probably winding up dateless doesn't apply to only women, my friend. If a guy has enough time to level a char post 50 he's not likely spending a whole lot of time with his girlfriend dontcha think? I lived with a b/f (programmer/gamer) for two years trust me after staring at the back of their head long enough you tend to find something better to do...such as pack up and leave:) <br>
<br>
Some people &quot;want&quot; to be dateless for a while *cough*, let's hope anyone with some sense doesn't spend that much time behind the CPU and expect otherwise.<br>
<br>
Hence the recommendation to go out and try something different - e.g. 24 hour fitness.  The artist formally known as Tat suddenly remembered that after deletion..it does wonders for the mind/body/spirit;-) I had to buy a personal trainer to get me back in to the groove again I had grown so habitual about EQ.<br>
<br>
I used to cycle in 170 mile bike rides and was once a professional ballet dancer....I kind of shock myself that I spent that much time in sitting on my rump in this silly game. I am sure everyone has their reasons...and it would be &quot;rare&quot; if not hypocritical for anyone to state it is healthy for themselves or their relationship to spend 20+ hours here a week (unless your partner is doing it to). This is not a female thing - it is a person thing.<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure if one was wanting serious involvement with a person playing EQ all the time wouldn't be the right route to go. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 4/3/01 7:31:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzandalay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zandalay</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#939393>(4/3/01 8:07:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   /FLAME US ALL</span><hr size=1> The Monogamy Myth is the belief that monogamy is the norm in our society and that it is supported by society as a whole. The effect of believing that most relationships are monogamous is that if an affair happens, it's seen strictly as a personal failure of the people involved. This leads to personal blame, personal shame, wounded pride, and almost universal feelings of devastation. <br>
<br>
The reality is that monogamy is not the norm, not by today's standards, anyway.;) Conservative estimates are that 60 PERCENT of MEN and 40 PERCENT OF WOMEN will have an extramarital affair. These figures are even more significant when we consider the total number of marriages involved, since it's unlikely that all the men and women having affairs happen to be married to each other. If even HALF of the women having affairs (or 20 percent) are married to men not included in the 60 percent having affairs, then at least one partner will have an affair in approximately 80 PERCENT OF ALL RELATIONSHIPS. With this many relatioships affected, it's unreasonable to think affairs are due only to the failures and shortcomings of individual MEN OR WOMEN. <br>
<br>
Society as a whole is supportive of monogamy and of people's efforts to remain monogamous, leading people to expect to have a monogamous relationship. This reinforces the idea of personal failure for those people who fail to achieve monogamy. <br>
<br>
In reality, while society gives lip service to monogamy, there are significant societal factors that actually support and encourage affairs!! This is not to say that all the blame should be placed on society. That would be just as shortsighted as blaming only the particular people involved. <br>
<br>
The best hope for monogamy lies in rejecting the idea that a couple can assume monogamy without discussing the issue, or that they can assure monogamy by making threats as to what they would do if it happened. Either of these paths creates a cycle of dishonesty. In either case, people don't feel free to admit being attracted to someone else. If they don't admit these attractions, then they won't admit being tempted. And if they don't admit being tempted, then they certainly won't admit it if and when they finally act on the attraction. The effect on the relationship is to cause it to be filled with jealousy and suspicion, as well as making it less likely that it will be monogamous. <br>
<br>
The hope for monogamy lies in making a conscious choice that specifically involves a commitment to honesty. In making this choice, both partners realize that attractions to others are likely, indeed inevitable, no matter how much they love each other. So they engage in ongoing honest communication about the reality of the temptations and how to avoid the consequences of acting on those temptations. The effect on the relationship is to create a sense of closeness and a knowledge of each other that replaces suspicion with trust, making it more likely that it will be monogamous. <br>
<br>
Monogamy is something most people say they believe in and want for themselves. Every survey ever done on this question shows a high percentage of people think monogamy is important to marriage and that affairs are wrong. But a belief in monogamy as an ideal doesn't prevent large numbers of people from having extramarital affairs. We need to make a commitment to face the reality of affairs and address the issue in a more responsible way, both individually and as a society. <br>
<br>
This means challenging many of our most cherished beliefs about monogamy and affairs. It will be hard to question some of our old assumptions—and even harder to give them up. Our attitudes about monogamy and affairs are so ingrained that we find it difficult to consider anything that deviates from those beliefs. But it's essential if we're to gain understanding and perspective about this very emotional issue. <br>

I don't cheat in a relationship, have never cheated in a relationship, will never cheat in a relationship, nor do I feel it's justified by your little essay there.  <br>

You may think it's ok to cheat on someone because 'that's what you're supposed to do', but not me. <br>

<br>
I happen to believe that cheating is 99.9 percent of the time a very bad idea and most times serves to make an already bad situation worse.<br>
<br>
I also believe people cheat for different reasons, some being internal issues and some being external.<br>
<br>
But also disturbing  to me is that some people auto assume she is a &quot;pig&quot; on the circumstances described in three sentences on a message board.  <br>
<br>
There could be many, many other issues in the relationship that we know nothing of to cause this girl to stumble.<br>
<br>
I'm not excusing or condoning.  I don't think the information given was revealing enough for any of us to make judgements.  <br>
<br>
I also don't think bashing her is going to make Boofy feel in the least bit better or make the situation easier for him in anyway.<br>
<br>
He said he is hurting so obviously he does care.  She was honest and told him the truth.  Why?  Maybe she made a mistake and realized it...maybe they can work it out?  Maybe it's not to late....How do we know?<br>
<br>
The essay was statistics for the /Flame Women when in fact if you want to flame cheaters...MEN are in the lead. :)<br>

You do not know what the future has to offer to you. As I like to create situations to clarify things, listen to this.<br>
<br>
We assume that you are 23 years old and student at some college. In 2 years you are finsihed with your studies and get a job to earn some money. You have a lovely girlfriend who you know since you are 21. One day you become a manager and have to go to congress in New York, while your girlfriend or maybe wife is at home in Chicago. In the meantime you are 35 years old and still love your wife (although studies already pointed out that &quot;love&quot; ends after 7 years and the relationship is kept together because of the daily routine - but that should not matter here). On this congress you meet that 28 year old good looking woman and you start a discussion with her. You enjoy the conversation and after the end of the congress that day you have a couple of drinks with that person in a bar nearby the congress center. <br>
At the end of the evening you feel that a certain desire develops inside you but you do not follow this desire because of your wife and how it would not be right to have a one-night-stand with that person in front of you. BUT WAIT!<br>
Exactloy at this point you already cheated your wife, because cheating starts in your head and not with the action itself.<br>
<br>
The situation above is pretty common imo, just exchange the situations. Who of us can say that we never had such a desire? I think that is the minority. So, when you say, that you would never cheat your GF, think twice about it cause that is a pretty dangerous thing to say. Better be a &quot;mind cheater&quot; than a &quot;mind cheater&quot; AND a liar! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#939393>(4/4/01 3:18:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> I think Senial is supposed to be senile.
