For the sake of actually discussing try putting your personal experiences aside..really aside..and just know this post isn't about any one in general. We know the more predominant arguments etc. but I'd like some &quot;real&quot; open perspective on how people think...without fear of being bashed for your response based upon some personal experience. <br>
<br>
So the ground rules are: (although I am sure &quot;someone&quot; will break them) try to remove yourself from your own personal experiences and don't attack others for your personal experiences with them when posting. <br>
<br>
Person in a guild percieves  something bad happened to them in game, by a singular player or group of other players in another guild e.g. a plane was taken from them when they were planning, someone ks'd them, someone stole from them etc.. They notify guild in guildchat or through forum - be wary of guild xxxxx (sometimes in more colorful terms).<br>

They notify other players in game while grouped or in a public forum be wary of guild xxxx (sometimes in more colorful terms).<br>
<br>
When this happens, how do you choose to view this:<br>
<br>
A) Well it really isn't all bad. If this didn't happen, competition wouldn't exist, and we need competition to keep the game active.<br>
B) I believe I need to stand behind them and show them support, particularly if it is a friend or guildmate.<br>
C) I might not like it, but I won't say anything, I'll just ignore them.<br>
D) I might not like it, but I won't say anything, but it annoys me.<br>
E) I might not like it, and I'm going to say so because I think it is important to express an opinion upon. We need to try to be more reasonable with other guilds.<br>
F) Why doesn't our server just have formal guild wars over these incidents?<br>
G) Fill in the blank with your own thoughts.<br>

<br>
When I was a n00b &lt;--haha had to use that term, I had a negative experience and I went as far, to generally avoid grouping with a guild because of it. Turns out as I grew up I found there were good people in that guild and I was way out of line, it was definately an individual thing not a guild thing. <br>
<br>
I will confess that I tend to go with E, because well I'm apt to express an opinion on anything albiet a flexible opinion which can be amended. I don't think it is productive to hate an entire other guild...some of the reasons are:<br>
<br>
I think there are healthier ways to compete<br>
<br>
I have met at least 1 good person and 1 person who maybe rubs me the wrong way in each guild so it isn't &quot;guild culture&quot; it's people culture.<br>
<br>
Problems are usually individually based not guild based with me, but when that individual is the &quot;leader' of a guild I run in to some rationalization problems.<br>
<br>
I come here for escapism  - if I want to compete I'll spend that energy at work where I will be compensated for it in my paycheck; however, I'll contradict myself and say that I am competetive by nature, and may like to see at least a little friction...but not friction of this type. <br>
<br>
I think I have more to say here but I'm late for work...more later. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 3/8/01 5:23:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boto</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/01 6:16:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion Topic - II</span><hr size=1> G. None of the above<br>
<br>
IMO a guild can rarely be assigned a persona, there are always diverse personalities in every guild.  I have been on the listening and informing side of these incidents but always try to clarify the individuals involved and base opinions solely on the individual perpetraters and/or those that directly supported their behaviour.<br>
<br>
Resorting to a personal experience (sorry).  The velious gate spell scam (I wont mention the guild as their are many good folks in it).  I kept a list of those who scammed and those who defended the action, most but not all from the same guild as the scammers.  I have opinions of those folks that will likely never change, but often help other members of the same guild.  Judging an entire guild by the actions of a select number of that group smacks of stereotyping and even bigotry.<br>
<br>
Certainly an exception to this would be if the offending behaviour is part of the guilds charter, but that is very rare (in my experience).<br>

<br>
Just for clarification I did say there is probably 1 person who rubbed me the wrong way and one person who rubbed me the right way (purrr) in every guild....doesn't mean though that I harbor resentment against them or their guild..but that is a lead in to another discussion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubargeroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bargeroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/01 7:55:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion Topic - II</span><hr size=1> G: I would ask for specifics of the incident or multiple incidents in some cases. After hearing my guild mates/friends side of the story, I would make my own judgement. It would be  based in part on their side of the story and in part on my personal knowledge of the accused. <br>
<br>
If I knew that action to be out of character for the alleged perpetrator I may tell my guildmate/friend to chill out and give them another chance. I would probably ask the alleged perpetrator their side of the story. <br>
<br>
If the allegation I heard sounded to be in character for the said individual/group. Id go forth as if it were true until proven differently.<br>
<br>
So the question now is what do you do about it? Personally I avoid the said bastards in question. The world is big enough to make it easy to do so. Now if I could kill said thieves, scoundrels, cheats, and Bullys in a PvP environment. I would round up a posse and seek swift justice.<br>
<br>
I think a solution such as that would make the game a lot more interesting, and fun. <br>

Meaning if xxx guild had 3 people who did you wrong and you believe this...xxx guild is one you wouldn't group with again? Or might wage war with?<br>
<br>
Personally, my opinion as of late, is that people who hate an &quot;entire guild&quot; are squackers. Squack , squack, squack. I even think they just like the whole act of &quot;Squack&quot; rather than really having any meat behind their incidents. But I reflect and remember that above listed noob experience and remember how it can happen. Sometimes though I think to myself...&quot;you know if you want to squack that much why not take the whole thing a step further and have guildwars?&quot; Now that could be interesting to watch LOL<br>
<br>
Some appear to be suspended in this pergatory of just griping - but not really doing anything about it- so I say lets make it really interesting...do more than squack and go out and battle. Either that or just learn to deal...<br>
<br>
Mind you that is just a snapshot of a current opinion ...I don't really dislike anyone for it...just being candid. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 3/8/01 8:27:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/01 8:06:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion Topic - II</span><hr size=1> usually supply moral support ('kick their ass!!') in guildchat while they deal with the incident themselves.<br>

I feel if you have a bad experience with a person or persons of one particular guild, you <br>
1. Speak to your guild and friends about the guild in question. Get their input as to their <br>
experiences and see if others have had bad experiences<br>
2. Speak to other members of that guild, particullary officers of that guild. How is a guild<br>
supposed to know it has problem players if noone ever informs them of the problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every guild is going to have bad seeds.<br>
<br>
Its how the guild deals with these bad seeds that people need to take note of.<br>
<br>
Should the guild disband any player any time someone complains about them - No.<br>
Should the guild disband any player if that player is repeatdly being complained about - Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guilds are funny things. They are like cliques in high school. Your clique is the coolest with <br>
the coolest people and every other clique is crap. Sure you might like a person or two in <br>
another clique, but overall the other cliques are weak and just arent as good as your <br>
clique.  The jocks thought the geeks were pussys. The geeks thought the stoners were <br>
assholes, the stoners thought the popular girls were bitches, the popular girls thought<br>
the band people were weird, and so on. <br>
<br>
Next time you log into high school, errr EQ, remember which clique you are in..<br>

The whole guild isn't bad if there's a bad apple or two, unless they refuse to deal with them.

<br>
Then extra credit for actually cooperating with other guilds, assisting other guilds or individuals and so on.<br>

I tend to find that most arguments I see in EQ tend to have two sides and reality was somewhere between both. People assuming they new what some one else was thinking and flipping off at the handle.  It mostly with the low level players where people are perpetual jerks.  90% of high levelers must group to survive.  So they butter at least half their bread.  <br>
<br>
So I stand on gaurd with strangers any time I'm camping something important no matter who it is.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessage?topicID=1357.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessage?topicID=1372.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=1369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1369.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1369.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
