No one exploited, I&quot;m not a hacker, I was actually a noob who just got the spell charm and learned how to use it like most enchanters who go to highkeep. (yes they still do today charm orcs in highkeep Ceenedra go stand there and be the charm police and hassle them all for a year and a half). You were pissed I took it to public forum. Well the truth is I had to take it somewhere because I thought I should contact Sony customer service, and I wasn't sure after that night if you had scarred my record or not with your PMS attack over the charmed orc. Get over it freak!!! Talk about karma man your karma would scare me you are  psycho.<br>
<br>
These are your quotes:<br>
<br>
RE: Joining my first guild &quot;And one of the reasons for doing so was to try to resolve the issues between us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The bottom line is you got caught by the guides exploiting the use of a spell (charm) in order to take a mob that you did not attack first and for the purpose of denying others the right to kill that mob&quot;<br>
<br>
n00bs fight over fire beetles daily and get in to shouting matches about it - give them a fucking &quot;hard or soft warn - whatever your former aol board moderator lingo you want to use is&quot; then move the fuck on they aren't posting about it in a web board &quot;admittedly&quot; a year and a half later. Go away freak! <br>
<br>
It was the Sony board where when I read to look for customer service after you had PMS attack in game and petitioned me. It looked like the right place to write a letter to them. Damn right I wouldn't have taken it to public forum if I thought I had other avenues the response from eqcs@sony.com (whom I sent it to at the same time) was much much better. You have been stalking me for a year and a half go away please. <br>
<br>
I must confess you still scare me. You are very psycho. I am sorry I don't know how one person can still be so freaky over an orc, making shit up clearly still mad since Jan 2000 that is your problem Cee please go get your head checked and leave me alone<br>
<br>
No one joins the guild of someone they have been harassing to &quot;resolve the issues between us&quot;. WTF! You are a freak! Hmm lets see Meneldil bugs the living shit out of me in here let me go sucker someone in to letting me join his guild so I can resolve the issues with him? Please go away psycho!!! <br>
<br>
<br>
You may want to go back to the sucker who let you in and give him that reason for joining too!!! because we know what bullshit story you made up for him. You left after I quit to get away from you and I am only thankful I ran in to my next guild where I was made an officer and bascially as a result was able to keep you from following me further. I took the next server move out of there because for christs sake you are a freak and would have kept up with this daily there. I even took a good 6 months off of playing here entirely. When I came back no one even knew who the fuck I was! Except for Ceen - Ceen Ceen the bitch who is mad about an orc I charmed in Jan 2000. Move on psycho. <br>
<br>
My group was very pro-charming the orc because they were very tired of you bitching at them before I even arrived. We all came to agreement that I would announce the next orc to be charmed so a) they would hit the right orc and b) you couldn't have a cow because you weren't warned. I &quot;shouted&quot; &quot;Charming an orc Berzerker&quot; because you were bitching at my group so much we wanted to make you aware the next one would be charmed so you wouldn't think we were &quot;taking it from beneath you&quot;. Get over the details - get over the incident - good lord get over yourself and obsess over someone else please. n00bies shout in east commons too they aren't stalked for 2 decades over it, they learn and grow. Your retailiation was to come and ks' us w/ your level 50 anyway some fucking adult you are.<br>
<br>
Like you said and I have said now in two posts &quot;I quit GBC&quot;. No one was punted from &quot;any guild&quot; like you have stated in your prior letter. I left GBC (/guildremove self) to get the fuck away from you because you are freaky obsessed with Verant legislation over a n00b who was using charm. <br>
<br>
I joined another guild whom didn't punt me either I &quot;left them&quot; (/guildremove self) due to a multitude of reasons one has to do with the fact that I never wanted to be an officer in the first place because all of the responsibility &amp; time it was going to take and  sure enough  all responsibility  was being thrown at me anyway while others took credit for all of the work. I offered for them to keep their stupid home page on &quot;my web environment&quot; 350 in hosting and 70 in domain (which was agreed to be paid in the first place and never paid). They were more than welcome to have their web page which I built for the cost it would incur.<br>
<br>
WTF this is any of your business I don't know because again it was a &quot;year&quot; later, it is clear that you spoke to the wrong person when you were STILL STALKING ME though who didn't have &quot;all&quot; the info. No punting hon just you and your imagination and whatever partial bits of info you can gather because you are inquiring about me like some psychopath a year later when all I wanted to do was stay away from you because you have clearly some issues. You weren't allowed in that guild, I made sure you couldn't keep following me.<br>
<br>
Yes when bringing out the logs please bring up the 10 page fucking legal deposition you sent to GBC while I was on a business trip Good Lord you are a freak!!!! It is May 30'th year 2001 please Ceen go dig up your logs of how I charmed your fucking orc Jan 2000 and cry over it.<br>
<br>
Although I don't beleive it it wouldn't surprise me if you were still searching the web and stalking me from Jan 2000 incident because you are one sick puppy.<br>
<br>
BTW &quot;because I seen&quot;  isn't proper English and it annoys the crap out of me almost as much as you do.<br>
<br>
Oh please Ceen do show how I lied and I really fucking charmed your orc &quot;intentionally' rather than &quot;unintentionally&quot; a year an a half ago. You are a fruitcake it will keep along with the theme. Bring out a 10 page legal deposition on how I made a forum posting about &quot;you&quot; - I wasn't writing to you, or the community,  I was writing to address eqcs@sony.com to make sure you weren't going to get me banned from your chronic schizophrenia over the fact that I charmed an orc in highkeep.<br>
<br>
What I think I shall do if you choose to continue being a psycho bitch a year and a half by posting in here is to  make this your servers issue too. Consider yourself warned. You see I have no stakes in this game now - you do and apparantly I have to resort to idle threats to get you off my back. I deleted char four months ago. I am sick of you following me for a year and a half and I will make it broadly known. STFU and go away psycho woman.<br>

What a reason to join.. sounds like you were trying to harass if you ask me. But I stopped reading after that. Your posts are becoming obnoxious and filling up my screen. Send her an email. Tatianae has enough problems with Drinal people, she doesn't need your baggage as well. Whatw ill it accomplish if you go through all your nerdy logs of stalking a nd cybersex to bring up where Tatianae said a few cuss words and ks'd a lowbie mob? Nothing.. just piss more people off.

She ran away from her reputation on Mith Marr to Drinal. You would think she would have the sense to shut up for a change and be nice to people.  She obviously hasn't.  <br>
<br>
FYI, the stupid charming incident in HH was long forgotten that very same night it happened as soon as I logged.  What I haven't forgotten is how Tat maliciously harrassed me on the message boards and spread rumors in the game for months after that, and never once attempted to make any efforts to resolve it.  She preferred to keep up the harassment of me instead of putting it behind her.  So, I took actions to resolve once and for all.  And it was.<br>
<br>
Now, when I found these boards and seen what she has done here, I laughed my ass off and commented on THAT.  No one deserves it more than she does as far as I am concerned.  Now, go back and look and see who brought the whole old HH charm incident up here on your boards to begin with.  It wasn't me.  Tat brought it up. Now ask yourself why.  Who hasn't gotten over it?  If she didn't want to go thru the hassle of that again, she should have left it alone.  She opened herself up for flames the moment she opened her mouth about it.  Tuff cookies.  You can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen. I've said it time and time again Tat just doesn't know when to shut her mouth.<br>
<br>
Sticking up for Tat isn't gonna help you.  She is not the innocent person she likes people to believe.  I know her tricks and that is one of the many....tell a &quot;poor me I was victimized story&quot; to gain sympathy while pointing fingers at those she would like you all to believe did her wrong.  Talk about pathetic and what is worse, she honestly believes her side of her stories to be the gospel truth.  Now that is pure delusional.  The more someone confronts her, the bigger the story becomes and the more folks attack her the wilder her stories become.  Stalking?  That's paranoia.<br>
<br>
I fail to see if she was oh so innocent, why would her troubles be following her around to many completely different folks who probably never heard of her before on Drinal?  No one just looked at her being so innocent and harmless and said oooh lets pick on Tat and started to harass her.  <br>
<br>
Get a grip and wake up and smell the garbage.  She is pathetic, delusional, and paranoid.  If you can't see it, you deserve each other.<br>

No Ceenedra I ran away from &quot;you&quot; who were so focused on &quot;reputation on mith marr&quot; that was your only ammo to find ways to destroy my reputation. I never gave a fuck about my reputation - I did care about the fact that you wouldn't &quot;go away&quot;. If you piss off Ceenedra her whole goal in life is to follow you around and make sure she can &quot;destroy your reputation&quot; for charming a god damned orc at level 20. <br>
<br>
What I haven't forgotten is how Tat maliciously harrassed me on the message boards and spread rumors in the game for months after that, and never once attempted to make any efforts to resolve it<br>
<br>
Talk about paranoid - seesh it wasn't a &quot;rumour' that you were following me around in to my guild and then making inquiries about me for the next year all due to a forum posting I made &quot;addressed to Sony&quot; in the Sony forums to make sure you weren't trying to get me banned for charming an orc when I was a n00b. It's not a rumor that you profess to seeking me out here. It is a fact which you openly admit. <br>
<br>
You sensationalize still today 2 years later. You are the one who has openly confessed to seeking me out on this board and openly confessed to joining my guild seeking to &quot;resolve things with me&quot;. I don't join the guilds of my enemies and write ten page letters about their ks'ing an orc to &quot;resolve things&quot;. <br>
<br>
Good lord just quit seeking me and move on. The posting was made to Sony not you and you just never got over it making up delusions of rumors and other crap. You are here in this board following me around still fervent about the topic 2 years later.<br>
<br>
Again - go harass some other noobies you fought over an orc for. It is you &quot;ceenedra&quot; who is on the Drinal board after an admission of querying the web to find these postings &quot;about me&quot; 2 years after I made a posting to sony to find out if you had my account scarred for charming an orc (which you are now calling harassment). You, Ceenedra, need to go back to Mith Marr which is your server instead of following me around. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/30/01 10:13:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#993300>(5/30/01 11:19:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> Tat, just a short question: Ever thought about an own show on tv? or radio?

&quot;an admission of querying the web to find these postings &quot;about me&quot; 2 years after I made a posting to sony&quot;<br>
<br>
Where did I say I was looking for postings about you?  /looks around at my few posts.  Nope I sure don't see it.  What I did say was I was searching EZ boards.. you know.. like as in .. ez boards ring.????  /doh!<br>
<br>
And you still can't do the math.  Where do you get 2 years? Is this 2001 or 2002?  That incident YOU keep bringing up happened in January of 2000.  The game was still in Beta in January of 1999.  You fail 3rd grade math or what?<br>
/points and laughs You can't even count to 1 without screwing it up.<br>
<br>
Keep going Tat... this is the most fun I have had in ages.<br>

I was perusing all the flames about Tat on this page and found her comments about me and the link to the AL's boards!<br>
<br>
I am laughing so hard I'm dyin here... Talk about coincidence!  I guess I will just have to pay more attention in the future to what's said on the AL boards ..assuming I go there to read.. your boards are so much more fun!<br>
<br>
/chuckles<br>
<br>
I can't take anymore laughing tonight or I&quot;ll never get to sleep.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the pure enjoyment Tat.  Keep it up.  This is better than Comedy Central.  Now I know for sure where to come when I need a good laugh.<br>
<br>
You guys may think you want to ban her but, if you do that your boards will lose about 50% of the posts and ALL of the enjoyment factor and become dull and boring. Ya'll really don't want to do that do ya? <br>
<br>
Thanks Drinal.. keep up the good work!  I'll be persuing for my laughs.<br>
