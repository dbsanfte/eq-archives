Some of the best partnerships and examples of putting dissagreements aside have been when two or more guilds work together in joint adventures. If guild membership was limited to 50 characters max... all the things done now would still be done, but the level of cooperation would be so much higher. No single person or guild would have the power or influence to snub their nose at anybody. <br>
<br>
Just take a look at the polical party system in the US. Because of there being two parties that weild all the power, you wind up with WaterGate, the Florida voting fiasco ... ect... <br>
<br>
Spread the power base out and more people would be empowered. The primary elections would still leave us with the 2-3 most popular choices... just as in EQ there would be 2-3 guilds that would likely have their sh*t together more than the others. But the difference between the 3rd best and 4th best would not be like it is now. <br>

That makes it possible for AL to keep the numbers small and still do the big things. With a guild limit of 50 you either can't do the big stuff as a guild or you cannot recruit people from different continents. But why should I play a MMORPG when I can only play with people who live in the same time zone? <br>
CS had members from all around the globe. From Asia, Europe and the States. We already had that constellation before we moved to Drinal and that is one the things I liked most. But that requires some more people than just 50. You may ask why. Well, that's pretty simple. It is called life besides EQ. Not everyone is able to stay up to 5 am European time so that you can raid stuff with those people who just came home from work and live in a PST zone. You are able to give up some sleep for some raids, but not always. Other way around is the same. You are sometimes able to come home earlier from work but not always. CS did not fall apart because of the large number. It is the same difficulty if you try to bring 60 or 120 opinions under one hat.<br>
When you build a strong guild around people from the same time zone, then it is no problem to do stuff with 50 people. But other factors also matter, not only time zones. But this is a different subject :) <br>

The only thing lost would be the ability to use guild chat for raids.  <br>
<br>
IMO the number 1 thing EQ should have allowed that would help support grouping with different people for raids is the ability to make your own channels.  Think about it.  The reason large raid guilds formed was for ease of communication, ie /gu.  Give people the ability to create their own EQ channels for easy raid communication.  /ooc /auc and /shout were never meant for raids, it just happened that those were all that were given to us.  If you want to kill a mob with more then 6 people, you either use one of those channels and spam the whole zone, or you form a guild and use guildchat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqalarrubican.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qalar Rubican</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#993300>(2/24/01 11:30:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What If Guild Membership Was 50 Limit Per Guild?</span><hr size=1> I suggested something a long time ago on this subject.  Actually, it was like 3 months after release or so, but anyway...<br>
<br>
It would be really great if you're in a group, and the group leader could invite other group leaders into a 'party.'  When the groupleader gives you the invite, you click yes or no, if yes, you get added to /partychat, just another chat channel, including all the other groups in your raid.<br>
<br>
I also suggested that they could share the experience, but was told that it would be extremely hard to implement since EQ XP sharing was based on a 1-6 group system.<br>
<br>
Would have been very cool if you were in a guild and also had party chat for the raid leaders, for commans and stuff(bright pink!). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#993300>(2/25/01 5:57:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What If Guild Membership Was 50 Limit Per Guil</span><hr size=1>  Another point is, when a guild is say 90 players and a raid is done that includes 5 groups ... perhaps another 30-40 people will be online that are not attending that raid. Is /gu going to be any more effective than /ooc or /auc for communication? There will still be plenty of non-raid people using the channel for their price checks and GG requests. <br>
<br>
But what I now see as more important is not limiting the number of friends that can share a communication channel to socialize privately. <br>
<br>
Also, to have a group of people that share loot in a civil and unselfish way may encourage the members of a guild to group almost exclusively with each other. <br>
<br>
What I really was trying to find the answer to was the question &quot;Why don't we have 10-11 guilds on each server that are capable of the same or simular accomplishments of a 'Afterlife' or CiH? <br>
<br>
The replies I have read to this thread make it clear that limiting guild membership to 50 chars (not players) would not make this happen. Wonder why ... but that would make a new thread. :)      <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 2/25/01 6:37:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulukasz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukasz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/eq_lukasz/sigstuff/ranger.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#993300>(2/25/01 12:50:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What If Guild Membership Was 50 Limit Per Guil</span><hr size=1> If a guild has 90 players they won't all be online at the same time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uh0tr0d.showPublicProfile?language=EN>h0tr0d</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gifzboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 375<br> <font color=#993300>(2/26/01 8:36:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hear hear lern</span><hr size=1> give me a guild officer channel.<br>
