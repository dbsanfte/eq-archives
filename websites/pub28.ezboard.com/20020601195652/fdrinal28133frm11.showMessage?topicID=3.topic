<br>
She gathered her belongings, donning her gleeming green armor and buckling on her gleaming scimitar, but just as she finished the last straps, something in the wind caught her senses and she knew there was going to be trouble this day, she put her hands out to her sides and called upon the forces of the earth to enshroud her in the guise of a great grey wolf, once the transformation was complete she called upon nature once again to encase her in protective majiks for the perils ahead, she then set off to the north where she felt the pull of evils drawing her....<br>
<br>
All seemed to be as it should be while she ran, she was to pass the great encampment of the Centaurs a proud race they are she thought, but as she grew closer to the encampment she realized something was amiss, great billows of smoke and fire came from the rooftops and buildings, as she enter the camp her wolf senses were overwelmed with the stench of death and decay and her heart was deeply saddened when she came upon the cause of this smell, hundreds of centaur bodies were strewn about the camp, the bodies were contorted and mangled almost beyond recognition, My god what could have down this horrible slaughter, I scoured the camp looking for survivors or signs or what could have befallen these mighty creatures but alas I found sign of neither, the marks on the bodies were not made by anything man made it was almost as if some creature tore them apart. <br>
<br>
Not long after I came upon the camp a fellow druid Tedule entered the camp also completely horrified by what had transpired, he told me that he had just come from the great city of the Aviak biredmen and it was the same situation, everyone was dead, but the question is how ?? What new evil lurks in the Karanas and can it be stopped before it reaches the civilized cities of Norrath.......<br>

Behind her the once prowd city of the bird people lay in smoking ruin.  Her eyes still watered from the smoke.  It seemed as if the very air was filled with a terrible waiting.  And <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> something</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ran close behind her, hounding her every step.  She could see nothing yet it drove her north, always north. <br>
<br>
Instinct told her to run and not stop.  To keep going until the safety of Rivervale enfolded her.  But as she rounded a hill new plumes of smoke became visible. It was the centaur village.  The bard felt a groan escape her lips. She had spent long days within those stout stockades as a young bard, afraid and alone on a continent not always friendly to Wood Elves.  <br>
<br>
And so, though fear nipped at her heals she turned away from her nothern flight.<br>
<br>
Her drum carried her over the ground so quickly that in moments she was amid the ruin.  Tandaina staggered, retching, at the stench and the horrible slaughter around her.  She looked up and her eyes met those of a wolf who stood only a few feet away.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uthorpinwhiskyforge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorpin Whiskyforge</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/7915/beerk.gif height=27 width=22 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/4/00 6:04:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://beerismylife.com/graphics/pics/schweikr.gif height=90 width=90></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cold winters day</span><hr size=1>  Small hands clumsily pulled the fat body they were attached to out of the Gorge. The old dwarf was exhausted. He'd spent quite some time in the Beholder's Maze and had more than a few cuts and scrapes to show for it. He rooted through his pack to take another look at what he had taken from the Eyes.<br>
 <br>
A beautiful bracelet made of polished bone. It was remarkable to look at. Not much by way of protection for a warrior, but Thorp assumed he might fetch a pretty price for it. More than enough to sharpen his axe and take some of the dents out of his armor. He hoped he could sqeeze enough left over for a few beers as well.<br>
<br>
After taking another glance at his provisions, he came up with the idea of hiking down the road and heading onto the Centaurs village. He could think of no better place to have his things repaired, than by the same people who made them.<br>
<br>
After a few hours travel, thoughts of bartering and ale drinking ceased. Billows of black smoke clouded the sky. From the direction, it seemed to be comming from where he was headed. That put an extra skip in the short legs of Thorpin. His pack hit the ground, his walking stick swung up in his arms as the weapon it was intended to be used for, and he ran.<br>
<br>
About 20 yards out he realized the sad truth that he was too late. The smells of death assaulted his fat nose. Those smells werent fresh, and likely would become worse as the days wore on. He resolved himself to the gruesome task of burying a proud race of creatures, hoping he could find some survivors along the way.<br>
<br>
Walking through the encampment, Thorpin found 3 people standing about a shattered ruin. Maybe they could tell him what had transpired here, and who it was that could  do such a thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11>Role-playing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
