[Tue May 22 21:06:50 2001] Kilamyan tells the guild, 'forget that. the guild IS an epic helper. and if you don't believe me. then when I do get my epic I wont come on any raids. and I wont let anyone use the effect'<br>

[Tue May 22 21:07:32 2001] Ogermeister tells the guild, 'that's what I am talking about.'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:08:08 2001] Kilamyan tells the guild, 'Then why do I feal that only time anyone comes to anything. Like the Chardok raid. Is because they can help themselves'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:08:26 2001] Ogermeister tells the guild, 'I would and will help you if you need my help cuz you my family'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:08:33 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'Okay heres my two cents and you can quote me. My account, my damn time. Every monk OR puller helps everyone get thier epic. Threatening anyone over not using the effect to help people helpign you in nonsense. No one is Obligated to help anyone'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:08:49 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'You help people because you want to'<br>

[Tue May 22 21:09:48 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'Selfish attitude. But been a rough day so me gonna forget you are off your rocker '<br>
[Tue May 22 21:10:23 2001] Kilamyan tells the guild, 'Why the hell would I help someone that isn't/hasn't helped me? Wanna explain the logic behind that?'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:10:29 2001] Ogermeister tells the guild, 'Kilam if you think I will help you just because I need the effect of your epic..that's wrong..'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:10:32 2001] You say to your guild, 'Because you're a wonderful person...'<br>

[Tue May 22 21:12:01 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'No one has to help me. I udnerstand they pay to play thier account to, not here to dictate what they need to do inorder to recieve service from me'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:12:57 2001] Kilamyan tells the guild, 'If anyone ever expects to get help from me. you better be damn sure that you are gonna help me sometime in the future. and if not then don't ever expect help from me again. nothing is free'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:13:08 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'love is'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:13:16 2001] You say to your guild, 'I dont think that's an attitude that any guild would want or support.'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:13:45 2001] You say to your guild, 'I dont agree with it in the least.'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:13:55 2001] Kilamyan tells the guild, 'this game isn't about love Rhaurgh. Are you ever gonna meet me out of the game? its a GAME. you get addicted and you have no social life.'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:14:21 2001] Evanerv tells the guild, 'Sorry to hear that Kil. I'm addicted and still have a social life.  =)'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:14:34 2001] Rhaurgh tells the guild, 'I know a few people outside the game. and yes I still have my family'<br>
[Tue May 22 21:15:20 2001] Emirkil tells the guild, 'you guys take this way too serious......'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some wonderful quotables in there....<br>
<br>
&quot;'Why the hell would I help someone that isn't/hasn't helped me? Wanna explain the logic behind that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If anyone ever expects to get help from me. you better be damn sure that you are gonna help me sometime in the future. and if not then don't ever expect help from me again. nothing is free&quot;<br>
<br>
something everyone would want to see their guild members say.....<br>

We were bitching over why nobody was helping with epics and mine came up. I asked for help on my epic earlier that day is why. I was told not to ask in guild for help on my epic. Then I was told the guild wouldn't help me with my epic. Then it blew up.  And  AR didn't fall apart from me, everyone left because nobody would help on their epics but still demanded help in return. Thus Siusiu's guild formed and everyone left to join it. I left to Clan Skallagrim about 3 weeks before AR fell apart, where I have many friends and people that have known me from the split.  If you ask anyone in CS about my conduct in the guild I guaruntee it will come up positive.  Posting something without posting ALL of it is very lame Inganno.  So from a hearty enchanter to another twink <br>
/point <br>
/FU<br>
<br>
And posting shit like &quot;oh, I think he was that guy who died in sewers alot' I sure as hell did, and I was also doing sewers at 48.<br>

No guild automatically owes anyone to help them with their epic. If the person has done things to deserve assistance from the guild then the entire guild should assist them.  If the person has never done anything for the guild to deserve the guild helping them, then they should get as much back as they gave. Nothing.<br>
<br>
This post isn't toward anyone, just the way I feel about epics.<br>
<br>
Nothing pisses me off more than having guildmembers who never show for guild-raids or help people out when others need help, turn around and get pissy that people arn't running to help them with their epic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Easy rule: Don't expect to get anything you have done nothing to earn.<br>

I logged on when i saw the conversation start about Jenif getting her epic, and you being pissed off because she had people to help her and you were on every day workin your ass off just the same and got very little.  I thought that was a good point (even though she was 56 at the time while you were 54 i think)  All i know is that you said those things and it pissed me off.  btw I sold everything i earned on my 53 cleric and put it into inganno.  Call me whatever you want, at least i'm not a greed monger.  I dont care what ya think of me.  I had every bit of respect for you until i saw you say those things.  Now there is little.<br>

However, you can manage many epic encounters with scheduling.  Have your guild set aside one night a week for dealing with them (the ones you can).  Make up some ground rules about who gets epic help (level, raid participation, helping others with epics, and so on).  Otherwise you'll burn everyone out with epic help requests and people will eventually stop helping. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udrakannighteagle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drakan Nighteagle</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/01 7:49:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why epics suck, vol. 584</span><hr size=1> epics suck if you don't have a big guild with big balls to swing from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueqalexio.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQ Alexio</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/01 12:18:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why epics suck, vol. 584</span><hr size=1> Epics really just make you ask yourself &quot;is x item really worth all this shit?&quot;. I know I for one have asked my friends for a assload of help with alexio's (mage) epic. Im down to 5 pieces left I feel so close yet so far away, its fucking sad, all this over a pixel. However in EQ you have &quot;real&quot; friends and acquantinces, same thing in RL. Your real friends dont care if 1) they get xp while on your raid 2) loot if any while on your raid 3) keep tabs on how many times they help you. I was reading some guilds boards (i think KC)and someone said somethign to the effect of &quot;to those classes that have really difficult epics:  once they complete their epic those pixels are symbolic of a loyal group of friends to the weilder of that epic&quot;. I really like to belive this, god knows I would not be down 5/24 drops left without my friends. <br>

<br>
&quot;If anyone ever expects to get help from me. you better be damn sure that you are gonna help me sometime in the future. and if not then don't ever expect help from me again. nothing is free&quot;<br>
<br>
then says to a guild member<br>
<br>
Kilamyan tells the guild, 'this game isn't about love Rhaurgh. Are you ever gonna meet me out of the game? its a GAME. you get addicted and you have no social life.'<br>

<br>
This has nothing to do with people outside the guild...the only service it performs is getting people pissed off.<br>
<br>
If it's a problem within the guild...keep it within the guild...don't bring it here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=275.topic&start=21&stop=35>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=275.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=275.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=275.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=275.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=275.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
