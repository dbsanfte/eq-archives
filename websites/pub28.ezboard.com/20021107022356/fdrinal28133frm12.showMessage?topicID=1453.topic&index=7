If it were truely genetic you would see an equal distribution of gays in all socioeconomic areas of society which I really don't think you do.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes a person may, however, have genetic tendences which are accentuated or suppressed by environment.  The only way genetics factor into homosexuality is that a person may lack a genetic tendency towards sports or other parts of our culture that are considered &quot;masculine.&quot;  This combines with environmental pressures (often other people who may not like sports coming together and rebelling so to speak against societal standards) to create a gay lifestyle.  Often times as far as environment goes, a person may not receive enough attention from their parents or be the &quot;middle child,&quot; and by rebelling against societal standards they try to get attention from their parents or others.<br>
<br>
That said, Briyan do what you want in your life but don't press your lifestyle on us as &quot;genetic&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; because it isn't either, and frankly its about time for you shut up and stop begging for attention.<br>

<br>
First of all, the information you gave totally supports the environment theory.  You had older brothers who were competent athletes.  If I had to guess, they were very successful in sports and got a lot of attention from your parents and family who attended their games and cheered them on.  You on the other hand did not finds sports as interesting and did not receive the same attention.  This is perhaps because you weren't as skilled as your older brothers or simply because you did not like sports for whatever reasons.  Your parents and brothers probably pushed you to play more sports, which you resisted and associated yourself more with other men who didn't enjoy sports or &quot;masculine&quot; activities.  You hung out with these guys or learned more about the gay lifestyle in other ways.  You felt perhaps like you couldn't really attract women (perhaps correctly, perhaps not) because they were more attracted to the guys on the football team or people like your brothers who are in to masculine activities.  You then rationalized the gay lifestyle to yourself as &quot;alternate&quot; and that you were genetically different from the start.  You felt that a gay lifestyle would be a way of showing to your parents and brothers that you were different and unique and in that way acquire the attention of your parents.<br>
<br>
Obviously I don't know you so I might be totally wrong, but if I had to guess I'd say I guessed pretty correctly with the above paragraph.  You had a choice over your lifestyle to the same extent all of us have control over our lifestyles.  We are all influenced by our genetic inheritances and our environments (when I say environment I don't just mean what family you were brought up in like you do in your post.  Environment can be where in the family you are, what societies standards are, what you are exposed to, who associates with you, and the list goes on and on).<br>
<br>
Briyan the fact that you need to make all these posts in the first place, and, as you said, keep posting simply because of the shock factor and people's responses to it, shows me beyond all else that you are attention starved and crave the attention (whether positive or negative) your lifestyle gives you.  If this weren't true, you wouldn't have even mentioned your lifestyle on these boards in the first place (since no one would have known or cared if you were gay or straight if you hadn't mentioned it).  I'd be quite happy if you proved me wrong by shutting the hell up.  Like it or not, &quot;normal&quot; has always been defined by society's perceptions, and the gay lifestyle is not &quot;normal&quot; in the society in which we live, get over it.  You posting here 500 times won't change that, so do the rest of us a favor and stuff it.<br>

<br>
If you are offended well then get over it. We tell people who complain about sexual remarks and references on sigs or peoples post the same thing. But just because he’s gay it takes a different light. He is not putting a gun to your head saying “hey be gay or else!”<br>
<br>
The day gay couples wander into your house and start having sex on your coffee table you can talk about it bothering you. But what people do in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business. Not like the gay community is banging on your door telling you to stop smeggin your wife that its offensive to them.<br>
<br>
Granted Bry wanted to get some shock value out of his posts. But who here hasn’t done the same thing. GO bry for being open with who you are and leading a happy life. <br>

Every time you find a man attractive do YOU think about having sex with him? Or do you just have a natural feeling of attraction to him without even considering sex? Personally when I see a good looking guy I don't think about jumping his bones lol.<br>
<br>
Children do know when a boy/girl is cute to them. I had my first kiss in kindergarten and I know a lot of little kids that run around saying, "so and so is my boyfriend/girlfriend." It is possible that a child does know who he/she feels attracted to even at such a young age. It is also really obvious when you feel awkward because the way you feel and the things you do don't go along with the "norm" in society. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uteauvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teauvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Whiny<s>, spoiled</s> brat.</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/02 3:48:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i agree with synide <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>aka Raisst Ritter</span><br>  Posts: 2021<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/02 7:03:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/dancfrog.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Callandra, he doesn't sound very happy to me, actually. <br>
