It`s seems fairly obvious that someone accepted something from someone else and now doesn`t want to give it back. If I gave something to someone and they wanted it back unless it was a clear &quot;deal&quot;, I would give it back no matter how i felt. <br>

I feel that is a very similar experience to the guy who kept my karnors loot and gave it away - totally lacking in honor. <br>
<br>
I don't think it is wrong to inquire for the whole story - after all what happened can be key - and some people may have made mistakes but are they totally irreconcileable? <br>
<br>
Example scenario: (I am totally making this up)<br>
Bannion asks thraxx for tunic back<br>
Thraxx misses a tell - honestly<br>
Bannion goes in to guild say and says whoa didn't get a response when i tried to get tunic back<br>
Four people jump on thraxx in tells calling him a noob, jerk whatever.....<br>
Thraxx gets mad and just decides to log to not deal with them...or decides out of anger to make up some BS to the four ppl giving him tells...or decides screw it they spoke to me like that I will forever ignore him - people get offended and angry and sometimes act upon it, it happens. (Who is right or wrong isn't the issue here)<br>
<br>
That is something that is solvable, apologies can be made, items returned etc. It's not an easy solution, but it is solvable. One of the parties involved in the fictitious scenerio would have to be willing to explain thier actions to the other and why, and the other party would have to be mature enough to accept those actions and take responsibility for theirs - in the end you have two people who disagreed or did something to offend the other but both win in the end if they manage to finish their transaction e.g. a tunic is returned.<br>
<br>
But lets say instead the problem brought in to a forum, sure the party has a right to be angry, but they wind up further angering Thraxx. So instead, Thraxx makes up lies and defenses or both stories are exxagerated....then the problem may no longer solvable - it is escalated to the point where someone has to win. It would take a much larger swallowing of pride to now solve the problem and this way of trying to obtain resolution has greater consequences. One person has to win by burning the other hardest.<br>
<br>
This may not be the case at all...but having some experience with being flamed in here (hehe) I'd say that a variety of legitimately solvable problems wind up in here doing  permanent damage.<br>
<br>
I really don't care if you guys call me crazy for writing posts, some times it takes more than one sentence or paragraph in D00dspeak to get a point across.<br>

Thraxx #2 traded bugazi for the bugazi account.  Bugazi Thraxx then saw all the BS he had to go thru in this so not worthwhile game.  Sold his account, traded for dearly (with gear, dunno can't remember, oh it was siksol heh).  Siksol is a whole other spin off that's amusing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, he traded dearly for some druid on nameless, then got xuro's/and some 56 warriors account.  Ebay'd it all, and now he made quite a bit of cash from a somewhat frustrating game.<br>
<br>
This thraxx, would then be #4, who paid 1500(?) for it.<br>
He has some 57 or so wizard(that's awhile ago) on some other server.

Thraxx had not received his &quot;new tunic&quot; as it is. Why I asked it back was as I stated before. the point is, there was nothing wrong with me asking for it back. What seems to be fuzzy for folks here, is that 1, this was between me and Thraxx, 2, CiH has nothing to do with this. Alos, there was no 1 tell sent about this. For a solid week I would log in and say hi to Thraxx. He was always Anon so I asked him where he was and he told me. I then told him that I would come meet him and get the tunic. Each of the 4 times I went, he would log as I got there. There was no one missed tell. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but 1 week, 4 log offs was a bit to much. On Saturday, he promiced me to meet me that night to give me the tunic back. Of cource, he never would meet me. The 4th and last chance was Sunday when I logged on, he was in Permafrost. I got a gate and ran all the way there for good old thraxx just to log on me once again. I don't know what anyone else would do. I gave him a week and 4 solid chances. There was never a conversation to buy the item from me. It was always centered around him returning it to me. I read the crap he has said and none of the &quot;reality&quot; that he posted ever happened. I don't know a soul out there who would trade an item to one person then give the cash to another. Thats the oldest scam in the book, one he tried to pull on danialson with a tranqual staff for a tunic a while back. How did it get to the board here? How did it get to friends of mine asking him about it? My friends who have asked him are not all CiH, people who know me know I will not the thing he has done. The people who were there when I let him use it, know it was a temp thing. Thraxx is the only one who lives in a world where me asking for it back required a self made reality where he gave the tunic to some alt that doesn't exist. Tell them all Thraxx who the name of the alt was. Next, after 4 tries ( I seriously doubt anyone can reply that he will meet me and say each of those 4 times were all missed) were an attempt to get the item back, not to sell it to said evil. My friends begin to ask him about it AFTER I had given him ample chances. Monday morning, I had had enough and I gave him a piece of my mind telling him he needed to get it to me now. He said that he would. Not an hour later, people started to ask him what his problem was and then, suddenly he makes up this story that 2 days earlier he had given the money to my mule after talking to me about it. Where did this come from? You have to look inside the chaotic mind of thraxx and understand that the lies begin there. Now, on the boards, he says that he gave the said trade to me instead of the said mule. The point is, the tangled web he weaves when frist Thraxx practiced to decieve. Now he would that people forget his little slip ups and make this a CiH thing. Whatever it takes to get the attention off the facts. Either way, I am done with this thread, Anyone dumb enough to trust thraxx in the future, well, you have been warned. As for me? I will be the same old me. Which means, I will help those who need help when I can as I can. Guild tags are a little useless to me when it comes to making friends. But then, anyone who knows me, knows that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 364<br> <font color=#939393>(4/11/01 5:55:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> Never even heard of that scam ...I guess I am fortunate.

NM figured part of what you were saying out....but if CiH are friends in your guild &quot;telling him he needs to fix this&quot; (quote 1) vs. friends not in guild &quot;asking him questions&quot; (quote2) it is two different statements.<br>

New fictitious scenario: &lt;--again not saying this happened, but the probability exists that these things do happen yielding undesirable results whether they be honorous or not. This is how problems move from a stage of having potential solutions to having no solution.<br>
<br>
Scenario:<br>
Bannion gives tell to friend Menendil: Thraxx hasn't responded to my tell(s) regarding a tunic he borrowed and logged off.<br>
Menendil gives Thraxx a tell: You better not mess with Bannion or I keel you!<br>

What answer would you expect from Thraxx in response?<br>
<br>
Thraxx if you have the stinking tunic give it back to him. If you gave money to an alt cut your losses and consider it a lesson learned. Items and money mean very little to the game anyway, hell I walked around half naked for months and still had a good time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 4/12/01 5:16:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwindailya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Windailya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#939393>(4/12/01 12:13:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> actually i wasnt replying to your made up &quot;scenario&quot;..i didnt even read it... i was replying to you trying to pick apart the &quot;in-accuracies&quot; (i do believe if'd up that spelling) In bannion's post about him giving tells to friends in guild, and then saying he gave tells to friends in and out of guilds, all i was saying is God, chill out, lol<br>

Ya, hehe bye. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#939393>(4/13/01 3:30:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> synide : hes what u call a nice guy!~<br>

I can write in one paragraph structures using &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot; and &quot;anywayz&quot; instead of anyway, not challenge that the blanket statements put in the headlines of this board then I am mentally balanced and broadly accepted? All that tells me is you have nothing to add to the point I made.<br>
<br>
When you get over the age of 18 you will find new ways to communicate, hopefully. There is a huge difference between attacking the person and disagreeing with what the person is saying. I have primarily focused on the latter.<br>
<br>
Challenging what I said did not just occur, attacking the person *is* what you did &quot;Tat you are psycho&quot;, so you are guilty of the very thing you are accusing me of. That made your post less convincing. Can you think of a better way you could have approached that so that you are adequately challenging my viewpoint?<br>
<br>
You could have actually &quot;read&quot; my posts in the period of time it took you to make this foolish attack which has no relevence to the discussion at hand.<br>
<br>
P.S. Capitalize your &quot;i's&quot; too please.<br>

Summary of all posts for the intellectually challenged:<br>
Some D00d accuzed Thraxx of doing some shit. Not all stories posted in here have one side.<br>
<br>
If someone spoke to Thraxx the way you just spoke to me (twice) then Thraxx would be more inclined to react and probably decided &quot;screw them I&quot;ll make them sweat&quot; and not give the tunic back. I sincerely believe from the communications I see on this board endlessly there is a good chance one of those friends who were pulled in to talk to Thraxx did not approach the situation well - because I have only seen 2 or 3 masters of diplomacy in these boards..the rest of you are little shits &lt;--now that's an attack. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 4/13/01 4:57:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzandalay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zandalay</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#939393>(4/13/01 4:39:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thraxx the e-bay monk turned thief</span><hr size=1> &lt;---  Reads this whole thread<br>

Tat, damn you are long-winded.  On top of that you make up shit.  Are you a reporter?  If not apply to one of the tabloids.  That active immagination will net you a lot of money (yes, I actually read all of the &quot;suppose this happened&quot; posts that you made).  You make me laugh.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
Bannion, yep I know of you in-game.  Although I play very little these days, what I know of you and what I have seen first-hand tells me that you are a good quality player.  Sorry about the item, and thanks for the warning about Thraxx.  I have heard others complain about him in the past, but not to this extent.<br>
<br>
Thraxx.  How does it feel to be following in the footsteps of other notable thieves?  Lurk comes to mind immediately, although you would have to work hard to be at that level.  Good luck.<br>
<br>
Lukasz, where are you??  I still wanna frag ya in UT.<br>

P.S.  How was that for diplomacy?  Damn, I'm good.  Next stop, the Middle East. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uthorsen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorsen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/13/01 6:12:14 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=101&stop=111>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=245.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=244.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=150.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
