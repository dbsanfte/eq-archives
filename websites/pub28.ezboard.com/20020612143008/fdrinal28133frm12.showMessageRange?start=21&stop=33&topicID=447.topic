<br>
Where are the insults?  I said someone was a thief.  If someone steals a car, would it be an insult to call them a thief?  NO, because they would be a thief.<br>
<br>
You are stealing from ezboard. Period.  Try to justify why you are stealing is fine, but you ARE STEALING.<br>
<br>

/ROFL - Ezboard makes money off of ad revenue.  If you don't let the ads appear, they don't make money from those ads - Or the companies who pay to have those ads displayed will stop paying.  <br>

But why did you stay?  Oh yeah, all the other free message board systems that were worth a damn went out of business.  So instead of going out of business, ezboard has a plan to stay in business, and have people pay a MINIMAL amount of money, OR see some popups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wow I am a theif for using legitimate software that blocks annoying pop up ads. I would like to see them prosecute me for that. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Of course they won't be able to prosecute you for it, they couldn't prove you were using for starters.<br>
<br>
And why do you say it is legitimate?  There is plenty of software that you could download off of the net that does things that are immoral and illegitimate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Thought Eqbeastlord = Vfelia? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It does, and until ezboard ads in the quick switch feature, i'll probably continue to post under eqbeastlord - sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are using this message board, and you are either - Letting the pop ups happen, or paying your bi-yearly fee, or donating to the board, then fine.  I appreciate it, and ezboard appreciates it<br>
<br>
If you are using pop-up stoppers ---- PLEASE LEAVE THIS BOARD ----<br>
<br>
You are generating extra hits that cause this board to be so expensive for the people who want to use it LEGITAMATELY.<br>

What don't you understand?  You are taking money out of my pocket.  You are taking money out of anyone's pocket who is donating.<br>
<br>
I donate my TIME and MONEY each and every month to have this site easily accessible.  From webhosting fees, to domain fees. You can say, fine, that is your problem, and you are right, but this is OUR community and if you just want to flush it, then fine. <p>_________________________

 YOU are stealing from ezboard by going and making a new board for everyone to post too.. Eventually everyone will move there and no one will post here and ezboard will lose 5 extra cents. The horror.<br>

<b>You use a pop-up stopping program because you are a spoiled brat, who think that everything in the world is owed to you.<br>

You are trash</b><br>

Those are insults in my book. Either way I'm still using a pop up stopper because I choose not to be inconvenienced by EZBoard. Just out of curiousity, those people with old browsers that don't support JavaScript, are they thieves, too? How about people that turn off JavaScript for other reasons, are they thieves? Banners ads I will put up with because they are easily ignored, but the day EZBoard introduced pop up ads that play .wav files was the day I got a pop up stopper. <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>
