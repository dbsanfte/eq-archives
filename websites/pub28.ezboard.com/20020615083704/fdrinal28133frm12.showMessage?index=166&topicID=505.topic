I was not there, nor even online when this happened, so i will not pretend to know what was going on in anyone's mind who was there, or took place in this event. Let me say that those of you who keep talking about how you &quot;will never help kc&quot; &quot;will tell all of kc to go f%$# themselves when they ask for gate/ rez, whatever&quot; I am sorry to hear that. <br>
 Next let me say that I like being a member of kc. Yes, I believe the members of kc who took part in this were wrong to do take the spawn, when gotk was in process of cr.(Seems no one is contesting yall were there first, and had failed once. In my exp, almost no one ever goes after a big mob only once, so it seems logical you'd be given the chance to go again, or give up.) In all honesty, I've been surprised at the flames being thrown out there in this thread. I'm into this game for fun and friends. Loot is just somethin secondary to brag(or whine) about. Also to add insult to injury, it seems there is also no contestion that he was pulled right on top of yall's cr. Clearly in poor taste as well. What goes through peps heads when that happens i have no clue? &quot;hey i'm gonna ks this from ya, but to make matters worse I'll bring it right next to ya and let it whack ya first&quot;(my feelings on thought process there, not saying anything like that was said or thought at all) Sorry to hear about this whole matter.<br>
 I would like to apologize for the actions of those who took this camp from Gotk, although i know this does no good to those who lost out. Mantik i'm sorry you got screwed man. In younger days, I remember having grouped with you. you're a good guy, this twas a shameful act, and is saddens mi heart. Whenever you need help, I still offer my humble services, just send a me a tell.<br>
 There was only a small portion of Kc that took part in this though, and was not a guild participation.(I believe it's been said 23 kc peps did the sniping.) They were wrong imo, and the actions of other guilds against us do not justify what was done. &lt;FYI I have not ever personally been involved in any of those situations either, so again it's only what I've been told/read&gt;<br>
 There, I am done now. Just wanted to make sure it was known that not all of Kc approves of/is happy of the end result of this mess...Some others it seems have hinted at feeling same way, but I wanted to say it blatently!<br>

Why not? A little competition is good. I just think people need to take the time to say &quot;welp, they got the force they needed on the ground before us-we'll have to move faster next time guys&quot;.<br>
<br>
Guess what-that works. Ask AA about it-they did it for GotK. It's called mutual respect. Once two groups have that, the rest of the shit just falls into place. I was severly bummed I couldn't get to Skyfire to help with Ragefire today. But grats Ilenya from AA on your rez stick =)<br>
<br>
And if they two groups are honestly that close together in being ready to go like last week with KC/CS(or was it CT-honestly don't want to read this thread again) I personally am in favor of the two raid leaders getting together to talk it out-preferably solve it with a random and then...OK...watch this one guys-take a deep breath and sit down for a minute before you read this-have the loser of the roll HELP (OMFG!) the other raid party. Hell, if two scales drop, ya both win! Call bingo, collect yer jackpot and go home happy. And ya know what? I'm guessing maybe...juuuust maybe next week, you show up in EJ the same time as the other guild, they might say to themselves &quot;hey, those guys from UberPuppies are all right-they not only adhered to the roll they lost, they helped us make it an easy fight-hell, we should help them this week&quot;.<br>

/agree Higar.  The problem is when both guilds have adequate numebrs in the zone to take down the lizard by themselves.  At that point people's pupils start turning into dollar signs and it's very hard to stop the momentum.  After that the /petitions start happening and it gets really ugly and childish.<br>
<br>
You are right though, there should be more cooperation between guilds.  A lot of raid leaders out there know that I am the first to call for a joint raid if there is a scheduling conflict.  The trick is to get both sides to agree. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24811">Trewayn Fifate</A>, <font size=1><EM>Virtuoso, master artisan and all round good egg</EM>

<br>
For most of the three years I’ve played EQ I’ve been an officer in a fairly high level guild.  First in Ma Yuan and for the last two years in CT.  One thing I’ve learned is that a guild lives and dies with it’s reputation.<br>
<br>
As guilds grow in size, it becomes inevitable that there will be some people that don’t like you.  Even if people didn’t have bad days, conflict is inevitable in life.  Sometimes people make poor choices, and sometimes they have no good choice.  Sometimes (usually) the person in the wrong will tell the story in such a way that they don’t seem to be wrong.  Whatever the cause, a guild’s reputation hangs on every action taken by every member wearing the tag.<br>
<br>
This might be ok if it was possible to control every action taken by the members of your guild, but that’s not even a reasonable thing to try to accomplish.  As an officer of a guild, I know that our members will occasionally do things that reflect poorly on us.   When that happens, or even when there’s a rumor that it has happened, my job is to determine the facts as best as possible and react publicly to ensure that the character of the guild is displayed as best as possible.  If our member wasn’t wrong, then I will try to explain why I believe that to be true to the person with the complaint, sometimes that doesn’t work.  If our member is wrong, then I apologize and let the person know that we don’t tolerate that type of action and let them know what we will do about it.  If possible, I will try to undo any damage done.  If the issue was made public knowledge, then as an officer I must respond publicly to let the community know what we will do about the issue.<br>
<br>
Nobody expects people to always be perfect.  They just expect them to make things right.<br>
<br>
In this particular issue, your peers condemned the actions of your guild.  Not one person who wasn’t in KC came here supporting your guild’s actions.  The only response from KC at all was inflammatory and insulting.  There was no official response from KC’s leadership at all.  In the absence of any official response to this situation, it is inevitable that the Drinal community will assume that the actions are condoned by KC’s leadership.  That, to us, is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
There were several appropriate responses that could have occurred.  KC’s leadership could have come here claiming responsibility and apologizing.  They could have let us know what action they were taking to rectify the situation.  This could have been anything from formal discipline to turning over the scale to GoTK, or several other things I havent’ thought of.  These responses didn’t occur so the perceived public message issued by KC’s leadership is “what our members did is ok with us.”<br>
<br>
It is true that it is unfair to the decent members of KC that they will be treated the same as the members who committed this act.  But it is also true that if you knowingly choose to belong to an organization that condones such actions, it is reasonable to expect to be treated accordingly.  Fortunately, guild affiliation isn’t as difficult to change as national citizenship.<br>

Perhaps more has transpired since I was in Skyfire yesterday to help Stumpp - not sure, but now Rage is even more snipe-able (gratz me, new word).  <br>

I suppose gratz to someone, but I'm sorry Stumpp, you'd been camping that dragon for a long time, and it sucks you didn't get the stick.  Yes, AA had agro. Yes, technically and by all the rules, they had first shot.  I tell ya what, though .. I am NOT looking forward to this camp and race.  *sigh*<br>

Had Unc been faster, I would have substituted Iyena's name with Stumpp's, because both guilds have my equal respect as being full of good people.<br>
<br>
You can put an FD monk anywhere you want to watch for when a mob spawns, but if you can't get the people there to back it up faster than someone else, all you've done is had the pleasure of watching a rare mob actually spawn in front of you.<br>
<br>
Anyway-this doesn't belong in this thread. I know Unconquered expressed a desire to not make this a public issue because they felt it wasn't merited. I'll not be the one to take it any further.<br>
<br>
(And I'll agree with you on one thing though-VI made the Ragefire spawn like this EXACTLY so that noone could claim it-in other words, its become Sev Mk.2. Ah well, at least they don't have to worry about customer service issues anymore O_o). <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

They obviously not only waited until your were fully rezzed and conceeded the spawn, but also for Lod to regen to full HP and reset.<br>

Truthfully, if your idealism could be attributed to everyone on Drinal, none of these discussions would be taking place. It's a pity that's not so =)<br>
Ideal: Skyfire Rage would be campable in exactly the same way as SolB Rage was.<br>
Realistic: Clerics now get the distinct pleasure of knowing what warriors have been going though with Sev for these past two years, with the silght exception that our piece is a guaranteed drop over just a common drop.<br>

<br>
It`s just a matter of how some people given the right circumstances will put their own greed ahead of what is morally right. KC just chooses to do this more often because it is generally composed of the poorer players of EQ, ones who have been around a while and just not done as well with their time as others, so when a loot opportunity presents itself they take full of advantage of it, no matter what the consequences... <p>
