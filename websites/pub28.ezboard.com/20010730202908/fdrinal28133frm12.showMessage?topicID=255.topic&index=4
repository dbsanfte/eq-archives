<br>
And, to the druid, i'm guessing....who said tough shit.<br>
<br>
<br>
that's really funny.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And maybe I don't feel like finding peoples corpses.<br>
<br>
But I do.<br>
<br>
Am I here to cater to everyones needs to find their corpse? no.<br>
<br>
are druids here to port everyone around? <br>
no.<br>
<br>
Are clerics here to resurect everyone?<br>
no.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your responce just tells me you need to find another class to play.<br>
<br>
People know what their class can do before they play em. And if they don't, they know before they hit level 15 at the most.<br>
<br>
I made an assumption that taking 2 mins out of your time to help a fellow player out when you aren't doing anything anyways was something that most people would do. Maybe I was wrong...or maybe that just shows how FUCKED UP your class is.<br>
<br>
People like you make the general population of druids look bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I always ask for a port...not demand it....when it's an emergency...I be a little more forceful, but never say &quot;PORT ME BITCH, OR ELSE&quot;<br>
I'm always curtious when I ask...<br>
I'm always greatful....<br>
I always offer money....at the least what I have on me, and if I can't pay you, I'll pay you back when I get my corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's only when I get stressed for time is when my attitude changes, and I get upset when someone doesn't give a shit. Or they make up a lame ass excuse as to why they can't port me.<br>
<br>
How many have asked a cleric or a druid, or a wizard or a shamen for some sort of favor, and they said. &quot;sorry, logging&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, logging takes 30 seconds....If it was an emergency....that's understandable, you would have hit /q...if your logging cause you have to go to bed...that's bull shit.<br>
<br>
if the person's right there, and needs help, and it only takes you 10 seconds....do it...it will gain you some rep points, possibly some extra cash, and people won't look at you like your a lazy ass bitch. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A> at: 6/25/01 2:39:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrevize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trevize</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#993300>(6/25/01 7:51:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flame on druids/wizards.</span><hr size=1> Hmmm  Running from Karnor to EJ with SoW takes about 10-15 min or so?<br>

I do hell of a lot of gates, ALL THE TIME.   I've given up groups, given up camps, just to gate people.<br>

But if I am otherwise occupied and don't want to gate, then I'll say NO.   It doesn't matter if I am sitting at the zone doing (what seems to you) NOTHING AT ALL.  I might be having a nice conversatoin with a friend or I might be paying attention to my dog.   But whatever it is, no one is ever going to dictate to me about gating, sowing, buffing etc.<br>

<br>
I'm always amazed that someone would sit and shout for a port for 45 minutes when they could be there and back in 20. But no, it's much easier to expect someone else to put aside their plans to accomodate your whims, and like it doesn't happen to them 20 times a night with 20 people all equally desparate for a port, a res or something else.  There's a reason people go anon, its because they're sick to death of being pestered.  As a bard that's probably not anything you're acquainted with since you probably haven't been asked to perform any public service since you were level 15 finding lost corpses for newbies.<br>
<br>
And asking someone to rebind?  Bind points are treasures.  You stick your bind point somewhere hard to get to and you don't want to more that sucker for NOTHING.  Oh, to you it may be a few minutes, to the druid/wizard that has to reestablish that difficult to get to bind point, it might be a LONG dangerous run. <br>
<br>
A little self-sufficency goes a long ways in this game.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwysteriaplushfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wysteria Plushfoot</A> at: 6/25/01 10:22:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 646<br> <font color=#993300>(6/25/01 10:29:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flame on druids/wizards.</span><hr size=1> Ok...Lemmie give you the WHOLE story.<br>
<br>
<br>
I was bound in Skyshrine. Why skyshrine?<br>
<br>
because of a raid I did earlier in the week.<br>
<br>
it was a pickup raid, and a druid ported me to dreadlands, I ran to karnor's, and got a port to EJ.<br>
<br>
we went far into CoM, and died past a door that was locked.<br>
<br>
I waited for about an hour for this rogue to help pull corpses. He couldn't, so we needed a necro to summon.<br>
<br>
I spent another hour trying to find a druid to port me to dreadlands from Cobalt scar...the druid who ported me the first time logged off.<br>
<br>
I found a druid. thanked him, and ran off to karnor's to see if I could get a port to EJ. <br>
<br>
when I got into karnor's there were 3 druids in there.<br>
<br>
I asked the first one kindly, and explained my situation...he said, sorry, i'm in a group.<br>
<br>
I asked the second one...he said sorry, i'm the leader of the group.<br>
<br>
I asked the third one, and he said he was in the warlord room.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, at least  2 hours had past.<br>
<br>
I asked the first one (blacklotus) if he could disband for a few, and port me....I really needed the help.<br>
<br>
sorry if I get lost quite a bit while running...I have a shitty graphics card, and the clipping plane has to be at minimal for it not to lag up and crash.<br>
<br>
blacklotus responds: sorry. low on mana....<br>
<br>
at this point, I know he's feeding me bull shit excuses.<br>
<br>
so I try to argue my point that it's really important, and that I can give him mana song to compinsate for lost mana.<br>
<br>
after 30mins or so...45 at the most, I get a port...<br>
<br>
<br>
Now it might have been faster to run...but coupled with the fact that my graphics card is shitty, and my clipping plane has to be at minimal, and there's a good chance I could get lost...I didn't want to take that chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
and at the same time, I had the necro wanting to leave, cause he was tired...<br>
<br>
I know a corpse lasts 1 week before rotting, but to get a res, it only lasts 3 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had people ask me to drag corpses for them all the time...weather i'm in a group or not...i'll help em out...unless it's a raid that i'm on, and i'm not at a point where I can leave it to help. Or, if i'm in a place in a zone where I can't leave.<br>
<br>
<br>
Could I have run to CoM? sure<br>
<br>
Would I have made it? maybe<br>
<br>
in the long run, it probably would have been better for me to run....I can't rely on ANY druid.<br>
<br>
but I guess it's my fault for thinking that others would be willing to lend a hand when someone needs help.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, if you're going to be an bitch, and not port someone....say it to their face. tell them.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to port you. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Don't feed them bull shit answers like....Sorry, I'm in a group....or sorry I'm low on mana. or sorry, i'm about to camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's what i'm really upset about here.<br>

<br>
<br>
so lemmie break it down.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) druid that could port was IN KARNOR's.<br>
2) Druid that could port was at ZONE.<br>
3) Druid's only excuse was that he was in a group...which had another druid in it that could port...so it wasn't like he was required for the group to function.<br>
<br>
Now I guess the point isn't so much that he wouldn't port me, it's that he was making up excuses NOT to port me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I could have raised him back to full mana within a matter of a couple mins...the whole thing would have been alot safer, and faster if he would have accepted. So other than the fact that they were lazy, I have no problems.<br>
<br>
If he would have said off the bat that &quot;how much time you got left on your corpse?....you think you can make it running? cause I just got in a group, and i've been porting people all day.&quot; I would have been happy with that answer, and gone on my &quot;not very marry&quot; way.<br>
<br>
But he gave me the answer &quot; sorry, in a group &quot;....which doesn't mean jack when you're in karnor's at the zone.<br>
<br>
and then he gave me the answer &quot;sorry, i'm low on mana&quot; my response....I have 2 mana songs that stack...I can get you to full mana in a matter of a couple mins, and I really need this port.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Boofy did not sell his account...he gave it to me. I now have 2 accounts, and 2 computers....one of the computers was unusable during the time.<br>
<br>
I do play boofy from time to time, and I do port people. However when people ask me for ports, and I don't want to port them, I let them know that i've been porting people for the past (x) amount of time, and I'd rather not...but if it's an emergency, such as the one I had...then I make an honest effort to help the person out in some way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwysteriaplushfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wysteria Plushfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#993300>(6/29/01 10:31:06 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flame on druids/wizards.</span><hr size=1> You're not interested in reading the other posts because you're wrong and you know it.  <br>

4) they were both about to leave...me telling them &quot;I have a port comming.&quot; is what was keeping them from leaving my ass in CoM.<br>
5) I didn't have my drums with me...Yes, I should have had an extra pair of drums in the bank, but I didn't.<br>
6) I'm thankful for the port I received.<br>
7) most of these flames against me are from people who weren't even there, and or didn't even read the entire flame.<br>
8) posting /flame wizards/druids is not an appropriate title for this flame....because the actions of a few do not constitue the flame of an entire class.<br>
9) *for kerney's sake* it's not a port, it's a GG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=272.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=269.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
