I am a proud member of the mystical titans guild and i have grown fairly close to estwing. Although i cant say that what happened wasnt true i can say that although est is alot of things he isnt someone who would go off and try to threaten and piss someone off. I know that u arent lieing but the fact of the matter is does someone deserved to be slandered and put down for something like this. It is a game '' A GAME'' and bogg or whatever ure name is u say that estwing is all types of bad stuff and u are getting everyone to hate him for how he was mean and rude to u. WELL HAVE you realized that what you are posting is something that is also rude. Although u may have a reason to do this to estwing you have no right to attack * mystical titans* or chengson or any other person who knows estwing. You are judging people on someones action and i will be damned if i sit back and let you talk all ure damn shit about the mystical titans being gay and /rude chengson. BECAUSE Chengson isnt estwing. Chengson is Chengson. Estwing was kicked out of Mystical titans. BECAUSE OF YOU! We are not the type of guild that wants people to think of us as bad or ksers. But to attack a guild based on one persons action is just as rude or ruder than what estwing does. And i think that you need to realize since you are throwing out insults left and right. I will stand behind estwing as a friend even though he has done something wrong and stand behind Mystical titans because we havent done something wrong as a guild Yet you are the person who is attacking it. I hope you know that u are just fueling the fire.<br>

He might not have seen that somene else was there and therefor when est got back up and killed it brog or whatever his name is might have thought that est ksed him. Not saying this is true just saying that this is a possibility.<br>

My only gripe with Mystical Titans was his status as a member.  Now that you booted his ass I have no quarrel with the guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vittorrio>Vittorrio</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/27/01 11:36:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> I am not calling you a liar friend.  Actually I have heard nothing but good things about you.  I know people in your guild and you come with a great reputation for honest game play.  All I was saying is that the AC is a frustrating camp...and maybe just maybe he did have the agro first.  He claims he popped on him.  Did you watch him pop, or did you track to him?  Also, I know Estwing has over 500kpp from working his arse off buying and selling in NFP.  Why would he risk KSing a mob for so little gain on his wedding day?  That just doesnt make sense to me.  He also has given me many items worth tons of pp without any expectations of repayment, why would a guy do that if he was so greedy?  Also, I am not saying you were wrong, he may have KSed you without knowing it. It happens, I have had 3 people KS me so far with AC while fear kiting him and then tell me I didnt have agro...sure it looks pretty obvious that he isnt my agro when he is running away right? But, I understood that mistake would be easy to make and the other people could have presumed I was lying myself.  See this could be a case where both of you feel you are lying.  My real anger with this is at Verant for being complete dumbasses.  The AC should not be MQable PERIOD.  This would stop idiots from selling the damn quest and let everyone like yourself and myself finally have a real chance at getting a great item.  and I have to be honest I lose respect for people that sell MQ for jboots.  That includes Estwing who is a friend.  I cannot make someone abide to MY morals however.  This is point is null for me now since Estwing is no longer a Titan.  My main concern was with my guilds reputation which I can assure you is based on friendships, which is why I am here in the first place.  I would also like to add that unlike some people here I have not called a single person a name and realize that you dont always see a person the same way as another because they treat you better.  <br>
<br>
Have fun and I hope you get your AC ring, I know I have yet to get mine due to KS...or was it a KS?<br>

And why I was also talking trash on Chengson. Yes I also think he's a worthless peice of shit right along with Estwing, kicking him out of his guild makes no difference to me. There were two seperate issues I spoke of initialy in my post. Maybe I should be more clear.<br>
<br>
1) I was not claiming camp on AC, I was using my druid to help a couple of new char's in SRo when the AC happened to pop ontop of me. I engaged the AC and I had been kiting the AC around when Estwing did infact come KS me. Was offered the option to loot *MY* mob, if I wanted to pay Estwing for it.<br>
<br>
2) My problem with Chengson. I decided to have chat with an officer from &quot;Mystical Titans&quot;. After talking to a member of the guild I find out that Estwing was an officer (he has since been removed), at this point I decide it would be better to have a chat with the guild leader. After a short chat with Chengson and finding him verbaly abusive (being called a 'stupid fucking n00b' and many various other words). I had enough to form my own opinions about Chengson.<br>
<br>
And so in closing... /rude Chengson /rude Estwing<br>
<br>
I never once said anything bad about &quot;Mystical Titans&quot; I just suggested staying away from a guild with such leadership.<br>
<br>

You can change accounts, you can create new characters... but an asshole is still an asshole. Eventualy you're reputation will be your downfall. <br>
<br>
THE END O_o<br>

<br>
The &quot;It's just a game&quot; argument: Is it not your time in real life that you invest? Time spent IRL = makes whatever that time was spent on worth quite a bit. That's where the value of money and everything you own comes from. Same thing goes for time invested in the game. It's a luxury, just like any possetions. Do you care when your possetions get fucked with? If I spilled wine all over your carpet out of maliciousness, would you get upset? If I was malicios and fucked with you in game, would it not affect you? In this example, if you were spending time camping and someone KSed, would you not be upset that that person was intentionally being a jerk and as a result wasted a crap load of your time? *sigh* Typical example of ppl who have no clue where value is derived. Botom line is that any time you spend time doing something, the margianl cost, if you want to use economic terms =P, is missing out on EVERYTHING else going on in the entire universe. So if some jerk comes in and fucks it up for you, they are wasting quite a bit more than &quot;just a game.&quot;<br>
<br>
*note I never claimed that Estwing KSed anyone, just tired of the cop-out argument that has no thought behind it. I was also going to point out a few things, but Boog seemed to cover them in his last post. And if you note, he never attacked Mystical Titans - he attacked Estwing because he said he KSed him, and Mystical Titans leader for not giving a crap, and insulting him.<br>

I play 18hours a day=)  He spends most of his time in nfp selling uber shiot.  Dunno if he bartered his way to riches or if the rumors that he hacks accounts is true (prior most believable).  Just know I dont care for the guy.  Stuck up and greedy. nuff said.<br>
