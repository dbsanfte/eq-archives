<br>
And I think you didn't read my post very carefully, yourself.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, national socialism and so-called communism didn't have &quot;holes&quot; that &quot;allowed&quot; the Stalins and Hitlers of the world; they were DESIGNED to create or empower them.<br>
<br>
But I am thinking this discussion is getting a tad off the /flame organized religion thread haha. <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">

<br>
Hm, I might just have to disagree with this.  Religion as a whole is responsible for quite a few deaths itself.  Religions haven't exactly been passive throughout history.  There were many religious battles in ancient times between all different religions.  Events such as the Spanish Inquisition or the Crusades are also not to be underestimated.  There was also the first genocide of the 20th century, where the muslim Ottoman Empire killed nearly 1.5 million Armenian Christians in some of the most awful ways you could imagine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barbie doll<BR><font color=#ff0000>lover</font></span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/31/02 2:09:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re:.</span><hr size=1> As you will note, I merely said that the great religions couldn't hold a candle to the great 'isms' -- and I have never heard it claimed that the Young Turks committed genocide against the Armenians because of religion -- I thought they were quite secular actually, just like the fascists of Germany, the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, etc etc.<br>

Religions have done their share of killing -- but again, nothing like the scale of the non-religious political movements of the 20th century <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">

Now everyone could bring up the whole priests molesting children, hell my local Bishop was brought up on charges within the last few weeks, he was proved innocent and i support that decision because i've heard him talk. And also within the last 3 weeks one of the Priests at my school was asked to leave because he kissed a girl, though they did not release where he did it, thier is no doubt in my mind that it was on the forehead or cheek, as he as done that to at least 400 of the 700 people in my school, both male and female. Nearly everyone I talk to has the mindset of &quot;I hope i don't find out who got him kicked out cause she'll get jumped&quot;, if i knew i'd tell people in a heartbeat, cause for attempting to ruin a persons life, ya i think she deserves to get jumped. Now by now your prolly saying wtf has this to do with Organized Religion, well i'm an Aethist have been for about 5 years, alot of people are against organized religion, I for one am not. I've met alot of great people who are the people they are because of thier faith. Faith is a great thing if you have it, it makes you stronger, more determined, and something to depend on when  your down. If people can find faith in organized religion let them, you may not believe in it but if they can get some peace in thier mind and hearts don't riddicule them, don't try to get them out of it, let them have it.  A while ago while at one of the School masses, the priest told a story of something that happened to him while he was  working in Ohio i think it was.  Well he had recently became a priest so he of course a shitty job, working at a Church in a real ghetto area, a place where major drug deals happened on the stairs of the church. So this 16-17 year old couple comes in and tell him that thier going to have a child, now the couple were really happy, the priest had a wow your actualy happy about this look on him. now months later they come in and i think they had a sonnogram (prolly spelled wrong) and the baby was going to have birth defects. When the kid was born it was premature, it had major birth defects and it wasn't going to live without life support. (I believe the child was so premature that he could literaly fit in your hand, being that it has been at least a month since i heard the story i can't recall it correctly) now The Parents wanted a funeral for the kid, and at the mass the father gave the homilee, now this part is also pretty fuzzy but i believe he something along the lines of this. Jesus died on the cross for us, alot of people don't really find him but i did, i found him in my son, his death gave me back my life, if i would have had him i'd never be able to go to college and do something with my life but because of him i can. thats about all i can remember and when the priest said it, he did a lot better job than i did. <br>

Organized religions do more to help this world than any other institutions.  Most religions have it in their beliefs to help the poor and the down trodden, to help those that often cannot help themselves.  Tell me, how many people outside of religions you see walking the streets of lower wacker drive in Chicago, or Skid row in L.A., or wherever feeding those that have no food, giving clothes to those that are freezing.  Tell me, would you have those people freeze and go hungry?<br>
<br>
You can prolly guess that I believe whole heartedly in organized religion, in reality especially Christianity (Biblical Christianity, not the hypocrisy that is portrayed as Christianity all too often.)  I will preach the good news which is Jesus' love, sacrifice, and ressurection for mankind for all my life.  I'm not saying I'm gonna *force* it on anyone, because if they don't wanna listen there is no point, but to anyone who will listen, I will share.<br>

<br>
You're such an inspiration for the ways <br>
That I'll never ever choose to be <br>
Oh so many ways for me to show you <br>
How the savior has abandoned you <br>
Fuck your God<br>
Your Lord and your Christ <br>
He did this <br>
Took all you had and <br>
Left you this way <br>
Still you pray, you never stray <br>
Never taste of the fruit <br>
You never thought to question why <br>
<br>
It's not like you killed someone <br>
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side <br>
Praise the one who left you <br>
Broken down and paralyzed <br>
He did it all for you<br>
He did it all for you<br>
<br>
Oh so many many ways for me to show you <br>
How your dogma has abandoned you <br>
Pray to your Christ, to your god <br>
Never taste of the fruit <br>
Never stray, never break <br>
Never---choke on a lie <br>
Even though he's the one who did this to you <br>
You never thought to question why <br>
<br>
Not like you killed someone <br>
It's Not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side <br>
Talk to Jesus Christ <br>
As if he knows the reasons why <br>
He did it all for you<br>
Did it all for you<br>
He did it all for you..<br>
<br>
Thank you A Perfect Circle.<br>
<br>
1) Im not a sheep to be watched over.<br>
2) I dont need a shepard to keep me in order.<br>
3) Just because a lot of people believe something to be true doesn't mean it is.<br>
4) If the belief of which I was raised as (Episcopalian) is true, then, on the day of our Judgement, I will be allowed to repent, and if, at that time, I take Christ into my heart, I will be forgiven.<br>
So if religion or some other set of beliefs makes your life better and does not hurt others, then Im all for it. But dont think, for ONE minute, I'll allow you to tell me what I should or should NOT believe in. What I choose to believe is just that, MY CHOICE, not yours, not anyone else's. If there is a God then he gave us free choice to CHOOSE not to believe in him. So, to all the people that push religion down other's throats or say that what you believe is wrong.... just let them remember this ONE point. Who are YOU to tell me what I believe is wrong, if it was, dont you think GOD would tell me? And if he's not telling ME that Im wrong and he's not telling YOU that you're wrong... what does that tell us? .... Maybe we are BOTH right? Maybe there isn't ONE true way..... <p><img

THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD<br>
<br>
The Lord is my shepherd,<br>

Even though I walk through the valley<br>
of the shadow of death,<br>
I fear no evil;<br>

<br>
But by what authority do you call the Bible the 'word of God?' for this is the first point to be settled. It is not your calling it so that makes it so, any more than the Mahometans calling the Koran the 'word of God' makes the Koran to be so. The Popish Councils of Nice and Laodicea, about 350 years after the time the person called Jesus Christ is said to have lived, voted the books that now compose what is called the New Testament to be the 'word of God.' This was done by yeas and nays, as we now vote a law. The pharisees of the second Temple, after the Jews returned from captivity in Babylon, did the same by the books that now compose the Old Testament, and this is all the authority there is, which to me is no authority at all. I am as capable of judging for myself as they were, and I think more so, because, as they made a living by their religion, they had a self-interest in the vote they gave.<br>
<br>
You may have an opinion that a man is inspired, but you cannot prove it, nor can you have any proof of it yourself, because you cannot see into his mind in order to know how he comes by his thoughts; and the same is the case with the word 'revelation.' There can be no evidence of such a thing, for you can no more prove revelation than you can prove what another man dreams of, neither can he prove it himself.<br>
<br>
It is often said in the Bible that God spake unto Moses, but how do you know that God spake unto Moses? Because, you will say, the Bible says so. The Koran says, that God spake unto Mahomet, do you believe that too? No. Why not? Because, you will say, you do not believe it; and so because you do, and because you don't is all the reason you can give for believing or disbelieving except that you will say that Mahomet was an impostor. And how do you know Moses was not an imposter? For my own part, I believe that all are impostors who pretend to hold verbal communication with the Deity. It is the way by which the world has been imposed upon; but if you think otherwise you have the same right to your opinion that I have to mine, and must answer for it in the same manner. But all this does not settle the point, whether the Bible be the 'word of God,' or not. It is therefore necessary to go a step further. The case then is: --<br>
<br>
You form your opinion of God from the account given of him in the Bible; and I form my opinion of the Bible from the wisdom and goodness of God manifested in the structure of the universe, and in all works of Creation. The result in these two cases will be, that you, by taking the Bible for your standard, will have a bad opinion of God; and I, by taking God for my standard, shall have a bad opinion of the Bible.<br>
<br>
The Bible represents God to be a changeable, passionate, vindictive Being; making a world and then drowning it, afterwards repenting of what he had done, and promising not to do so again. Setting one nation to cut the throats of another, and stopping the course of the sun till the butchery should be done. But the works of God in the Creation preach to us another doctrine. In that vast volume we see nothing to give us the idea of a changeable, passionate, vindictive God; everything we there behold impresses us with a contrary idea, -- that of unchangeableness and of eternal order, harmony, and goodness. The sun and the seasons return at their appointed time, and everything in the Creation proclaims that God is unchangeable. Now, which am I to believe, a book that any impostor might make and call the 'word of God,' or the Creation itself which none but an Almighty Power could make? For the Bible says one thing, and the Creation says the contrary. The Bible represents God with all the passions of a mortal, and the Creation proclaims him with all the attributes of a God.<br>
<br>
It is from the Bible that man has learned cruelty, rapine, and murder; for the belief of a cruel God makes a cruel man. That bloodthirsty man, called the prophet Samuel, makes God to say, (i Sam. xv. 3,) &quot;Now go and smite Amaleck, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
That Samuel or some other impostor might say this, is what, at this distance of time, can neither be proved nor disproved, but in my opinion it is blasphemy to say, or to believe, that God said it. All our ideas of the justice and goodness of God revolt at the impious cruelty of the Bible. It is not a God, just and good, but a devil, under the name of God, that the Bible describes.<br>
<br>
What makes this pretended order to destroy the Amalekites appear the worse, is the reason given for it. The Amalekites, four hundred years before, according to the account in Exodus xvii. (but which has the appearance of fable from the magical account it gives of Moses holding up his hands,) had opposed the Israelites coming into their country, and this the Amalckites had a right to do, because the Israelites were the invaders, as the Spaniards were the invaders of Mexico; and this opposition by the Amalekites, at that time, is given as a reason, that the men, women, infants and sucklings, sheep and oxen, camels and asses, that were born four hundred years afterwards, should be put to death; and to complete the horror, Samuel hewed Agag, the chief of the Amalekites, in pieces, as you would hew a stick of wood. I will bestow a few observations on this case.<br>
<br>
In the first place, nobody knows who the author, or writer, of the book of Samuel was, and, therefore, the fact itself has no other proof than anonymous or hearsay evidence, which is no evidence at all. In the second place, this anonymous book says, that this slaughter was done by 'the express command of God:' but all our ideas of the justice and goodness of God give the lie to the book, and as I never will believe any book that ascribes cruelty and injustice to God, I therefore reject the Bible as unworthy of credit.<br>
<br>
As I have now given you my reasons for believing that the Bible is not the word of God, that it is a falsehood, I have a right to ask you your reasons for believing the contrary; but I know you can give me none, except that you were educated to believe the Bible; and as the Turks give the same reason for believing the Koran, it is evident that education makes all the difference, and that reason and truth have nothing to do in the case. You believe in the Bible from the accident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same accident, and each calls the other 'infidel.' But leaving the prejudice of education out of the case, the unprejudiced truth is, that all are infidels who believe falsely of God, whether they draw their creed from the Bible, or from the Koran, from the Old Testament, or from the New.<br>
<br>
When you have examined the Bible with the attention that I have done, (for I do not think you know much about it,) and permit yourself to have just ideas of God, you will most probably believe as I do. But I wish you to know that this answer to your letter is not written for the purpose of changing your opinion. It is written to satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief of the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God; for in my opinion the Bible is a gross libel against the justice and goodness of God, in almost every part of it.<br>

THOMAS PAINE<br>

Paine was one of the best flame artists in American history.  As none of you quoting in favor of religion have an original concept amongst you, I'll continue to quote 200 year old sources beating down your &quot;logic&quot; until you finally get the clue that anything you can say has already been said, been beaten down, and buried by the next generation of priests.<br>

I don't know if he was first class flamer or not, but he sure was liar and a fool.  Man's cruelty existed long before the bible was written whether you happen to believe in the bible or not, certainly your common sense would allow you to admit this.<br>
<br>
Thomas Paine was a Deist, who believed that his &quot;religion&quot; of God's word being shown in Nature and was superior to Christians belief, Jewish belief, and Muslim belief.<br>
<br>
Hah yes, very original.  <br>
<br>
I hear so much about the hyprocisy of religion, but yet find it is just as rampant on the other side.  You point and say you can not prove it..but nor can you disprove it.<br>

From the Bible, concerning Paines' veiw of it twisting man to cruelty:<br>

You can quote supposedly logical arguments all day and it won't make a wit of difference to any religious person, be they Christian, Jewish, Moslem, etc.<br>
<br>
The point of religion is faith; it defies logic. Some would say that therefore it's hooey, but they are wrong -- someones beliefs are &quot;correct&quot;, merely because they are beliefs.<br>
<br>
When they cross the line into telling YOU what to do, then THEY are wrong. Or if they use that faith to justify wrong acts.<br>
<br>
But the bottom line is, neither those of faith or those not should be flaming the other side.<br>

<br>
The point of arguing religion is much less an excercise in right or wrong than it is one in mental growth and training.  Faith is almost always strengthened by such debates, so entering a debate of the sort with the intent of proving someone wrong is imbecilic.  Also, any debate tends to strengthen the mind of the participants, through use of the mind and through learning.  A win-win situation.<br>
<br>
Of course, eventually some idiot will step in and I'll resort back to trol....er, flaming this forum for stress relief.  Either way, it stands to be fun.<br>

I am well aware of the story surrounding Amalek.  He was a wicked and vicious man and apparently his cup with God had runneth over.<br>

To this day, the word Amelek  refers to the narrowest group possible of incorrigibles who dehumanize others. <br>

A number of men in Veitnam, having been subjected to the horrors of a war fought by peasents, turned to shooting all veitnamese after having seen friends shot down by female snipers and blown up by babies wearing bombs, and other atrocities involving what were, at the time, considered non-combatants.  These men were and are considered by our government, and most of the population, insane, cruel, and bloodthirsty.<br>

I suppose there is a difference, that makes slaying &quot;woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass&quot; not cruel?  Or do you support our fighting men &quot;gone mad&quot;, who slew anyone who wasn't american, burning villages in their wake?<br>
