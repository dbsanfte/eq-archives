<br>
And I think you didn't read my post very carefully, yourself.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, national socialism and so-called communism didn't have &quot;holes&quot; that &quot;allowed&quot; the Stalins and Hitlers of the world; they were DESIGNED to create or empower them.<br>
<br>
But I am thinking this discussion is getting a tad off the /flame organized religion thread haha. <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">

<br>
Hm, I might just have to disagree with this.  Religion as a whole is responsible for quite a few deaths itself.  Religions haven't exactly been passive throughout history.  There were many religious battles in ancient times between all different religions.  Events such as the Spanish Inquisition or the Crusades are also not to be underestimated.  There was also the first genocide of the 20th century, where the muslim Ottoman Empire killed nearly 1.5 million Armenian Christians in some of the most awful ways you could imagine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barbie doll<BR><font color=#ff0000>lover</font></span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/31/02 2:09:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re:.</span><hr size=1> As you will note, I merely said that the great religions couldn't hold a candle to the great 'isms' -- and I have never heard it claimed that the Young Turks committed genocide against the Armenians because of religion -- I thought they were quite secular actually, just like the fascists of Germany, the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, etc etc.<br>

Religions have done their share of killing -- but again, nothing like the scale of the non-religious political movements of the 20th century <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">

Now everyone could bring up the whole priests molesting children, hell my local Bishop was brought up on charges within the last few weeks, he was proved innocent and i support that decision because i've heard him talk. And also within the last 3 weeks one of the Priests at my school was asked to leave because he kissed a girl, though they did not release where he did it, thier is no doubt in my mind that it was on the forehead or cheek, as he as done that to at least 400 of the 700 people in my school, both male and female. Nearly everyone I talk to has the mindset of &quot;I hope i don't find out who got him kicked out cause she'll get jumped&quot;, if i knew i'd tell people in a heartbeat, cause for attempting to ruin a persons life, ya i think she deserves to get jumped. Now by now your prolly saying wtf has this to do with Organized Religion, well i'm an Aethist have been for about 5 years, alot of people are against organized religion, I for one am not. I've met alot of great people who are the people they are because of thier faith. Faith is a great thing if you have it, it makes you stronger, more determined, and something to depend on when  your down. If people can find faith in organized religion let them, you may not believe in it but if they can get some peace in thier mind and hearts don't riddicule them, don't try to get them out of it, let them have it.  A while ago while at one of the School masses, the priest told a story of something that happened to him while he was  working in Ohio i think it was.  Well he had recently became a priest so he of course a shitty job, working at a Church in a real ghetto area, a place where major drug deals happened on the stairs of the church. So this 16-17 year old couple comes in and tell him that thier going to have a child, now the couple were really happy, the priest had a wow your actualy happy about this look on him. now months later they come in and i think they had a sonnogram (prolly spelled wrong) and the baby was going to have birth defects. When the kid was born it was premature, it had major birth defects and it wasn't going to live without life support. (I believe the child was so premature that he could literaly fit in your hand, being that it has been at least a month since i heard the story i can't recall it correctly) now The Parents wanted a funeral for the kid, and at the mass the father gave the homilee, now this part is also pretty fuzzy but i believe he something along the lines of this. Jesus died on the cross for us, alot of people don't really find him but i did, i found him in my son, his death gave me back my life, if i would have had him i'd never be able to go to college and do something with my life but because of him i can. thats about all i can remember and when the priest said it, he did a lot better job than i did. <br>

Organized religions do more to help this world than any other institutions.  Most religions have it in their beliefs to help the poor and the down trodden, to help those that often cannot help themselves.  Tell me, how many people outside of religions you see walking the streets of lower wacker drive in Chicago, or Skid row in L.A., or wherever feeding those that have no food, giving clothes to those that are freezing.  Tell me, would you have those people freeze and go hungry?<br>
<br>
You can prolly guess that I believe whole heartedly in organized religion, in reality especially Christianity (Biblical Christianity, not the hypocrisy that is portrayed as Christianity all too often.)  I will preach the good news which is Jesus' love, sacrifice, and ressurection for mankind for all my life.  I'm not saying I'm gonna *force* it on anyone, because if they don't wanna listen there is no point, but to anyone who will listen, I will share.<br>

<br>
<br>
You're such an inspiration for the ways <br>
That I'll never ever choose to be <br>
Oh so many ways for me to show you <br>
How the savior has abandoned you <br>
Fuck your God<br>
Your Lord and your Christ <br>
He did this <br>
Took all you had and <br>
Left you this way <br>
Still you pray, you never stray <br>
Never taste of the fruit <br>
You never thought to question why <br>
<br>
It's not like you killed someone <br>
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side <br>
Praise the one who left you <br>
Broken down and paralyzed <br>
He did it all for you<br>
He did it all for you<br>
<br>
Oh so many many ways for me to show you <br>
How your dogma has abandoned you <br>
Pray to your Christ, to your god <br>
Never taste of the fruit <br>
Never stray, never break <br>
Never---choke on a lie <br>
Even though he's the one who did this to you <br>
You never thought to question why <br>
<br>
Not like you killed someone <br>
It's Not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side <br>
Talk to Jesus Christ <br>
As if he knows the reasons why <br>
He did it all for you<br>
Did it all for you<br>
He did it all for you..<br>
<br>
Thank you A Perfect Circle.<br>
<br>
1) Im not a sheep to be watched over.<br>
2) I dont need a shepard to keep me in order.<br>
3) Just because a lot of people believe something to be true doesn't mean it is.<br>
4) If the belief of which I was raised as (Episcopalian) is true, then, on the day of our Judgement, I will be allowed to repent, and if, at that time, I take Christ into my heart, I will be forgiven.<br>
So if religion or some other set of beliefs makes your life better and does not hurt others, then Im all for it. But dont think, for ONE minute, I'll allow you to tell me what I should or should NOT believe in. What I choose to believe is just that, MY CHOICE, not yours, not anyone else's. If there is a God then he gave us free choice to CHOOSE not to believe in him. So, to all the people that push religion down other's throats or say that what you believe is wrong.... just let them remember this ONE point. Who are YOU to tell me what I believe is wrong, if it was, dont you think GOD would tell me? And if he's not telling ME that Im wrong and he's not telling YOU that you're wrong... what does that tell us? .... Maybe we are BOTH right? Maybe there isn't ONE true way..... <p><img
