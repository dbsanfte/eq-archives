RE: your prior posting about my leaving a hate raid and your group titled /flame Tatianae<br>
<br>
During a 4 hour long drive home tonight, with my car radio dead, I had a lot of time on my hands to reflect upon everquest and my time spent here. I, in particular, reflected on this post. Don't ask me why, maybe I am weirdly fixated with it or maybe I just reflected upon some serious irony which I just feel may be worthy of sharing...because I think people tend to fly off the handle too fast (I am guilty of the same I am sure) in this game.<br>
<br>
I reflected on the night of the hate raid, and the fact that I was setting out for a five hour drive in four hours. I reflected on the fact that Dogguk felt compelled to come in here and falsify the facts. e.g. &quot;hate raid ended&quot;. I reflected on some of the other things I dislike / like about this game but what significance it has when you view your real world. I reflected on why I feel like the time I spend in game is valuable. That time is so valuable that I probably have a threshold for how much time I will spend with a group which isn't going well. <br>
<br>
This will really be too much info, but I think it really adds to my &quot;perspective&quot; and may help add to others &quot;perspective&quot; before they spend time beating people up in game, in here, treating others with disrespect (I don't tolerate it), and taking crap like this to the forum with the intent to take me out of the game after I invested 2 years of that very valued time of mine building up a character.<br>
<br>
I was driving home tonight from a trip...it has become a familiar trip to me now, a different city but with the same objective. It is the same trip which I made after getting my four hours of sleep from the hate raid referenced above which in fact did &quot;go on&quot;, Shaere lead it.<br>
<br>
These trips are hard...they are as hard as waking up in the morning these days for me...when I wake up and ask myself will I be strong or will I be sad. These trips I take are all the same...the same as I did today. Arrive in a city, hit the salvation army, hit the local libraries, scan the streets and every public parking lot, hunt through the parks, and inquire if people have seen a 32 year old man who may be well dressed in something like a Tommy Hilfiger shirt or maybe not.., but this man looks like me. I check the obituaries, I beg beg beg police departments to help me file a missing persons report. I spend time with my family where I try to reconcile my fathers angst and watch my mother vascillate from denial to sadness.<br>
<br>
<br>
I take these trips (which I leave hate raids for four hours of sleep for) to try to locate someone who held my hand walking to elementary school, fought with me in the back of the car on road trips, picked the TV up off my face when I was six, protected me from bully's in junior high, comforted &amp; understood me when I rebelled in my teens, this person whom I watched walk across a platform to receive a diploma from one of the best universities in this state, and whom I admired for his success in his career. This person suddenly, mysteriously, disappeared on September 26, 2000. This person is someone I know and love much more than your cartoon, this person is my brother. That is right I love my brother more than your stinking hate raid..and if you have endless hours to waste squabbling over loot and coffins that is great but I needed my four hours of sleep.<br>
<br>
I am suspended in this strange pergatory daily, not knowing whether to mourn, cry or be strong and hopeful... but I am very quick to rationalize at any given time, that I don't care about your cartoon if your cartoon is being a jerk or wasting enormous amounts of my time.<br>
<br>
I reflected on this post because...well just because deleting Tatianae was the only way I saw fit to get away from this bullshit we call a game..but doesn't feel like a game. To get away from people who accuse me of being a &quot;spoiled brat&quot;. I reflected because in some way it makes me angry and I am not sure why. As I thought about it though...it became clearer as to why it makes me angry.<br>
<br>
It makes me angry because this person was mad enough to come in here and spout off that I am a spoiled brat because I had to go sleep, or valued my time, or leave when I feel people are disrepectful...I may even leave to avoid what I really want to do which is lash out. I want to lash because I am dealing with my real life and you are consuming xxx number of hours of that valued real life time being utterly ridiculous and I know that you could potentially waste more hours of that real life time sending me in to a CR. You know when you are playing well and you know when you are playing like crap....we all know. I always try to get my group to a safe place and make an excuse to log when I am playing badly enough to put people in danger...<br>
<br>
I am a person with real life concerns and worries and constraints on how far I am willing to go in this game. I just don't have time to deal with things in the game which may impact things that I value more..e.g my career (I have to be up in a reasonable hour so I don't want to CR after 10pm), my trips to find my brother (I have to sleep to drive to them), my self-respect (I don't have to stand around and tolerate people speaking to me like a child or a moron).<br>
<br>
Dogguk, I will wake up in the morning and look very deep in to my already very heavy heart and try to muster up some element of concern about whether your cartoon got to cast magical spells in game...when I need sleep to drive out of town for my real life, very serious, quest. You know what? I can dig very deep in to my heart, but that concern just isn't going to be there....You are the selfish one...I can honestly and straightforwardly say you are the one who is thinking about nothing but himself. You are the one who thought only of yourself when you put my tells on ignore instead of working things out and taking it in here instead. You are the one who is concerned about &quot;your&quot; cartoon more than whether or not I have real life issues which require me to weigh and prioritize my in game activities so they don't impede upon my real life time.<br>
<br>
I just want to thank you, from the bottom of my very tired heart, for taking that final step to force me to leave...because I just can't muster up a single element of give a shit about you. You are nothing in my eyes but a twerp who didn't take your issues to me in tells and decided to flame me in here..<br>
<br>
Before you children decide to come in here and bash others, you may try and inquiry or two of the people you have issues with in tells. They may also have real life concerns, real life values upon which you are impeding.<br>
<br>
Before you decide to act like a paramilitary leader - understand how to speak to people with respect.<br>
<br>
Before you decide to jack around in a dungeon - putting others at a potential of several wasted hours of corpse retrieval..consider if they may have other things to do in those several hours which are very real life matters. This game is phenomenally long, everything takes a long time, corpse retrieval, raids, experience....respect peoples time as everyone, I am sure, has other real life matters to attribute time to.<br>
<br>
I put this in here, because I baffle at the irony...I really do baffle at it. It is profoundly amazing to me how seriously petty people are in this game..I repeat the age old statement 'It's a game!&quot; some nights and some groups will go well and some won't. Deal with it or go out and experience the real world a while so you too can take a moment to step back and reflect upon just how unimportant a cartoon is in life.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for reminding me how ignorant it is to take this game seriously...and how ignorant and unconcerned others can be in the game. There are bigger issues in the world to deal with folks.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 3/15/01 7:40:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaakla2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aakla2</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=ttp://www.geocities.com/aakla2/EQ000014.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#939393>(6/11/01 1:31:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flame Dogguk</span><hr size=1> bump <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=115.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=111.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
