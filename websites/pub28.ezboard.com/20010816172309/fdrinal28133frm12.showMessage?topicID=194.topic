  Kvasir<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Let me start by saying that I have grouped with many AA in the past, be it at dragon raids, seb, guk, solb etc. My experiences with AA members have been for the most part great; they have treated me kindly and were fun people to group with. This is being written because of an atrocity that I have been told of that happened sometime this weekend.<br>
<br>
Let me start of my giving you a little summary of the evening. Kvasir, flubbie and pharos went to TT to get some seb keys. During the course of the camp, a ceremonial iksar breastplate drops. This breastplate that dropped would have been an extremely beneficial upgrade for one of the members in the group, but instead it was not given to that member by default (like it should have according to the AA charter), not rolled, but rather taken by Kvasir because he said he needed it for his warrior twink. I just find it totally appalling and sickening that you would screw over a guild/group member like you did the other day. I would like to know why you did this? You were grouped with someone who was wearing a bloodstained tunic! You cant tell me that a twink of yours could get more use out of the tunic, or deserve the tunic more than a member of your own group and guild!<br>
<br>
Along side the fact that you felt that a twink of yours deserves the item more than a level 50 shaman who is using a crappy breastplate, you even disobeyed the guilds charter! “The most logical loot policy for the guild is &quot;need before greed&quot;. Present usable classes should be first to lotto for any items.” Hence the term “need before greed.” It is utterly sickening that you would take an item from a guild member you were grouped with, a primary character at that, to use for your twink (and from grouping with pharos many times in the past, I know for a fact she would have given it to the person who could have used the item). There was only one person present that could have benefited from the item, let alone use the item. What if you 3 were running to unrest to meet for a kedge raid or something of that nature, and pharos ran across Bilge, killed him and looted a pearl kedge totem. How would you feel if she said it was going to her twink? If it were me in the group with you at the time, and I was the only one who could use the item and this ordeal occurred, I would be extremely angry. And I imagine that this is the way one of your group members feels. <br>
<br>
I used to have a lot of respect for AA, and I still do, but when I see any of your members now it will be with a raised eyebrow. I just don’t see the logic behind screwing over one’s own guild members. <br>

<br>
This is my fault to be sure. My apologies for that but a friend had used my account last evening. Usually when he does this he will not interact with the guild or people that I know but I suppose when Flubbie ask for help with his Seb key he felt that he could handle it. He had informed me about helping Flubbie and about the BP after the fact so I am afraid there was nothing I could do about it. This should not reflect upon AA for he is not an AA member. Again my apologies. <br>

Hi folks. Been a long time since I've interjected my opinion here but I have to say something now. Kvasir, first of all, it's against EQ policy to let someone else use your account. Even though it wasn't your fault that this person acted irresponsibly, I feel it is now your duty to get that BP back from your &quot;friend&quot; and give it to the person in the group who should have gotten it in the first place. Obviously no one can force this action but it's the right thing to do, and I'm sure you know that. If this ever happened in my guild, officer or not, I would promptly remove you from the guild for acting in an irresponsible manner. Not knowing you personally or in game, I'm not about to judge your ethics, but here is your test. You run with it how you want to.<br>

Edit: Kvasir, your character wears the AA guild tag. Anything your character does, whether played by you or someone else, reflects upon AA as a guild. Even if your &quot;friend&quot; was playing anon, /guildstatus still returns the fact that Kvasir is an officer of AA. <br>

I agree 100% with Willowe. You are ultimately responsible for your characters actions. If you want to rectify this situation and remain a credible person, I suggest that you return the bp to the person it should have been awarded to in the first place. As of now, I know there are a handful of people with mixed feeling towards this issue, and they too believe that this is unacceptable and ridiculous. Throughout my EQ “career,” I have seen many people get screwed over, but this is tops in my book. A guild/group member screwing over one of their own, I still find that hard to believe. I sure hope you do the right thing…<br>

I am sorry you feel that way about the this situation, but as far as taking this BP back from some one who earned it I will do no such thing. First of all he did not have to go out to TT to help some one get a key and second of all he soloed the mob in question himself. As far as letting him play my account from time to time in order to GG himself and what not will be left to my discretion and mine alone. You are of course entitled to your opinions but I would hardly think this is something to kick up a fuss over, especially since if he wasn't so willing to help out some one else this would not have happened in the first place. Perhaps he should have just turned Flubbie down and not gotten him a Seb key eh? Sounds like a better course of action in the future for fear of whiney retribution. <br>

Hopefully any disputes can be settled between the affected parties quietly and between themselves as adults. Any dispute that cannot be resolved in this manner will be taken to the Arcane Council. It is the involved parties responsibility to involve the council . <br>
<br>
This is the part of our charter that i assume was missed by Suven and Willowe. No disputes in guild will be handled on the boards. This is a guild matter and will be handled in guild as per our charter. <br>

Again, apologies for the length of the post but what happened here is just plain WRONG and I don't think that handling it in the &quot;council&quot; will be sufficient.  This is something that everyone needs to be aware of.  I'm prepared for opposing opinions to be sure, but Kvasir, give me a freakin' break!  You WILL NOT ask for that BP back???  Oh, yeah, I forgot, the &quot;friend&quot; playing your character didn't even have to help in the first place.  How FUCKING noble of your &quot;friend&quot;.  HEY anyone out there, if you need help getting Sebilis keys, give Willowe a tell in game and she'll help you with no further obligation on your part, she won't loot whore from you and she won't remind you over and over again that she did YOU a favor by helping YOU get YOUR sebilis key.  I'm done.  Thanks.<br>

 After reading this, and seeing how much of an arrogant jerk Kvasir and company are, I plan to not group with them ever. Not that I have the slightest clue as to who they are, but that sickens me, it sickens me even more that he did it to his own guild mate, and that their own guild went and yelled at Pharos over it. Shows how truly greedy some people are. I am sure I will see Kvasir selling his Iksar BP in NFP, what a sick greedy person you are. I hope one  day while you are in fearplane, a druid breastplate drops and some warrior ninja loots it.. &quot;oops&quot;, or better yet, I hope you never get help on your epic, and we all know a druids epic is somewhat hard.. but whatever.. in your game, it's greed before need.. but in mine, it's always and always will be need before greed. So act like you are higher of a man/woman and not flame me back, but we all know if you do, it's only because I spoke the truth. See you around Kvasir.. in one way or another<br>

I am making the assumption that the shaman was wearing the tunic. Riddle me this...how would a shaman be benificial going 4 less wisdom? wait..lemme guess..the benefits come out of the shammy selling the damn thing to get better wisdom enhancing items. LOL. Come on guys..gimme a break. This item was designed primarly for a melee class..not a caster. If you had a problem with the druid taking the tunic why didnt you settle right then and there? He said he has a warrior alt. Wouldnt he be the most beneficial getting the item? gawd..it looks like a case of greed on the shammies side as well..go figure! <br>

The facts are, based on the members class of that hunting party, is that none..nada..not one would have benefited from an Iksar BP!<br>

For one, higher AC.. For two, the effect. When you go in sebilis and camp the fungi tunic, the two primary classes to random for it are: monks and shamans<br>
For monks, because they can use while feigned death and for shamans, they can use while casting Cannibalize line of spells<br>
4 wisdom? Big deal.. thats like 40 mana at level 50.. I'm sure someone can drop that much. I for one would say, goodbye to the Blood stained tunic and hello to the Iksar BP if I had the chance. <br>
<br>
Shamans use a spell called cannibalize, it takes hp and converts it to mana. That's why the breastplate is good for shamans, because of the regen =)<br>
<br>
Edited: Edited out rude sarcasm, wasn't trying to offend and now that I reread it, I see it as offensive, I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
Edit: Wisdom isn't the most important stat for a shaman. When you get high enough to be able to drop some wisdom.. and I think at 50 Pharos should be able to.. You start focusing on other stats.. I think a lot of people have it set that there is some race to getting 200 wisdom, I think a shaman is a much better player with more AC than wisdom. <br>

So to that Phar *whatever your name is, sorry couldn't remember* don't even let those guys in AA try and bring ya down, take the fight right back to them as you did, I applaud you. Let them spread all the rumors they want, what it comes down to is people who know you, know it's a bs coverup to pass the buck off on you. <br>
<br>
To the guy who's so called &quot;friend&quot;, btw that excuse is so over used. Nice try to cover up more then likely it was you and you wanted to see if you'd get away with it so you make a fake friend as a scapegoat, nice try slick, saw it before, some of us are good at reading between the lines. Anyhow about this &quot;friend&quot; and you not doing anything by making him give back that nice bp to someone who NEEDS it, more then your lame twink warrior, just shows me you're not worthy to be in an upstanding legit guild. I am not flaming all AA members, only the officers and those who defend such a greedy punk like that Kvasir. You know what the right thing to do is and you didn't do it, tells me there IS and never was a &quot;friend&quot; it was your greedy butt all along, not only are you a theif but a liar now as well. Meneldil said it right, greed /sigh<br>
<br>
So as the friendly shamaness ahead of me so nicely put, don't bother asking her for a group, well add me to your list, I'd be darned to help someone of your low character out as well. Funny thing is, I never met ANY of the above people, but the story alone caught my attention and I cannot stand greedy guilds like that and officers who set out to make BS up about someone just because they spoke the truth, fact is the officers are now as guilty as Kv, since they failed to to do their job. Slackers, bah go figure.<br>

Probably, widely known for my huge mouth.. if at all. But the only person I've grouped with here before is Slinker.. I've seen Mene and you about =) Never met Willow, Pharos, or Kvaris.. so I'm assuming, since they were camping for the seb key, that is probably why =) Heh, I wish this game wasn't so full of greed sometimes, but when you think about it.. the game is primarily: Kill, loot, level.. repeatedly.. so somewhere in there.. mainly loot, there falls greed. I think when people get in the post 50's and start seeing how things work more, they will understand WHY there is need before greed. Let's face it, this game gets flat out HARD at some points. Everyone has their wishlists and wantlists, and not everyone gets EVERYTHING they want. So, it's nice when something on your wishlist drops, but kind of a big disappointment to lose it because of greed.<br>
<br>
 It's like this druid who I saw in Karnors castle the other day while waiting for a gate to EJ. He was asking for a group and somehow the topic came up about how his group from the night before were camping in the hand room, and a druid ES Vambrace dropped. Well.. the leader of the group, decided to do a full random, even though this poor druid needed it. He lost to an enchanter. The enchanter was pissed when he went linkdead, can you believe the greed there? The guy even logged back in and gave the ES Vambrace to the enchanter who won. What nobility lies in that poor guy. I wanted to give him some money to buy some, but I had given 17k to my guild. So I was too broke. But I've heard stories from many different people on how they get screwed over, and itpisses me off that people act like this. It's like those two best friends who filed a law suit against each other over a coca cola million dollars. One friend was saying it should be hers since the coke was given to her, it was a gift. The other said since she bought the coke, it was hers. I think if I won, I'd split it 50/50.. and if my friend won and didn't want to, then that's her problem.. not going to bitch at her about it.. I'd be congratulating her for it.. that's what true friendship is. And that's what this game is supposed to be about. Making friends andf having fun. Not getting loot and getting greedy.<br>
<br>
Whatever floats your boats I guess<br>

being a shaman myself, i feel my chloroplast is good enough regen.  i rarely use canni, only in the few times when i get into a group and im the only healer.  so if was to win a iksar regen bp, id use it. then when the novilty wore off, id sell it.  im sure there are more bp's out there that would be more benifical to shaman that a regen bp of any type.  yes i am a member of AA, i am not sticking up for those involed(i wasnt there, im not an officer, trying to save the integrity of a great guild.  why do people assume the whole guild is greedy and selfish?  thats not very fair.  <br>

I have no idea who Suven is.  I know who Pharos is and I know who Flubbie is and I know who Kvasir is, but I don't know them as in I've never hunted/grouped with any of them before (that I can recall anyway).  The reason I posted the whole ordeal on here was because Faril, the guild leader and EzOp for the Arcane Asylum board, closed the thread.  I have known him, in the past, not only to close threads, but to delete them entirely when they did not suit him or the image of his guild.  It was my OPINION, and I stress my OPINION, that what took place on the TT hunt for Sebilis keys was wrong.  Suven had originally made the first post to the AA board which was followed by a response from Kvasir which was just lame, lame, lame.  I then posted what I thought about the whole thing, on the AA board, and so on.  Then Faril closed the thread, not allowing anyone to further comment.  He said this matter would be dealt with at the guild officer level.  Here is my problem with that.  Apparently, Suven was/is not a member of AA and secondly, Kvasir IS an officer.  The matter started out as a public one and should have been concluded as a public one to the satisfaction of the parties involved.  This wasn't going to happen in a closed thread.  I am not saying that the entire group of people making up the guild Arcane Asylum are bad, greedy, or should be punished.  So, Spin, I'm sorry if that's how you took it.  I'll be the first to say that the entire guild is NOT corrupt.  Hmm, perhaps the manner in which sticky issues is handled is a bit below par but I'm not judging the guild on that.  AND as I stated before, if ANYONE would like help getting Sebilis keys, or anything else for that matter, give Willowe a tell in game and she'll be happy to help, free of charge, whenever she can, no strings attached.<br>

In this case however i feel as though i must respond.<br>
<br>
 I closed this thread on the AA open forum because i felt it was a guild matter that should be dealt with in guild , and still feel that way. I did attempt to get BP back but as it is no longer on a AA member i have no way of doing so. For this i apologize to all involved parties as it should have been lottoed between all group members. As far as Kvasir is concerned i still feel that he is a honorable person but due to the incident involving his friend using the account , Kvasir is no longer an Arcane Asylum officer.<br>
<br>
 I do apologize to the involved parties and am saddened that they decided to leave AA before i had the opportunity to resolve the matter. I also take full responsibility for the matter because as guildleader all actions taken by the officers in Arcane Asylum are my responsibilty.<br>
