<br>
Guild Charter for : &quot;Ancient Realm&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Mission Statement:<br>
<br>
Simply put, we are here to have fun and achieve our goals as a cohesive unit. Many people in Ancient Realm have been previously guilded, and we have left our old guilds because something was lacking, amiss, or just plain wrong. What we seek to create with Ancient Realm is an environment in which players may explore all the opportunities that the game allows, and enjoy doing so with a solid core of guildmates with whom they enjoy spending their time. (after all, does the game boil down to anything else??) This is the place that we have created for ourselves to escape the greed, squabbles, and pettiness that so often seem to plague the game. While acquiring items and experience is a main objective in the game, this IS NOT our main objective in the guild. We strive to create and maintain a home that we are proud to call such.<br>
<br>
1. Joining Ancient Realm:<br>
To avoid problems repeated over and over in guild in the past and present, membership will be limited and somewhat exclusive. Not to set us in Ancient Realm aside from anyone else, or assume superiority, but simply enough we want to protect our home. A guild that grows slowly with firm roots and bonded members is better off than the guild that goes from 2-100 members in a week and falls apart the next. That being said, guild recruitment and invites will be handled as such:<br>
All potential members will be required to visit our message boards under the &quot;General&quot; forum and post a brief application (explaining what you feel you have to offer the guild and your reasons for joining).<br>
Officers will confer with Euth, and after weighing their opinions with those of the guild as a whole, a decision will be made. Euth is the ultimate authority as to whether or not someone is allowed in, but while this may be a Dictatorship, it WILL NOT be tyranny.<br>
<br>
2. Authority:<br>
Our guild leader is Euth. Our sole officer is Kilrog. As an officer of Ancient Realm, he represents Euth and is left in charge in his absence. Bring any guild problems or questions to either Euth or Kilrog.<br>
<br>
3. Guild Responsibilities:<br>
It is the responsibility of all of our members to portray Ancient Realm with the utmost honor. All rules and play nice policies of EQ will be strictly adhered to. It is also the responsibility of all members to keep themselves updated on current events and topics by visiting, reading, and posting regularly on the message boards. It is required that members visit the boards twice a week to keep up to date. It is encouraged for everyone to take a few minutes every time they log on to review the boards first.<br>
Guild shouts are our forum and telling our brothers and sisters hello and good bye is encouraged. It is also far better to answer a question with &quot;I don't know&quot; rather than with silence. This also includes day to day grouping. We prefer Ancients to group with Ancients when possible, and when this is not an immediate option, fellow Ancients should be considered first for any group openings as they become available. Granted this may not be possible 100% of the time…but as a guild, we are here to help each other out, and if you don't group together, you don't build the trust and confidence in your guildmates that is so necessary to carry us forward as a whole. Raids, events, and specialized &quot;camp&quot; groups are set up to help individuals in reaching their goals as well as Ancient Realm as a whole to do the same. We are all here for each other, and the good times that result.<br>
<br>
4. Guildchat:<br>
There will be no swearing or disrespect of any guildmember or other guild in the /guildsay channel. Put plainly, under no circumstance will harassment or prejudice due to race/age/gender/religion/lifestyle or any other reason be put up with. Nobody is here to badmouth anybody else, or to listen to someone else do so, so that being said there will be none in guildsay…period. If someone slips up and cusses, apologize-it is forgivable, it happens…but lets be mature and choose our words before we spit them out. If you just HAVE to swear something or shout out some all-encompassing expletive, at least make up something cool and witty--- like HORSEPUCKY!!!<br>
There will be no belittling, disrespecting, or flaming of any sort done by a member of Ancient Realm in /guildsay, /shout, or /ooc channels. If you must direct your anger at someone, do so in /tells. If you feel that an issue cannot be fairly resolved privately, bring it to Kilrog or Euth. We ask that you please discuss any problems regarding the guild with Euth or Kilrog, seeing as problems gone undiscussed and unresolved do not disappear. Please remember that through whatever frustration you may have, the goal is here is to help and grow, not the contrary.<br>
<br>
5. Raids:<br>
All Ancient Realm members are encouraged to attend other raids, and hold open raids. However, being in a guild means that yes, guild members may come first. This is not to say every piece of loot goes to us on a raid, merely that if you're doing fear, the majority of druids, if they wish to go, will be Ancients. When on a raid (whether it be our own or somebody else's) it is expected that you will conduct yourself in a way befitting of and representing Ancient Realm. It is mandatory that those invited on raids listen to and follow the directions of the leader at ALL times. Any action by which you cause yourself to be blacklisted or defamed by another guild will be cause for review. If the review is negative strong disciplinary action will take place, up to being /guildremoved.<br>
Epics- Of course everyone wants to get their epic, seeing as it is the best item that their class allows. Ancient Realm strives to accommodate everyone in terms of item and epic camps, but nobody is guaranteed an epic weapon. If you would like to plan a time/date for an epic run that would involve more than just one group, please do so at least 48 hours in advance and give as much information as possible. Nobody is expected to drop what they are doing and rush to a raid/epic run at the drop of a hat, but participation is highly encouraged, granted proper time was allowed to prepare.<br>
<br>
6. Loot:<br>
All loot gained in guild events and raids is considered initially to be property of the guild. This will be distributed on a need/greed basis beginning with those present, and then primary characters who are not present. This is generally done using a system of &quot;full random&quot;. All members who can and will use an item will /tell the person leading the event and a roll will be made. The item will go to the winner of that roll. One exception to the full random policy is when someone is on their last two pieces in a set of planar equipment. In this situation the person should notify the leader and the loot will be defaulted to them. This is the only type of seniority condoned by Ancient Realm... bottom line. The only other time loot will not be full random is when the raid is specifically set up for a person to get an item… i.e. Kilrog sets up a plane of Air raid to get his spiroc wingblade for the last part of his epic quest. The Spiroc Wingblade that drops from the plane would be Kilrog's default loot to complete the step of his epic, as planned. If you have any questions about how loot will be distributed on a raid check with the person leading. The leader will always set specific loot regulations for the raid so long as they do not directly violate any policies of Ancient Realm such as assigning loot by &quot;seniority&quot; or &quot;rank&quot;. Bottom line is this- the leader makes the looting policy, and those following the leader will uphold it. If an unfair policy is set, or leadership privileges abused, actions will be taken to ensure that that person does not lead/abuse that right again. Items acquired in guild raids that are no longer needed return to the guild vault, to be distributed among those that need by Euth or the Officers. Items NOT acquired in guild raids that are no longer needed may be dealt with at the owner's discretion. We encourage hand-downs and help with items that guildmates can use, but do not require it unless the item was gained during a guild event.<br>
<br>
<br>
7. Alternates:<br>
Having alternate characters is suggested as we all know what character burnout can be like. However, for the time being, only one of your alternate characters will be allowed to wear the Ancient Realm guildtag. This is done mainly to facilitate communication between guildmates under a circumstance that would require us to log off (ie: breaking the planes and having to /q or camp out).<br>
<br>
Basic day to day rules:<br>
1) At all times respect your brother and sister guildmates.<br>
2) The /anonymous and /roleplay commands are not allowed. If you are being asked for SoW/Res/Clarity etc. and cannot lend your aid, say so politely…there is nothing wrong with that.<br>
3) Guild shouts are a forum for us all. Problems and arguments should be dealt with privately, and flaming or harassment of any type will not be tolerated.<br>
4) If there is a problem that cannot be resolved in one on one tells it should be taken to Kilrog or Euth who will mediate.<br>
5) At all times respect your brother and sister guildmates.<br>
6) It is expected that guildmates in need of assistance will be given all reasonable aid.<br>
7) Begging for aid beyond the reasonable is not permitted. If you have questions as to why someone cannot lend you aid, politely ask them. If you have questions as to what is reasonable, ask Kilrog or Euth, or just use common sense.<br>
 Profanity in guild shouts is not permitted. If you slip up apologize.<br>
9) No discrimination of ANY sort is welcome within the guild halls, let alone guildchat. Period.<br>
10) AT ALL TIMES RESPECT YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER GUILDMATES!<br>
<br>
Anything that may have been left out of the charter is being left to the common sense of the guild. The members are trusted to understand what is and is not condoned, and any issue that is left unclear or questioned should and will be brought to the Officers for clarification.<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read the Guild Charter for Ancient Realm. Amendments may be made to the charter and implemented as deemed necessary by Euth. The rules and policies covered in the charter are non-negotiable, and will not be bent or broken for anyone-Officers included. Any constructive suggestions or questions are welcome, and both Euth and Kilrog are available to answer questions or clear up misconceptions.<br>
