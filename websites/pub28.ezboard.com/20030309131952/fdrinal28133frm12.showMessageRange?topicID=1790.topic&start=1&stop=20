This may also serve to inform peeps in WL and CT as to why I am no longer in the guild because almost everyone has no fricking idea what the hell happened!<br>
<br>
So let me give a bit of background.  Mojoo never wanted me in WL.  Simple really.  He tried every trick under the sun to get me blocked from guild entry but, at the end of the day, he was outvoted.  Hell, while I was a trial member he even tried to use an excuse that I had pissed off one of the guild clerics (Heallany) by saying she might be a tad too low level for a danger-group in Cazic Thule.  This was news to Heallany and was certainly news to me.  FYI Heallany left WL in disgust after Mojoo unilaterally /guildremoved her hubby for linking VT loot to guild chat.  <br>
<br>
At the risk of sounding like an item-oriented waster I'll say that the final fight happened because of an item.  If you have immediate perceptions of loot whores, whining shits who complain when they don't get what they want and so on then kindly piss off immediately cos you'll miss the point entirely.  Since I joined WL the only thing I have been after is a weapon upgrade.  Everyone knows this.  I've been waiting patiently for my time to come up and hardly grumbled when the last bard rapier from Cursed went to Genuven even though he had a Lava Infused Bludgeon.  Why?  Because I am not that fussed about equipment because the majority of it doesn't have much of an effect outside of raid situations.<br>
<br>
But when we headed off to whack the Arch Lich on Sunday he turned out to be holding a Lava Infused Bludgeon, a rather nice little bard weapon.   The last time this thing dropped someone apparently had to loot it to stop it from rotting but for me it would have been a rather nice little boondoggle.  So I sent Mojoo a tell...<br>
<br>
[Sun Dec 15 22:52:17 2002] You told mojoo, 'Can I have a quick word in your ear Mojoo?'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 22:52:27 2002] Mojoo tells you, 'whats that?'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 22:52:57 2002] You told Mojoo, 'Don;t normally do this but PLEASE try to get that damned bludgeon for us '<br>
[Sun Dec 15 22:53:03 2002] Mojoo tells you, 'no i have'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 22:53:09 2002] You told Mojoo, 'what?'<br>
<br>
*crickets*<br>
<br>
Absolutely gob-smacking!  Because Mojoo already has this weapon I can just piss off and die?  I seethed through the fight, watched Gabrielle win the Bludgeon for CT (grats Gabby), waited until we were out of Ssra and opened fire.<br>
<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:27:05 2002] You told mojoo, 'What the hell?  Is there some particular reason why you refuse to equip me? '<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:27:41 2002] Mojoo tells you, 'if u dont like our officer decisions dont let the door hit u in the ass on the way out'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:28:13 2002] You told Mojoo, 'That is not answering the question.  Is there a reason why YOU are refusing to equip me?'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:28:37 2002] Mojoo tells you, 'dont piss me off'<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:07 2002] Taking a screenshot...<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:19 2002] You say to your guild, 'Well folks, I have my screenshots for the day.  '<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:20 2002] It will take you about 30 seconds to prepare your camp.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:24 2002] It will take about 25 more seconds to prepare your camp.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:29 2002] It will take about 20 more seconds to prepare your camp.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:30 2002] You are no longer a member of Winter's Light.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:33 2002] You no longer have a target.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:34 2002] You abandon your preparations to camp.<br>
[Sun Dec 15 23:29:43 2002] You tell fusion:1, '?'<br>
<br>
So there you have it folks.  Mojoo removed me from the guild FOR TAKING A SCREENSHOT!<br>
<br>
This is absolutely fucking ridiculous.  I have heard storied from other people who left the guild about Mojoo being a crack-addled, piss-brained tin-pot Hitler wannabe but I've always been able to live with it.  He is, after all only one person.  But this type of bullshit takes the biscuit.  I've heard stories from every corner of the server as to how much of a complete cunt this guy is but while the rest of WL were good guys (and trust me, they are ALL good guys.  Hell, I've even made up with Dilandau since we got out of KC) it was something I could overlook.  But the simple fact is, this guy is on a total fucking power trip.  He's enacting all those little pent up aggressions he hasn't got the balls to manifest in real life and he is doing it to the people within the guild.  EVERYONE knows about him getting drunk, logging in and guildremoving random people for the fuck of it.  THIS IS NOT THE WAY A GUILD LEADER SHOULD BEHAVE!  He's an utter twat at the best of times but usually he's just a Polpot without the charisma.  <br>
<br>
In fact a few weeks ago someone asked me if it was worth joining WL.  I replied that it was a great guild with a surprising number of superb people to play with.  And in fact, there was only one person who was a complete headcase in the entire guild.  Unfrotunately, he is the guild leader.<br>
<br>
The sad thing is he used to be a nice guy to play with.  In the old Winter's Light he was a decent bloke.  You could have a nice chat with him, talk about this and that and generally have a fun time playign with him.  Then he server-moved, server-moved back again, set up WL in his own image and, somewhere down the line, became Charles Manson's best buddy.  True, he always had a face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle but personality goes a long way.  Unfortunately right now his should go as far away from the rest of humanity as is physically possible.<br>
<br>
While I'm chatting about WL I should throw in a quick apology to the other officers.  Sorry for making your lives a living hell and not coming straight out with what I should have said a looong time ago.  guarded references to changing the guild's officers always got misinterpreted as meaning that the guys I was talking to were not up to scratch.  Well, rest assured, you all do a fine job.  Shouja, Madrone, Bazel, Craxx, Karv, you are all great guys and it was really fun raiding with you.  <br>
<br>
Oh wait a moment!  That's right!  Not Karv at all.  He left cos he was also sick of Mojoo's primadonna antics.  I almost forgot.<br>
<br>
Guys, just get rid of Mojoo!  If you have to disband WL and reform under a new name but without this prick in charge then do it.  He is a complete laughing stock on the server, he's got the personal magnetism of a lepper with a dose of the clap and he will run the guild into the ground sooner or later.  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah.  And just in case I forgot to mention...<br>
<br>
Mojoo [b]IS[/b] a cunt.<br>

Oh yeah, by the way, I do realise that it would be exceptionally easy to spin this to make it look like an argument about loot but I'm assuming that the mental and reading age of the people on the forum is above twelve.<br>

I've also known you for a little while too Trewayn, and although you're usually a great guy to be around, I'm sure you know that your know-it-all attitude rubs many people the wrong way at times, although you do know a great deal about the world that is Everquest.  I know you're not a loot whore at all, I even remember the day you soloed the scout for me in Cobalt Scar to get me my Bracer of Benovelence lol.  And in all reality, you haven't gotten much loot at all to speak of from Winter's Light.  But everyone has personality quirks.  Mojoo's very opinionated, and you're a know-it-all just to name a few.  But if you had such a problem with the guild leader and you really want Loot X or Y eventually, you have to know that he's going to be biased towards the people he doesn't think are assholes. <br>
<br>
 I'm just saying bro, maybe you have some tiff with Mojoo, but as far as I know he's a very respected leader for the vast majority of Winter's Light.  I'm just saying, I don't see the point in flaming him.  You know you're generally just going to get the same old &quot;Yeah, Mojoo's an asshole&quot; from a few outspoken CiH members and a few &quot;Fuck you Trewayn, I'm glad you're gone&quot; from a few outspoken WL/CT members.  But hey, that never gets old right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I wasn't there when this dropped, but you can't expect a weapon upgrade just because u need one, other people need stuff too. There were probably other items dropped we may have needed.  We also have to split items with CT, so often one or the other of us only gets 1 item.  Before you blow up on your guildleader, who you know you had your differences with you should have consulted some other officer or someone else.  As with membership Mojoo isnt the last word either in choosing our pick or on awarding it, he has an equal vote with the rest of us.  It was poor form to bring this onto the public board, I would have thought better of you Trew. Oh well, u burned it now.<br>

If I felt Trewayn's post here accurately portrayed him, I'd have 0 compunction or need to defend Mojoo as people aired out his dirty laundry.  But the fact of the matter is that you, Trewayn, are full of shit.<br>
<br>
First off, while Mojoo may have his faults, accusing him of putting his own interests before the guild just goes to show how full of shit you really are.  Mojoo works tirelessly for WL and lives and breathes by the successes and failures of his guild.  He's obsessed over equipping his players and getting the best deal possible for his guild.  He raises guildfund money to buy sets of armor for new members and does anything and everything in his power to make his guild the most strongly equipped it can be.  In divying up loot from mobs between our guilds, he obsesses over making sure his guild members get a fair shake.  Over the time I've known him, I've never seen him give up hope in what he wants his guild to be or what he wants for his members. I think WL people should be honored to have a leader that cares about his guild and gives as much to it as mojoo does.   For all the shit mojoo gets for being an outspoken and forceful personality, and for all the run-ins we've had in leading, I'll state unequivocally that he's a good guy and a good leader.<br>
<br>
Trewayn you attend very few guild raids for WL due to your time zone.  WL officers believe in equipping the people that come to their raids, as I believe all officers should.  The Lava Infused Bludgeon is a relatively common drop off AL we have gotten more than a handful of.  I can think of at least once when WL as a guild defaulted the bludgeon, but had no bards there that wanted, so they gave it to us.  Where were you then or all the millions of other times bard weapons were being defaulted away?  Also, Mojoo didn't even go in on the 1st and 2nd bludgeons your guild received.  While you're log is probably accurate, I'm going to assume it's out of context as Mojoo has never once shown any tendency towards doing what you suggest he did.  Also, I see just about 0 motive for him to do it.  AL is a mob we're pretty much done with, why Mojoo would be interested in selfishlt hording AL loot.<br>
<br>
If I was in the same position as Mojoo I would have done exactly the same thing.  Why would I pick an item which has defaulted or rotted over a valuable item many people in the guild might want?  Would I do this simply because a whiny asshole like yourself who annoys both WL and CT members finally decided to grace some raids with his presence and demand a weapon he *claims he has *sniff, let me push away the tears* been working toward for so long? <br>
<br>
If you actually showed up to raids you would have gotten one a long time ago.  Mojoo was justified in picking another item off AL over an item WL had defaulted before.  The fact that Mojoo has a LiB (I didn't even know he had one, someone must have forced him to loot, as he didn't want it or want to go in all the other times we got one) had 0 bearing on him not picking it, no matter what you say.  If Mojoo really wanted to use his power to loot whore something, he'd have a lot more loot than he already does, and he wouldn't be doing it over AL loot, and he'd be politically savvy enough not to tell you about it.<br>
<br>
Given your character against his, and watching AL loot, bard loot, and alliance loot be divvied up in the joint officer channel as many times as I have, I'm calling you out on your bullshit sob story.  When Mojoo approached me about possibly adding you to WL's roster, I told him you were an asshole and a liability and to avoid guilding you.  He was the one that actually stuck up for you, and I bet he's regretting it just about now (I told you so mojoo!).<br>
<br>
Good riddance, just about everyone in CT was sick of you.<br>

Basically this is what it said.<br>
<br>
Hey guys, I got a SS Plate BP I got on a raid just sitting in my bank.  I don't plan on turning it in.  So here is what I thought.  We raid vindi sometime, I loot Vindi BP, then Ill mq the SS bp to someone else and Soandso can have my current BP.  Otherwise, Ill just hang onto it.<br>
<br>
Pissed alot of people off, holding something captive that the guild got him, till they let him loot a raid force mob that only drops 1 thing? Laf... saddest thing is leadership probably would of done what you wanted had  KC not fallen apart at the same time.<br>
<br>
To his credit, after KC disbanded he did MQ the BP for free to an old member, about 2 months after the post was made.  His choice of who he MQ'ed it too was interesting, went to a friend of his who I hadnt seen log in for about month, but whatever.
