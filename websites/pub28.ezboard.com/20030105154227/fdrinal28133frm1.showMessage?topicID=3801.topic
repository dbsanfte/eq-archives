&gt; &gt; 25 years of his life sentence in prison. While on the run, he broke into <br>
a <br>
&gt; &gt; house and tied up a young couple that had been sleeping in the bedroom. <br>
He <br>
&gt; &gt; tied the man to a chair on one side of the room and his wife on the bed. <br>
&gt; He <br>
&gt; &gt; got on the bed right over the woman, and it appeared he was kissing her <br>
&gt; &gt; neck. Suddenly he got up and left the room. <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; As soon as possible the husband made his way across the room to <br>
&gt; &gt; his bride, his chair in tow, and whispered, &quot;Honey, this guy hasn't seen <br>
a <br>
&gt; &gt; woman in years. I saw him kissing on your neck and then he left in a <br>
&gt; hurry. <br>
&gt; &gt; Just cooperate and do anything he wants. If he wants to have sex with <br>
you, <br>
&gt; &gt; just go along with it and pretend you like it. Whatever you do don't <br>
fight <br>
&gt; &gt; him or make him mad. Our lives depend on it! Be strong and I love you.&quot; <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; After spitting out the gag in her mouth, the half-naked wife <br>
&gt; &gt; replies, &quot;Dear, I'm so relieved you feel that way. You're right, he <br>
hasn't <br>
&gt; &gt; seen a woman in years, but he wasn't kissing my neck ...He was <br>
whispering <br>
&gt; in <br>
&gt; &gt; my ear. He said he thinks you're really cute and asked if we kept the <br>
&gt; &gt; Vaseline in the bathroom. Here he comes...be strong and I love you too.&quot; <br>

Fred and his wife Edna went to the state fair every year. <br>
<br>
Every year Fred would say, &quot;Edna, I'd like to ride in that there airplane.&quot; <br>
<br>
And every year Edna would say, &quot;I know Fred, but that airplane ride costs ten <br>
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.&quot; <br>
<br>
One year Fred and Edna went to the fair and Fred said, &quot;Edna, I'm 71 years <br>
old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Edna replied, &quot;Fred that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten <br>
dollars is ten dollars.&quot; <br>
<br>
The pilot overheard them and said, &quot;Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take <br>
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say <br>
one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars.&quot; <br>
<br>
Fred and Edna agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists and <br>
turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. <br>
<br>
He does all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They land and the <br>
pilot turns to Fred, &quot;By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you <br>
to yell out, but you didn't.&quot; <br>
<br>
Fred replied, &quot;Well, I was gonna say something when Edna fell out, but ten <br>
dollars is ten dollars.&quot; <br>

A couple was invited to a swanky masked Halloween Party. She got a<br>
terrible<br>
&gt; headache and told her husband to go to the party alone.  He, being a<br>
devoted<br>
&gt; husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some<br>
&gt; aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being<br>
spoiled<br>
&gt; by not going.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So he took his costume and away he went.The wife, after sleeping soundly<br>
for<br>
&gt; one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to<br>
&gt; go to the party. Since her husband did not know what her costume was, she<br>
&gt; thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he<br>
acted<br>
&gt; when she was not with him.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the<br>
&gt; dance floor, dancing with everyone he could, copping a little feel here<br>
and<br>
&gt; a little kiss there.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive babe herself, he<br>
left<br>
&gt; his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had<br>
just<br>
&gt; arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her<br>
&gt; husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she<br>
&gt; agreed, so off they went to one of the cars for a little workout.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away, went home, put the<br>
&gt; costume away, and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he<br>
would<br>
&gt; make for his behavior.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time<br>
he<br>
&gt; had.  He said, &quot;Oh, the same old thing.You know I never have a good time<br>
&gt; when you're not there.&quot;Then she asked, &quot;Did you dance much?&quot; He replied,<br>
&gt; &quot;I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance. When I got there, I met<br>
Pete,<br>
&gt; Bill Brown and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker<br>
all<br>
&gt; evening.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But I'll tell you... the guy I loaned my costume to sure had a real good<br>
&gt; time!&quot;<br>
