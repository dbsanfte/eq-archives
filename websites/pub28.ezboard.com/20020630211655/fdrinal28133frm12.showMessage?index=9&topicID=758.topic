<br>
But People should try not to get so mad with EQ to point where you want to break stuff...I had my 2-3 upsets..nothing really big though.  Just chill, relax, be calm, be patient.  And try not to fight over mobs also respect each others camps.  Thats all I have to say about that thread..<br>
<br>
---About the people in that car accident-----<br>
---I had an accident of my own, glad to be here---  <br>
Don't' read this if you don't want, no one has to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
But you know we are all very lucky to be alive.  And many peoples thoughts of life...others may and may not agree...but heck its your life, do with it what you want.  Live it your way and live it to its fullest.<br>
<br>
Well I for one plan to live it more and see what it has to Offer...because, on May 4, 2002.  I got in a car accident of my own, on the freeway.  I was at the wheel, with my sister on the passengers side.  Then there was my younger brother, and my mom on the back seats.  Well to make the scene short.  Some driver flew by pass in front of me, I was going at 70mph on the 2nd fast lane ( 4 lanes on this fwy.)...imagine this freak...passes me from the right, then basicly cut me off in front and the car is going to slam on the left shoulder bumper - head on, the car was already at an angle..<br>
 <br>
The driver slams the breaks like ...10-15ft.  In front of me..and then I slam my breaks...but I guess I was going to fast and didn't stop fast enough well I ended hitting the car on the back...the hit made the car turn--and go backwards...and it hit a car somewhere in the back...as I looked left, I saw nothing but debrie, smoke, sparks, and glass.  I thought in my head, before I hit the car I  thought - I was gonna die.  Crazy...stuff I tell you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ...All of this happend under...5 seconds.  /boggle<br>
<br>
The N710 Freeway, headed towards downtown LA...  On a Saturday is always packed.  My brother, sister, mom and I were lucky...the air bags never went off-- who knows what might happened...I probably could have gone right side of traffic...and got clipped by other cars..and get hit more and cause even more cars to be involved.  But lucky that never happened - I drove the car to very left side of the shoulder.  Then like 15seconds later after the car stopped.  The ambulance, cops, and tow trucks were there.  Amazing how fast the departments responded.  My family was just shaken up by the accident no major injuries...just a pain on everyone neck really and shoulders, which is now gone.  But the other drivers and passengers, were not so lucky the 3rd car involved, had 2 people with out seat belts.../sigh well there was a little girl all bangged up, along with her mother, they were cut real bad to do to the glass..and the driver who caused all this, had a tore up neck she could not even move.<br>
<br>
We were very lucky, and hope the girl and that other car with the family in it are going to be ok.  As for us, all we can do is thank god we are alive.  For me after a...what I can call a near death experience...<br>
( because I never came close to death like this ) -- Its changed me in some ways, and maybe for the best.  I also realized...I don't care much for EQ no more, just that I like to play it, but I wont stress over this game any more.  Life is the most important thing out there.  <br>
<br>
Sorry if my pst was to long, or preachy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
But oh well, what can I say...to who ever read this.<br>
Enjoy Life, the way you can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
Hope all is well and all turns out well.<br>
<br>
One of the fun things about this board, and the game of eq, is that it really ISN'T real. <br>
<br>
It's a place to let off steam; meet people you will never have real responsibility for, make friends, flame people, mess about.<br>
<br>
Again, I hope all turns out well. Just today, I learned that my father had another heart attack, and that he will prolly need a bypass. He's getting on in years, and it's rather stressful.<br>
<br>
But there's nothing better as a cure than to get on EQ, wack-a-mob, come to the drinal board, wack-an-idiot and drift off to bed, contented that I have let go some of the stress of the day.<br>
<br>
Sometimes yall think I am silly, or over the top, or some sort of extremist (right, Arrora? LOL) or you wonder who the fuck I am lol but frankly, yall have been very helpful to me -- in sharpening my insights into many things, allowing me to bounce opinions off yall, and sparring from time to time.<br>
<br>
I just wish I'd discovered this board two years ago. I know, I know, thank god it didn't happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW, Arrora, just because my dad had another heart attack is NOT a reason to flame me, or him. Just in case you were wondering. Sheez. I know you like to prey on the weak, but that's just over the top... come on.... <br>
