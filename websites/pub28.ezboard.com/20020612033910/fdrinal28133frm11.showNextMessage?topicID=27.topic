But Gwarok was born different than most trolls. He was amazingly strong and fierce, but an intelligence burned bright in his eyes, unlike that of other trolls. He was freakishly smart for a troll, more than some humans. However it is not a good thing in grobb to be smart. Gwarok learned this early, and often. The other troll children were bad enough, but the adults accused him of being cursed and he was beaten and shunned from there on out. Life was rough, and troll children receive scant assistance from their parents.<br><br>Rajnor saw how Gwarok was different and decided to do something about it. Another of his children Sutok, was growing powerful as well and threatening Gwarok daily. Rajnor decided to apprentice Gwarok as a shaman. When the time came, he thought that Sutok would become chief, Gwarok would be the Tribal Shaman. It would be well.<br><br>Alas it was not to be. A dark voice came to Gwarok in his youth. At first he feared it, but later learned that fear was his tool, not his enemy. Only the weak let it master them. He learned much from the shaman about spirits and troll magic. But from the voice he learned about fear and death. Even his master feared him, he could see it in his eyes, and smell it in the air. They were all scared of him, even then. <br><br>The old shaman did indeed fear gwarok. Gwarok was a curse upon the tribe and only by threatening the old shamans life did Rajnor persuade him to apprentice the foul whelp. But fearing Rajnor's wrath he did as he was told, hoping soon even Rajnor would see him for the abomination that he was. <br><br>Sutok had his own plans. The day came eventually for the Trial of Hurt to confirm Gwarok was an adult. The tested have a stake driven thru their knee and are given a head start. Soon after a pack of other trolls wielding firebrands set out in pursuit to wound and harry the runner all the way to the finish, the borders of the swamp. Sutok led this hunting party, and he had no intention of letting Gwarok reach the desert. No one would even fault him, he would be hero.<br><br>Sutok returned from the test alone, and badly wounded. Gwarok had snapped and struck back, against the rules of the contest. Sutok was the lone survivor and Gwarok was fled into the swamps. The Shaman seized this opportunity to rally the feeling of the other trolls against the freak in their midst and demanded of Rajnor he kill Gwarok. <br><br>Rajnor had to do something. Clearly Gwarok was now an adult and had challenged tribal law and therefore Rajnor himself. His power was growing and they must fight to the death. His plan had failed. He picked up his warclub and resolved on what he must do. <br><br>Gwarok was crafty for his youth but nowhere near so as Rajnor. The mighty chief tracked Gwarok to an obscure location in the swamp and the challenge was met. Gwarok fought with everything he had, but dark Rajnor was more than a match, crushing Gwarok to the ground time and time again. <br><br>As he lay on the ground broken and bleeding, something round landed on the ground next to his head. It took a while for his eyes to focus, but it was the charred remains of his mother's head. <br><br>&quot;You are dead to me, and you no longer have roots with this tribe. The spirits of the swamp will never answer your call, and your coming will be forgotten from our lore. Return to Grobb again and the dark lord himself will weep with pity over the agonies inflicted on you!&quot;, cried Rajnor. With that he left, telling all in Grobb that there is no more Gwarok. <br><br>You see Rajnor was also freakishly intelligent. But he hid it better. He does not understand what two trolls like this means, but he believes it is a sign of favor from the gods and that Trolls are ascending to take their place as conquerors of the world. He did not wish to defy that favor, and hopes that Gwarok will prove to not be a curse upon the tribe.<br><br>Gwarok however was not totally alone. Fear was with him and revenge would be his. He took to the swamp and grew strong. With stealth he slaughtered the frogloks of Guk, becoming a legendary terror. This he has repeated all over the lands of Norrath. Now girt with weapons and armor of power, and many allies of his travels, his day of revenge is close and will not be bound to grobb. Armies will crush town after town spreading fear and terror and the land shall ring with the cries of the weak. This is the dream of the Voice, and Gwarok is its servant. <br><br><br><br>Gwarok &quot;The Betrayer&quot; Painbringer<br>51st Lvl Troll Reaver<br>GrandMaster Drinker<br>Drinal Server  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/01 7:43:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ridgenet.net/~opticman/tincanhead.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: There once was a troll...</span><hr size=1> *thumbs up*<br><br>testing sig btw la~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utamour.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamour</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/1/01 2:09:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: There once was a troll...</span><hr size=1> Yay, Gwarok! <p><font color="violet">Tamour of the Soulbonded<BR>Half-elf Cavalier<br></font></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=25.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showNextMessage?topicID=25.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.threadControl?topicID=25.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm11>Role-playing</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
