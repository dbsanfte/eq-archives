From what I've heard, many of the acts are not first-time-offenses.  Like a dog returning to its vomit, a felon will oft return to his ways.  A wise man once said, &quot;Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the hearts of the sons of men have become full set in them to do bad.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Why is our government so humane to people who commit acts of terror upon others?  Why should we have tax payers bear the burden of countless life sentences in jail?<br>
<br>
I personally feel that many gross felons are being denied their right to a lethal injection.  I feel that if our justice system made an example by granting more of these rights to murderers and rapists, the fear of punishment would help curb these acts of barbarous cruelty.  Anyways, do you think that many criminals are unfairly being denied this right?<br>

I used to say ya give them what they deserve, but I read a book by grisham, i forget which one it was, but it was about an old man on death row, and it gave me some perspective. I believe people should be punished yes, however throwing people in jail doesnt solve anything, and killing people for their crimes seems too much like the easy way out, no one deserves to die, because people can learn their lesson.. also remember this, a minimum of 12% of people put to death in the past for their crimes were not guilty . DNA evidence is thnx.<br>
I am going into my 2nd year of law school now, so i have some legal perspective on this, about the 1st strike you mentioned, its called the three strike rule, wherein people will be given a certain degree of clemency upon their first offense if they can show that they didnt have a backround , and have no ties to do it agian, on the 2nd offense its generally treated by the book, the third offense typically lands them in jail for life. Im in the middle of something right now, but i will post back in a bit with some more thoughts. Feel free to dispute me on my death = wrong, i love to hear other perspectives, and i would love someone to convince me otherwise, im not an arguer, but a learner <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=289373  target="web">Reksarl Chaoticfury</a><BR>

<br>
I am definitely against the death penalty.  I think it's barbaric.  It's racist too.  Blacks are sentenced to death FAR more often than  whites are.  I think males are put to death much more often than females as well.  Somehow most of the Western nations manage to do quite well without it.  In fact, lots of countries won't extradite our criminals to us because of our death penalty.  <br>
<br>
I think it's time we emerged from the 12th century in this matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugreatdark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>greatdark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 7:56:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Fundamental Right Many Are Being Denied</span><hr size=1> Sorry guys and gals but if they are sentenced to death they should have one appeal if that does not pan out then jack'em in the chair.

<br>
As I see it, unless a person comes to a profound reversal of direction while in prison, then he's worse off for being there because he gets to associate with people more evil than himself.  Then the prison system becomes more of a criminal boot camp.<br>
<br>
And isn't a life sentence in prison more cruel than a swift and virtually painless death?  While in prison, the person has all that time to think about the freedoms he could have enjoyed and the things he could have done, etc.  So then his life becomes a living death.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uueauvan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ueauvan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Judge U</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/02 11:17:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Fundamental Right Many Are Being Denied</span><hr size=1> The death penalty is wrong IMHO for one reason<br>

I am all for the death sentance, if someone goes and kills a family because &quot;the dog told me to&quot;....sure this person needs some serious medical attention...but the world is probably better off without them. The thing i dont like is they let people sit on death row for 20+ years....thats costing me money. But it also varies from case to case. If the guy did it, everyone saw him do it, there is no doubt about it...nail his ass to the wall--make him have more pain and suffering than he has ever known and then remind him that he still has hell to look forward to. If they are &quot;unsure of all the details&quot; *as we have all heard so many times* limit the number of appeals. if he cant prove his innocence by then...well, sorry to sound like a hardass, but sionara *spelling*, i hope you've found religion. Now yes, there are some truely innocent people that are on death row, yes, i feel sorry for them. i will wish them the best of luck with proving their innocence. If they slip through the system....I hope they have found religion also *just in case their appeals dont ever pull through*. I am sure they will have alot of people praying for them. <br>
It also depends on the crime, and why the crime was commited. part of america's problem is that we dont take enough time to look at all these facts before passing sentence. *just an example* if a guy rapes and murders a girl, and it has been proven beyond any kind of a shadow of a doubt..Hell Yes. nuke his ass. If a kid steals a blow-pop from a candy store...thats not a reason to be put on death row.....i know it is a kinda far fetched example, but you should get my point. So anyway, as i was saying. If a guy rapes/murders a girl, and the authorities are looking for him ..dad/brother/&lt;anonymouspersonhere&gt; finds them and is absolutly enraged at the very thought that this person did this and they fly off the handle and kill sob_01....should this person get Death Row? IMO no, he shouldnt. he should be given a damn reward for it as far as im concerened....mainly because half the people who i believe should deserve the death penalty wont get it...and this sob could of slipped through the system the same way. go dad/etc go<br>
I am all for the death penalty..ive thought the genepool needed some chlorine for a long time now. <p><HTML>

<br>
However, <br>
<br>
Death penatly doesnt lower costs, cost pretty much the same, and sometimes more for all the extra lawayer fees and appeals, to fry the bastard, then to feed him for life.<br>
<br>
No system is perfect, no matter how tight the system is, someone who is innocent will get framed, or be in wrong place at wrong time, and die because of it, this is UNACCEPTABLE, death cannot be reversed.<br>
<br>
Crime rates in country w/o death penalty have lower crime rate, however this is probably not due to lack of death penatly, but a smart enforcement of Gun laws, (Its not a less violent media either, look at japan) I dont care what you say, you dont need a semi automatic assault rifle to take down bambi. Fuck the 2cd amemdment, King George isnt coming to my backyard, and if he did i'd invite him in for a cup of tea.<br>

<br>
We have a higher crime rate, and violent crime rate at that, not because guns are legal but because we have such a liberal system of law.<br>
<br>
Our fore fathers (sp?) wrote our bill of rights and designed our legal system with no clue what so ever what society would be like today. We have so many attorneys that have perverted the laws a good majority of the laws are useless. Hell we have to many attorneys period.<br>
<br>
You honestly think we have a high crime rate because guns are legal? Please...... if these violent idiots want to kill somebody and they cant get a gun a brick, knife, or bat works just as well. Look how many get killed and maimed while in prison and they arent using guns in there boys and girls.<br>
<br>
The truth is if it was actually used correctly and enforced 100% of the time the death penalty would work. If it did not deter them from commiting the crime it would sure as heck ensure they didnt commit the same crime again.<br>
<br>
Reform in prison is a joke, less than 1% of all violent criminals are reformed...actually I read this awhile ago and darned if I remember where the study was but it was something like less then 1/4 of 1% were &quot;reformed&quot;.<br>
<br>
Another problem this country has that not alot of others do you are comparing us to is the racial diversity/prejudism. Now granted there are other countries with these problems as well, but if they are as bad or worse than in the USA then take a look at the violent crimes there...I bet they are as bad or worse than us.<br>
<br>
Death penalty as used now = ineffective<br>
<br>
Death penalty if used correctly could be very effective. <p> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueqwarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWarlord</A> at: 8/30/02 4:27:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udamerion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damerion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/pa5/dminder/035_explosion_pyroTshirt.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/02 4:47:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Fundamental Right Many Are Being Denied</span><hr size=1> I got a situation for you.  A man and a woman in NJ, kill their child.  Then, instead of burying it they burn it in the fireplace.  Then they run to Florida and the grandmother of the child is worried and they find the remains in the fireplace.  Now the parents are asking for mercy in the courts.  Should they get it?  Why should we keep these kind of people around??<br>
<br>
Where do we draw the line?  Criminals do crimes over and over again because they get off.  What is a few years in prison, when you can talk to other inmates and see what they did wrong, then formulate a plan that will work better?  I am for the death penalty all the way.  I feel that they should revise it so that you don't have the time to get a law degree while in jail.  I think our whole jail system should be revised.  They have more amenities than most middle class families.  No wonder so many want to go back or don't mind going back.  Get rid of the luxuries, you were put in there because you are a menace to society. Let them read books.  Let them write letters.  If they pay for it out of their pocket, let them get a college degree.  Is this inhumane?  Enhance the work programs so that our tax dollars are being spent on something other than soaps on TV in a lounge that is nicer than my living room.<br>

Thanx, have a nice holiday.<br>

I'm sorry, but the attitude that it's &quot;too bad&quot; if an innocent person dies to the death penalty is just as barbaric as killing someone in cold blood.<br>

<br>
To pysically batter someone to death with a blunt instrument requires you to be in proximity to your victim, requires time to do it and requires the strength of conviction to carry the matter to it's grim conclusion. <br>
<br>
This is a far far cry from the simplicity of puling a trigger from a distance.<br>
<br>
The removal of guns from the equation in the case of murder I would suspect facilitates the gathering of evidence. <br>
<br>
Case 1. Offender shoots victim from 30 metres, throws gun in river.<br>
Case 2. Offender batters victim to death with baseball bat, throws bat in river.<br>
<br>
One of these cases will yield a significant body of phsical evidence, one will not.<br>

It has since lowered some, but is still higher than it was before they effectively outlawing all forms of firearm ownership.  A little closer to home for those of us living in the good ole USA, in Washington, DC it is illegal for 99% of people to own a pistol, and yet, Washington, DC has one of the Highest rates of murder via handgun in the US.  In almost all cases, any new gun control law passed restricting the use of firearms has not resulted in a decrease in crime, but rather an increase. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uxylordraconia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xylor Draconia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/02 8:30:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crimsontwilight.org/Upload/Xylor/xylor3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Fundamental Right Many Are Being Denied</span><hr size=1> I kind of like the Bill O' Reily school of punishment, 3 violent crimes and gratz you going to remote part of alaska to do manual labor for the reminder of your life. <br>

I've never taken a stance on it one way or another before but after reading on it I am not a supporter of the death penalty.  <br>
<br>
This is an excerpt of it --&quot;As of 7:30pm EDT, December 7, 2000, 152 people have been executed during Bush's tenure as governor.  This makes Texas Governor George W. Bush the most-killing Governor, in the history of the United States of America.Under the leadership of George W. Bush, Texas continues to rank dead last in virtually every social service area, yet first in executions. Texas has some of the poorest funded programs to help the mentally ill (who account for a good number of the prison population). Bush's response to this dead last ranking was to insist that the legislature pass a $5 billion tax cut. <br>
<br>
Bush has been steadfast in his refusal to recognize the significance of international treaty law, specifically the right of foreign nationals facing the death penalty to receive notification of their right to consular assistance. Texas has the second-largest death row population of foreign citizens in the USA (after California). None of these individuals were informed upon arrest of their right to consular assistance, as guaranteed under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Even a personal intervention by the US Secretary of State (in the Faulder case) was ignored by Bush, undermining the viability of international law, outraging nations allied to the USA and endangering the human rights of detained foreigners everywhere, including American citizens arrested abroad. &quot; End Quote.<br>
<br>
Anyways, 152 people is alot. Its a very unfair system. Most of the people who are executed are black males who have commited crimes against white persons. The fact that 80 people since 1973 have been released due to their innocence BUT the fact that 23 have died since 1990 to the death penalty. 23 innocent people from a report I read about a year ago, is just incredible to me. To me, there is no way to justify this. <br>

Well, let's do some math here...<br>
<br>
I am going to overprice the cost of a gun because it's been so long since I've purchased one but let us imagine that the gun we want to use costs $1,000.00 a pop. Now we don't need anything to radical, a simple 22 rifle will do the job just fine.<br>
<br>
So, now let us buy a box of bullets. Again, it's been so long since I purchased bullets but let us assume they run $5.00 a bullet. So we purchase 50 bullets, so we're now looking at a total cost of $250.00.<br>
<br>
Gun cost ----   $1,000.00<br>
Bullets *50 count* $250.00<br>
Total cost ----    $1250.00<br>
<br>
Now last I recall it cost THOUSANDS of dollars per month to keep criminals locked up, this includes the cost of guards, electric, swimming pool, library, and gym expenses and so forth. By the way this is a total for ONE inmate. <br>
<br>
Let us do the math....<br>
<br>
$1250.00   to do away with 50 prisoners<br>
$3-7,000.00 per month to house a criminal<br>
<br>
Does it take much thought as to what is cheaper? Either way the criminal will push for a mistrial and lesser charges. In the end it's far more feasible to do away with violent criminals who CANNOT be rehabilitated; and anyone that thinks so needs to go live with one for a year, my bet is your dead within 6 months.<br>
<br>
So 50 prisoners executed for a high estimated cost of $1,250.00, or we continue to pay thousands of dollars each month to house them. I was brough up on an EYE for an EYE. I was also raised to be compasionate and forgiving, but people who are extremely violent cannot be taught a new trick. They will go back to the old ways once free, that's not the truth, that's a key fact.<br>
<br>
Oh and for the record, I'm tired of this racist this, racist that BS. You want to see racist? Look at how the caucasian male is treated now a days on the job; and when they seek employment. That's racist! <br>
<br>
<br>
Balrak<br>
All for the death penalty! The heck with electrocutions, put a bullet in their head - its cheaper and faster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#FF0000>Drinal Ally</font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 526<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/02 11:18:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A Fundamental Right Many Are Being Denied</span><hr size=1> I am with ya Bal.<br>
<br>
Also...it is not just a cliche when people say if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns, it is a scary fact.<br>
<br>
We have taken so much self responsibility away from people we have lost sight of how to make laws...we make laws now based on preventing the 1% of stupid asses from being able to act like stupid asses instead of punishing them and let the respectable populace govern thier own lives.<br>

Problem is, there is no real way to prove it.  Until we have ways to actually prove, without a doubt, that someone is guilty, then yeah.. I agree with it, 100%.  Good population control as well ;-D <p><br>Currently in the works:

Forgot about that in your simplistic little equation didn't you Balrak. All the safeguards that you folks seem to want to do away with are in place to ensure that the wrong person is not accidentally executed. Even with all the safeguards in place we have, with the advent of DNA testing, released over a hundred folks that were wrongfully convicted. Wrongfully convicting the innocent does as much damage to the system as inadequate enforcement.  Look at some of these third world countries that you seem to think we should emulate. Are their justice systems truly just or are they merely an arms of oppressive governments? Eventually the people in these countries realize that there is no justice and they make their own. It usually involves a significant amount of bloodletting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3634.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3634.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3634.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3634.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3634.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=3634.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3634.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3634.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
