I just feel very strongly about this...  Mistakes will be made, and yes I have made mistakes.  But a mistake like this?  I'm sorry but there is an awful lot of thought that goes into this action.  You don't just accidentally meet someone outside of your relationship, happen to hit it off to the point where you both consent to sexual activity, just happen to misplace your clothes, and once they are gone just accidentally repeat the same motion over and over until you achieve that moment of climax.  There are way too many things that precipitate the act itself to classify it as a simple mistake or accident.<br>
<br>
There is just no way anyone will convince me that cheating is anything more than a voluntary act of selfishness, executed with the full knowledge of what you are doing before, during and after the fact.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of mistakes and ups and downs in a relationship, but in my mind there is no room for this.  If I can stay faithful, I do not think it would be too much to ask for my partner to do the same.  In the face of temptation your mind must prevail over your body for the sake of yourself and your chosen loved one's well being.  Otherwise, just do it and when the sh*t hits the fan don't cry when you are left alone, you made your bed to lie in and sometimes it turns out you actually have to.  <br>
<br>
Like I said before, there are plenty of women out there who will respect you and themselves enough to refrain from this sort of deplorable behavior.  There is forgiveness, and there is also justice and consequences for actions we take.  I can forgive the cheating itself, but the consequence is that I won't stick around for it to happen again.  <br>

<br>
I realize that does't make you feel any better, but trust me, it is far better than some have had it.<br>
<br>
On a side note, there was a female writer a couple of years back that got ripped by the public for writing a piece abotu the double standards between men and women in society.  She wrote for a popular womens magazine and was later fired for her comments, then she sued and won.  Gotta love it.<br>
<br>
She basically stated that double standards are creating a bitter hatred between sexes and contributing to more and more abuse now than ever.  She used cheating for example.  When a male cheats, he is called a pig, and slammed by society.   Yet, when a female cheats, most women back the women and frequently se the term &quot;a liberating experience&quot;.<br>
<br>
Thsi female writer was appalled at other females thinking this way and wrote about it, and many other double standards.  So many females threatened to drop their subscriptions the magazine fired her.  Thank goodness the courts gave her alot of money for it.  <br>
<br>
Sad thing is, many women actually think this way.  Or they justify it by &quot;he was probably cheating on me anyway&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I don't know the original poster, as I am new to EQ, but the reply by the female flamer Tateana (sp?) kinda shows you how ignorant some people can be.  I hope it never happens to her or anyone, even thoguh this is unrealistic, but it would be a nice thing to hope of, because it is hard to get over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 703<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/01 4:06:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> LMAO! Alrighty then. Support Boofy until you get tired of him calling you a &quot;fuking dike&quot; like the rest. <br>
<br>
Here is a sniplet of what I said, assuming you are referring to this since you weren't clear:<br>
<br>
/quote<br>
&quot;On the topic of the thread, naturally females get our hearts broken too but I guarantee if we decide to come to a public &quot;game&quot; board and to cry about our faithless ex-boyfriends with a post titled /flame all men, we would be classified as whiney male bashers and get tons of defensive follow ups&quot;<br>
/endquote<br>
<br>
It is a &quot;double standard&quot; actually for people to give PMR endless amounts of grief in this forum for bringing far too much personal information in here then support this forum thread because it's by Boofy the male who was hurt?, Your post is &quot;ignorant&quot; (-- just quoting you here ;-) Boofy acts in a verbally abusive manner in this forum 99.9% of his posts, it is &quot;ignorant&quot; to point out that may be why he can't get dates? I don't think so - it is more ignorant for you to think he deserves empathy. Perhaps you should get more forum posting history so that it isn't &quot;you&quot; who is speaking out of ignorance.<br>
<br>
Women don't want to go out with men who's vocabulary is limited to &quot;fuking dike&quot; or 'suck my dick&quot; which has been the content of 99% of boofy's 1million posts.<br>
<br>
If I had or had not been cheated on before it wouldn't be in this forum trying to obtain empathy from people whom I had called a fuking dyke or fag for six months. <br>
<br>
The way I see it his original post left two choices. Choice 1 was to discuss the topic of fidelity and feel empathy for Boofy unless later down the line there were other facts behind this situation. Choice 2 don't feel empathy until you have the facts. I go with choice 2 based upon his posting history he is a real jerk. <br>
<br>
How do you know the night before he didn't have that &quot;I want to date and have fun with you but am not looking for commitment - aka the I want to have my cake and eat it too discussion&quot;. <br>
<br>
How do you know the night before he didn't raise his fist and call her a &quot;fukin dike&quot;. How do you know she didn't try to get through his answering machine for 2 days to break up with him but he was so busy playing eq and <br>
bashing people in here he didn't pick up the phone?<br>
<br>
You don't - so it is &quot;you&quot; who posts out of ignorance. You assume this girl cheated on him or did so without reason without knowing any facts.<br>
<br>
There are others who could post on the same topic where I would feel empathy without any knowledge of the facts because they have a track record of being fairly kind and honest.<br>
<br>
Please, Oh mighty not-so-ignorant poster, point which of my threads are you referring to next time it is easier to discuss points rather than blanket statements.  <br>
<br>
The current theory is that he called her a &quot;fuking dyke&quot; so many times she decided to &quot;prove&quot; to him she wasn't ;-P <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 7/19/01 5:37:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/19/01 12:42:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> fuckin dike<br>

So don't consider my silence as ignorance.  Those who speak the least usually listen the most.<br>
<br>
As for Boofy, you are right.  He posts with all the mental alacrity of a 13 year, but that still doesn't mean I should be glad someone cheated on him.  <br>
<br>
As for your stating that if a woman came on here and posted something like this she would be called &quot;a male basher&quot;.  Give me an ever loving break.  Male bashing is in, and many(not all) women have been doing it for the last two decades non-stop and yet they never really get looked down on for committing such immature generalities.  <br>
<br>
For example, when my girlfriend goes out with her friends for a girls night out, they spend much of their time bashing men.  They talk about other things I am sure, but even she admits it is mostly gripe sessions.  <br>
<br>
Now, take men for example.  When we get together, do we complain about women.  Not hardly.  In fact, most guys don't even talk about women when having a guys night out.  We talk about sports, cars, politics, idiots we met during the last few weeks, or whatever.  When we do talk about women it is usually not to bash them ... although some of the things we talk abotu might be considered demeaning to them, we all know women talk about the same things to their friends.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, you are right about me not knowing the whole story.  Few people ever know the whole story.  How do you know that Boofy doesn't act the way he does because his girlfriend treats him like crap.  You don't.  I can say one thing.  With your obvious dislike of males in general you will have a hard time ever finding a man yourself.  More likely you will end up settling for someone you don't really love because you have chased off any who care about you.<br>
<br>
Hmmm ... did that piss you off a little.  Good, now you know how it feels when people jump to conclusions.  I don't really mean what I just said, but was trying to make a point.  The point is, you should never cheer when something bad happens to someone, even if maybe they are deserving.  You wanted to know why everyone was against you on this, and that is why.  Just trying to point out to you what is obvious to everyone else.  <br>
<br>
Now, might I recommend you try to meet a nice guy somewhere other than a dance club and have a good time.  Maybe you won't be so angry at the world.<br>

Sheesh....I think even Tat is going to find that hard to agree with.<br>
<br>
The only thing &quot;degrading&quot; to any partner is forcing / coercing that person to do something that they do not want to do.  If you do coerce them, you simply do not love them.  If they enjoy performing the sex act that you want them to do, then they are doing so out of either a sense of self-satisfaction, or love.<br>

Now if your personal opinion is that oral sex, or any other form of sex, is degrading, then you have made a personal judgement call, and YOU should live by your standards.<br>
<br>
Please do not attempt to state your standards as a rule.  That makes you as bad as every other group that attempts to force their view of right and wrong on everyone else.<br>
<br>
My two cents.<br>

He was having such a hard time locating it that I had the opportunity to pull his g-string, leopard pattern underwater up to chin, kick him in the shin (I tried for his balls folks, but those little nuggets are just a little too small to target) and then spanked his ass with a wire brush.  I stopped spanking him when he started begging me to hit him with my hand.  Sick little bastard.  Anyway, I did have to run from him, because now every time he sees me around he begs me to spank him, or cyber with him.  Freak.<br>
<br>
I'm sending him over to Doofy.  He is so feminine that Doof will think that he is a woman and start calling him a dike, at which point I think that Mellan will get excited and ask Doofy to spank him.<br>
<br>
Freaks.<br>
