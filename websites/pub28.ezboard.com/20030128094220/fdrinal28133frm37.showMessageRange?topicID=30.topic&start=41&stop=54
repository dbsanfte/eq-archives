<br>
Yes, I could buy invis potions but why should I waste money on invis potions when people using The Grey can make camps on the 2 sides of the temple that do not get trained?<br>
<br>
Sure, getting trained is an inconvenience, but so is having to replace invis potions or negotiating with another person to get an invis, especially when you are constantly getting home from work in the middle of prime raiding time. The best solution, IMHO is not to put your camp on the sides of the temple that face Scarlet Desert or Mons Letalis.<br>
<br>
I've never thought of myself as being a dick and I've never gotten off on ruining someone else's day, but I have to say: if you lay down on the train tracks, don't sue the railroad company when you get run over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enaliya>Enaliya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/24/02 12:52:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh the irony....</span><hr size=1> I am sorry Pindk. That was NOT me. First of all the only time I have ever had any dealings with you I was grouped with you in PoV. We camped golems on the left side of the castle. I believe we died twice or so but had a few good hours of exping one day when we finally got rolling. As for me I have never been in PoV in a 3 man group, everytime I have been to PoV its been in pickup nonTK groups and its always been a 5 or 6 man team. Usually a 6 man team. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately alot of Rangers these days look alike due to the everyone wearing HoT stuff.<br>
<br>
Wow Pindk, after the one time we grouped I left thinking you were a nice guy and had alot of respect for you. I thought you might have felt the same way, I guess not. /shrug Oh well. Anyway it wasn't me, i am sure of that because i have no been in a group with helce since before pop came out. Helce and I have different play schedules it seems.<br>
<br>
Sorry for your trouble though, i hope the rest of the day went better for you.<br>

<br>
Sorry for lumping your name into that incident I must have had your name in mind from grouping with you. In general I have a lot of respect for TK and this really was the first negative exp I've had with one of your members. <br>
<br>
The only reason I mentioned it here is Higar bringing up the fact that the few posts TK people post here usually are patting themselves on the back for being a level or two above the rest with regards to game etiquette. For the most part you are but apparently not always. <br>
<br>
The general theme of my reply was an observation of the hypocrisy. TK in this incident fit the bill also and it was fresh on my mind. For whatever reason Helce and friends had a hair up their ass that day. /shrug<br>
<br>
As for not being nice when I am flaming some prick for insulting me in game. Nah you're right I am not nice. Any other time you'll find I am mostly pleasant to deal with.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=renlorvolunteer>Renlor Volunteer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/24/02 8:35:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &gt; Re: Oh the irony....  </span><hr size=1> I don't think there's anything wrong with FF posting<br>

<br>
As for the incident, well I was not there. But that doesn't sound like any TK member I know. Not saying it didn't happen, just saying it doesn't sound like standard TK fair. Sorry for the trouble you were caused. Everyone has their bad days, TK included, and certainly myself included. <br>
<br>
As for TK, yeah maybe we keep quiet, keep to ourselves, and make little noise on Drinal or on the boards, But we always try to play the game with Integrity and compassion for our fellow servermates. We take pride in who we are and what we stand for. Sometimes that pride could appear to be a little bit of horn blowing and drum beating from the outside looking in, but the things that make up that feeling of pride that TK has is what makes us who we are. We're not perfect by any means, but we always try to do things better. Better for ourselves and those around us. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, many of the other guilds are better than we are in their own way, just in a different way from TK. <br>
<br>
Well this Tangent appears to have successfully derailed this thread nicely. So I'll put an end to it by saying this.<br>

Even the most careful and considerate of people will occasionally cause a train, sometimes not even knowing one is trailing behind them. What I dislike seeing is those who get joy out of creating trains and causing inconvenience or death for others, and especially those who like to brag about it. <br>
<br>
If I ever pull a train on someone, it will definitely be a mistake. If it causes any deaths, be sure to send me a tell, I'll be happy to come back and rez anyone I caused to die, and apologize for that mistake. <br>
<br>
And Higar, it's not conceit, but more an effort to show people that it is possible to live in harmony on this server if we make an effort to do so. I realize that we can't have a perfect world because there are idiots everywhere, but we don't want people to think that we are overrun by idiots either. This server actually has a lot of good people on it, but it's the bad ones that seem to stick out. Most of the ones complained about are in the upper end guilds, so those guilds in general get a bad reputation. I for one would like people to know that not all high end guilds are filled with jerks and lowlifes. (Not implying that other guilds are, it's just the perception people get when all they see is the bad things)<br>

Kiss....it's not even so much the saying that TK wouldn't train people that got me, it was the condescending tone that prevaded the above quote. I can all but see FF dressed up like a 1920s banker, monocle, cane, top hat and grey gloves, looking down his nose at everyone as he says the above. Yeah, extreme visual, but it makes my point.<br>
<br>
That's why I said it was conceit. To extrapolate on what you said, I, for one, would like people to think that, besides the jerks and low lifes, the only other type of person in high end guilds are conceited and will talk down to you if do something that falls outside their idyllic picture of what life on Drinal should be. Not saying FF is like that, I'm saying that's how he comes across in this post, and in others that I've seen on the Drinal boards. <p><table border=1>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not saying FF is like that, I'm saying that's how he comes across in this post, and in others that I've seen on the Drinal boards. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now, that's important, because Kiss was specifically talking about how people's perceptions of the high end guilds was affected by threads like this. Which only goes to prove, that perception is everything. People might never even bother to take the time to get to know him on any level because they feel they already do know him from what they have read here on the boards.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I have no problems with TK as a guild. I have alot of friends in TK, people I've known since I was running around the commons and Fay beating the hell out of orcs. I'm simply stating that some people might start to think they are full of snotty people because the only time they get involved in a flame post is to say &quot;we'd never do anything like that, because we're good, resposible people&quot;. Best bet? say &quot;yeah, that's stupid, I hate people who do thoughtless things like that&quot; and let it go at that. If you don't show up on the flame boards as a guild for doing negative things, trust me, people will realize you are nice people all on their own. <p><table border=1>

<br>
On one hand, as a SK, I try to invis anywhere I go. It's kind of a habit to have my &quot;travel spells&quot; up, which include: ultravision, see invis, invis, darkness and fear. the darkness is good in case i get agroed by something i cant run from... just snare and run. fear is good to just get something  off me to run. FD works too, but it never clears agro, so to hell with that.<br>
<br>
ive run across many a zone and rarely train to the zone. but if i think i might, i tend to FD at the zone, wait a minute, then zone. usually there is no train that way.<br>
<br>
On the OTHER hand, I learned from day 1 (back in blackburrow) that camping near a zone is a bad idea. People are constantly going to be coming and going, training all the way. Unless your group is prepared to handle 50 mobs, dont fight near the zone. It's just unwise. Learn from the mistakes of the newbies, and play smarter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~Nnod Fleshripper~<br>
