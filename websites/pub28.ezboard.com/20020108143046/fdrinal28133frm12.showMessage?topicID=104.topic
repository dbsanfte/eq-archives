<br>
I am recently making an effort to get people howling stones keys and was attempting to take down the chancellor for a jade prod for the key quest.<br>
<br>
I get two close by to come help me kill the chancellor and head to lake of ill omen. I yell three times to see if its camped and get no response. Claim the camp and head in. At the chancellor's room, we proceed to clear the 40 little spawns in the room because I didn't want to fight with the little heals and we all could have used an earring or two. So we clear the entire spawn except the chancellor. I sit down to med and say give me a minute to med then we kill him. <br>
<br>
Just as I do that a necro logs on (or sneaks by) sets up in the corner and pulls him. I had not noticed until he was over half dead so the necro gets the kill.<br>
<br>
He then tells me he logged in and didn't see anyone camping it so he decided to take the chancellor. 40 spawns missing in the room and he thinks no one is camping it?<br>
<br>
/lame<br>
<br>
Shit like that pisses me off. He probably was there for his own profit gain while we are trying to get a few damn quest items.<br>
<br>
There I feel better now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/13/01 12:50:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> I remember once when I was waiting in unrest for the ghoul who has the key for a mystic cloak.

I just giggled and said that is ok they could have the camp, but they must have thought I was really silly to think that someone would use regular invis in a 100% undead zone. <br>
<br>
They confessed a few days later, and were pretty nice. <br>

<br>
Me and 3 others break aviak camps in lake rathe, were doing the spawns, suddenly a solo paladin shows up and figures he can run up and solo the spawns individually which he never could have gotten if a group was not already there.  I even ask him if he wants to join the group, he doesnt respond so we just basically make sure we get all the kills, and he calls us a kser :)<br>
<br>
WTF should someone like this get a better deal than everyone else who worked hard to get the camp, makes no sense at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/23/01 9:47:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: reply</span><hr size=1> Heres an even funnier story heading over to a camp to help out your pals (guildmates) and having one of them spam you about why you are here as if you showed up to killsteal the spawn.<br>

Funny part is my entire group follows instantly cause we all know what he was trying to do. I must have spent 10 minutes raging on this guys stupidity and all he can say was sorry didn't see you<br>
<br>
/moron<br>
<br>
Five minutes after I leave the whole groups sending me tells that they were sorry and please don't judge them on it. Wonder if they would have been sorry if it was a jade mace on the Dog as loot?<br>

I was camping this guy for the page in highpass for 4 hours and about 5 minutes before the guy spawns this little druid gated in a n d said it was his camp he has been camping it for days and he had more seniority than me and he was going to take the camp.. i was defensless.. I was level 25ish and he was 30ish.. needless to say, the guy spawned, he killed the guy, got the killed, and logged. the next day he blamed it on his brother.. and so in the big guild talisman that was he was in.. he acted like a nice guy and blamed it on his brother so they did not disband him. i just went along and said okay.. and got over it.<br>
<br>
 again as i made anoither char on tunare.. my cleric friend was powerleveling me in south karana at the hermit and we were there for like 2 hours and this guy opens the door and runs in and said itwas his camp he was invis and had been there for 4 hours and im like 'uh no you havent kid.. we've been here 2 hours invis doesn't last that long (didn't have sneak/hide abilities) and then he said he must have gone linkdead while doing his homework.. and he said we were going to share yada yada. needless to say he left after we told him off for lying<br>
