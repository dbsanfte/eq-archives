<br>
While Truehart is indeed a pig and playing lying, deceptive and despicable games are never OK, I see an overwhelming outpouring of sympathy here for a woman who obviously KNEW she was getting involved with a person who was married and has a child.   The SECOND you found out he was married in RL was your clue to EXIT your  online, over-the-line rendevous.<br>
<br>
My pity is with the poor soul who is married to you True and your child.  For your child's sake..I hope your wife remains oblivious to all this melodrama that you created.<br>
<br>
Ah well....live and learn....perhaps at least one of you did.<br>
<br>
Never ever, is the hurting of truly innocent people OK... but here, neither of you can claim complete innocence.<br>
<br>
Karma and what goes around comes around indeed.  <br>
<br>
Seems there are no winners in this game.<br>
<br>
Be well,<br>

And which part is that?  Perhaps you would care to enlighten me?  Or maybe you would just rather try another extremely weak attempt to flame me by comparing me to the President of the USA because I happen to hold a different view/opinion on the situation than you?<br>
<br>
And it IS my opinion, based on what I see as right and wrong and last time I checked...I am fully entitled to it and as long as my ezboard account is active i'll post it when the fancy strikes me.  I made it based on statements given by both parties. I didn't just troll and flame as you have done.<br>
<br>
I believe you reap what you sow and yes, in my opinion if you are knowingly involving yourself in ANY kind of an intimate relationship with a married person...then you are only setting yourself up for heartache or to cause it to someone else.  This obviously wasn't some silly, harmless flirting/chatting...this was a serious year long ongoing thing. He was married and still living with wife yes?  He wasn't seperated or in the middle of a divorce or any similar situation where it might have been acceptable?<br>
<br>
I voted for Gore by the way....but perhaps if you have such an aversion for our president that you feel it is some kind of put down...maybe you should consider defecting to somewhere more your style...like maybe China.<br>
<br>
I didn't post just to personally attack....I posted as an opinion on &quot;HEY LOOK WHY IT&quot;S NOT A GOOD IDEA&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Even though True is blatantly a cad, doesn't make the women helpless creatures and snow white.<br>
<br>
If you wish to personally attack me or my ideas, ethics, morals, values....?? You better go camp yourself some better equipment for this one snookums...it'll be a long ass battle.<br>

Me and Eld had a falling out over this stuff, and most of these folks don't even know about him because he never talked to them when he was playing. So of course they assume Eld is me since it was on my account. I don't have the password now, and I hope they are not giving him a hard time.<br>
<br>
Dude, don't get involved with these Jus Divinum people. They are like a inbred hillbilly town where everybody are first cousins. One thing you got to know about the ladies I have had EQ relationships with. With the exception of a very few, they were all notorious cyber-sex ladies that were interested in me primarily because of my reputation as being good at that. <br>
<br>
Think about it. Truehart was known as a player for over a year on Mith Marr. I would sit in NFP with 2-3 ladies in a circle around me, all of them knowing that I was fooling around with the others. <br>
<br>
Before me and Merianne became a couple, she used to come buff me and one of my ladies in Oasis when my Cleric was 7-8th level. She knew how I was before we got together. <br>
<br>
These people from Jus Divinum really got pissed at me because I was fooling around with Bluskye, Aanolinea, and then later with Merianne. All 3 of these ladies were cybering many guys in JD, and the guys in the guild did not like me coming along and bagging THEIR personal playthings.<br>
<br>
Muirna was married in RL, having a EQ sexual relationship with Failbhe, and cheated on Failbhe with me! Wow, she has room to criticize ME! And then the second time I met Merianne, it was when Muirna and Meri allowed me to 'watch' (read) them cybering each other in Rivervale. Not long after that, Merianne and I began talking on our own and Muirna went on a vendetta against me for stealing her woman that she AND Failbhe were sharing. <br>
<br>
Aanolinea and me and Merianne had a little 3-some in Perma and Aanolinea posted about it on the damned JD board (what a ass). So her EQ man Marccuss immediately put me on his most hated list, and got his friends to hate me too. <br>
<br>
Now Silia is one of the few persons with valid reason to dislike me. She was solely concerned about her sister getting RL feelings. Silia, you have been respectful in your criticism, and I will respect your privacy as to your EQ relationships that went RL. You know that Meri told me everything.<br>
<br>
And if you want to know why certain persons post in aliases... it is because they ain't clean.<br>
<br>
What we have here is a lot of bitter ladies mad because I ended the online relationship with them, or guys that they were cybering who were mad when they got with me. Of course, there are sprinkled in some guys like Saevan who just jumped on the &quot;Hate Truehart&quot; band-wagon because all his guildies were on it. <br>
<br>
The truth is, I know what REALLY went on. I know that these ladies were cybering WAY more guys than I was doing ladies... and now they want to play innocent and get the guys they were cybering to post here against me to get even because of me leaving them. <br>
<br>
You can all kiss my natural ass. Hahahahaha<br>
<br>
 *Added After Post Was Made*<br>
After reading what I posted... all absolutely true... I do have to add that there were some very wonderful ladies that I was involved with that were not into any type of online sexual activity. These ladies were good friends and hunting companions ONLY. I do not want their good name tarnished, and do not want them in the same catagory as ladies like Muirna/Bluskye, Merianne, Aanolinea, Tgcid, and a few others that originally got together with me in relationships of verying duration SOLELY because of my reputation and sexual vocabulary. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/12/01 12:42:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#993300>(6/11/01 11:55:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1>                    &quot;Ode To Everquest&quot;<br>
One day in March of '99, a world did come to be.<br>
It's name we know as Norrath, a new home for you and me.<br>
<br>
Our weapons and our spells were armed, we left from walls of stone.<br>
And after killing bats and rats, we reach the dreaded 'ZONE'.<br>
<br>
The world did stop, the action ceased, was this some type of gate?<br>
And what's this silly messege that says now &quot;Loading, please wait&quot;?<br>
<br>
So zoning is a little pain, but new fun we would find.<br>
Oh no! I'm dead and worse that that, my ass forgot to bind.<br>
<br>
So now to find a place to kill the creatures we must slay.<br>
A person tells us &quot;These are camped, you assholes cannot not stay&quot;.<br>
<br>
So after looking far and wide, we get a little pissed.<br>
Every place we try to play already has a list.<br>
<br>
We then decide to try a quest, and kill a creature rare.<br>
We kill 100 placeholders, and still it is not there.<br>
<br>
Then finally it shows it's face, 4 hours we did wait.<br>
Some wizard kills it with 2 spells, he laughs than casts his Gate.<br>
<br>
We finally decide that other fun we'll try to seek,<br>
The Wood Elves here are awful cute, perhaps we'll have a peek.<br>
<br>
And since this game is make-believe, perhaps it is alright<br>
to be a Romeo and have a different girl each night.<br>
<br>
But after doing this a while, we find to our dismay<br>
that Romeo is something that you're not allowed to play.<br>
<br>
So dog and frog and golem we must cmap both day and night,<br>
they always spawn the same old place, and that begins to bite.<br>
<br>
Verant, I must admit you had me with your baited hook.<br>
But then I cleared my eyes one day, and took a better look.<br>
<br>
And those that want to flame me need to take their mirrorred glass,<br>
and look at our reflection while they KISS MY BIG BLACK ASS.<br>

Tyrus Shadowdancer<br>
<br>
While I well know who is innocent and what has gone on, I probably have more &quot;cause&quot; to hate you than anyone else in this game. Know what you are not worth my time to hate. See I was married to Merianne, both in game and in RL. Both are ended now. While there was more to it by far than you in RL, you played your role in it as well. See we had several conversations in game over it and I was told, by you,  something to the effect, &quot;it was all in game&quot;. Shit dude I knew Merianne for 20+ years and KNEW it was not &quot;all in game&quot; more the fool I for falling in love with someone so fickle. While Tyrus sits in dust I sit back and see that Karma does bite people in the ass. Again I am proven right about stuff.<br>
<br>
I stick by my opinion that you are a turd, have been a turd and always will be a turd and if I can be of any service to make your life miserable I will. =)<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

Its almost like you are bragging in your last couple of posts. Youve done nothing to be proud of. Whereever the blame may lie, rest assured some of it is yours, not all perhaps, but some. The fact that you have a wife and child and cheated on them in this fashion is appalling and you should feel extremely bad for the BS youve pulled. They didnt ask for this crap. What kind of example are you setting for your child. And dont be stupid enough to believe that they could never find out. Life doesnt work like that. Everything you do comes back home my friend, you never really get away with anything, sooner or later you pay for your actions. Do you want your kid to know that his father cheated on his mother in an online game, was cybering with several different women, ect. I know I wouldnt want my kids to think that about me. Think about it.<br>

<br>
Again you have no idea, as I mentioned and as others mentioned they kept it quiet.  No one said a thing when I was grouping with you and meri.  It wasnt until I was directly asking them &quot;here was my experience have you had similar with this guy?&quot; was I told &quot;I dont group with him unless I have to&quot;  That is pretty mello stuff and far from a &quot;hate truehart bandwagon&quot;<br>
<br>
as far as your rep as being a &quot;playa&quot; etc... as I mentioned I knew none of it, I didnt know who was married to who in RL nor did I have any knowledge of your previous relationships etc... all I know is my interactions that were directly with you.  I initiated them in an attempt to get to know you.  I got to know you a little better and posted above my experiences with you.<br>
<br>
you see , there wasnt a hate TH bandwagon to jump on.  All of the dirty laundry was on the boards for all to see, and I didnt see a whole lot of hating TH posts on those boards.  (of course I joined JD much later than you did so I am not privy to what was on the boards before I joined)<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway think what you want, it really doesnt matter.<br>
<br>
The game is over, and no one has won, except you getting a few months of free EQ play time and your all so important &quot;last laugh&quot;.<br>
<br>

5. cybering with ANYONE in EQ means SHIT!!!!!!!! it does not make you a man..go wack off somewhere else besides a game children and adults play ...my entire family plays and thier children play too we dont need people like you in thier world....and if you say its the parents responsibility to keep them away from you YOUR A FREAK! thought you were a COP! some behavior for a police officer huh? tell ya what buddy track my red neck steroid ass down and we will see who bites the pillow!<br>
<br>
6. if you try to say im the jealous EX your insane. i HAVE what and who ive always wanted ..youve NEVER EVEN SEEN HER! LMAO! ..but you think  shes your EX . and you think you can run her and i down with your make believe stories sorry MR male model i dont think anyone buys your shit anymore. <br>
<br>
7. NO WOMAN IS AN EX IF YOU HAVENT EVEN SEEN OR TOUCHED THEM YOU FREAK! <br>
<br>
8. the only time your wife and child come into the pic is when you try to bail on someone because you cant meet them in RL <br>
<br>
9.  Lets remind everyone what kind of guy he is in general ..a woman hes leading on gets cancer and the poor thing struggles through it alone only to find out the man she thought would love her was a total fake and couldnt lead the lie anymore because she needed help and someone to love ...dear god i know i would want that if i was balanced between life and death YES LIFE AND DEATH! NOT A FUCKING GAME!...in a time when she is batteling for her life loosing her hair and struggeling day to day to make another day what does he do?!?!? im writeing this to tell you..he CHANGES his clerics name and HIDES! ....oh you are such a big man TRUEHART  <br>
<br>
10. so lets sum all the facts together ....hes a lier cheater child stalking heartless puke who is supposed to be a police officer? ...i dont know about you but if my 15 year old daughter is anywhere near this man i would panic <br>
<br>
11. ANY man knows men do not cyber for the enjoyment of women  but how often do we as men go out in our real lives and have woman BEG to have sex with them? ..i myself have to beat them off with a club  and im am a normal guy ..<br>
you INSIST that you do it for the ladies!  ...hmmm lets see when a woodelf comes up to me and says hi handsom want some? i KNOW its either a guy or someone who wants something ..you are NOT a gift to woman ..you are a plauge to human kind!<br>
<br>
Good ole truehart he told me he was the same age as me 29 at the time and he was the black fella from the young and the restless and that he was a male model and was a apt manager and that he was a police officer also ..well when he fights with me he says things like YOU WERE JUST A DRIP ON YOUR WHORE MOTHERS LEG WHEN I WAS GETTING IT EVERYWHERE! ..nice huh? thought ya was the same age as me? guess not ..Im so sure he will have a million lies after i post this ..ive read them all ..but if enough of us come forward the truth will be told!<br>
<br>
Please everyone if your children play EQ watch them! there are people like this man out there!! And i apologize before hand for my language but if you are reading this you have already run into him and im sure you have seen worse <br>
<br>
Ill end in saying if i was the one who passed you bye and your face was onfire i wouldnt stop to piss on it! All of the things i have stated are true and he knows it. i couldnt really post all the things ive had in tells from him they are just to vulger. Have a merry life MR male model police man maint worker stud EQ player ..seems alot of jobs for a guy with 3 50  characters <br>

I am not going to dignify your post with lengthy defenses.. I think your reputation as a self absorbed, egotistical liar speak for itself. <br>
About the only thing that you got right about me was the fact that I am married. <br>
I find it very telling about your character as a person that you feel it necessary to qualify every relationship with sordid, sexual overtones. Yes, Meri and I are friends, as is Failbhe. Just friends.. but that type of relationship is obviously not something you grasp. <br>
It must be a sad, sick world you live in.. I dislike you yes, but I pity you more. Get help, True.. while it isn't too late.<br>
<br>
Tootles.. I won't be back to post, this tour of the twisted, wretched side of the human psyche is over for me.. <br>

Gredilis!!! I have been waiting and hoping that you would show your face here! /cheers <br>
I'll tear you a new ass hole in a sec. <br>
<br>
First I want to respond to Ellesar. <br>
Yes, married people playing here and engaging in make-believe romances may have moral flaws. But it is a fact that the very thing that made Everquest the success it is was NOT the game play mechanics. It was the integration of a chat room into a multiplayer herioc fantasy game. And the majority of persons having make-believe romances, or sexual role-play in EQ are in fact married in RL. Just as most chat rooms are filled during the day-time hours with bored house-wives seeking some extra 'zing' to perk up what might be a hum-drum sex life at home... the same is happening here. And believe me, there are many people you play with on a regular basis that are doing it.<br>
<br>
Now Grendilis... I knew that you posted a earlier post here, and had responded. I decided to edit it since you posted under a alias, and being the chicken-shit person you are... would have denied it was you. But NOW you posted and I can talk about your sorry ass.<br>
<br>
You are pissed because I had a 7 month EQ relationship with Remmy/Lexxi (Lexxi 50th Cleric Drinal). During that relationship she was married to another person that plays EQ, and he was a class guy.  <br>
<br>
During our relationship, Fara 50th Wizard, used to hang out with us. Lexxi believed Fara was a real female. Maldictus, who was married to Fara in game believed she was a real female. Fara entered into a second EQ marraige, and had a ongoing relationship with the Enchanter Erza. Nobody had any suspicioun that Fara was anything other than what 'she' claimed to be.        <br>
<br>
Then *I* got tired of Lexxi and her RL drinking problem. She would get drunk and pass out at the KB 1-2 times a week. I had to get a GM to relocate her to Felwithe more times than I can count. And so I ended the relationship and Lexxi/Remmy... and Fara, who had been a good friend to both me and Lexxi was single finally at the same time that I was. Me and Fara got together, she joined Grey Bear Clan with me. <br>
<br>
Then a good friend who knew somebody that knew Fara in RL tipped me off that Fara was really a 17 year old guy. I was sickened and shocked. I told Erza, and both Fara's former EQ husband's and Fara quit EQ for a while because of it. <br>
<br>
Then YOU move in on Lexxi and have a online romance with her... while she is married!! And worse than that, your home-wreaking, wife-stealing ass gets her to leave her RL husband and move in with YOU. How can you have any room to talk about me??? I remember you hanging around and trying to hit on her while me and her were still together. While I was telling her online to get into treatment for her drinking problem, YOU were telling her to leave her husband and come get into your BED. <br>
<br>
What can you do now in EQ? Without me there for you to send your Hate /Tells to all day, you must be pretty bored. You said to keep just me and you in this, but how could that be? The whole reason I ever met your sorry ass is because you cannot get me out of your system. Why? Because you know that she and I cared deeply for each other. After begging her to get help for her drinking for 2 months... I had enough and ended it. You jumped right in behind me and probably shipped her cases of booze so she would be drunk enough to leave her RL husband and move-in with you.<br>
<br>
All the silly stuff you wrote about me and what I have said to you is all to distract the real fact of your jealous obsession with me...that has went on for months now. You have her with you now in RL, so you SHOULD be happy and move on... and stop obsessing about me. <br>
<br>
My RL are and what I look like are none of your concern. Why are you so worried about who I am, how old I am, what I look like? Hmmm. I don't even know you, have never hung out with you... only thing we have in common is that after I left Lexxi (who was created as a partner for my Bard Hartsong), you grabbed her on the re-bound and got her to leave her RL husband and move into your cardboard box with you. You never were able to get over how close me and Lexxi were, and your jealous obsession has driven you all this time.<br>
<br>
Now keep *F*ing with me, and we will talk to Lexxi's ex husband and hear what HE thinks about this. He plays here on Drinal too, you know.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugrendilis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grendilis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(6/12/01 12:48:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1>  Yes moron you think i dont know zyll and he i ? It still doesnt change the fact that your a pathetic loser and cant have RL relationships you just pick out odd facts that have nothing to do with you being a asshole.<br>
<br>
I met lexxi and i became friends in spite of you with her.<br>
<br>
and we became more ..inspite of you<br>
<br>
and a friendship became RL ..something i could do you couldnt <br>
<br>
And RL pic wasnt of a model ..and i wasnt cybering and looking for a DATE on EQ<br>
<br>
Friendship of a woman is something youll NEVER understand <br>
<br>
Again i wouldnt piss on you if you were on fire <br>
<br>
And i wont respond to anything else you say i have no time with you i even wondered if i should post but i felt it a obligation no matter what lies you spewed after this i felt others should know..odd none of the others posting ever had the problem being ripped a new ass like you huh?<br>
<br>
Again how could i be bitter or jealous? the only thing youll ever have is your hand and a keyboard ..nothing more ..dream all you like talk all you like. i love real life warm blooded woman. not hi elf pixels ..get a life <br>
<br>
im not even spell checking or anything F that your not worth that time<br>
