I do agree with Synide, its over.  We all do things in the game we regret later and I truly dont think Phoenixx intended to offend anyone.  Phoenixx was just trying to help someone and appreciated the help for the guild.<br>

Probably even better chances at winning, why?  Because by the time he gets 51 he won't have to compete for Lodizal as much.<br>

So why not have someone who can do the quest NOW have the map?  Kinda fucking stupid to let a lvl 35 loot it.  No, EXTREMELY stupid.  Logunn, why don't you organize a raid for Vox, and I'll go as my rogue.  Then I'll go in on eyepatch because I have a lvl 1 cleric sitting in FP that I haven't moved yet.  Then what?

Now this makes me sad, the ranger is now justifying the decision this just gets better and better, you would figure hed remain low key.<br>
<br>
1. We were asked to help the players who they asked too are NOT lootwhores, they were allowed in on the lottos. Personal gain is not an issue here, yet the guildmates posting defensive flames would have you think so. The issue is the level of the player allowed to loot on an item dropped by a 60th level mob, now being justifyed because &quot;they said so, it was their raid, and thats the bottom line, cause Stone Pheonixx said so!&quot; <br>
<br>
2. Statements are being made now that they could have completed the raid without our help. shrug. I felt we brought something to the table.<br>
<br>
3. To this Taldone invidual, sir I sincerly hope you are in a position to lose a lotto in a situation like this, I am sure responses like yours would be a bit harder to type.<br>
<br>
4. Lets end this on a positive note, one day there'l be a ranger with a kickass mask, and hey The proc might work at 35th level!! Seriously lets move on, we know the way people really feel on low levels looting high level gear, specially no drop stuff from the people involved, I offered to help, I have put the thing in the past the only thing bringing me back here is to make sure that no ones passing the bullshit or distorting what happend now :)<br>

I also VERY rarely post, I prefer reading to writing. However, IF it went down as Phoenixx states in his posts and the Lotto rules were stated both BEFORE&lt;most important&gt; and after the kill, then yes I DO agree with his decision on letting the Ranger lotto once on 1 item. <br>
<br>
Let me offer you another hypothetical example Slinker/Shol:<br>
<br>
Lets say that &quot;Slinker&quot; is away from home, and Shols online, he gets a tell from a friend who says Lodizal is up and would like him to bring Slinker instead of Shol to help with the Kill. Now, assuming this happened, the raid leader let &quot;Shol&quot; lotto on 1 item for Shol instead of Slinker.<br>
<br>
In essence that's exactly what happened and the Level be DAMNED. Level has NO bearing on the participation of the lotto, ONLY that you DID participate and helped kill that Mob.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Player&quot; behind that computer generated graphic is the same person, whether its for a Lvl 53 Shaman or a lvl 34 Ranger. That's also the most important thing.<br>
<br>
Please remember that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaktunka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aktunka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#993300>(3/27/01 8:40:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Thoughts</span><hr size=1> Again, I was there as well with my lvl 51 warrior. I didn't roll on the map piece mostly because I am pretty sure my chances of seeing the griffin are between slim and none, so I am not being swayed by any involvement in that lotto. <br>
<br>
I personally did NOT hear anything about Osteopath being played by someone else that would be looting as a ranger before the kill happened. AFTER the kill, and after the loot dropped was announced, I did hear Phoenixx say that he would be lottoing as ranger. Personally, I always make sure everyone understands loot rules prior to the kill or raid if it is my raid. That is the best way to avoid any of that sort of conflict. <br>
<br>
Oh well, I hope that we all can put it behind us and move on. Good luck all :)<br>

The second would be what the hell is a 35 ranger going to do with ONE peice of the eyepatch, hed need multiple peoples 50+ to help him camp the other parts of the quest. The whole CoF naggy comparison dosent work because this is a quest and that is a singular item, theres nothing else involved in it. The map peice is usless to him untell he is 55 or so, when he might be able to camp it on his own. People do raids all the time and dont get loot, he should have to face up to that fact. The raid was what, 2, 3 hours of his time, if that. It really was ment for those 50+ chars who could even GET the item, let alone use it. Another thing is i dont think we should kill lodizal any more, hes the single most trouble causing mob on this server. The whole club of the ice ocean thing acouple spawn back was rediculous. This server gets in more fights about this mob then any other mob, its crazy, thats just my two bits. <br>

yeah but if &quot;shol&quot; was level 35, you think i`d make a mockery out of the raid and even consider being in a lotto against other higher level ready to use/do the quest players ? No fucking way. I wouldnt do that to people I know, let alone guildmates.<br>
<br>
Lets put this into perspective, im the type of player who would rather see ANYONE, i mean ANYONE, get an item they can use, as opposed to having it sit in MY backpack. It has become fairly apparent that isn`t the global drinal case. (Mind you there are some really awesome people here and you know who I mean :)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uphoenixxspiritwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phoenixx Spiritwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#993300>(3/27/01 2:22:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> End</span><hr size=1> Ok, everyone has had their say and I can see what the general consensus is here. Right or wrong, it was my raid and my decision and nothing can be done to change that particular lotto.<br>
    Slinker, I don't hold your anger on this against you. I do have a problem with you choosing to come straight to the boards and attempting to flame my guild over this matter. I gave you a fair chance at discussing the problem and you certainly could have voiced your disgust before the map piece was even lotto'd.<br>
     *However* I have thought about the situation and understand your view on it. I will state again that this is NOT how I normally do lotto's and please don't make this into &quot; this is how Phoenixx/and or Divinus Veritas does their lotto's because it isn't. Because I requested help from within my guild by asking a lower lvl ranger to bring his cousins higher lvl Shaman, I felt that he deserved a fair chance at lotto'ing for a single item, whatever Lodizal dropped ( and he could use/quest/equip). This was an SINGLE exception I made. Does that mean I will allow such things on the future, no. We needed a shaman and in a hurry and I felt better going with one of my own rather then someone I had no record of. If someone disagrees with it before the rolling starts, send me a tell immediately. I have always been fair and will make adjustments for valid points if every present agrees.<br>
    In the future I will take extra steps to ensure people, if not 2 times or 5 times, are aware of how the lotto'ing will be done prior to lotto'ing. I also with such future encounters probably lotto different ( aka ask for which items people intend on lotto'ing before any rolling is done).<br>
<br>
      That's pretty much all I can do. I won't make an apology for allowing the ranger to lotto because my main point here is that fact that he indirectly added to the success of the raid and therefore had a valid reason for choosing to lotto. Perhaps I should have let him lotto as the shaman, perhaps I should have excluded him all together and gone without one. For that I may have a bad decision and for that you can blame me for. My apology for that. I think we both could have done a better job at making clear how the lotto'ing was going to be done and to have made it clear that we both understand and could have voiced any disagreements PRIOR to the item being lotto'd.<br>
<br>
      With that, a truce is called and I can hope that this thread closes with the understanding no one was trying to &quot;Whine&quot; nor &quot;Screw anyone over&quot;.<br>

*Also* Though somewhat off topic, this is an FYI for those who are or will actively seek to complete the eyepatch of plunder quest. I have found no level restriction on completing the quest and despite the difficulty of killing Lodizal, the rest of the quest is fairly easy ( and yes, a lvl 35 ranger is capable of completing it).<br>
