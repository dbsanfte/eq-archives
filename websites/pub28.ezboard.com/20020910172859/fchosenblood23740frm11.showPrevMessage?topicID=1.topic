<br>
&quot; I tire of this my friend, sing for me one of the ancient ballads.&quot; Said Caroneskarn, dressed in Felwithe Silk Evening wear he sat in a large room lit only by a large fire in the room's center. <br>
<br>
Lolyen was the only other person there for the time being. By command he began to sing the tales of the past, of mighty heros and noble protectors long forgotten in the changing dark world. Then Lolyen paused in mid song...<br>
<br>
&quot; I remember when Kelethin was one a place of great honor, where the people lived in the open instead of locked a way in their homes giving into the mercy of the guilds.&quot; Lolyen said with  a sigh.<br>
<br>
&quot; When a guild infringes upon the rights of his fellow brethren, betray us to the dark forces and knife their own homelands in the back... you know their are problems in the world.&quot; Caroneskarn said in a mocking tone.<br>
<br>
Lolyen Nodded and Caroneskarn continued &quot; ... And now I suspect you wonder why we are here? frankly, I don't know I recieved a note from Tesia to come here with anyone I could find. You, Lolyen, were the only one I could find.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; What of Orsean? or Gaeamyen? the Priest Ashenith...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Is right here Gentlemen&quot; Said Ashenith stepping out of the shadows. His once young face now ravaged with age but still ever a noble elf as he always seemed. There was a quick shaking of hands and smiling nods between the three Karn but they each stepped back taking opposing stances around the fire.<br>
<br>
&quot; There once was a time when we all stood here together ready to go to our deaths at a...&quot; Said Ashenith, but, Carones cut him off.<br>
<br>
&quot; That was long ago, we all know the score.&quot; Said Caroneskarn<br>
<br>
The doors of the great hall opened with a small gust of wind, they quickly swung back and were bolted shut. In an instand a small wood elf appeared out of thin air, the magic keeping her hidden from their sight fading away slowly from the head and finally down to her booted soles, fading away like dust in the breeze, revealing her sleek and apparent very feminine form.<br>
<br>
&quot; No Nephew... What is the score exactly?&quot; She demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot; Tes...&quot; Caroneskarn began to say. She wouldn't let him finish.<br>
<br>
&quot; Is this it? I sent messages to everyone...&quot; She said softly.<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm Sorry M'lady...&quot; Ashenith said.<br>
<br>
&quot; It makes no difference.&quot; She said looking down at the floor trying to hide a tear almost forming in her eyes. &quot; You all remember, don't you... for years we've all been living in shadows of our former selves. Hard to believe Ori had such an affect on us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm comfortable with who I am... Its a hard world, got to get by in it and make the most of things.&quot; Said Caroneskarn, he looked around and recieved nodds of aggreement from both Lolyen and Ashenith. He looked towards Tesia, she remained sullen. He was reminded of how like Ori she was, he imagined that should Orito had grown to an old age, she would have assumed his work... as it is well known knowledge that half elf have shorter life spans then their elder brethren, unfortunatly few live to see old age, Oritokarn was no different.<br>
<br>
&quot; So you mind getting to the point of this whole meeting Aunt Tesia Karn, I didn't come stifing across dangerous country side leaving my shop in Shadowhaven for a social gathering.&quot; Said Caroneskarn<br>
<br>
&quot; What of Orsean? I was sure he would have came.&quot; Said Tesia<br>
<br>
&quot; M'lady, Orsean has turned in his sword for a hammer and the forge. He makes an honest living in Qeynos as a smith, married a nice human girl, raising two young ones. Serving as a trainer in the Qeynos Militia from time to time. Sadly his wife has taken to illness and he could not leave her side.&quot; Said Ashenith.<br>
<br>
Tesia smiled, &quot; good for Orsean&quot; she though to herself. <br>
<br>
&quot; .. and Gaeamyen?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I saw him in Shadowhaven about a month ago, he stopped in the shop for magical supplies. By the looks of it he was doing an assisnation, he hasn't turned up in the jail house or the runt would have petitioned me for bail money I'm sure.&quot; Said Caroneskarn with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
&quot; Then this is it...&quot; Said Tesia, she continues &quot; You all come with me.&quot; She walked towards the back of the great hall. She gestured with her hand and the hearth in the room began to blaze with crimson fire, then slowly faded to a normal flame, &quot; One or Ori's favorite tricks&quot; she thought.<br>
<br>
Illuminated in the room was an old desk still bearing the crests of the Norrathian Protectors. The room was still dim even in the fire light, maps and plans were still strewn across the room. A few small items, camping gear bottles of brandy, bed rolls, a finely made bed with soft quilts and down pillows. Windows opening on to the forest. Caroneskarn remembered the room all to well, the quarters of the General. It also became apparent that the bed was well made up and kept up, Tesia had been living here, careful not to disturbed anything in the room.<br>
<br>
His jaw struck the floor, the fire crackled and with a flash he saw it. In perfect condition, the armorment of Oritokarn hung cerimonial over the hearth. His Scimitars crossed across the crest of the Norrathian Protectors born upon his Shroud of Nature. The gear was well worn, and well artifacts of an older time in this day and age, but still impressive. Much likes the cermionial gear in which all the remaining Karns, including himself, had stashed away in whatever they call home. Caroneskarn swore he could hear in the wind &quot; we are all layed low...&quot; so he whispered the words he knew so well.<br>
<br>
&quot; We are all layed low by death... untill then let me win glory.&quot;<br>

I think all the characters in the story have been pretty true to their rp'ing... with out me Carones has become a cynical prick and Tesia has become a leader of the family relying on the good nature of her family to gather at her ask but can't really get them to do anything =P<br>
<br>
For the next story... well... I won't say anything as to the next chapter but if you arn't starting to get the message, Oritokarn Wolfensoul is dead but this is the history behind Oritokarn Forestwraith...<br>

Keep reading =) <p><CENTER>
