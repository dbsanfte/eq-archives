I took a course and we spoke about women benefiting from affirmative action more than any other minority.<br>
<br>
I think the fact is not that all women choose to reproduce and slow down their careers, it's that since someone is a women men ASSUME she will eventually have a child and slow down her career. That FACT is that when business owners are considering a women, they pre- judge her based on her having a child whether she has had one in the past, plans on having on in the future, or never wants a child. <br>
<br>
Just because you have a child does not mean you cannot handle a full time career, however business owners( normally white males) assume that women who have children= women who have to stay at home with those children. They don't consider that a women is capable of having a career and a family at the same time. While men can right? Men have been able to hold careers and have children and now a days you will see men playing just as much role as the female in raising a child. So having a child or wanting to shouldn't be an excuse for not hiring a women. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 929<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 12:52:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  .....</span><hr size=1> 1...

My sister is a good example of a mother/professional. She is currently expecting her third child. She is an OBGYN and head of the department in a military hospital.(and no they are not lenient to anyone that is not pulling their weight) She had her first child when she started her residency her second at the end of her residency and now is working 12 hour shifts and 7 months pregnant. She’s managed to completely reorganize her department suiting the needs of her department and the whole hospital. Being a mother she uses her free time for her kids. I work in a very physically and mentally demanding position myself in medical administration and still can handle working and being a mother. No one put a gun to our heads and said &quot;You better have children now!&quot; I didn’t do it to repopulate or to oppress my carrier. I just felt I was ready to become a mother.<br>
<br>
 I did spend time as a housewife and stay at home mother because in all honesty I don’t trust other people taking care of my children at their most delicate time. Mothers who chose to stay home get the worst treatment by society in my opinion. You get those replies most mothers get used to ignoring. The ever famous &quot;Oh&quot; when you are asked and answer to what you do for a living. I can tell you right now staying at home was hard. Try keeping a house clean, children entertained and educated with basic knowledge they need AND try to keep that house you just cleaned CLEAN and the children still entertained and learning. The hours suck, the pay is nonexistent but you get the greatest benefits, watching your kids grow up the way you want them to. If other women choose not to have children and keep their carriers booming, I applaud your hard work and determination. But don’t judge what you have no knowledge of.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#FF0000>Drinal Ally</font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 557<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 4:16:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Dirra using the percentage of the number of women who reproduce does not fly. If women didn't reproduce you and every other white business owner wouldn't exist so the fact that women reproduce is an obvious given and shouldn't be used against us. Thats like saying men have a penis No shit lol. Not to mention the same percentage of women who reproduce is the exact same number for men who have children as well, but I don't see anyone holding that against a man.<br>
<br>
- to the other guy who posted about his personal experience.<br>
Did you ever even consider that she just worked at home and pulled her weight? Sometimes even working more hours than an office job? Men and women do this all the time. My dad has been working at home for years and works harder than half the office employees and has been promoted 3 times because of that.  It's easy to look from the outside and assume you know the situation, but it could very well be that she is a good employee and deserves it. If the management is ok with her working at home then it shouldn't be a problem. Maybe her work is so good that the management thought she deserved to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 830<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 4:28:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Arrora, read very closely, and perhaps you will understand:<br>
<br>
Men (approximate, as a percentage of the population): 50%<br>
Women (same caveat): 50%<br>
Desired number of women, per Tat, in upper management: 50%<br>
Desired num of women, per Tat, in upper management, per her company quote: 20%<br>
Number of women who interrupt their careers to make babies, play EQ during crumbcrunchers naptime, etc.: Some %&gt;0%, let's say X%<br>
<br>
Let's do the math: You can't have 50% of the upper management of a firm be women, unless you discriminate against men, if only 50% minus X% are available.<br>
<br>
To reiterate: 50-X&lt;50  where X is a positive number.<br>
<br>
Does that help? Oy.<br>
<br>
Oh, and we haven't mentioned that very often, upper management positions at large firms go to those people who have earned graduate degrees, such as an MBA. I would love to know the percentage breakdown of graduates from these programs by men or women. I know when I was working at the business school at my alma mater, the majority of the grad students were male. And I don't recall there being an outcry of descrimination here; just more men were pursuing their MBAs is all. Course that was in the 80's; things have no doubt changed -- but bear in mind that the kids getting their MBAs in the 80s are the candidates for upper management today. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sort of the same thing as the fact that many more women enter the nursing field than men; and by and large this is a choice, not something they were forced into.<br>

The UM article shows only slight differences in the enrollment of men &amp; women, and is only one system, so I don't get the point of that although it's pretty to look at.<br>
<br>
The WashPost article does show some interesting trends, but as you read it you will note that the trend started in the mid to late 80s -- remember what I said about seasoning? It takes 20 years to make top management; you are now seeing more women in management in the last few years and I think the trend will continue to grow, due to exactly what we're talking about. Not due to quotas, but due to more women getting the training and experience to make management positions. And even then, you won't see as many women in management as men, due to attrition for family life -- unless the education gap becomes wider; once the pool of women over men candidates gets to say 70-30, then you might MIGHT see 50-50.<br>

Now normally, I could give a shit who Ben or Jerry or whoever give their money to; it's their money. But announcing the fact, and making a big deal about how they are going to give part of the inflated price of their ice cream to some off the wall leftist cause makes me decide NOT to give them the money in the first place.<br>
<br>
I don't give a crap HOW good the ice cream is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeienea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meienea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of the Cat  bag</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 12:49:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Good!

Seriously Dirra, you need to give breathing air a chance sometime.
