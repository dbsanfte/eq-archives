<br>
So you done yet Ceenedra? You said your peice, and we know how you &quot;know when to shut up&quot; (I think that is the right quote of the day)<br>
<br>
Are you going to peacefully go away to your server now? OR shall you also create a char on this server and infiltrate Gwen's guild (to resolve things of course it's the best approach!) ask everyone on Norrath for any information you can get on her for the next year and a half ( not two years but a year and a half!!) - get your brother, Sobe, to create forum postings anonymously with you insulting her- then when she is good and tired of you and has you on /ignore in game, you can complain that she doesn't respond to you when you say Hi to the guild (because of course she MUST love you after you called her stupid in here - and she has serious problems if she doesn't) - therefore she must also be spreading nasty rumours around to people about you and how it greives you so. OH dear she has harassed you! Maybe you can suck the guild leaders dick enough via cyber so that he'll defend you against all taht nasty harassment you aren't participating in at all for no apparent reason too. Fortunately the &quot;guild council&quot; will be smart enough to call a spade a spade.<br>
<br>
Then when she leaves town on vacation maybe you could write a 10 page letter to her guild leader saying how Gwen has subjected you to such unfair treatment and harassment by posting to you in this board -(which you don't contribute to *at all* of course because you are an angel and so very nice all the time thats why you are posting here on another servers boards). Of course again the &quot;council&quot; will be smart enough to call a spade a spade and they'll see through your 10 page letter of bullshit, but you'll keep plugging on with your bizarre need to investigate her forever.<br>
<br>
Then you can follow up by digging up little artifacts of information about her - not necessarily all the facts but whatever info you can get by rummaging around in a nosy paranoid state (for a year and a half - not two!). Then you can post tidbits you gathered on someone who doesn't acknowledge your existence in public forum on a &quot;different server&quot; 1.5 years later (not two!!), and follow up to your own posts laughing at how entertained you are.<br>
<br>
We know how important that &quot;reputation&quot; is for you Ceen. It isn't becoming to come in here like that.<br>
<br>
But we know that you, Ceenedra, know when to shut up of course so there definately won't be any follow ups to this posting from you or your anonymous accounts! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 6/11/01 4:56:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uceenedra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CeeNedra</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(5/31/01 6:01:22 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I could care less about what you say Tat, because what you say doesn't matter at all.  I know the truth and that is all that matters.  <br>
<br>
Of course you have never learned when to shut up and the more you make accusations the worse you look to everyone.  So have at it.  Say whatever you want.  Many folks here have told you over and over you do this to yourself and have no one to blame but yourself.  No one is forcing you to respond to any post let alone mine.<br>
<br>
/shrugs besides, no one I care about would believe anything you say about me anyway.  In fact...from what I have seen here, I think the vast majority of the folks here who read this board wouldn't believe much of what you say.  After all, they know you for what you are.  You have done the same thing to them over and over and over.  They are not stupid.<br>
<br>
You made yourself literally the laughing stock of this board all by yourself.  That in itself is the only reason I posted at all here and the only reason why I keep coming back to read what new things are going on in the ongoing comedy of Tat. Your only value is solely that of amusement--nothing more. So, don't overrate yourself as being important because your not.  You are nothing butm 'amusement'.<br>
<br>
Pretty pitiful if you think about it.  That is all you are.  Something to laugh at.  And they all know that.  Say something to upset you and you rise to the bait like a starving fish.  They dont care what you say, they probably don't even read your long winded posts. I don't.  A few words here and there but that is it.  Then they point and laugh and bait you more and away you go again.  Rinse and repeat.  You just dont stop.<br>
<br>
I was completely amazed when I surfed thru the pages here last night and seen just how many posts contained your name either started by you or about you.  In fact it more or less jumps out at you.  I can't believe just how badly you have trashed yourself and have yet to learn why it keeps happening. <br>
<br>
HELLO?  /knock knock knock IS ANYONE HOME?  IS THE LIGHT ON IN THERE?  It's not like people haven't tried to tell you.  They have.  Repeatedly (and I am repeating it again hmmm).  That truly boggles the mind and the more I think about it the more I feel sorry for you.  Imagine that .. me feeling sorry for you?  HAHA .. but its true.  I do. You are pathetic in ways I hadn't thought of before.<br>
<br>
And as I have added my opinion of you to the pot of flames, I have no need to continue.  I will grant you that making fun of you isn't any better than what you did to me or what you do to other people, and I do know two wrongs do not make a right, so that puts me slightly above your level.  But I don't care.  It's not like you never did anything personally to me to deserve it.  As far as I am concerned I have justification for my few posts here and that is enough for me.<br>
<br>
However, do not expect me to stop reading these boards and /laughing at you.  If your not smart enough to learn from your mistakes and stop repeating them, why should anyone much less myself pass up a good opportunity to get a good laugh now and then?  And, I dont have to post at all to get my daily dose of comedy in the life of Tat on the Drinal boards.  The reading is more than enough.  I've had my little fun digging at you.  As long as you keep opening your big mouth, there will always be someone to bait you.  You make yourself such an easy target after all.  That's good enough for me  =)<br>
<br>
Now as for Gwen, since you brought this up, let me clarify something---I have no issues with Gwen or anyone on these boards.  Not even you.  /shrugs don't even know her.  She wants to stick up for you who cares?  I think she is a bit misguided perhaps, reminds me of the stereotypical dumb blonde.  I feel sorry for you too, but I am not that stupid to think you don't do it to yourself and deserve what you get.  She will learn like all the others sooner or later.  And if not, well.. again who cares?  /boggle<br>

You are flaming non existant pixels of a character that no longer even plays the game.  Tat has no value, her actions or postings have no consequence for any of us in game because she DOESN'T play TAT anymore. <br>
<br>
True the person who was  manipulating the character  Tat still posts here to this board but SO FREAKING what?   All postings about Tat, from Tat etc. all are washed out, over played, rehashed versions of crap that personally 99.9 percent of us dont' give a rats ass about.  Only a few small percentage of you have nothing better to do than keep this never ending and forever boring want to be saga continuing. For all thats unholy in Norrath, let this character remain dead.  I mean ultimately, you have ALL ALREADY won...she deleted.  Bravo, Congrats!  What more is there to say?  What more can you push her to do?  No...your work here is done, enjoy your victory for gods sake and move on.  Dead character, Dead Subject.<br>
<br>
Move on, ciao<br>

PS  Fair warning Ceen, tread softly on the blonde references and your comments about my guildmates.<br>

<br>
Oh well, I just felt it was time I did a BUMP on a flame, afterall I'm not going to sit by and let Synide have all the fun here. <br>
<br>
About this 1 year old debate in HH, I never hunted there nor would I ever take and alt there, why would I when there's far better places to hunt and few idiots to deal with. Why don't you all just drop that event, let it die and go on with life on EQ. I mean there's only so much harping you can do before it's just a complete bore to everyone.<br>
<br>
I am curious as to what class Tat plays now, in her defense I must say she always did a good job when she was in my groups, I really can't speak low on her abilities from my own personal experiences with her.  So Tat if you do by chance *very slim one* ever see me around drop me a line if you need a hand. We had our problems but blah, all in all you did manage to make me laugh at times, even when we were yelling at each other, lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#993300>(6/4/01 4:32:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This threads still going on??</span><hr size=1> /hug Zandalay!!!<br>
