<br>
Homosexual animals are not normal they are defective or disabled or sexually challenged. Put it however you like. Being gay is not like being black or being a woman which are &quot;normal&quot; things. It is like being genetic deaf or blind or having down syndrome. There is something wrong with you internally and your instinct to breed. <br>
<br>
Does this make you a bad person? NO.  just like it doesn't make you a bad person to be deaf.<br>
<br>
Are there some folks who are just perverted freaks? yes but thats a whole other argument. What I stated above isn't an argument its a fact. if you deny it you are an imbecile and there is something wrong with you too ). <br>

You real sure about that? One rather widely held belief is that the reason humans do not have a visible heat period is to keep the male around to help with the nurturing of the offspring. What about forming close tribal bonds? <br>

If these so called parents, I prefer child abusers really believe that their child would have better opportunities as a deaf person they are also insane as well as deaf. <br>

Dirra you have some serious issues with your narrow mindedness. It's obvious from your posts you know absolutely nothing about homosexuals or anything else for that matter. You base all your judgements by what YOU consider to be right and wrong and don't consider the fact that maybe your narrow mind just can't except certain issues. Before you open your homophobic mouth more why don't you educate yourself a little. Most homosexuals are normal people, raised in good healthy families, and are kind hearted. Unfortunately though they have to live in a world with people like you who judge them based on ignorance. <br>
<br>
Oh and Dirra a women doesn't need a man to raise a healthy loving child. There are plenty of single mothers who raise non homosexual children. If they did turn out to be homosexuals its because thats who they are, not bad parenting.

<br>
I have had a number of gay friends; one recently died of AIDS, Hep C, and a number of other things including herion addiction. Another is serving a long sentence in a California prison for drug dealing and more because he was a coke head. Or another who went crazy and attacked his family.<br>
<br>
Every single homosexual I know or knew came from a disfunctional family. There may be millions of happy gays out there; I suspect there are many many more happy lesbians than gay men; most of my experience has been with miserable gay men. <br>
<br>
People I have loved, and cried with, and watched as they screwed up their lives and died or went to prison or worse.<br>
<br>
So don't give me your 16-year old idealist bullshit. I have been around prolly twice as long as you; I've seen and experienced things you prolly never will -- so your nice-nice hand-holding bullshit, while making you sound like a liberal and sensitive person, is just that -- bullshit.<br>
<br>
I never said homosexuality was wrong, and if I did, I mispoke. I could give a shit where people put their whatevers, among consenting adults and in private. But in my experience, it's not &quot;natural&quot;; not one of the gays I've known was &quot;well adjusted&quot;, whatever that means.<br>
<br>
The only conclusion I could come to was that their environment, and life choices, caused them to do what they did. Any other answer denies responsibility for our actions. Which is also bullshit.<br>
<br>
Homophobe? ROFLMAO. That's a bullshit term used by bullshit liberals who wouldn't know their ass from a hole in the ground if someone didn't draw em a roadmap.<br>
<br>
What I AM phobic of is people like you who stick your head in the sand and end up empowering deaf lesbian &quot;couples&quot; to fuck up their childrens lives in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot;. Or allow the bathhouses  to keep operating because it's a gay &quot;lifestyle&quot; choice, allowing many more idiots to ride &quot;bareback&quot; and fill the hospital wards with people who should never have gotten AIDS except they have a deathwish. Course, I then get to shell out my families money via the tax system because we have to pump em full of drugs because they were too stupid to be monogamous or practice decent and easily-accomplished preventive measures.<br>

<br>
whether or not homosexuality is 'natural' or not is entirely subjective, if a person is straight, it isn't, if they are gay, it is.  this does not mean i am saying all straight people think being gay is wrong, or vice versa.  it simply means that it would most likely feel 'un-natural' to the individual if they partook in associated activities of a different sexuality.<br>
<br>
on the note of bath houses being a 'life style' of gay people, please don't forget that straight people run around having unprotected sex and/or partaking in 'risky' behaviours too.  it's just that they don't have a bath house to do it in usually, many just live much the same lifestyle through bars/clubs/work/the gym etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 8:25:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/ez_pic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame deaf lesbians</span><hr size=1> Lallu:<br>

If you openly realize that you judged all gays by only a few that you know, there is nothing wrong with admitting that you generalized and judged. Many people judge whats wrong, right, normal, or weird by their own lifestyle instead of looking at each case from outside of themselves.  As long as you know inside that it is not always the case, then thats all that matters. I'm sorry that so many of your gay friends are going through hardships. <br>
<br>
Also like mentioned above Aids, unprotected sex, and hospitalization from sexual complications is not a gay thing like people stereotype. Heterosexuals are the number one group of people who suffer from Aids and std's, not gays. Straight people are just as risky and promiscuous in their bedroom behavior as anyone else. Being gay is just like any other relationship.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 9:37:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/ez_pic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame deaf lesbians</span><hr size=1> That's funny; I had heard being gay was a pain in the ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulalluieni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lalluieni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 9:48:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame deaf lesbians</span><hr size=1> *grin*<br>

I think the point of this post was the fact that these people engineered their children to have a disability. Now I dont claim to know anything about the lesbian community or much about the deaf community other than they are both usually rich in love as well as everything else &quot;normal&quot; communities are rich in. I know the deaf community seems to be bound closer together than many (my observations) and as my boss at work is a lesbian I can tell you, they suffer and love like normal people. <br>
<br>
Now, focusing on that both of these communities are similar (not the same) but with the same need of love and closeness and with similar desires as the rest of the world... it comes down to this...<br>
<br>
WHAT parent, in their RIGHT MIND, (or left for that matter) would want to start their children off in life with a disablity? (ANY disability) Now, even if these people dont believe it's a disability, most parents want the most for their children. Just because a child is not deaf (or homosexual) doesn't mean that they cant be accepted, loved, or cherished within those communities. I think this was a very drastic meassure taken by very scared people who were afraid of lossing something...<br>
<br>
And it will be very interesting to see how these children feel about their parents when they are old enough to know that they were MADE to be this way. What I think these women should have considered is that these children, having deaf parents (regardless of their sexual offliations) could have everything they wanted for them if they had just fought for those rights. Those children would have been adopted into the deaf community because of their parents and could have probably gotten into those special schools for the deaf if their parents had had the courage to try.<br>
<br>
This takes parents rights to how their child is raised to horrible new heights.... A child doesn't have a choice. <p><img
