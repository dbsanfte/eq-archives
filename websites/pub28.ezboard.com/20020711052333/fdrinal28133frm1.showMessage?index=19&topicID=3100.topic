ESPECIALLY if a few of the guilds who would like to think of themselves as honorable people will support it.<br>
<br>
I mean, if Cleric X is camping RF, RF pops, Cleric X gives the call, and 5 or 6 (or more) guilds do as much as they can to mobilize an RF force as quickly as possible, it's gonna be hard for greedy-disrespectful-guild_01 to KS. Sure, it could happen, but it will definitely be more inconvenient for them.<br>
<br>
And as far as the problem of getting on the list is concerned, all a Cleric has to do to get on it is to walk into SF and let the list-holder know they want on. That doesn't seem unreasonable, and we've been doing it with any number of MOB's since EQ was a few months old.<br>

I would suggest that you keep a Ragefire channel, PW and  moderate it with people that you know belong in it and just have people log into it every time they get on. <br>
<br>
I know a bunch of Mystic Legacy people that would support every person on that list in the hopes that when one of our clerics is ready, they might be able to participate. (heh see ya in 6-12 months)<br>
<br>
Either way, You can sign Jakle up to help out when you need it. You can also include Sraiye (my sister) on the list and Dovelyn (my mom). They are all of the same mindset as the Jak Attack...<br>

I really wasn't in favor of posting on this board for this reason, although I understand why some people wanted the list to be public instead of just kept but the current cleric camping rage.<br>
<br>
This list wasn't compiled from a select list of clerics who happened to be friends.  It's made up of the clerics who happen to be showing up in skyfire.  Find out someone is already there, talk to the cleric currently camping.  And decide to participate.  If you know clerics not on the list, then it's cuz they haven't been showing up in skyfire and seeing what's going on, or it's cuz they chose not to get on it.<br>
<br>
It's a choice.  No one is forced to get on the list.<br>
<br>
If you decide to get on it, then you know right up front that you have a bit of a wait for it.  Lots of clerics need him, but we only get a little over 1 a week.  Sony's rules, and we can't change it.<br>
<br>
If that sounds lame to you, and you don't think you should have to wait, by all means start a camp.  Just know that all the people who did try to join in a community effort will be working together to ensure that the cleric next on the list gets the dragon.  Sure, you might get lucky and your guild might be able to mobilize before the current cleric can get enough people there to do it.  But i wouldn't count on it.  In the past 2 months, i only know of 1 cleric who was able to get a force to take down rage before the cleric on the list did.<br>
<br>
Also, understand that this isn't a list being mandated by the guilds.  It belongs to the clerics who were camping it.  Crimson twilight doesn't officially support this list, but we do support our clerics who chose to be a part of it.  Right now, we don't have any clerics on it, but i would imagine that when Rage pops for Boomi, if he doesn't have enough guildmates on to take him down, and we're not in the middle of a raid, you're gonna see people with CT tags dropping into SF.<br>
<br>
So why waste your time telling people it won't work when it already is.  Especially if you're not a cleric.  Fortunately, people with experience are never at the mercy of people with a theory.  <br>
<br>
If you are a cleric ready for rage, you have a choice.  you can choose to wait a bit and get support from others that need him too, or you can go it alone and face all the frustrations clerics have faced since rage was moved to skyfire.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you all, especially Boomi who hopefuly will be the next to plunder the dragon's heart.  <br>
<br>

Keep Ragefire as FCFS, as it has been since time immemorial.  <br>
<br>
Think of the uproar there would be if mages started a list for Magi P'Tasa, wizards started a list for Phinny, or rangers started a list for the mini-bosses in Hate.<br>
<br>
Sure, you're still going to get people ks'ed (you will in any case), but if you think this is in any way &quot;cutting down on the cleric bottleneck&quot;, you are kidding yourself - you are only making sure that certain clerics are getting their epic before others.  <br>
<br>
And there are going to be far more clerics and their guilds who will not want to be *any* part of this list.<br>
<br>
Edit: And for those people calling for this list due to this bottleneck, bear in mind that Ragefire is the *ONLY* true bottleneck in the cleric epic; the rest could be done in two-three days with luck and a good guild behind you.<br>

<br>
its turning into a matter of numbers.  if this list is going to be supported by UC, UF, CT, GotK, you have approximately 250 people+ right there who stand behind this list, most of whom are level 60 or close to it in guilds who are used to mobilizing fast for big kills.  Add to that some of the smaller supporting guilds like House Bloodthorne, Dark Family, Divine Intervention, etc., and you can add on a few hundred more.  <br>
<br>
And sure there might be times when Ragefire pops during a time of day when most asian guilds are in full swing, and they'll get him because they can mobilize faster during those times and a lot of them might not be aware of this list, but almost any other time, you have a very large contingent of support from many people in many guilds who will come on short notice to help you, regardless of your guildtag.  <br>
<br>
anyway, i know there are some small problems with the list...i've heard peoples names ended up out of the original order and in different orders now and stuff, but the clerics seem to be pretty satisfied with it, and as long they are, i'm right with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualuyenoftunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aluyen of Tunare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/02 12:51:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3100.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Lists..</span><hr size=1> Calaniel wrote:<br>

&gt;&gt;The nice part of the list, which some people seem to have missed entirely, is that you don't have to endlessly watch for Ragefire... when your turn comes, you stand watch. You don't have to fight off other clerics trying to steal &quot;your camp&quot;. If it takes you 3 months to get to your turn on the list, you can use the time to do other stuff than sitting in Skyfire sulking.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I can see where you're coming from, Panamah, but that still won't cover clerics and their guilds who don't want a part of this list.  If they want RF, you'll still see them coming to ks you; and if you are sitting there alone waiting for Rage to pop when they have 30 or so people with them, claiming some form of seniority as part of a list on a message board isn't going to cut it.  <br>

<br>
Seke, I can see the idea and the ideal behind this list, though these are the self same problems that occur with old world dragon lists on servers - people's names get bumped out of order, perpetuating bottlenecks for individuals, and favouring others.  <br>
<br>
And wait for the argument when two (or more) clerics using this list who think they are &quot;senior&quot; for Rage turn up in Skyfire at the same time. <br>
<br>
Aside from that, I still think this is a bad idea, since I've seen how creating lists like this for mobs affects people and friendships. And just for the record, this just my opinion, and not the opinion of my guild.<br>

No, but sending a tell to me, Bargeroth, Zarax, and Garathson and letting us know whats going on and asking if we could lend a little extra muscle sure will &quot;cut it&quot; against almost anyone on the server.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucaendf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CaenDF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>1st post by this guy</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/02 1:48:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3100.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Lists..</span><hr size=1> I personally support this idea and will be available to help in any way I can.<br>

I don't care for all the drama and heartache and headache that has surrounded this camp.  I certainly never wanted to step on anyones toes.  That is just not my personality.  Alas, before I knew of this list Ragefire did pop when no one appeared to be around, (not even me.. I was botted)  Yet, there was a cleric there.  What happens then... big fight, big drama, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Before I knew of this list, I started to create a formal list in my mind.  I would buy ragefire.com or make a board or something.  I would post the idea on every public board Drinal has.  I would get very little support.... <br>
<br>
I was very happy to meet Magada aftter I stepped out of the shadows in Skyfire.  I learned of a list already in place and I was more than happy to get on it.  From what I was told, the original clerics randomed for thier spots, and after that it was whoever asked to be on it got on it.  There were not really any rules, and we don't really like too many rules.  They always get broken.  Broken lists are not that great.<br>
<br>
Camping Rage is not all that bad (as it could be) when you have so much support.  I respect this list, just as I have after becoming a part of it.  When he popped for Puleo, both of us were sitting there dead asleep.  Someone in my guild got word he was up.  My friend called shortly after and woke  my boyfiend.  He woke me up,  and I nuked and feared Puleo for like 30 minutes until he finally heard it and by that time -both- CS and UC were en route to kill Ragefire for -Puleo-.  <br>
<br>
No one can say that this list will not work, because it HAS.  The only thing you can say is that somehow, this list will suddenly stop working.  But, how is that?  <br>
<br>
Now that it is semi-formal/official, people have different theories on how it should work, etc etc.  There is no way that it can be perfect.  There are good reasons to keep the list off the boards and there are good reasons to put them on the boards.  Right now it's both.  It's still working.<br>
<br>
My only concerns with this list is that names are getting shuffled and bumped and added to the top.  There is a cleric on top of the list that I didn't have anywhere on my list.  I've seen the same cleric get bumped off or down 3 times.  Another cleric bumped down one.  Another cleric bumped off totally.  I was also given a 'shitlist'.  I won't go into that.  Its VERY easy for this to happen and no one is to blame.  It just happens.<br>
<br>
That is the only problem I see with keeping the list in game.  I wouldn't say that it's -such- a terrible thing because it encourages clerics to be &quot;agressive&quot; about their spot on the list- to spend time in Skyfire with the other clerics and make sure that they don't get bumped or moved or whatever.  Also, you could make friends with someone that way, instead of just knowing a persons name on some list.<br>
<br>
May I request that the Ragefire channel be named 'Ragedance'?  It was the same everytime I was there with Magada and Puleo.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I support this list 100% for what its worth.  <br>
<br>

Or they had control of the list I would have steered clear of the situation.  That however was not the case.<br>
<br>
In almost every ragefire fight on Drinal it wasn't even the cleric's that were fighting, but rather the guild officers of the represented guilds.  It almost all those situations the clerics were offering to random or whatever it took to stop the guilds from fighting.<br>
<br>
Enter the list.  This was set up, and maintained by the clerics themselves.  The people in guild_01 - guild_10 are simply stating they will support their clerics.<br>
<br>
Chindra is on that list, and she is a member of UC, so long as she supports that list, I and we will support her.<br>
<br>
This list will not last forever, its just the nature of things, but while it exists, lets appreciate the harmony, can we? <p><center>
