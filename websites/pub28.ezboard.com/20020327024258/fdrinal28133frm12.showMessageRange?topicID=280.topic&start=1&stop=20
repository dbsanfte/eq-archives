We went up, back to the gatehouse to get another few groups, then back up to the 2nd floor.  We eventually got wiped out by several adds during a pull.  This is where it gets all screwed up.  The raid leader took her sweet time figuring out what we were going to do.  I logged in my brothers cleric to help with CR.  We spent about an hour and a half in sro just standing around.  Raid leader never answered my tells about why we were waiting. <br><br>After we finally logged in, we summoned some corpses, and then sat around and waited.  when we hit the 50 min time till corpses were unrezzable, we found that the raid leader had logged.  That left us with about 15 corpses still up on the second floor unrezzed, 50 till they were unrezzable, and no one had stones for hate since we gave them all to the leader.  We had to have everyone on the raid give their money they had on them to our wizard so he could gate down and buy stones and coffins.  he also used money out of his (and others) personal money.  We finally got everyone summoned and by the time we got them, the corpses were unrezzable.  <br><br>The reason I am posting this flame is to see if I can get a resonable answer to why we sat around for no apparent reason in sro and in the gatehouse when we could have not wasted so much time and actually got exp back for those who died.  <br><br>Not only did the raid leader camp in the middle of a difficult CR, she logged with at least 5-7 blue diamonds and prolly the same or more diamonds.  People had to use personal funds to get the entire raid rezzed, when we could have used gem money to fund this.  We ended up leaving Hate about 12am (12 hours later)  <br><br>The leader of this raid was Matona.  I would just like some answers.  Why the CR took so long, and why she logged in the middle of the CR.  SHe did not let anyone know she was logging.  In my eyes this is unacceptable.  If you lead a raid, you stay to the end.  Especially when doing a CR.  This is my first encounter with her, and I am not sure if I am mad or not.  What I am really looking for is an explanation.  If anyone knows the answers or if Matona reads this, I would love a tell in game.  <br><br>Also I would like to thank everyone on that raid for staying to the end, to Fatee and the others who used personal funds to buy coffins and gems.  <br> <p>Loading, Please wait...</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazsure.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azsure</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/30/01 10:02:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucalim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calim</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/01 10:11:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: First time Flamer =)</span><hr size=1> I left the raid when we went to get more people in the gate house.

Please note that she went LD over 5 times durring the raid while I was there.

Finally I took my butt to Permafrost to gate him out myself. luckily as I got there someone else in the raid who was just as aggravated with her as a leader decided to disband and gate him out. I was fuming about this, I haven't lead that many raids but the few raids I have led I am there until the end. I was in fear with a nasty CR that took out the 1st breakin group we brought. and it seemed almost hopeless, then to make matters worse they announce they are bringing down the server for a patch, I knew time was ticking away, but you know what I was there till the end I went LD didn't camp out when the server came down, and for those people that weren't rezzed before servers came down, I sent them each a tell the next morning making sure they all got there corpses and to apologise for the incident the night before.<br><br>My point after so much rambling, as a raid leader you are responsible for everyone who joins your raid, Matona has proven herself to not be responsible for anything, it appears as if she even has a lack of caring of her own belonging much less anyone elses, My guild will no longer join her raids, It was a suggestion that I made to my guildmembers and they fully agreed with me. I also believe her to of camped during the vox raid also, I ported people to Sro last night from her raid, who had been waiting in Traknon for an hour or so. I believe if there was a reward for the biggest lamer in the world Matona would get it, Hell I want to create it just for her...and she was selling the gems the next morning in NFP.....OMG how unbelieveable...<br>LOL someone told me she sets her group up as the exp group of the raid...LOL <p>Cerenity Swiftpaws Zwernemann54 wanderer</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unarekstigmata.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Narek Stigmata</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/01 3:53:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: First time Flamer =)</span><hr size=1> Off the UGoD boards (more information):<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/funitedguildsofdrinalfrm1.showMessage?topicID=257.topic">pub41.ezboard.com/funited...=257.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>You can bet if Matona is on a raid, I will NOT be there. <p><center><a href="http://www.splattint.com/jayvee/cananimation.gif"><img src="http://www.lindeamerica.com/images/narek.jpg"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uskarlspeedbump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skarl Speedbump</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/01 4:32:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: First time Flamer =)</span><hr size=1> I was asked to join a raid by Matona, and being all happy because I haven't been up since Mith Marr, I was happy to join.

Yeah and since when has verant done anything about that, they break their own rules left and right. It's time for a reality check, one of the reasons EQ has taken a serious downfall is because of system of which verant runs their support, the second and most obvious one is all the little kids who ruined Diablo months after it came out are bored there and have moved onto another game such as EQ. Evolution of rpgs online, it's a fact you cannot escape. The problem with games like EQ is that and there is no true way to resolve these matters. What set UO and EQ apart was simple, the fact that if someone did something like on that hate raid, you could locate them and just make their life a hell on the game, by killing them everytime you saw them and looting all their items and cash. I did this many a times back in my days of UO, perhaps that is why I was feared by those who knew of me on the Atlantic shard, but the point is, it was a well known fact, you dare screw with my character and it was game over. Your house, your armor, your horse, your training items,your gold, your furniture would all soon belong to me. You ask yourself how would this impact on such a situation, well it's simple. They lost everything they owned and ever would own, it was pointless for such a player to remain on that shard, most just up and quit. It may not of been the perfect solution to some but for myself and those who supported me, it was the perfect solution to rid the lands of UO of some pkers and punks who thought they had a easy time bullying/scamming others.<br><br>Unfortunately this cannot be done in EQ, which is it's biggest downfall. Oh sure you could train someone with monsters and get them killed that way, but now you just broke a rule, so now your the one who would really get punished. So what's the answer, well it's simple just don't go on this persons raids. I'm not saying you have to like it, but what options do you really have? I wish you luck on whatever path you decide to travel, I myself ended that path and moved onto greener pastures such as Anarchy, at least if someone ticks me off there I can go out and whoop there ass, without worry of them reporting me, because as the game plays, that's what I am supposed to do, rule over my foes. Hope you resolve this issue with this person, what he *we all know 99.9% of the *female* players are male anyhow, anyway as I was saying, goodluck resolving this issue.<br><br><br>/crossarms<br>/pulp        *Yes this is a pulp fiction dance emote in AO*<br>/disco       *Yup John T's staying alive dance emote*<br>/point<br>/moon       *drop the pants and let the mooning begin*<br>/flip           <br>/rocky       *the rocky dance* <br><br>*If you never saw an Anarchy emote, your missing out on the best laughs a game can offer.

Even in the unlikely chance that it is true, you are responsible for your Avatars reputation. If that means not lettting your signifigant other play then so be it. And if you have to let him play because thats how it works, dont be surprised when your Avatar gets a bad rep and act all innocent when you get pegged as unreliable. <br><br>But just fess up, your reps already pretty ruined, it was you wasnt it?<br><br>Gwarok  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubalrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balrak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/01 7:10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=280.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Mean?
