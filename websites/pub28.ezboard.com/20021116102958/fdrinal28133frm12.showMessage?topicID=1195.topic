Those merry little dark balls of pips and juice have been making my life a fucking misery for the last two weeks.  Such ripe, fruity goodness was never supposed to have a soul as black as its skin!<br>
<br>
It's August in England.  The sun is out (which, believe me, makes a change), the skies are blue and the autumn fruits are beginning to bloom.  And a quick note for you idiotic Yanks in the audience.  Just because you numbnuts can never remember which way around to place the first two letters of this season does NOT give you the right to invent a completely idiotic new name for it.  I mean, what the hell are you imbeciles doing?  Let me guess.  You called Autumn 'Fall' because that's the time of year when the leaves begin to &quot;fall&quot; from the trees?  Where will it end?  I look forward to Winter being renamed &quot;Cold&quot;, Spring being renamed &quot;Flowers&quot; and Summer being renamed &quot;Bikini&quot;.  Morons!<br>
<br>
But I digress.<br>
<br>
This year I decided to try my hand at cooking.  In the past I have had mixed success upon hitting the kitchen.  It either goes spectacularly right and everyone who partakes of my concoctions believes me to be the long lost messiah of cookery, or else it goes horrifically wrong and they have to call in a hazmat team to seal the area.  How did I do this time?  Well, lets just say that they won't be erecting a statue to me this year.<br>
<br>
First off, Blackberry jam.  And that's another thing.  Jam is jam!  Not jelly, ok?  Jelly is the stuff you have at birthdays with ice-cream and party hats.  And jelly is definitely, one hundred percent NOT called Jello.  Jello is either the name of a musician of dubious merit or else a greeting used by those who think they are being cute and amusing.  They are wrong.<br>
<br>
So I head off down to my local free blackberry emporium (bunch of bushes on common land sandwiched between the local reservoir and a main road) and fill a carrier bag full of fruit.  It's a hot day and I've brought  a backpack along with a thermos of cold cordial in case I get thirsty.  I pop the bag full of blackberries into my backpack and trot off home.<br>
<br>
Now, the first problem arose when I got back.  I opened the backpack and discovered that transporting soft fruits in a black backpack on a hot sunny day is not the wisest of moves.  The little fuggers had withered in the bag and about half a cup of red-black juice had flowed out between the seams.  It looked as if I'd stuffed a kitten and a packet of twenty razor blades in there and given it a good shake.<br>
<br>
I extracted what remained of the fruit and started the jam making procedure, whilst leaving the backpack running under the tap to clean out.  Making blackberry jam is very easy.  you heat the blackberries, sieve out the juice and throw away the skins and seeds, add half as much again in sugar and then leave the whole lot to simmer for twenty to thirty minutes.  Maybe add a few extras like to give it a bit of bite.  A dash of lemon or a sprinkling of cinnamon would do nicely.<br>
<br>
I don't know why I decided the extra I would add would be half a cup of cider vinegar.  It must have been the heat of the day addling my brain.  Whatever, I chucked in rather too much of the stuff and nearly choked as a billowing cloud of boiling acetic acid rose from the stove.  Oh well, if nothing else it would make a good dressing for meat dishes.<br>
<br>
The goo was simmering away nicely when the telephone rang.  It looked safe enough so I ran into my lounge and answered.  About five minutes into the conversation I heared a very angry hissing coming from the kitchen.  Oh god no.  I droppe dthe phone and ran back to the stove.  The blackberry jam, now extremely thick, had decided to try to make a break for it and had exploded all over the stove.  There was a sticky black ooze all over everything.  The stove, the front of the oven, the work surfaces, everything.  I tried to dab a kitchen cloth into the mess to soak it up and that was when I discovered that half-cooked blackberry jam is an amazingly good heat sink.  The molten mess slid over my fingers like a particularly aggressive mirror in a Keanu Reaves sci-fi film and proceeded to demonstrate to me why going anywhere near it was probably not a good idea.  A quick yelp, a dash to the sink and I was able to narrowly avoid giving myself second degree burns.<br>
<br>
So far so bad.  Jam was obviously not my bag.  time to try something else.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I grabbed another batch of blackberries, this time intent on trying my hand at pie making.  Now, you must understand, when I cook I try to do as much as I can without the aid of pre-manufactured materials.  In this case, store-bought pastry was a no-no.  As most cooks will attest, making pastry is not the easiest of jobs so it was with some trepidation that I approached the task.  I won't bore you with the details but suffice it to say that the pastry part was that brief sliver of sunlight which pierces through the clouds just before the sky dumps fifteen gallons of rainwater on your head with a side order of nose-targeting lightning bolts.<br>
<br>
The pie went into the oven.  The pie came out of the oven.  It looked and it smelled gorgeous.  The pastry was golden brown, thick and crusty, just the way I like it, and the aroma was heavenly.  I laid it on a cooling rack for ten minutes and busied myself with tidying up. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, my stove is next to my sink and there is only a small amount of workspace on that side of the kitchen.  The plate to which I wanted to transfer the pie would not fit on that area of the surface along with all the dirty dishes that needed to be washed.  The obvious choice was to carry the pie over to the other counter-top, a mere meter and a half away.  With hindsite, the additional obvious choice would have been to accomplish this task by picking up the whole cooling tray.  but no, that crust looked sturdy enough so I picked up the pie only.<br>
<br>
Half way over to the other counter I felt something move between my fingers.  I knew what was going to happen and in an instant I knew there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  Before I had a chance to react half the pie sheered away and fell to the floor with a sickening splutch.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it was the bottom half, along with all the blackberry filling.<br>
<br>

<br>
Have you ever seen the mess caused by dropping two pounds of stewed blackberries three feet onto a hard surface? I dare say you haven't because, unlike me, you haven't been targetted by the Blackberry Cosa nostra.  There were stewed blackberries everywhere, from wall to wall, half way up the cupboards and fridge and a thin, slime trail of black ooze slowly creeping its way into crevaces I knew it would take a jet-hose or a flame thrower to clean out.  It was a complete disaster.  And there was I, looking at this hellzone whilst holding the remains of a perfectly formed and lightly sugared pie top crust.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I was not best pleased.  &quot;Oh dear&quot;, I said.  &quot;Drat and tarnation&quot;.  Well, something like that, anyway.<br>
<br>
That's about it really.  I just wanted to have a good old rant about my epic struggle to tame the mighty blackberry.  So let this be a lesson to you.  They may look like innocent little bags of wholesome juice but inside every blackberry beats a seed of pure evil.<br>

It's wonderfully written - rather reminds me of that old &quot;accident report&quot; (you know, with the pulley and the barrel full of bricks).<br>
<br>
Wonderfully constructed, great imagery, terrific prose.  It reads like an entertaining short story.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, the first thing I did was to run Alta Vista and Google searchs to see if you just didn't cut and paste this from someone else - but I couldn't find anything like it.  If this is truly yours, I'd submit it to a magazine or something.  It's really good.<br>
<br>
I especially liked the Matrix allusion.<br>

Take the phone off the hook and put a sign on your door when you are baking, and for crying out loud, who would try to move a pie by taking out of its tin?! <br>
<br>
Maybe in England, thats something you do.....but in America we leave the pies in the pie tins until the pie is done lol<br>
