<br>
you can click on that link or read below: (notice how she says her boyfriend has 2 level 60 characters on different servers, this is laughable)<br>
<br>
Matona says:&quot;WELL THEN..... I really do not have any explaining to do to you people acting like this but he does have 2 level 60 characters on a different server and we have the same account that has never been a problem cause we work different hours and he started helping me level my cleric at around level 40 and hasn't been playing his much since I said I would find out about the gems and I would repey those to whomever but as for exp now I can not fix that..... I hate to say this but EQ IS ONLY A GAME and I have no reason to steal or lie to you people and if you do not believe me oh well I am sorry I am trying to explain this problem here but you people are just immature and rude and we have been playing the same character for a while and I have not had this problem before but now that it has happened I guess I have learned my lesson. Thx alot for bashing me I really appreciate it..... Matona&quot; dated -&gt;7/31/01 11:33:49 am<br>
<br>
<br>
(now read this at her guilds message board saying her boyfriend ONLY has a level 26 paladin, hmm funny I could have sworn she said he had 2 level 60 characters on different servers.)<br>
Heres the link  :  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub80.ezboard.com/fcollidingfatefrm1.showMessage?topicID=20.topic">pub80.ezboard.com/fcollid...D=20.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
or you can just read below...<br>
<br>
Matona says:&quot;Well I have now seen all the message boards and replied to them all. I was not playing my character when all of this occured so I do not have a &quot;side of the story&quot;. My boyfriend only has a lvl 26 pally and plays my cleric because I am level 51 which I would not be there without the help of him playing me but I was not on the raid Being ME in RL but he was and I have printed out all of posts to show him and THANK HIM as well. I am sorry and I will repay all of these people for gems money etc... There is not much I can do about it. Faid if you were on the raid I apologize to you especially and I understand everyone being upset and I hope to be able to make it up. There are many people who have been playing with me that knows I would not do this. I understand everyones anger as I would be angry to ypou can not give exp back that is hard worked for at higher levels. I am sorry but I do not appreciate everyone bashing me talking about I am a theif, I always steal exp groups ect... because the raids I HAVE done I was hardly ever in exp group so there for got no Loot and have borrowed from you people and PAID you back It is a game I have no reason to cheat or steal....just a game.... Lisa aka Matona If my charac is on Monday thru Friday before 6pm est pls do not send /tell it ios not me it is HIM... Thanks again&quot;   dated-&gt;7/31/01 9:08:12 am<br>

<br>
well it looks like to me that she started freakin out when she saw how many people were pissed at her, that she thought she'd simply make up that her boyfriend has 2 lvl 60's on different servers.   She posted on her guild website first to try and make them aware that her boyfriend only had a 26 paladin and wanted to play a 51 cleric...  then she looks at the UGoD board and makes up some BS, well Matona .. that was a nice lie but I busted yer ass.<br>

Lying is not a good policy in general unless you a truly exceptionaly liar.   In your favor Matona you don't fit in that catagory.   Even IF she usually lets her man play her char, there are times when you don't do that.   Leading a plane raid is one of those times, LOL.<br>
<br>
&quot;but EQ IS ONLY A GAME &quot; means what?  You aren't getting what you deserved for that fiasco?  Trust me, we know its just a game.  If you had ACTUALLY led us up to hate to be slaughtered and then bailed with the loot the consequences would be much more severe.  But since its all fantasy and merely constituted a colossal waste of about 30+ peoples time, you will have understand that we are gonna blast you pretty hard on the msg boards, and you are gonna have to take it like a (wo)man.  <br>
<br>
Like she is even checking these boards anymore.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot; i have not had this problem before&quot; ?<br>
<br>
Incase everyone doesnt know this is the SECOND raid in which matona has been leader and ALL of the following has happened:<br>
<br>
* Matona kept and sold all gems in NFP the next day (she even had the nerve to /tell meskall whats the PC on a Blue diamond&quot;?  )<br>
<br>
* The entire raid was wiped out due to POOR planning and leadership<br>
<br>
* matona disapeared shortly after the wipeout (1st raid went AFK in SRO for 8 hours, 2nd raid &quot;her boyfriend&quot; logged)<br>
<br>
* people on the raid where forced to put up thier own money to help the CR<br>
<br>
* Several people did not get exp rezzez (do to the fact there was such a delay waiting for matona to start a CR)<br>
<br>
So Matona PLEASE explain the first 1 while not including that yer boyfriend sat you AFK....<br>
<br>
<br>
I spoke to several people before the raid and told them not to go i wish i had made a log...i told them what happened on her last raid...and then she did almost exactly the same thing agin...IF she says it was her boyfriend that time too im inclined to believe he leads all her raids...and if it was not...then they are truely retarded for each other as they show the same responce in the same situations.<br>
