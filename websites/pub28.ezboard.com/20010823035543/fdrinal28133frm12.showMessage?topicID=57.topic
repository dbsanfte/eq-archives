And I doubt that will ever happen.  I am a very good at playing my cleric and monk, especially my cleric, but I still miss things on occasion or make some newbie mistake (very rarely I hope).  I dont doubt most of us are more focused when Shaere is leading because we know he'll give a rash of shit for a mistake that affects the raid.  That is why his raids tend to be more successful than others IMO.<br>
<br>
If you want to raid with Shaere suck it up and take your scolding when you scrooge up, we all do it so dont feel like your being singled out, I've even seen him &quot;WTF&quot; himself for a bad pull once or twice.<br>

Quick, what is that from, you can choose from a movie, a comedy bit, a tv show, dvd, game, song, blah blah...<br>
<br>
Guess right, and I got 5 black sapphs for ya.<br>
<br>
Oh and meneldil, you might be angry too when you have spent 30min fd dragging corpses underneath ragefire and you get coh out....I appreciate the coh, but not yetttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt<br>
<br>
Oh and rahul? I was killin bats w carus and icarus and we decided to do some fg, since no one was, you guys werent even  in zone. So we kill some ldcs, get lev, med up a little. <br>
<br>
Shaere tells the group, mana?<br>
&lt;grouchy rahul and 2 other rangers show up&gt;<br>
Shaere says wtf ranger patrol<br>
Shaere tells the group what in Gods name can a monk and 3 rangers kill, ss room?<br>
Rahul says, get lev.<br>
Shaere is thinking(hmmm they getting lev, going to fg. But they ignore us, sitting here with lev, and they dont see its clear of ldcs? They have to be smart enuff to ascertain why we r here, yet they ignore us. And monk 3 rangeers aint killing any fg)<br>
Shaere tells the group, lets go.<br>
Group starts killin a fg, hes half dead, and 2 cs groups pop up and start killin it.<br>
Shaere thinks sigh, hwg again.<br>
Rahul pulls first 2 fg.<br>
Shaere says, look guys, do you always do this? is this typical cs crap? You KNOW we were here, You SAW us here, yet you proceed to ignore us, start pulling ad killing regardless, and you still aint even said hello.<br>
Rahul says sorry we didnt know(lies)and I was just checking to see if the first 2 were up. Once they aggroed I had no choice but to pull.(ever hear of fd man? /w all rahul. Gee lvl 60 monk).<br>
Shaere says look, we dont want fg, we were just bored. But what I do not, appreciate is you simply comin up in here ignoring us, and pulling and killin while we are here. THAT isa bullshit.<br>
Rahul says, you knew we were coming and u hurried and ran past us.(yes 30minutes before you got to solb, I felt a disturbance in the force and hurried to fg).<br>
Shaere says dood, you guyus can have fg if you just would freaking say hullo, you guys doin fg? Then Ill say yah, but you can have if you want, we just bored. But you dont friggin come into someones &quot;camp&quot; and start killin shit, The way this SHOULDVE gone is, you said hello, and we talked blahj blah. Not this typical uberguild crap cs does, you knew we were here, you SAW us, yet you try might makes right. <br>
Maar tells you, you talkin shit bout my guild?<br>
<br>
Well you know what, maybe I am. That was bullshit.<br>
<br>
Shaere tells maar, this what happened. They saw us at lava, ignored us, got lev, cam,e up after us, saw us there, started killin anyway. W/out a hello or nuttin. Now they can have the fg, I dont care, but at least freaking say sumpin or ask. <br>
Maar saYS, THEY LEAVE NOW.<br>
Shaere says no man they dont have to.<br>
maar ignores you.<br>
<br>
Rahul says you heard maar guys, lets leave these selfish people to the fg.<br>
<br>
................<br>
<br>
Look , I dont need anything from the fg. I said you could have em. We were just bored.<br>

I'm so sick and tired of people saying they don't like the violence on television or the lyrics in songs today etc., etc.  I say if you don't like it don't do it.  Nobody forces that crap on you.  If you don't like the way Shaere runs his raids, talks, scolds, etc., then DON'T GO.  And to go and flame about it afterwards?....pretty lame. As far as I know he does the best he can on every raid to make it successful. I've never known him to do anything to deliberately get players killed.<br>
<br>
Thogg....as far as ragefire that wasn't Shaere's failure!! To my recollection there were like 26 people there.  If a few key people had bound there etc., we would have taken him down.<br>

Now while that may seem like a small feat for some of you, for me it was a very nice feeling. The raid went  very well for the most part, with decent armor drops and good amount of stones. We had very few deaths (most of them during maestro and inno if i recall correctly) and for the most part the raid was smooth as silk. I commend you on raid leading ability Shaere. <br>
<br>
There were a few times though where people were bitching over the way lottos were being handled or whatever. Some person got in on lotto and won an item, then when the good part of their armor dropped, they were allowed in on that item and won that as well. One person had seen all the lottos throughout the night being /random  1 100  then when he was able to lotto on  something the lotto was done by Shaere with a /random 1 2...so there was a lil bit of a lack of consistency on that part. This is where I got to hear a lot of bitching in ooc, groupsay, shout, say etc and that was the ONLY part of the raid that I could really have done without. It kind of ruined the whole atmosphere hehe. <br>
<br>
I think that a LOT of this sort of problem can be avoided though with just a few  short lines of speech when going through your instructions. If people have some understanding, it can go a long way to make it so that people don't have any reason (or what they think might be a reason) to whine about stuff. <br>
<br>
First of all, we are all people behind the keyboards, and we ALL will have some sort of expectations of how loot, movement, breaking the plains, etc will be done. It doesn't matter if you are a raid newbie, you are from Mith Marr, or you are from Tunare. You will have some sort of expectations on these issues. As a raid leader, I think realizing this will be good in the long run. And no, i do not mean you need to ask people what they expect, just have the idea in your head at the startup that different people will expect different things, and that is good enough :)<br>
<br>
Second, now that you are thinking that different people may have different expectations, you then decide what YOUR expectations are. Since you are the raid leader, you are going to rightfully enforce your raid expectations, and all those involved will need to follow your instructions and go by your rules for loot or whatever. This step I can see most leaders do not have a problem with. They are usually quite clear in their own mind about how they want the raid run, how they want to run the lottos, etc. This part usually isn't where the problem comes in on mixed raids. <br>
<br>
Third, you can avoid a LOT or ALL of the bickering over loot or whatever by just telling everyone that os going to the raid, and this means BEFORE porting up to the raid spot or zoning in to it or whatever, what YOUR rules are going to be for the raid. I guess specifically focusing on the hate raid I was with Shaere on, there was a lot of great instruction before we gated up to Hate. Was very wel laid out for the newbies to the planes that were with us. Unfortunately, many different people didn't know how loot was to be handled. This is where most of the bickering seemed to come from. I guess i will elaborate based on what I saw that night. <br>
<br>
For some people, what they have always experienced on a raid for armor is that if you win a piece (any piece) you are out until all there win a piece. For some people, they are used to it being that if you win a piece that is considered junky, then you are still in for any other pieces that are not considered junk. Whichever way this is handled is a valid loot system, but the person that has the first view might be a bit ticked if the lottos are done by the second view of it, or vice versa. But if these people understand how the lottos are handled BEFORE they are actually in the middle of the raid, and they still agree to go, then they don't have a leg to stand on if they bitch, because they KNEW it was that way before coming. <br>
<br>
I think even a couple lines of text  during your pre-raid instructions would be enough to diffuse most of the bitching on the raid, Saying something as simple as &quot;Ok, I will be handling all lottos for loot and they will be done the way I see fit. They may not be done the way you are used to, but I assure you they are fair. My say will be final on all loot. If you do not agree with this, then please disband now and do not attend the raid.&quot; <br>
<br>
If people understand that sort of thing, or even a better description of how things will be run, and they  still  go, then they can't bitch about it. Errrr, well they shouldn't bitch about it hehe. <br>
<br>
Hmm, I hope I got my point across. I just woke up so maybe it doesn't make any sense. I will try reading this again in a few hours :)<br>
<br>
Personally, I do not care how loot is done typically. I have frequently joined people on raids where they say up front that the raid is to get &quot;so and so their quest item/loot/etc&quot;. It makes me feel good to help out sometimes. <br>
<br>
Of course I don't care if that is the way it is donen in the planes  either. If someone invites me to a planes riad, and  they  say &quot;All loot goes to me, all shaman loot is to be left on the  ground to rot, even if you need it&quot; I am ok with that too....as long as I know those are the rules and I agree before hand :)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, have fun all <br>

About raid leaders...<br>
<br>
You know who they are before you go, at the moment you have the choice to say no.  I don't like being yelled at either, hell I am a father of 5, but if I screw up and I am on a raid of a leader that does that, I have already accepted that persons attitude.  Nothing else to talk about there.<br>
