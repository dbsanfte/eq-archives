Concerned chiefly or only with oneself: <br>
<br>
selfish<br>
<br>
\Self"ish\, a. 1. Caring supremely or unduly for one's self; regarding one's own comfort, advantage, etc., in disregard, or at the expense, of those of others. <br>
selfish<br>

http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=selfish<br>
<br>
there ya go thats the definition from an online dictionary.<br>
point proven I know the definition and its a perfect fit. So don't assume I don't know the definition its not that complicated.<br>
<br>
p.s. I never said it wasn't important to them.. I said did it out of selfishness re look at the definition pls thx. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usaddil242.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saddil242</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/27/02 7:39:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hhe</span><hr size=1> Well, ignoring the fact that that is a poor definishion of selfish, with a connotation already attatched to it, I can still use it. According to that definishion, you are selfish for not giving all of your money to other people, especially people who have none. But since you are chiefly concerned with yourself and disregarding others, in this instance, you are by definition selfish. I'm sorry, but selfishness is not a bad thing. There is a bad connotation to it, and you are simply using the word's connotation in conjunction with the fact that by definition this was a selfish act (when in reality all acts are selfish) to make an argument. Kinda like I just called you selfish for having money. You are not wrong for not giving all your money away, but since I used the word selfish to make my point, it certainly has that effect, but we can all see, that's ludicrous. Hence, I said you apparently don't know the full definition or implications of the word, as I said before.<br>
<br>
And you said that killing the sleeper wasn't worth it, even if it was only for the sake of waking him. You made a value judgement and said it was cats', presuming that you know what it's worth to them, or how important it is to them. Just more examples of that ignorance that Nodda likes to point out.<br>
<br>
re learn to think and interpret pls thx ^_^<br>

I was right in using the word I used. Lets not get into the ways to use the word since I used the word the right way too. Your not an English teacher stop pretending to act like one and just admit I used the word correctly lol. Whether its good or bad who cares, it was my point of view. Your the one misinterpreting. <br>
<br>
- It doesn't matter what it "meant" to them. I was stating the actual outcome plane and simple. I already said what you get out of it. Getting to say you woke the sleeper.. thats an obvious fact and however you feel about waking him and whatever kick it does for you still leads back to "you woke him".<br>
<br>
- for the record I do try to help people less fortunate than me. I do donate to house less people and do what I can. I'm not rich though lol. I don't screw others over for my own needs, so no I wouldn't be considered selfish.<br>

She is not a loot whore or a guild jumper I would vouch for her any day of the week. I can see points on both sides of the arguement here. But in the end it is just a game. So who's wrong who's right? It all depends on how you look at it, but in the end were all playing to have fun, or at least I hope we are. It seems the longer people play this addiction of a game the more they lose sight of the whole purpose to begin with which is to enjoy it and have a good time get some shits and giggles.<br>
<br>
Anyways I know this is the flame board, but I just wanted to play the intermediator on this one. I hope you guys can all settle your differences and focus on enjoying the game. Taking a 3 month break from the game you come back with sort of a refreshed view on things. Go out and have some fun enjoy life, it's too short to be arguing about such minute things on a message board. Ok said my peace, oh ya and leave arrora alone or I will haev to get medievil on yo' ass biotch lol. /Group Hug /sneaks a kiss form arrora =)<br>

<br>
&quot;Would it turn you on if a 4 groups of female players woke the sleeper wearing nothing but silk teddies? Do you think this would make people less angry about waking the sleeper?&quot;<br>
<br>
Seriously though, if youre not going to read people's posts all the way through, dont even bother trying to respond to them :P You (and many others) have labeled CiH as a guild Selfish and/or Greedy, whether it be soley for this act or for another, whether you say its ONLY for this act, or for every other act, the point is, you still labeled ALL of CiH Greedy and/or Selfish when you made your original statements. In some people's minds eye this may be the truth, in others it may be a lie, who am i to say? But nevertheless, it is a Stereotype. You take one person, or one action, and base your opinion upon the entire guild based on that - and that is a stereotype.<br>
<br>
When Nodda called you an &quot;Ignorant Bitch&quot;, it upset you i'm sure, i know i'd be very upset, perhaps this is just a way of stirring things up inside of you? Letting YOU be stereotyped such as you've stereotyped him for calling him Selfish? (when you stereotyped cih as selfish). People can come up and agree with his accusations, or argue with them, but no one can say that it's right or wrong, because it's all an opinion. <br>
<br>
So tell me Arrora, how does it feel to be stereotyped? <p><P>

Why don't you go put something there instead of screwing up your post. Like I said earlier you don't like it look the other way. I actually got about 30 responses.<br>
<br>
- Basically your an ignorant bitch for your smart ass remark =) since were throwing the word around so casually now a days. I guess some people don't have brains. And if you actually read the question and knew anything about feminism its actually interesting. Your a woman you might want to look into it. I've never seen a women knock a feminist thats pretty funny lol.<br>
<br>
CIH woke up the Sleeper its was selfish its really not that difficult to understand. Lets all get over and stop trying to butter up what happened its over. You represent your guild don't you? So guess what if they do something good then your good and if they do something selfish then you will be looked at that way. Its a guild thats how it goes. One person screws up they can make the entire guild look bad. Its not brain surgery, you all know that, so like I said stop trying to cover it up and just admit it already. It was selfish woopy doo. I've never met such a bunch of baby's that can't even admit when they did something selfish. Others can admit it, but you guys just keep switching stories around or try to take personal jabs to take away from the actual subject matter. Pretty lame.<br>

So in that way they aren't selfish. <br>
<br>
- regardless its just a stand point from how you see the game really. Some people ( like me) see it as comparable to rl with rl people behind the computers and others see it as just a game. To me its a game, but I have to take into consideration other people, to others its a game and the object is to win.

Yes i'm a female, and no i dont care much for modern day femminists or whatever, back when women were actually fighting for their civil rights, it was a good thing, more power to them, but going around and whining about how men should start having babies and women being construction workers just isnt my thing, sorry! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Nowhere in my post did I start calling you a Bitch either, so to retaliate by calling me names only makes yourself look more childish than before, but by all means, keep on digging, it's getting pretty funny. If you would of actually read my post you would of seen that I was merely pointing out that Nodda was just doing to you, the exact same thing that you've done to him.<br>
<br>
In my post I also said that whether its right or wrong, you stereotyped us. Whether he was right or wrong, he stereotyped you. Did I ever say in my post that what CiH did was indeed right? Did I ever say that what nodda said about you was right? Indeed I did not.<br>
<br>
Before you start jumping onto people like a rabid stuttering animal, think about what they've said, and think about what you're about to say.<br>

With all due respect, I thought I knew a lot more than I actually knew in College. Statements like this do you and/or your cause no good. Things in the real world are a lot more complex than your college lecturers would have you believe. In the real world, truth also matters a little more than it does to many college professors.<br>

Christina Hoff Sommers, &quot;Who stole Feminism?: How Women have betrayed Women&quot;<br>
<br>
Amazon.com Editorial Review:<br>
<br>
Though several women have begun to speak out against the shrill and paranoic &quot;backlash&quot; feminism that has left many feeling slightly alienated from the term itself, it is hard to imagine a critique of that position more devastating than this from philosopher and &quot;equity&quot; feminist Sommers. In essence, it is a patient account of the heavy boots of propaganda crushing truth and stirring the young into a frenzy of anger. It rejects the dangerously totalitarian &quot;gender&quot; feminism of Susan Faludi, (early) Naomi Wolf, Gloria Steinem, Catherine MacKinnon, and the like, in favor of a more classic, &quot;equity&quot; feminism Sommers believes is represented by women as diverse as Betty Friedan, Susan Sontag, and Camille Paglia. Gender feminists, she argues, have an influence well beyond their numbers. They not only control a great many administrative institutions in academia, they have also found ways of manipulating a gullible news media and eager-to-please politicians.<br>
<br>
Most dangerously, they play fast and loose with the truth. Remember those reports about the so-called rise of violence on Superbowl Sunday? A total fabrication. Remember how we were told that teenage girls suffer a humiliating drop in self-esteem? Well, the data from this study is guarded by the American Association of University Women, but if you can get hold of it, you will find that the same data &quot;proves&quot; that African Americans have higher self-esteem than whites! What about the alleged high incidence of depression in women? Distorted data. How about the oft-reported &quot;unequal&quot; treatment of girls in school and the 59 cents women are supposed to earn to every dollar earned by men? Look at the truth and weep at how we're deceived. Time and again, Sommers went beyond the media reports and the press-releases of the advocate-scientists and found that the original data had been controversially interpreted or flat-out turned on its head.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, most of these findings come from a small cabal of like-minded academics who are almost never questioned by a press constitutionally disposed to prefer wild claims over fair ones. These women form the core of a gender-feminist party that proclaims itself bent on ridding the world of logic, science, exact thinking, romance, the concept of beauty, hierarchies, history, art, and all the other chains and opiates that even today blind most women to their brutal subjugation. Sommers' work is a study in totalitarian methodology and self-justification. No wonder women in the street feel uneasy. But maybe everybody will read this book, and the civil transfer of power to women can proceed. Stuart Whitwell --This text refers to the Hardcover edition<br>
