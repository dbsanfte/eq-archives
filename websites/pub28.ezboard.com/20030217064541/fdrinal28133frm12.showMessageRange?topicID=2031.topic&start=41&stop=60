<br>
I won't address the 1st two points since neither of us have the ability to prove anything.  I will assume that Iraq posses weapons of mass destruction for the rest of my arguments.<br>
<br>
I know of at least 10 countries that posses nuclear weapons and I'm sure there are at least another 10 that have chemical and/or biological weapons.  Should we force a country to disarm solely based upon their ability to cause mass destruction?  Should we disarm using that logic?<br>
<br>
I believe we will have far more American casualties in any new war with Iraq as we will be fighting in Iraq and not merely trying to expel them from another country.  Also, the last 2 major terrorist actions on US soil perpetrated by foreign agents were by Bin Laden's group.  There is very little if any connection between Bin Laden and Iraq seeing as how Osama and Sadaam don't agree on much religiously or philisophically.  There is however a long association between Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia, should we force them to disarm?  <br>
<br>
As for the increase in terrorism, it will increase in direct relation to our increasing involvement in Arab affairs.  If we don't want to give them a reason to hate us all we have to do is withdraw and leave them alone.  This won't happen since our government decided long ago that lower gas prices are far more important than a country's or region's sovereignty.<br>
<br>
As for CNN, wrong!  That network is too biased for my taste.  I watch Fox news as well as read the paper and internet.  I don't let any one news organization or individual provide all my news as no one is able to do that without at least some bias.  So I learn what I can and make my own judgements based on the facts that are presented.<br>

 <br>
I think a lot of people fail to take a good look at history and see what it teaches us.  I see a distinct similarity in the systematic appeasement both Germany pre-WW2 and Iraq today face.  The regulations that were in place after the treaty at Versaille post-ww1 were completely ignored by Hitler.  That wasnt the worst though, the League of Nations (Old name for the UN) did nothing about, and therefore were faced with WW2.  <br>
<br>
In 1998 when Iraq kicked the UN inspectors out they sent a clear message that they no longer were goin to adhere to the regulations and restrictions set upon them.  Its taken the UN 5 years to respond to a breach in the agreement and terms of Iraq.  I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if Iraq has and uses WMD.  In a lot of ways it would serve the world right.  <br>
<br>
One of the reasons Hitler lost WW2 was because he didnt care to look back in history and learn.  Napoleon lost to the russians because he tried to invade during the winter.  Almost 150 years later Hitler tried the same thing with the same result.  With a policy of appeasement the UN allowed Saddam free reign to do whatever he willed.  <br>
<br>
For those of u that are anti-war I just want u to think about something here.  What happens when Saddam is nuclear capable with enough missles and warheads to threaten us and our allies?  Do u think he wont use em?  If he already has them this point is moot, but if he doesnt, and he is trying to get them, then I think the effort needs to be made to disarm him and his regime.  I dont want to appease him until he sends a message to the world Via using WMD.  <br>
<br>
Again , this is just my view and opinion.  <br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. <br>
<br>
For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax . . . more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin . . . as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent . . . upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents . .  He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary, he is deceiving.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate or attack.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind or disfigured.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained: by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape.<br>
<br>
If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.&quot;<br>
<br>
My own comments...<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein is a violent and aggressive tyrant.  Nothing short of utter defeat will stop him from attaining his desires.  He is an immoral, deceptive, and vindictive man.<br>
<br>
Evil is a very accurate description of this monster.  Evil is not something that can be stopped by talking, or by walking up and saying &quot;Please Mr. Hussein, don't point that gun at us.&quot;  Evil is not something contained quickly and easily.  It must be conquered, but even then, evil NEVER admits defeat.  Evil must be destroyed.  One can't just beat evil into submission, it must be removed completely.<br>
<br>
Look at the example of Adolf Hitler.  After annexing Austria he was warned to cease such actions, but he then went on to kill millions of people.  One cannot reason with evil, it must be destroyed.  Hitler had a treaty with the Soviet Union not to attack them, but he turned around and did exactly that.  One cannot reason with evil, it must be destroyed.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein is following the same patterns that Hitler did.  He has shown repeated acts of aggression.  He has violated UN Resolutions time and again.  He cannot be contained, and must be destroyed.  <br>
<br>
He is a madman with an extreme dislike for everyone but himself (he even tortures/kills his own people.)  He is a madman with an itchy trigger finger.  He's shown his willingness to further his dominating desires through violent actions in the past.<br>
<br>
There is no proof that the past twelve years have cause and reform in his thinking, behavior, or tendences.  In fact we've seen the exact opposite.  He has developed much more cruel weapons than he had twelve years ago.  Also, he has created a much larger arsenal than twelve years ago.<br>
<br>
He poses a threat to every aspect of civilized life on this planet, even his own &quot;muslim brothers.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Over 1,500 years ago Augustine wrote about an idea called &quot;Just War.&quot;  There were two qualifications that had to be present for a Just War.  1.  The cause itself must be just.  2.  It had to be lead by the proper authorities.<br>
<br>
With that said, I believe war against Saddam Hussein would be a Just War because:<br>
<br>
1.  The cause would be absolutely just.  There is no more noble or righteous cause than the protection of human life.  This man is a threat to every person on the planet.  Therefore, for the sake of our safety, our neighbor's safety, heck even the remainder of our enemies' safety, he must be dealt with.<br>
2.  The U.S.A. is beyond a doubt the proper authority.  This statement will probably make many people disregard everything I've said, but please read my reasoning.  Saddam Hussein is a worldwide epidemic and problem.  The U.S. is undoubtedly one of the, if not the top, leading countries on the planet.  Therefore it is not only our right, but our duty to prevent, contain, and, if necessary, destroy threats to world safety and peace.<br>
<br>
And to end, one more quote from last night...<br>
<br>
&quot;Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.&quot;<br>

Sorry Dirra for basing only conservatives in my above post, I didn't mean for it to come out that way.  Some of the liberal bullshit being spewed is just as dumb, there just isn't as much of it.<br>
<br>
It comes down to one thing, though, which I will crystalize here: if you're pro-war, you're lying to yourself about the reasons you are.  No thinking person can say yes to killing with a clear conscience.  It's not that you have one view or another on the CURRENT situation, it's that you are so brainwashed by either liberal or conservative propoganda that you can't believe the world will ever be any different.<br>
<br>
Many of you may call me liberal, and you'd be wrong.  The world you all are arguing about, frankly, is not one worth fighting over.  Until you can see within yourself and be honest about the reasons you feel one way or another, this issue means nothing, because there will just be another issue after that, and then another.  Don't delude yourselves, no matter what side you're on, simply adhering to the system makes you responsible for all the suffering that comes from it.<br>

What do I mean by that? A couple things. First of all, no other president has had to deal with something like what happened on September 11, 2001. This is a first, and understandably it caused some big drops. Secondly, all of the policies that were running during the Clinton era are now coming to fruition. The economy was quite strong under Clinton, I admit readily to that. But it was built on a very weak foundation. The economy had already started to slow significantly while Clinton was still in office. Throw in the collapse overall of the whole dot com arena of the market, and that was really slowing it down. Economic growth based on companies that barely exist on anything more than paper are not a way to build a strong economy that will last. Also, all the corproations that were getting away with all the lawbreaking under Clinton are being caught in the act by the Bush administration and called up on it. I mean when you look at WHAT is happening, and not just saying &quot;Bush is in the white house, so it is his fault&quot;, then you can see that much of the blame doesn't rest with him. Now, do I think his plans are the best? No, not from what I have seen. But I can also say that alot of the reason for the big slow down in the first place is also not the fault of his administration either.  <p><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~mauskau/pictures/kermit.gif" border="0"></a><BR>

So even if we sit around saying its not worth the time and its a non issue there will always be people who feel that blood will eventually bring peace.<br>
And guess what?<br>
These people are the ones with military training and who are going to be the real people who make this happen. It's the volunteers who want this done-remember, no one is being drafted to fight.<br>
Every soldier in there is doing it on their own free will.<br>
And since I never heard about Bush gasing anyone or burning oil that other countries need, or just plain killing his own family and people... I'll take Bush over Saddam anyday.<br>

<br>
A kind of elitist &quot;If you didn't server, aren't serving, you dont' have room to talk.&quot; attitude. You said get off your butt and do something, and I told you I've been there and done that.<br>
<br>
If someone has been in the service they have a different perpspective on fighting, especially if the've been in it. <br>
<br>
Will I support the troops? Yes, unquestionably.<br>
Will I suppor the Commander-in-Chief? No, because I belive his motivations are questionable. I probably would have done the same thing with Kennedy too.<br>
<br>
I doubt everyone that is in or has been in the service completely supports what Bush is doing, but the ones that are in are following orders none the less. You take an Oath and you keep your word.<br>
<br>
If the president had the smoking gun, or even gave the UN time to do a complete and through job inspecting. I would support action, as would our NATO allies. <br>
<br>
If the US does this alone, sure we knock Sadam out of his seat and defuse one bomb, but someone else will popup to take his place somewhere else. I will end up being one huge game of Whak-A-Mole and our military will be the hammer chsing after the mad man of the moment.<br>
<br>
Of course we (the skeptics) could have Bush all wrong. He could just be walking and talking tough because he thinks it will get results. <br>
<br>
Clinton sure blew that one in Kosovo. By saying &quot;We won't send in ground troops.&quot; He gave Milosovich a green light to tromp right through and do some ethnic cleansing. Clinton couldn't say everything was on the table because he wasn't willing to put it out there and mearly hope he didn't have to use it.<br>
<br>
Bush on the other hand looks like he's putting EVERYTHING on the table, and expects to use it. <br>

<br>
Europe and America must stand united<br>
 <br>
THE real bond between the United States and Europe is the values we share: democracy, individual freedom, human rights and the Rule of Law. These values crossed the Atlantic with those who sailed from Europe to help create the USA. Today they are under greater threat than ever. <br>
<br>
The attacks of 11 September showed just how far terrorists — the enemies of our common values — are prepared to go to destroy them. Those outrages were an attack on all of us. In standing firm in defence of these principles, the governments and people of the United States and Europe have amply demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today more than ever, the transatlantic bond is a guarantee of our freedom. <br>
<br>
We in Europe have a relationship with the United States which has stood the test of time. Thanks in large part to American bravery, generosity and far-sightedness, Europe was set free from the two forms of tyranny that devastated our continent in the 20th century: Nazism and Communism. Thanks, too, to the continued cooperation between Europe and the United States we have managed to guarantee peace and freedom on our continent. The transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the current Iraqi regime’s persistent attempts to threaten world security. <br>
<br>
In today’s world, more than ever before, it is vital that we preserve that unity and cohesion. We know that success in the day-to-day battle against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction demands unwavering determination and firm international cohesion on the part of all countries for whom freedom is precious. <br>
<br>
The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the United Nations. All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441, which was adopted unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our backing for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the UN route and our support for the Security Council, at the Prague Nato Summit and the Copenhagen European Council. <br>
<br>
In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime is disarmed. The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity. <br>
<br>
The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel concerned. Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein’s last chance to disarm using peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with him. Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed that his long-established pattern of deception, denial and non-compliance with UN Security Council resolutions is continuing. <br>
<br>
Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they are the first victims of Iraq’s current brutal regime. Our goal is to safeguard world peace and security by ensuring that this regime gives up its weapons of mass destruction. Our governments have a common responsibility to face this threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own citizens and to the wider world. <br>
<br>
The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council with the task of preserving international peace and security. To do so, the Security Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring full compliance with its resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those Resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result. <br>
<br>
We are confident that the Security Council will face up to its responsibilities.<br>

Whoever thinks, that serving in the military is the only way to be rightfully entitled to have an opinion about this crisis, is wrong.<br>
<br>
There are so many things similar to the first Iraq war, it isn't even funny. Did you know that a 15 year old girl claimed to have seen babies killed in Iraq, she testified in noumerous TV shows, US people got angry enough to support Bush sen. and the war really started with whole US behind it. A few weeks later the truth comes out. The girl was the daughter of the Kuwait embassador in the US, and the whole story was fake. Noone cared.<br>
<br>
Now Bush jun. is telling us for weeks that the US intelligence has prove about Iraq still having weapons that they shouldn't have. But noone has seen those proving facts, not even the UN security council.<br>
<br>
He is telling us that the Iraq has atom or chemical/biological weapons. How did they do that? The last controllers in 1998 were sure that the Iraq didn't have those weapons anymore. Now people might say: But in the last 4 years they could have gotten new once. But how concerning the US watching over sattelites, UN sanction stopping the Iraq from making money and all cash transactions being watched? They couldn't buy enough food for the population those last years. Now some others may say: The controlling staff was weak, they didn't find a thing but the Iraq still had it. For those to know: Those biological and chemical weapons are useless after 5 years maximum. And for atomar weapons: Trust me, noone can hide a reactor in a barn. You recognize one when you see it.<br>
<br>
And the last point about the Iraq supporting ElQaida. Thats laughable, cause Saddam despises BinLaden and his guys because of their religion. It's like saying the extremist moslems and the Isreal government are the best friends.<br>
<br>
But whatever we say, we all are helpless stopping a war, because some people in the US government want it. I am still not totally sure why (have some pretty ghood guesses, but nothing proven). Only thing that comes to my mind is that we have the same heads in the higher positions that started the first Iraq war (Rumsfeld, Powell).<br>
<br>
I know that we who despise a war are classified as &quot;traitors&quot;, but thats always been the case with people opposing a war. We get used to it, bring some more.<br>
<br>

<br>
but please i do encourage you to stop reading papers and CNN ... and get the actual facts from a realiable unbiased news source like MSNBC on cable they show both sides of the arguement pretty good...and let all facts known not just the attention getters..<br>
<br>
if you watch msnbc you'll find out facts like... Saddam does support Osama bin laden ... in fact he has 2 training camps there that are known for a proven fact they might not share the same religious beliefs but they share the same goal on a holy war against the USA.<br>
there is proven intel photos of Osama in a camp in Iraq from a few years back on a beach with a old boeing airliner that they were practicing how to overtake a airliner....<br>
<br>
now knowone came rightout and said they were gonna ram a airplane into the 2 towers back then and we did nothing because there was no DIRECT threat to the USA.....<br>
<br>
and look what happened? want to wait again for that same type of situation?<br>
<br>
thats what the government said after WTT that it was avoidable but we didnt act on it...<br>
<br>
anyways i spent way to much time arguing this into the ground LOL... people can scream and yell no war....but ask anyone in the government or listen to any senator......<br>
<br>
we are going to war no matter what after Feb 5th when Powell goes to  the UN with the intel we have....<br>
<br>
btw how many senators do you think will not back this after feb 5th? maybe 2 if lucky ...some arent being as vocal as others on the democrat side simply because they all like to go with the public opinion and dont want to openly commit til they see what the full public does after feb 5th...<br>
<br>
but make no mistake even hillary clinton and Joe liberman  voted yes on the resolution earlier to give Bush full military action control...<br>
<br>
only 2 actively voted against this... <p> <img src="http://www.jaddesign.com/unconquered/craigorr.jpg" border=0 alt="Fire Fire uh huh huh"></a> <br><br>

<br>
In 1986 Iraq broke yet another treaty and withdrew his country from OPEC. Legally Saudi, Omon, Kuwait (you know that little country he invaded for their oil), and France (from an earlier treaty he broke in 76) have the rights to the oil in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Dont know what oil we will be getting our hands on, but still find it funny that the uneducated on this subject still use this arguement.<br>
<br>
Someone on the boards said there was no way for Saddam to prove that he distroyed his weapons and weapon components. Well, thats not true either. Unfortunantly, most of the components used in these type weapons are unstable and have to be disposed of is very precise manners. Many calling for completely new equipment to be used ONLY for that destruction. Not to mention the fact that the waste from destroying those weapons would then have to be contained and measured to determine that they were now in a non-toxic form and the waste itself would be around (yes prolly buried somewhere) because it cannot be burned. So, to those saying you cant prove something is destroyed because it was destroyed need to do some reading.<br>
<br>
Why dont we go after every country that sells weapons of mass destruction to terrorists I saw asked a few times as well. The answer is simple. No other country sells the weapons. Yes other countries do sell the chemicals and solid materials needed for the weapons construction, but at the same time these same supplies can be used for other things.<br>
When a country manufactures and stockpiles these weapons and sells a few to make a little money on the side to the highest bidder, thats where the world is obligated to step in and stop it. <br>
<br>
But then we could do nothing and let them go thier own ways. That way it wont be an airplane leveling buildings and killing people next time, We could wait for Saddam to finish his nuclear program, sell it to the next terrorist org that has the funds and then play pin the tail on the Americans to see what city gets the big bang theory tested in thier backyard.<br>
<br>
Do I think we should go to war in needed to stop this. Hell yes! I'm not a war monger sitting in war paint beating a drum and chanting, but I am adult enough to know that there are some people in the world that cannot be reached through whatever amount of diplomacy is offered.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=557698">What Cobbin wears</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=2031.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=2031.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=2031.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=2031.topic&start=81&stop=84>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=2031.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=2031.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2031.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=2031.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2031.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2031.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm39">Admin/Storage</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER>
