I am listed on it. I DO have a problem with this list. <br>
<br>
1) My position on this list has mysteriously moved down. I was in SF when Mag was camping RF. I was camping  SF when a certian guild petitions me for camping RF because they Quote Got there first unquote, even though RF hadnt even spawned yet. I was there when Puleo was camping RF, this was right after Helden and Mag got RF. I was actualy camping it at the same time as puleo. I was informed that I would get no shot. Because of another guilds power namely the "MB crew". Faman had already promised support to puleo. So i said Fine. I was also told about this mysterious "list" at this point. At that time, I was suposeadly added to it and it consisted of Puleo, and Requiemme. there was no one else on the list. This is the point i was "added". It seems i went from #3 on the list to #7. but crap happens.  I do forsee problems if there happens to be someone there camping RF longer that the one currently on the list. Even if the BLATANTLY lie to the GM, yes its been know to happen. the GM could make you leave the zone, EVEN though you were on the list. If you persisted, you could possible be banned for KSing. The GM's apparently are not all on the same sheet of music. and a few sandwiches short of a picnick...but thats another story. <br>
<br>
2) if there is a list for RF, shoot, lets have a list for all the other mobs.  /sarcasm off KC has been trying to  push a list for sev for a year now. so that would make them happy.  again thats another story.<br>
<br>
3) we will have to see what happens. if it works, i know that the lower and mid lvl guilds would be happy to actually have chance to get RF. share he wealth. heck next we will tie rabbits down for them to shoot at. ;) <br>

<br>
When I talked to you in skyfire, you made no indication you wanted to be part of the agreement. I don't remember exact words but I do remember mentioning how we were helping each other etc and you didn't want a part in it. If you did, you never indicated that to me. So, you weren't put on the "list" persay, as other clerics hadn't because you did not indicate that you wanted to be. I didn't enforce the list because at that time it was an agreement between the clerics that were there, not an enforcable thing, ( I still dont think it is)<br>
<br>
Puleo camped with me the whole week that I was there, thats why he was next, therefore I supported him when it was his turn after me. Faman, being my boyfriend supported this decision because he had seen how long puleo had been there. I believe what was said was completely taken out of context, it wasn't a flame at you or any other cleric. <br>
<br>
After I left skyfire I stopped "adding" people to the "list". I have gotton more than one complaint weeks after my camp that they weren't put on the list when 1) they didn't want to be part of it while I was there or 2) I never even saw them in zone to check.<br>
<br>
It's things like this that will make this list hard to keep track of. Everyone has their own view on the situation. <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/magada/option.jpg"><BR>

<br>
I just want to throw a quick post in here as I am one of the clerics listed, and at first did not see the sense in this list or support it. I did finally come to my senses though and threw my hat into the ring. I'm Feelsgood and I am with the guild Dark Family. This list presents many postive aspects to the Ragefire Camp as well as some negatives, but IMO the positives far outweigh the negatives. <br>
<br>
Here we have a number of clerics who have come together and worked out a way to cut down on the KSing and blatant child like behavior that this camp can bring people down to. Also please note that there are at least 4 guilds supporting this list and the cleric who is up to bat for Ragefire. I believe this is something truly civilized and very uncommon in the game of EQ. I feel very secure that when the time comes for me to camp this mob and my &quot;window&quot; of opportunity arises, I can call upon a vast pool of people dedicated to take this mob down and secure my Epic, which I might add will be the first Cleric Epic for Dark Family and a HUGE asset to our guild. <br>
<br>
From what I have seen, the  majority of the posts here support this list and only selfish and defeatist individuals do not support the list. Some people are not even clerics and throw their opinions into the fray, usually negative. Anyhow we all are entitled to our opinions, so I guess that's a moot point. There will be issues that will still arise, as some Uber guilds who feel they have the right to do what they want within the game, because they can, do not support the Drinal community attempting to come together and work out a very screwed up situation. They  have their reputation, and in keeping with that reputation say screw the list, if we want Ragefire and we have the force we will take him, who cares if Cleric-01 has waited 2 months for his or her shot at this mob.<br>
<br>
The list in itself will be hard to maintain, as Funno stated he was &quot;dropped&quot; down the list supposedly, but I suspect that the same thing happened to him as happened to me. He fought the idea of this list and did not throw his hat into the ring right from the get go, and in the meantime other clerics showed up and were listed. He will just have to be patient, and so will I.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
One thing bothers me about the Ragefire camp, and the people who are listed. I know , or have heard, that some of these clerics are not Ragefire ready. Or in other words, they have not done the quest to the point where they have the shimmering pearl in their posession, ready to be placed in the container and combined. This kind of bugs me, as I feel they should be to the point of the quest where they NEED Ragefire to get their epic, and not place the container in the bank holding up clerics who are indeed ready to finish this mob and their Epic. I know of one server, which I have read about in another post, that requires a screen capture of the clerics account, showing the shimmering pearl description (right click) and his name., BEFORE they can be listed. Since the pearl is a no drop item, this is the only way that a cleric can be verified as being ready for Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Well, that's my 2 cps worth folks. ( wasn't quite as quick as I thought it would be.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) My hats off to those people that have had the insight to start this list, and to those guilds who also support it. It is a definite asset to those clerics in guilds not large enough, or strong enough to deal with the Ragefire spawn, and it is a breath of fresh air in a game that can become stressfull and downright nasty at times, because of people and guilds that couldn't care less about anyone else.<br>

i might add how BC did this.....from the beginning on i got GREAT and AWESOME help from me guild.....had at least one group there farming spells at spawnpoint 24/7....and as cleric u need it, since u get crayz only seein a dumb dragon statue a red ball and grey stones......we got many spells and our low 50ies members got very good xp. some peeps together with me put a great deal of time into this....camp lasted 5days 7 hours rl time...(special thx to the ones bein there longest like baladorn, tanwein, gwentoria, ...and many more))) /hug)<br>
now to the point if this list works! when he popped only 6 BC were online and i asked for help and it CAME without intention of KS.....CT broke off from a tormax raid in kael to help with 2 groups ....TY)))....UF, DI and some more were there and helped out!!!! during the whole time i got NO threat of KS, noone was there to keep track of spawn to KS and i got a great deal of help and offers for the fight from ALL guilds....i think this is by far the best way to do this......cleric on camp holds list and adds clerics on last piece that send him a tell and updates list here when he is done....clear clean and simple.......and it is way better then the constant fights and KSing over this spawn!!!!<br>
I WANT TO THANK ALL FOR THIS AWESOME HELP !!!!!!!<br>

I did this camp back in the days that it originally was moved to Skyfire and my heart sank that day.<br>
<br>
I think that was the day UC really showed its true light when we gave the Ragefire camp (which I had been at for some time) to Fatchung from NC (who has been there straight for 10 days...)  It showed that a community can pull together and do this rationally.  I knew my chance would come.  As I am sure anyone on this list does.  (That was the 6th RF spawn on Drinal)<br>
<br>
For those who fear that the list may be tampered with.  I think that now that it is written down and not in someone's mind/on someone's pad of paper, it will be a lot easier to maintain and a lot less mixups will occur (people sliding down)<br>
<br>
Good luck Drinal Clerics!  Know that Seke speaks for all UC when he offers our support.  I know I will help anyone kill that dragon and rip his heart out! <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36283>Caleniel</a><BR>

To any who dont want to participate in the list you dont have to. Just realize that you will be competing against all of the people who are participating and all of their guildmates. At this point I think there will be a raid ready force capable of being in SF within 5 minutes 24/7.<br>
<br>
Prolly the reason clerics made this list happen and warriors didnt before with sev is the very nature of our personalitys. Clerics are healers and by their nature like helping others warriors are just that warriors and like to fight =p some of us for good, honor and whats right and some of us for evil, greed, and power.<br>
<br>
To all the clerics remaining on the list and all of those yet to be added you have my full support, my sword, and as many others as I can possibly bring whenever you need it. <br>
<br>
To those of you who still have your doubts, Wont it be great to see Dark Family get their first epic enabled cleric? Wont it be great to see all the others on this list and all of those to come get their epics and be done with this camp without the hastle of a race and get back to rezzing our dumbasses like they should?<br>
