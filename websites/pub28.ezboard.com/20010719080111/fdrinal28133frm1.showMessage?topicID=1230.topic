Or maybe 99% of the people dislike THogg becuase he is a whiny crybaby who pouts <br>
like my 2 year old nephew every time something happens in this game that doesnt <br>
directly benefit him. <br>
<br>
Or maybe its becuase he makes posts about stuff and then is proven 100% wrong<br>
in the replies, yet continues to insist his original statements are the truth. <br>
<br>
Or maybe its becuase he is a complete hippocrat who benefits from things but then<br>
criticizes others for getting the same benefits<br>
<br>
Or maybe its becuase he types like shit becuase he knows people will make fun of <br>
him and idiots like you can then say all people flame him for is his spelling. <br>
<br>
Or maybe its becuase idiots like you who defend him constantly becuase one time he<br>
helped you one piece of PHAT LEWT (and hell anybody who gives you phat lewt by law <br>
cannot be a idiot or wrong ever)<br>
<br>
<br>
Like THogg all you want. But maybe you should call yourself a sheep, since you seem <br>
to just want to like him becuase you dont want to be in the majority that dislike him.<br>

It is already slowly happening. the same warriors that use to say that Thogg was an Idiot for having his armor HP over AC are now doing the same thing. Im hearing alot less &quot;thogg is an idiot&quot; and alot more &quot;he is one hell of a PvP'er&quot; or &quot;he may be an ass but he knows his shit&quot; well im going to get back to work take care all.

And yes, I have known Thogg for quite some time.  Here is my theory on people that Thogg can actually call a friend : Even a blind squirrel will find an acorn now and then.

Even though it is just a game you guys kind of treat him like shit.  He never indirectly flames anyone.  I'm not saying this to kiss his ass or try and be friends with him but seeing this from third person view, you guys -do- treat him like shit.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of anger built up on Drinal, and lots of people like to one way or another blame Thogg.  If Thogg was really a dumbass, then great he's a dumbass.  But he's still a person and if you disagree with him that's your choice but don't go mass flaming him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaakla2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aakla2</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=ttp://www.geocities.com/aakla2/EQ000014.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#993300>(2/7/01 9:17:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thogg and why i  like him</span><hr size=1> I like Thogg, I talk with him on and off and he has come up with some very helpfull suggestions. he is like clubber in a way ( no offense intended ) so many people are use to tkaing there anger out on him that whenever he says something people automaticly start to go off on him. or someone miss quotes him and then everyone jumps on the band wagon. take that post he made about the Wurmslayer for example, the one where he posted like 7 pages of log. he said that the wepon was a good offense weapon thats all he said. then someone said that it was shitty for taunting and that thogg was an idiot. he never said that the test was for taunting only that the damager per second was good. then all of a sudden everyone started flaming eachother and in the end they all blamed Thogg for somthing that they started not him. secondly since we came to Drinal Thogg has been saying that HP is more important then AC and agian everyone said that he was an idiot. but then rumors of the soft ac cap for warriors came out and a few people started doing tests. and what do you know. after 1100ac HP is more important then AC. and now alot of warriors are building up there HP instead of there AC. and this is something that Thogg has been doing for a long time now. there is to much &quot; I heard from a friend who has a sister that was in a cyber cafe and they heard that Thogg said...&quot; going on. now dont take this the wrong way I'm not saying that we are the best of friends or that im going to make a guild called &quot; The Deciples of Thogg&quot; or anything. I have just seen this with Clan Bloodclaws AL Clubber Emrok Lurk Radigan and like a dozen other people. they get such a bad rep that if they come up to you and say &quot;HI&quot; they are intantly reported for being pedohiles and trying to offer you drugs to get high (HI) some might get that some might be wondering what the hell im talking about. Im just tired of hearing these rediculous complaints about other people. would you believe that I was in Selibis one day and we where doing the Guardian and a Gm/Guide showed up and someone in the group said that the Gm/Guide was probaly here to watch us so that he could kick us out if we did anything fishy cause Thogg and the GM where very good friends and that Thogg wanted to camp the Guardian. 1 peson actualy was afriad that the Gm would frame him for something and band his account. unless Thogg has acctualy screwed you over, not some friend you met a week ago, or what someone in your group said abot Thogg. please refrian from these senceless posts. when I first came here to Drinal and people where flaming Thogg, i have to admit it was funny at first. and yes the Thogg translator was hilarious but after like 2 months of the same thing over and over and over its starts to get on peoples nerves. this post is not only about Thogg its about anyone that gets constantly Flamed over and over about the same stuff day in and day out. if you going to flame thogg then get some new material at least please. oh well got to get back to work take care everyone. <br>

One reason people hate him is because he screams nerf on all that he views too powerful.  Once you realize that the Dev team isn't going to change every item strictly based on Thogg's opinion, hopefully your eyes will open.  It's not like he complains only on items outside the warrior's supply of equipment.  Does anyone remember his post on the Willsapper when it first came out?  That item would have made warrior soloing a bit more feasible, but Thogg brought it up and said it was unfair to Shamans and Enchanters.  True, he didn't have the item at the time, but getting it is always a possibility, hehe.<br>
<br>
I think the key to Thogg's posts would be reading between the lines.  In almost every statement he's made, there has been something beneficial for warriors.  Say for example his complaint on raising the defense/offense skills of hybrids and others.  I doubt Verant's going to change their mind on this topic, but perhaps it will add fuel to the fire of giving Warrior's a better taunt factor or some other defense oriented skill/discipline and keep the Warrior class as master of taking damage.<br>

What he has become is a scapegoat for everything as someone else has already said.  Also, I hope you realize that those of you who want him to shut up so badly are the same ones that add fuel to his fire by just not ignoring him.  It's insulting that people can get so worked up over a game and then allow themselves to be baited into a shouting match over a computer.<br>

making good points? he merely makes enough of them, that sooner or later one has to be good or valid. The odds are in his favor there.<br>
<br>
He is a self serving imbecile. He cares nothing about him and his. Do not be fooled, if he defers it is not because he respects that warrior, or is sharing. He is merely stacking up his chances so when the item he really wants drops, he gets.<br>
<br>
Like the loot off dain frostreaver.<br>

You think he defers cobalt legs etc because he is a changed man? He is merely waiting for thee dain or such to die, and he lays his claim.<br>

I defended thogg for a solid year. forget it.<br>

He is a self serving hypocritical incompetent insolent braggart.<br>
<br>
Uses people to further his own plans and desires.<br>
<br>
He is not the focal point for anger because he types poorly, or chooses to mispell words.<br>

You would be surprised at the hoard he has of loot and armor. Do not be fooled, everything is about thogg.<br>

Who here remembers him leading nagafen just to get him a cof? then never to go again? Or, lets do sky ! He was driven for that spiroc lord, he knows a trick to multi spawn! All his talka bout doin weekly sky raids? He dont need wingblade anymore, what he do now?<br>

Thogg is all about thogg. <br>
<br>
Going to church does not make a person religious, nor does going to school make a person educated, any more then going to a garage makes a person a car.<br>

Thogg did not acquire what he has beecause of his superior knowledge and abilities. he acquired what he has beecause of other peoples efforts, and ability to come thru and win despite thogg and his half brained ideas.<br>

to the original poster: do not be fooled by thogg's friendliness, it comes only at a price. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukiemo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiemo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#993300>(2/9/01 11:45:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> agree</span><hr size=1> Hey wow my last post got completely cut off.<br>
<br>
Damn I had alot of good points in there too. Ah well, it was way too much to type again.<br>
<br>
But what Shaere said is the truth.<br>
<br>
What THogg does in game is for THogg. What THogg says on the boards is for THogg.<br>
<br>
THogg is about THogg - he always has been. <br>
<br>
But it is funny to see people who really have no experience with him at all other then<br>
he let them loot some pos item that THogg already had 3 of, talk about how nice and <br>
friendly he is. <br>
<br>
Someday they will see the truth. <br>

<br>
<br>
Jeez<br>
<br>
Hmm<br>
<br>
Ummm<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah its your utter inability to admit you are a complete loser. Not to mention your<br>
inability to admit when you might have made a mistake or said something a bit<br>
untrue to try to get a point across.<br>
<br>
Yes I think it all comes down to when you stated &quot;I never lie&quot;, which was immediately<br>
followed by about 5 examples of you not being totally honest. <br>
<br>
Hell your own log you posted on Sony boards was proof enough that you lie, since told<br>
an outright lie to a friend you were conversing with (and it showed your stupidity also<br>
since you didnt edit that line out of the log).<br>
<br>
Or maybe if you could just once say &quot;Yes I am loser, I spend the majority of my time <br>
playing EQ, its all I care about, its all I want to do, my life completely revolves around <br>
EQ and as much as I whine and complain and bitch and moan about all the problems <br>
that I feel exist in game, I dont care, I will continue to pay Verant whatever amount <br>
of money they demand of me as long as they demand it, simply becuase without EQ<br>
I am forced to look at my life and myself and truly see what a pathetic piece of shit<br>
I really am.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Do that THogg and maybe you might gain some respect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzeniabigbootea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zenia Bigbootea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#993300>(2/9/01 12:54:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay</span><hr size=1> start quote-<br>

comment: hrmm and why are you posting this on the forum again? hrmm little insecurity about your own life eh? you seem quick to be everyones critic, maybe you should take a look in the mirror jack<br>

Bored at work. Finished the things I was working on and since I am on vacation <br>
all of next week I dont want to start anything new, so I gotta fill up 7.5 hours of work<br>
time today. <br>
<br>
My life is just fine, I am very secure about it. Thanks for asking though.<br>
<br>
And I am not everyones critic, I just like to correct and flame people when they speak <br>
lies and try to pass it off as the truth. When and if you catch me in a lie, you can do <br>
the same. However that wont be easy for you I gurantee becuase I do little wrong and <br>
when I do I fully admit and take responsibility for my actions. <br>
<br>
The name is kiemo also, not Jack. However I do have a nephew named Jack and <br>
my grandfathers name was Jack, plus I played You Dont Know Jack once, so I guess<br>
I will overlook that.<br>
<br>
Not to mention only THogg sues for stuff on ezboard.<br>
