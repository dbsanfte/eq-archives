You would also realize the only people who could get away (relatively easy) with waking the sleeper was CiH.  It didn't really change the server's attitude towards the guild...an attitude born from the simple fact that we're top dog.  Anybody else would have gotten slammed 100 times worse than us.  For CiH, it was just another of 100s of damned if you do, damned if you don't scenarios that we've put up with on this p.o.s. server.<br>

Nodda-  Actually I liked CIH before this incident. I thought there actions were for the most part good, and I had respect for them. This incident was just a selfish act that does NOT make them look good.<br>

You know what ignorance is?? you know assuming you know everything when you don't.<br>
<br>
mm so what would you be an ignorant moron, ignorant jackass.. whatever your the only ignorant person around for calling someone a bitch which shows you can't come up with anything good to say, and assuming I didn't like CIH and in fact many people Do like them and still do. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A> at: 2/27/02 9:29:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urallousdreadsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rallous Dreadsoul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ele.uri.edu/~richg/rall.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/27/02 9:42:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ele.uri.edu/~richg/rallousface1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Kerafyrm- the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> I wanna see Nodda actually go off on someone, I bet he's like Adobo underneath his usually calm exterior.<br>

<br>
If you don't like being called an ignorant bitch, then maybe you should think twice before insulting someone that you've never met or even knew existed.  This isn't the ramblings of someone who assumes to know everything.  This is someone who has enough common sense to judge individuals based on who they are and what they do, not based on their guildtag.  I don't claim to know much, but I do know that people who jump around calling others selfish for no other reason than the guildtag they wear fit very well into the category of ignorant bitch.  While not everyone is a saint in CiH, you would be surprised to find out how much a cat is willing to bend over backwards for the benefit of others.  From what I've witnessed in the past, I don't think we're very selfish at all.  I'd give examples as concerns Sleeper's Tomb, but you obviously wouldn't read it...seeing you didn't believe my first post in this thread or read anything in it other than the word &quot;bitch&quot;.  If you cared enough, I'd offer you to /t me ingame and I'd tell you the story behind CiH &amp; Sleeper's, but it's obvious you don't give a shit about what we really did or our reasoning behind waking him.<br>
<br>
If you want to insult someone, I suggest you know exactly who and wtf you are talking about before you start spouting off insults.  I don't presume to judge you based on your guildtag (I didn't even notice what guild you're in), only what you yourself have done by posting here.  I have enough respect for people to do this, I would like that same courtesy returned.<br>
<br>
Until then, based on your posts, I think you're an ignorant bitch.<br>
<br>
Ok now I'm done.  I've made my point.  This applies to anyone else who presumes to insult members of CiH or any other guild without knowing who they insult or judging people without ever meeting them.<br>

Quote: This is someone who has enough common sense to judge individuals based on who they are and what they do, not based on their guildtag. -Nodda<br>
<br>
Lets see I judged CIH by what they did. So your IGNORANT assumption is wrong. I did exactly that. I never said CIH has never done anything nice for anyone. In fact I held respect for them because of many kind things they have done. This particular act that is the Topic ( waking the sleeper since you can't read) is what was discussed.I felt that waking the sleeper was selfish and you or no one else has shown any another reason than acts of selfishness. If you look up the definition it is very fitting. They did it because 1. they can 2. to push their guild to go to the moon.. didn't matter that the entire server was forever changed because of it so therefore it was selfish. They only cared about themselves and no one else. That opinion has nothing to do with Ignorance or being a bitch. <br>
<br>
All either of your posts showed was how immature and ignorant you are.  So once again Selfish had nothing to do with the "guildtag". It was the act itself and any another guild who would have done it would have been called the same thing, so get your information straight or stfu already.<br>

Yes its my ten dollars, but when its something that could possibly sacrifice everyone else on the server, I am considerate of that. Personally it does not even directly effect me. I don't need primal weapons, I don't want any loot that no longer drops, I don't even care if I ever see ST. What bothers me are the people who did. The people and other guilds that have been working hard to go there also. I have respect for them, and considering absolutely nothing comes out of waking the sleeper except actually getting to say " I woke the sleeper", then it wasn't worth it. <br>
<br>
I learned that playing this game means other people matter. You can't run around thinking your a God and everyone else is beneath you because I wouldn't treat rl people like that so why should I treat rl people behind a computer like that? To me it was an act that was done out of selfishness and I do not think its wrong at all to think that. It doesn't mean that everything CIH has ever done reflects that at all, just this one incident.<br>

Is it when you completely ignore logical posts? Or maybe it's when you throw around the word selfish without knowing the full meaning of the word, the implications of what that says, or any support for it? Or could it be a loot whore bitching at people and calling them selfish? Or maybe it's attacking a guild by calling them selfish because according to you they only care about loot, when the only reason people are pissed is because of the loot they did or didn't get. I dunno, am I close?<br>

EDIT: Another thing, don't tell cats what the sheer act of waking the sleeper is in terms of inmportance to them. Maybe that act of doing it in and of itself is't worth it to you, but some people actually enjoy a story and epic events. Hmm, maybe another example of ignorance? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usaddil242.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saddil242</A> at: 2/27/02 5:41:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/27/02 6:50:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hhe</span><hr size=1> I'm not going to bother reading a post when he calls me an ignornat bitch.. its not worth my time then.

<br>
there ya go thats the definition from an online dictionary.<br>
point proven I know the definition and its a perfect fit. So don't assume I don't know the definition its not that complicated.<br>
<br>
p.s. I never said it wasn't important to them.. I said did it out of selfishness re look at the definition pls thx. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usaddil242.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saddil242</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/27/02 7:39:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hhe</span><hr size=1> Well, ignoring the fact that that is a poor definishion of selfish, with a connotation already attatched to it, I can still use it. According to that definishion, you are selfish for not giving all of your money to other people, especially people who have none. But since you are chiefly concerned with yourself and disregarding others, in this instance, you are by definition selfish. I'm sorry, but selfishness is not a bad thing. There is a bad connotation to it, and you are simply using the word's connotation in conjunction with the fact that by definition this was a selfish act (when in reality all acts are selfish) to make an argument. Kinda like I just called you selfish for having money. You are not wrong for not giving all your money away, but since I used the word selfish to make my point, it certainly has that effect, but we can all see, that's ludicrous. Hence, I said you apparently don't know the full definition or implications of the word, as I said before.<br>
<br>
And you said that killing the sleeper wasn't worth it, even if it was only for the sake of waking him. You made a value judgement and said it was cats', presuming that you know what it's worth to them, or how important it is to them. Just more examples of that ignorance that Nodda likes to point out.<br>
<br>
re learn to think and interpret pls thx ^_^<br>

I was right in using the word I used. Lets not get into the ways to use the word since I used the word the right way too. Your not an English teacher stop pretending to act like one and just admit I used the word correctly lol. Whether its good or bad who cares, it was my point of view. Your the one misinterpreting. <br>
<br>
- It doesn't matter what it "meant" to them. I was stating the actual outcome plane and simple. I already said what you get out of it. Getting to say you woke the sleeper.. thats an obvious fact and however you feel about waking him and whatever kick it does for you still leads back to "you woke him".<br>
<br>
- for the record I do try to help people less fortunate than me. I do donate to house less people and do what I can. I'm not rich though lol. I don't screw others over for my own needs, so no I wouldn't be considered selfish.<br>

She is not a loot whore or a guild jumper I would vouch for her any day of the week. I can see points on both sides of the arguement here. But in the end it is just a game. So who's wrong who's right? It all depends on how you look at it, but in the end were all playing to have fun, or at least I hope we are. It seems the longer people play this addiction of a game the more they lose sight of the whole purpose to begin with which is to enjoy it and have a good time get some shits and giggles.<br>
<br>
Anyways I know this is the flame board, but I just wanted to play the intermediator on this one. I hope you guys can all settle your differences and focus on enjoying the game. Taking a 3 month break from the game you come back with sort of a refreshed view on things. Go out and have some fun enjoy life, it's too short to be arguing about such minute things on a message board. Ok said my peace, oh ya and leave arrora alone or I will haev to get medievil on yo' ass biotch lol. /Group Hug /sneaks a kiss form arrora =)<br>
