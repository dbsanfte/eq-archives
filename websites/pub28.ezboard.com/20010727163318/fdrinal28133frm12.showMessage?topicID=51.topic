<br>
Two months after coming to Drinal from Tunare, time spent working all kinds of people to get into a guild and getting nowhere, I have come to a simple conclusion: being a paladin means being dissed.<br>
Paladin discrimination is blatant and rampant. As I told a few CS members while grouped in Karnor's the other night, I am pretty close to enlisting Al Sharpton on my behalf and protesting outside Maar's house in Norway or wherever he is from. Seriously folks, it stinks. I have grouped with numerous people in all the major guilds, and they all tell me they enjoy grouping with me, that I would be a fine addition to their guild, and that they will put in the word for me. Then the minute I talk to their guild recruiters, and I mention my class, I get my dwarven butt shoved out the door before I finish uttering the letter &quot;P.''<br>
I am seriously contemplating quitting the game, because without a guild at lvl 54, you basically can't do squat... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umadendarkcaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maden Darkcaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(12/20/00 9:49:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Painful Paladin Diatribe</span><hr size=1> Dubla I once felt the same way you did about my choice for a main char.  Main issue you need to focus on is why are you playing EQ. Most high level dungeons and raid setups have become pretty standard as far as what classes are deemed the best choice based upon what works best. For example if a group needing to fill a tank slot had the choice of grabbing a warrior - shadow knight - paladin - ranger, they would most likely pick in that order.  The only exception would be if the person could not play his character well/was a jerk for the negative or was a guildee/friend for the positive.  That is just the way that the game evolved/was designed/works best.  Could a paladin outank a warrior...maybe but not likely.  <br>
 If you play EQ to build the uber tank and get phat l33t then you probably have picked the wrong char to do it with.  By the same token you may be limiting your fun worrying about that sort of stuff.  My main char is a necro.  You know the class that gets invited to raids AFTER something has gone bad and CR is needed ie. summoning corpses and feeding mana to clerics rezzing.  I didnt realize this until 50+ doing areas like Seb and dragon raids.  We are the jack of all trades but master of none, finding a group is not as easy but it can be done.  Our pets are ok compared to others and we have good dot's but our DD is not as good and our dots are somewhat limited in usefulness (mob drops too quickly).  We can feed mana to clerics and chanters in emergencies and when necesary &quot;Ghetto Mez&quot; (screaming terror).  Are there other casters that are more useful - absolutely - depending on the situation.  We could contrast a paladin vs warrior in the same light.<br>
 I have moved past all this &quot;math/eq dynamics&quot;.  I know play whatever one of my chars I feel like playing.  If your not having fun then maybe you are looking at the game in the wrong way.  Try to find a guild where you can have playing with other people.  I would avoid some of the larger ones as they all seem to have grown too big too fast and are all experiencing &quot;growing pains&quot;.  If you want to remain unguilded then try to go on large scale raids with Shaere or Synide - they both do a very effective job and usually take all comers within their needs.  If you must be a power gamer/phat l33t guy then make a new char - your best bet would be a chanter or cleric - there are never enough of them around and they are crucial in groups 50+<br>

It's that I can't get into a guild on this friggin server, and I am tired of hearing ``we're not taking any more paladins.'' I can't find a group half the time, and it is getting pretty annoying. I have to say, though, that a lot of the better guilds have told me, ``you need to be 55 and have resistances in the 100s in 3 categories,'' stuff like that. That entices me to try to power-level through to 54 get to that point and farm a bunch of resist gear. But that's not what this game should be about... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#993300>(12/21/00 2:43:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Painful Paladin Diatribe</span><hr size=1> Dubla, as you mentioned the name of my guild/guildleader and also what you have been told on our boards as requirements, i think I have to say something about it.<br>
If you checked our roster, you would have seen that there are right now 107 players listed. And there are still people in our guild that are not on the roster. As we redid the roster when we moved over to Drinal, we can say that 90% of the persons are active members. Some more, some less. When we all bought this game we did not spend a single thought on resist gear or whatever, but now that the game changed a little bit, resist gear is one of the key factors to be successful on raids. The second key is your level. Clan Skallagrim was renewed after the move and there is no person in CS below 46. Clan Skallagrim is the only guild that has a lot of players from both servers that were in the split. We got a lot of high quality additions. So why should we add someone to our rows that at his/her current state is no improvement for the guild? That may sound harsh right now but isn't meant this way. If you really want to join CS, then the things we mentioned to have shouldn't be a problem for you. Believe me when I say that there is nothing more frustrating than a failed raid although you know that you have the right numbers to make it a success but it failed cause people did not resist shit of the Ubermob_00. It is not just pallies who are rejected right now but almost every class.<br>

<br>
Seriously though, Dubla, its not because you are a paladin at all, its about the numbers a guild can manage to control without collapsing, that will not happen, we have alot of new faces in the guild, and my bet is that some will get kicked out(so far it looks really good though), while other leave, while the main core will stay. What my main concern right now is, is to get the new faces to &quot;mingle&quot; with the old skaller, if you see my point.<br>
the amount of people that ask to join this guild everytime i log on is enormous, we have to be picky. My best guess is that even if anyone at 55 + comes to ask for membership right now, they will be turned down, but as i said, some people come and some go, so there is a ballance.<br>

<br>
I'll add one more personal point: Complaining on the boards about your inability to get in a guild will not help your cause, quite the contrary. I for one now view you as potentially &quot;high maintenance&quot;, and in a large guild, that is a serious detriment. I would recommend either 1) quietly work to meet the entry requirements of one of the established guilds while building relationships with members in good standing or 2) form your own guild and set up the rules however you choose.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you, and happy holidays!<br>

Everyone I ever grouped with in the guild was very nice, and very capable. So to those in the guild, please do not take my rant as an attack on you, it was not meant that way. Maar, my reference to Al Sharpton was clearly self-deprecating, and in jest. I know you are not American, so I will explain: he is a well-known rabble-rouser who appears anywhere racism or civil rights violations are alleged, regardless of their merit. To those I have grouped with and consider friends, I hope to see you in the next great mmorpg.
