I go from 15 to 16 to 17.<br>
<br>
You have financial problems at home, yet drive around a nice little car, now, that's just stupid. I mena, it's like &quot;Hmm, rent is about to go under, better go drive for a while in my nice car *car gleams*&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with being gay. Obviously it's you that has the problem for saying that shit. So, what happened Megolian, have a bad gay experience or something? Or are you just a homophobe because *gasp* HETEROSEXUALITY IS NOT &quot;NORMAL&quot; IT IS JUST MORE COMMON.<br>
<br>
You know, Lotozek, and actually some of the other people on these boards, and everyone in the world needs to open their fucking eye to what is going on in the world. Do you know that several things are happening for the gay community? Technically, soon, hittinga gay person is technically going to be like hitting a woman (shut the fuck up, I know that sounds like a putdown to myself, but it isn't.) Y'all should keep up on the world, and grow a fucking brain.<br>
<br>
And actually, Lotozek, I knew you when I played Tobyn/Tyyke and Baraccus/Briyan because I tried to ruin your guild on purpose, because I knew you were a scammer from the start. I remember you tried to sell a guildie a polar bear cloak for 300pp and you were &quot;cutting them a deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then I &quot;bought my epic&quot; I knew that I was going to be quitting the game to get away from something that was adding even more stress in my life. I just wanted to see how upholding of a scammer you still were. yeah, 25k I handed to you. (Bynox if your reading this, sorry, talk to me on AIm about this) And then I found out that you don't even HAVE YOUR epic. I knew this from the start. I knew that you'd tried to scam other people into the &quot;oops, I messed up on the turnin! I just got my epic&quot; trick.<br>
<br>
What happened when I asked you for the cash back as a decent human being? You tell me I'ma  sack of shit for not going through on the deal, etc. And you give me 9k and items worth about 5k also. Ooooh.<br>
<br>
This, my friends, is how Lotozek makes his money. And I've also SOLD him money before on playerauctions. So there is NO fucking way he has &quot;problems at home&quot; or his dad had a stroke or whatnot. Lotozek is one of the biggets sacks of shit I've ever met. He Lies, he SCAMS, he CHEATS, HE BUYS PLAT, HE HAS HACKED (he used to talk about it in guild (I dont even remember which guild it was, long times past... I broke them up anyways.) He has bought items also...<br>
<br>
Believe me Lotozek, I talk to a  lot of people that sell things. So. Ha.<br>
<br>
Now, let's see here. I knew that I was doing something wrong when I was selling platinum, But I made a nice $2000 off of it. What hapened? I got like 10 warnings. Only got suspended once, and that was because I told Valindor to suck my cock because I hated him. I was always in contact with VI, and never got banned. Why? Because I was nice to all of the CS.<br>
<br>
However, calling a GM a shithead because of a bug, is not a cool thing, Lotozek.<br>
<br>
And you make fun of me because I'm gay? How fucking petty and stupid can you get? You are a liar, scammer, cheater, slammer, bitch, etc. YOU can't even stay in a guild anymore because of the fact that YOU HAVE TRIED TO SUCK SO MANY GUILD BANKS DRY AND THEN YOU JUST REMOVE YOURSELF. <br>
<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
And yes, this is a side portion of my post. I knew that I was breaking up guilds, and I would do it intentionally, for kicks. I got tired of EQ back in about June of '01, after playing Tobyn/Tyyke and Beginning Baraccus. EVEN THOUGH I had many other chars all 40+. I had nothing to do with the Inferni Millites breakups though, that was all other people and I just said my 2 cents and people left because it started a discussion. I broke up a lot of guilds, and then I cooled down, quit for about 3 months, came back, and was like &quot;Wow, White Wind, I remember playing wth a lot of them&quot; So I joined. With PURE intentions, mind all of you. I kept good, and then I decided to quit. So I sold all my stuff. What are the GM's gonna do now? Ban my account that is cancelled? Ha.<br>
________________________________________<br>
<br>
Back to Lotozek. You said that you wanna quit the game or whatever. I don't believe you should quit the game, I believe you should put a motherfucking gun in your mouth and end THIS game. Bitch.<br>

<br>
<br>
I don't &quot;like&quot; hearing about other peoples sex lives....that doesn't just go for homosexuals...it goes for everyone.<br>
<br>
I don't want to picture &quot;anything&quot;!<br>
<br>
<br>
You being homosexuals fine....i don't give a rats ass. You are most likely hundreds, even thousands of miles away from me....so go fuck what ever guy you want...I'm not holding you back.<br>
<br>
But quit trying to milk the fucking &quot;i'm gay...look at me&quot; bull shit that your throwing across this board.<br>
<br>
I DON'T CARE....the whole fucking /shiverpuke thing was to get a few laughs.<br>
<br>
The whole thing about you and your lover had a shock value on these flame boards.....well guess what? it's over.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sure there's plenty of gay/lezbo porn networks out there that would love to find out which position you and rickie martin play &quot;hide the booty in the swashbuckler&quot;...but not here.<br>
<br>
So shut the fuck up already.....God....your like Fibwin....only GAY!<br>

<br>
none of my crew cared if he was weird or anything he was actually a really nice guy ... but you on the otherhand are one of these flamboyant gay people that from the way you post on the boards, that the whole world should bow down to you because your gay....<br>
<br>
you probably go around and randomly flirt with any guy you dont know on the street and end up getting your ass beat.<br>
<br>
i am not homophobic but jesus christ does anyone on here give a flying fuck if your gay? probably not.... so why did you even mention it? just to get attention and try to get people to side with you and make you feel better about sucking a cock?<br>
<br>
and yeah its a two sided coin bro ... it goes the same with the guys who come on here bragging about how often they get laid... chances are they are virgins trying to build thier ego... or they got a women so drunk she didnt know she was fuckin a loser....<br>

   As a bit of advice I think you need to understand that although you having to deal with your sexuality is probably a big part of your life and you have had to adjust, the majority of the rest of the world doesnt' really care about it.  I had a friend through most of graduate school, who was also a room mate for a while. There were many clues that led me to believe he might be gay, but he was a great guy and was fun to hang out with.  I was dating my wife through most of grad school so I think there was no discomfort between us. Anyway, here is my point. After knowing each other about 5 years all the sudden outta the blue he tells me he's gay, I looked at him and said &quot;Good for you, I am a recovering drug addict. Aint' life a bitch what it saddles you with.&quot;  <br>
<br>
     The probability of anyone meeting on these message boards or in eq and then developing a relationship with you that is sexual is EXTREMELY small. As such I don't think anyone here cares about it.  Take this issue to a shrink until you can live life without feeling this is your driving force. Just a bit of advice.<br>

<br>
&quot;HETEROSEXUALITY IS NOT &quot;NORMAL&quot; IT IS JUST MORE COMMON.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wrong.  Saying heterosexuality is not normal has got to be the most absurd and uninformed statement you could have made.  How the fuck do you think you came into being?  Somewhere in your past, someone in your family line had NORMAL, heterosexual relations and had your great grandpa or grandma...<br>
<br>
Also, by saying heterosexuality is abnormal, you imply that homosexuality is normal.<br>
<br>
<br>
What is the end result of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> natural</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> heterosexuality?<br>
<br>
Procreation, propigation of the species.  It has a purpose beyond pleasure.  Does everyone who has sex procreate?  No.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is the end result of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> unnatural</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> homosexuality?<br>
<br>
Pleasure - pure and simple.  A homosexual relationship is nothing but an unhealthy perversion of a normal, heterosexual relations.
