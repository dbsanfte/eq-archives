You mean when I was asking you what do you want to do to work this out amicably and instead of replying to 3 tells you pulled tormax? which btw we did not interfere with and zoned out asap. When we came back in you were dead (so I guess you really werent raid ready yet were you), then we pulled and died (I guess we werent ready yet either =p), then you pulled and died again?(so you still werent ready an hour after this whole fiasco began which again I offered to solve in the beginning) then when we were trying to pull a 2nd time you kept interfering with our pullers and sent them a tell saying (this isnt a direct quote but close maybe Moayen can provide the logs) &quot;no way your killin tormax I can keep this up all night&quot;, while all this was going on several of your guildmates were insulting and threatening us in ooc and shout and tells while there wasnt a peep from any CTer in a public channel except for me offering to roll on it and solve it? Then a GM showed up and you insisted on not rolling so he DTed tormax.<br>
<br>
If your refering to this &quot;incident&quot; which im pretty sure you are, no we didnt guild remove anyone, but I would have guild removed you (for your threat to another person once I saw the logs) and warned any member that made any of the comments your guildys made. <br>

but just like I said you try to derail the topic with noise and counter accusations kinda like Ubars sig. <br>

What is it about that crazy giant that brings out the worst in people.  I have my own little Tormax story that happened a little while ago.<br>
<br>
Long story short, we pulled Tormax while a rival guild was amassing their troops.  They didn't like this because they had<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> guild member in the zone first.  They didn't have the force to pull yet, but got our shit together faster and we did have the force.  So they send 3 monks to fd in our camp.  We figure they're just setting up to pull if we wipe.  It's a pretty standard tactic and we ourselves have done this.  Anyway, Tormax is pulled in and our MA gets on him.  Everything's going fine and then the fd monks pop up and start trying to trade food with our clerics.  This totally fucks up the healing rotation.  Yeah, I know they should have had &quot;accept trades&quot; turned off, but we really weren't expecting it.  So even though we tried valiantly we can't survive minus 3 clerics and we wipe.  The only survivors are 2 of our necros who feigned.  The rival guild pulls Tormax while a bunch of us /petition.  The GM shows up while the other guild is fighting Tormax and drops the whole fucking zone.  When it comes back up, no GM and no Tormax.  I started laughing when they told me the GM dumped the zone.  I really fell out when I heard there was no Tormax when it came back up.  All this for crap for some loot?  Why do people get so worked up over this shit? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufflewddurfflam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fflewddur Fflam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 3:34:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1149.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fuctards that are going on about CiH</span><hr size=1> Windailya,<br>

<br>
First let me say I think that I have a pretty damn good reputation in game, and anyone that knows me knows that I call things how I see them if I am involved and know the facts, regardless of who my friends are or who I am guilded with. On the evening with that Tormax deal, I logged on a mule and checked and Tormax was up. I checked doing a / and only a lower level raid on the arena was in the zone at the time. After just a moment a CT monk happened to log in right next to my mule (Akuktoo being the mule) and I assume that he put out the call to arms as I had. Long story short, people started showing up from both CT/WL and CiH. The first group with a raid capable force (capable of Tormax at least) was CiH. We had 29 people in zone and buffing (including a full staff of healers) while there were only 19 people from CT/WL in zone at the time (and this included only two clerics) and possibly Fierire (although from when I was in tells with him since he is a friend and past guildmate, I was not sure if he was there to assist you or not). This is the point where the competition should have stopped. We had the numbers in zone first with the correct classes to accomplish the task. We beat CT/WL to that mark. I had fully expected the alliance to back off of the tormax issue at that point just as Cats had backed off of Yelinak a month or so prior (when we all arrived in at roughly the same time, but you guys had a CoH person already up top, so obviously had us beat because of that). Sure there were some folks that wanted to get a GM involved, but I at least surely did not counsel that as a wise move. I recommended we back off because we had been beaten to the mob with the proper force to kill him. And we did back off. Anyhow, I had expected the same sort of courtesy when we had beaten WL/CT to tormax, but I was surprised to find that it did not happen that way.<br>
<br>
As for what went on in tells or whatever, I cannot comment on that because I was not a part of those. I do know that our first pull did go wrong and I believe it was because we were rushing the issue because even with only 19 people in zone from CT/WL, Maoyen shouted out a warning that Tormax would be pulled soon. From there everything wwent downhill until finally the GM despawned Tormax. IMO, it should never have gone that far in the first place. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, this is what I observed there as I was there for the duration. I don't make a comment positive or negative on something like this unless I know the facts, so please dont assume that I am making a statement about anything else with this post. Thank you. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229714 target="web">Aktunka Wormflinger</a><BR>

<br>
You perceived yourself to be there first, with suffecient force (What even determins this? Sure you know after the fact but its pretty hard to know before)<br>
<br>
And We perceived us being there at the same time, and didnt gain &quot;Suffecient force&quot; till the same time we did. Simply put it was a race.<br>
<br>
<br>
We Were finishing up rhag 2 when Tormax popped, we sent everyone who was not there to Kael, Due to some of your guildmates talking near zone out in Ssra we knew you knew too, however on a scan of /who cats all it showed 19 people.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly due to a strain of people due to many heading to kael, and a mistake in setting up rampage list we were not sucessful, but got a cleric out. and Quickly ressed and TL'd to Wakening Lands<br>
<br>
When I zoned Many other CT/WL were appearing as were CiH, we all quickly ran to Kael, and when i zoned in, we had about 24 people, and CiH had about 24.<br>
<br>
At this point we contacted you proposing a roll for the spawn, because we were both getting there in equal force, we do not enjoy races, and didnt want the shit that happened, to happen.<br>
<br>
Another Scan of /who cats all showed that many other had logged on, or become un anon.<br>
<br>
The Numbers steadily grew on both sides, Our monk and your guys puller (you didnt have a monk) raced to tormax's throne, You guys aggroed first, took him to zone and we all zoned out, because we respect first aggro, scanning who cats all soon many appeared in Bazaar or nexus and we zoned in to many dead CiH, evidently due to adds, (which we were not part of, as we zoned, most likely due to the fact that between being rushed to pull the spawn, and having no monk, having a Druid pull.<br>
<br>
We zoned in and foolishly pulled to early and zoned out to add's.<br>
<br>
You guys pulled again, and died again,<br>
<br>
We started to pull again, a GM appeared, asked us to roll for the spawn, and Trevize refused, and GM DT'd him (Tormax)<br>
<br>
During the whole incident there were insults and heckling coming from CiH, and admitaly some of WL as well.<br>

There is no doubt of your good rep and great sense of humor. <br>
<br>
I dispute your numbers but understand where you may have only thought we had 19 since we had several unguilded people along with us as well. We invite lots of non CTers to our raids often and dont always temp invite recruits especially when its their first raid or two. I can see where this would give you a false impression of how many folks we had present. <br>
<br>
I think you know my rep as well and I can asure you our numbers were dead even throughout the race. I did a zone /who every 10 seconds or so hehe =p. We would have 10  to 8 then you would have 12 to 10 and back and forth. I will try and dig up my logs if I get the time for exact numbers if anyone really cares. To me that conflict was legitimate. We both knew we were racing we both thought we were right We tried to offer an amicable solution. We never interfered with your pulls or attempts. <br>
<br>
I can also assure you that if we ever thought you had us significantly outnumbered we would have walked away as we have also done many times. <br>
<br>
For Trevize to suggest this &quot;incident&quot; was anything like the rage situation is ludicrous. <br>

and this  my first whole post was not about the RF thing, it was about flaming CiH in general. Hell, theres a shit load of incidents that i see other guilds doing, and are flamed on here.. Are they flamed as much? no.. CiH is put under the microscope for everything they do. Why is that? i dont know.<br>
<br>
If u see a thread flaming bushido clan, would u have all these people that hop on the bandwagon flaming them? guarentee you no.<br>

I remember multiple times watching the old WL trying to kill the newly buffed up Kland in WW and we never once walked over their corpses to try and kill him.  We waited patiently until Kvark said they were done and only then did we move in.  I think they tried 3 times or so and we didnft do anything to disrupt them, and we certainly didnft try to pull a mob they had engaged and lost to.  Thatfs the difference.  But as you said perceptions are different on both sides.  Mistakes were made on both sides during Tormax and during the RF incident.  You didnft guild remove anyone for Tormax and we didnft guild remove anyone for RF.  Glass houses and all that jaz.  So while you try to get us to admit to something you believe happened and call on us to take some form of action you didnft take that same action under similar circumstances. (and yes they are similar) Do as I say not do as I do eh?<br>
<br>
Regardless of all of this I have been in discussion with the RF list keepers to work out some form or agreement with them.  Please feel free to continue the CiH bashing.  And while everyone boycotts us, and  some people advocate the training and killing of CiH members I will tell everyone here this.  I at least will continue to be the same nice helpful person I have always been regardless of mine or YOUR guild tag.  Have a nice day.<br>

I really do try very hard to not get into mud slinging and name calling. You said you didnt get it why people were upset Kinad. I tried my best to explain it to you. the logs dont lie. Reeko was there for 6 days your cleric was there for 30 minutes Reeko had 25 freakin people in the zone /ooc multiple times he was there for rage your guildees just rolled over em without a word. Didnt even ask him what the situation was. <br>
<br>
I dont understand why you cant see these facts. I agree with you I wasnt there niether were you. Which is why I can understand defending your mate up to the point the logs were posted. After that what is the argument? Are you still saying it was justified? If one person from cast had sent one tell to reeko or anyone else and said &quot;hey were ready to pull this guy, looks like your here for the same thing whats the deal?&quot; <br>
You would have some justification. Instead you just pulled em and let the chips fall where they may. This is what upsets other folks not on your team. I wont say all or even most guild would do that. But I can tell you we do it, TK does it, UF does it, UC does it, GoTK does it. <br>
<br>
maybe you can explain to us why you dont do it?<br>
<br>
Havent other cats members come here and flamed people for trying to KS Stormfeather after they had been camping him for days? didnt you flame WL for rushing past you for Tormax way back when? Isnt this the same damn thing?<br>
<br>
Hroth im sorry I disagree with you on the Tormax thing but no imo it didnt end when you pulled Tormax. We were buffed and gtg as well but didnt pull because I was trying to talk to Trevize this entire time and he was ignoring me.<br>
<br>
From our side we saw it as you guys trying to bully us and get your way yet again. Now you have to admit you usually do get your way. Im sure from your side as Aktunka already expressed very well you thought you had every right to the mob.I completely respect his and your opinion.  It would have been nice if trevize sent a tell and said hey we have 29 here you have 19 were ready to pull. I would have replied no we have 28 here (or whatever the number was at that specific moment) we could have talked about it and were more than willing to come to a amicable solution. We would have left quietly and wished you luck if we were convinced you did beat us. Instead he stalled at one point told me &quot;just a minute&quot; with the intention of pulling hoping to end the argument through trickery. Hell if you would have killed him Trevize's tactic would have worked but you didnt. Were not gonna walk away because you pull some shinanigans. <br>
<br>
Btw this will happen again between us. We will offer again to work it out. If you dont want to so be it. Youll win some you will loose some. <br>
