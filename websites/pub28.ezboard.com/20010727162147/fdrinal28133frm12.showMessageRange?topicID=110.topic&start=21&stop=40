That is right after Boofy had his little hissy fit over loot policies you both gated out of that raid &quot;together&quot;. That was at least 1.5 hours before the wizard and necro were &quot;still&quot; standing to get coffins.<br>

You over exagerate the facts. We weren't needed, and I was falling asleep at the computer, so I asked boofy to port me out.

I had significantly more life impacting concerns to deal with which required me to go to sleep that night rather than listen to everyone in their disorganized, fighting chaos. <br>
<br>

<br>
There were 2 bards on the raid...myself, and Mojoo. Mojoo was just there for the greaves, which was fine, but that wasn't really the issue.<br>
<br>
Imbrued bracer dropped, I had one, and I thought to myself, hmm, I don't really wanna loot this, so if I win random, i'll diferr it to mojoo....<br>
<br>
I diferred it to mojoo, and he declined.<br>
<br>
So, rather than have it rot, I looted it. Same with the martune rapier *crap*.<br>
<br>
Well, about an hour later, I started thinking. What if somthing really nice drops...like Imbrued bp. Will that automatically go to Mojoo?<br>
<br>
So I ask....someone, probably rezfor about this. He says, yes...it would go to Mojoo. Now it's a little messed up, that I would be forced out of nice loot, because I looted somthing that I never really wanted, and only looted because I didn't want to see it rot. Both items I never use, nor have I ever used.<br>
<br>
Some how, this gets dragged into guild chat....and everyone elses opinion gets dragged through the mud, and before you know it, you have peope yelling at each other. I didn't cuss anyone out, and that wasn't why I left the raid.<br>
<br>
Like you said, you were waiting hours for things to get back underway....and I'm sorry if it's hard to stay awake late at night when your doing nothing but sitting on your ass, and doing nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this shed's some light, on that very......interesting raid. I'm sorry if anyone was overly upset at this, and got the wrong impression such as Tat did. This isn't the way I act on raids, and I have been known to join people on raids where no loot was promised to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for boofys comment about vicousmonk1(sp?) He didn't realize that there was an actualy a person named Vicous monk. He had no negative feelings toward you when he said it, and such it shouldn't be taken that way...It was &quot;you guessed it&quot; a lack of information.<br>

Now I just have one problem with this paragraph.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let the community be warned Boofy and Doofy gated out of a hate raid - hang them over the fire!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
I never stirred up any shit with you, boofy and my posts were purely comical, and detracted from the overall flame between you and dogguk.<br>
<br>
You were the one who stirred up shit with me. So...rather than drag this post on any further, lets just let the post die....What happened was several months ago, and it's not worth bringing up the past...i'm sure we both are more mature, and wiser than we were those many months ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#993300>(3/24/01 9:14:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Must Flame Tatianae</span><hr size=1> I saw no reason for your even posting to this thread, I kept names concealed for a reason and no info would even be on this board except Dogguk decided this needs to be a community wide issue so lets share with the community:) You and boof made the decision to follow up and therefore subject yourself to interpretation, you weren't comical and you didn't amuse me thanks. I spoke to boof in game he said he would fix, he didn't, so I called a spade a spade.<br>
<br>
That night &quot;began&quot; with bmac (dorfcleric) laying down the guilt smackdown on me for not being invited to the raid which I wasn't organizing or leading. For the reason he exclaimed &quot;being CiH&quot; - which quite frankly I had no control over wasn't my raid.and wasn't the reason. Was not a good start of the evening for me and it grew worse as you can see in the novel on the first page.  So I do think the &quot;amusing&quot; part is that you, boof, dorfcleric are the only ones who had strange responses to this thread. All chained in events of that lovely evening but harboring no guilt of your own?<br>
<br>
To top it off after seeing this forum posting dogguk, if I knew you were such an asshole (and the lies in your post didn't help - that raid did go on - and you were never abandoned in any situation where you were unsafe)I would have gated out far sooner:) There is no eq policy that states I need to socialize with turds on my spare time. <br>
<br>
Have a good eq life may only the assholes post 50 be left remaining to beat up on each other and the good ones be smart enough to delete ;)<br>

   If you didn't want or need the bracer, you should have let it rot.  Of course you wouldn't have gone in on bp if it had dropped later.  That's the chance you take when you accept those default wins.  It's been that way for as long as I remember.  Fairest way to do it.<br>

As a matter of fact, NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING dropped that was druid -usable, so my so called attempts of being a l33t druid is bullshit.<br>
<br>
I was fighting for Doofy, because other members of that raid (can't recall names) were looting items that no one else wanted.  Items they either couldn't use, or items that they had better than, for ammusement purposes, like equiping POD with these elaborate items and armor.  Doofy was doing the exact same thing.  Looting the item to use for amusement purposes.  He (still to this day) has no use for a imbrued bracer, or that maratune rapier, but looted them just because, like all those other people were doing.<br>
<br>
Now, my arguement was, if he, because of his actions in looting those items, was not allowed in the random for the next, more useful piece of bard armor/weapon, I believed it was not right for all those other members of that raid to be in the random for their more useful gear drop, because of their previous looting on that raid.<br>
<br>
In english, why is it okay for others to loot useless stuff, but not for Doofy?<br>
<br>
You guys singled out a bard (probably cause you were rootin for Mojoo on imbrued bp or something) for no good reason.  That was my arguement.<br>
<br>
As for the raid and me porting out?  That was both mine and Doofy's decision.  It was 3 in the morning, and it sounded like the raid was breaking up.  My personal reasons are because I can't stand dealing with people rootin on one person while the next gets the shaft.  That was my beef with this raid.  <br>
<br>
I thought we left senority behind us when we left Tunare.  I guess things never change.<br>

That raid, like I said, was very depicting of the composition of EoS as a guild and it's leadership (e.g officer Dogguk). Sorry but he was the brat who decided to bring this issue public  - and you guys chose to follow up not in my support but in absurd statements such as saying visciousmonk was me...so if you are going to lay the blows on me and my character virtually putting enough crappiness in this game for me to delete my char then I'll put my fists up too. <br>
<br>
I don't care any more that you guys argued or gated, but Dogguk decided to single me out because he was out of enchanters to abuse.<br>
<br>
It was 3AM and &quot;no one&quot; wanted to be there in the chaos. There was no &quot;wipe out&quot; there were two peoples bodies to retrieve and you guys couldn't even get &quot;that&quot; right. There was a reason I was the last remaining/departed enchanter in EoS, no one wanted to play with you and your friends when they play like crap Dogguk. Take your damned feedback and get it right next time instead. You are the one who deserves the public scathing for not having the sense enough to compose and deal with it. Howling Stones was simply a repeat adventure of utter stupidity. <br>
<br>
Sorry to any of the *good* players of the guild formally known as EoS who fall in to these blanket statements.<br>
