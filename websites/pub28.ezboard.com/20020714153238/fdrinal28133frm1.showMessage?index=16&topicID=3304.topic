I respect your right to believe whatever you want.  But I can tell you, as a man that believes in God, that I would not want to live in a country where religion is surpressed either.  <br>

Why do we worry about stupid little crap when their are so many more things we could work on that help the entire nation and not blow up a situation that gave the guy 15 minutes of fame.<br>
<br>
The issue was between parent and teacher.  Not the nation vs religion. <p><center>

Christians and followers of God worry about this &quot;stupid little crap&quot; because by the very definition, it further places God lower and less recognized in the eyes of everyone.  One more stomp on His name.  One more broom to sweep Him out of everyone's mind.<br>
<br>
Ok ok.. you're probably thinking I'm one of those gibbering morons Trewayne was referring to.  Maybe.  But it is very sad, and disheartening to see our country and people go farther and farther into turmoil the more that religion gets ignored and pushed aside.<br>
<br>
Religions in and of themselves generally promote some kind of Faith, Lawfullness, and hope and concern for those around you.  By ignoring religion and removing it from everyone's mind more and more, people forget that their neighbors are humans and deserve just as much rights and respect as they themself demand.  Societies and cultures thrive when they act together.  Religion in many ways brings people together, helps them understand they're not alone, and gives them something to believe in so they can work for common goals.<br>
<br>
In terms of EQ.  People play, respect the people instead of walking all over each other in order to better yourself.  Look at a well oiled &quot;uber&quot; guild (read - religion/culture/belief system).  They're that way because they know how to cooperate and work together.  Not because everyone in that guild are stepping all over the other members(read - lack of single belief system) trying to become better.  They succeed as a team, not as individuals.<br>

<br>
I am a follower of God and nothing like this or 100000x the magnatude of this can take away what is in my heart.  I don't need a daily reminder.  Nor do I need my country (which accepts all religions and those that choose to follow no religion) to give me that reminder in any way shape or form (ie, I don't need to have it on my currency or in my nations pledge.)  Just as my countrymen and women don't need to believe in my God or god at all to share my country.  I certainly am not going to get up in arms about propaganda that was placed into our daily culture by men who were worried about the cold war's influence on my society.<br>
<br>
I don't think it needs to be fought about in either direction.  But I will acknowledge this, I have the freedom to practice my religion up till the point it interfers with someone elses right, and vice versa.  That is why I said this issue was between the teacher and parent.  At the very very top the Principle and Parent.  As a father of five I can tell you this probably happened.  The child came hold and told the father they recited the pledge of alliegence.  Being proud of memorizing something the child recited it and the father reacted then over reacted.  If they teacher and principle did not recognize that the child did NOT have to recite that line, they are in the wrong.<br>
<br>
But, going  with the ideals that I stated above, those believing in God do have an unfair advantage by having such beliefs in a nationally recognized pledge of patriotism as well nationals currency is indeed wrong by our constitution.<br>
<br>
And I must agree that religion does indeed bring people together.  But the rest is merely a perceptionas religion has brought people together for peace and most certainly for war.  In fact religion has killed more people than the worlds worste plague and continues to kill more people than todays leading medical ailments.  <br>
<br>
So if you need a daily reminder of what is to be in your heart, maybe you need to do some soul searching and find what your heart is really saying.  If the word and belief of god is in your life and in your heart you have nothing to worry about if they change the pledge *back to its original state* or change the currency to remove reference to god (because last I check god wasn't worried about such things).  <p><center>

<br>
First of all this didnt come from the kid telling his dad about it. Second of all the dad is an athiest activist who has already tried to get &quot;in god we trust&quot; removed from our currency. He started this case because it was an easier one to win. The guy has given several interviews on national television about it.  <br>
<br>
Now for a lil history lesson about the Pledge for you ignorant folks:<br>
<br>
<br>
The Pledge of Allegiance, attributed to socialist editor and clergyman Francis Bellamy (the article leaves this part out. he was a baptist minister who was removed from the pulpit because he was a socialist. He still remained a very relious man. kinda ironic aint it), was first published in 1892 in The Youth's Companion, a children's magazine where he worked. <br>
<br>
The pledge was meant to echo the sentiments and ideals of Bellamy's cousin, Edward Bellamy, an author of ``Looking Backward'' and other socialist utopian novels, according to pledge expert John Baer. <br>
<br>
Bellamy crafted it as a resonating oration to bolster the idea that the middle class could fashion a planned political and social economy, equitable for all, Baer said. <br>
<br>
After a proclamation by President Benjamin Harrison, the pledge was first used in public schools on Oct. 12, 1892 during Columbus Day observances. <br>
<br>
The original wording was: ``I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for which it stands: one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' <br>
<br>
There were those who claimed The Youth's Companion editor James B. Upham penned the famous pledge, but the U.S. Flag Association ruled in 1939 to recognize Bellamy was the author. <br>
<br>
The pledge has been changed a few times since. For Flag Day in 1924, ``the flag of the United States of America'' was officially adopted as a substitution for the phrase ``my flag.'' <br>
<br>
In 1954, the words ``under God'' were added, after a campaign by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic men's service organization, and other religious leaders who sermonized that the pledge needed to be distinguished from similar orations used by ``godless communists.(this sure sounds like the promotion of Christian ideals to me!)'' <br>
<br>
The prospect of atomic war between world superpowers so moved President Dwight D. Eisenhower that he directed Congress to add the two small but controversial words. <br>
<br>
``From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and every rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty,'' Eisenhower wrote at the time. <br>
<br>
In 1988, the elder George Bush made the pledge a presidential campaign issue after Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis vetoed a bill requiring teachers to recite the pledge. Some Republicans sought to require a recital in Congress, but House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, soon casually and voluntarily started a morning recital. <br>
<br>
The Senate began reciting the Pledge on June 24, 1999, after passing a resolution at the urging of Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. <br>
<br>
There is some protocol when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Uniformed military personnel face the flag and give the military salute. Civilians stand at attention or place the right hand over the heart. Men traditionally remove their hats. <br>
<br>
Now that you know at least a lil bit about the issue make up your minds. <br>

<br>
Thanks for doing the research (way too lazy and kinda busy today).  But I'm afraid that no one will change their stance on this at all.  Fools will be fools and an educated fool is just that.<br>
<br>
As to those preaching of their religious morals and how much tighter relgion draws the world community in... What planet do you live on?  Certainly it's not here on earth where wars have been started over such small things as protestant or catholic.<br>
<br>
For those who don't understand my view on this it's really quite simple.  I believe in the Pledge.  I think it belongs in school, but should never be forced on anyone.  I don't give a shit wether those two words are left in or taken out, for to me it's not about God, but about country.  However, that said, those two words certainly are an assertion of the judeo-christian faiths and their power in this country and by the very nature of our Constitution don't belong in the public classroom.<br>
<br>
I do believe in the power of religion, and in freedom of or from religion.  However, the State should not be the one to approach religion with my children, and I should hope you feel the same.  That is my job (and yours).  Now I know that those two words are hardly a religious sermon, but think about it... my little Zeus worshipping/Atheist/Pagan/Druid/Muslim child is taking an oath to country and to God.  That is the problem. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

<br>
Nonsense!  This country is about defending the rights of the minority despite the wishes of the majority at times.  Go read up on the civil rights and find out what the &quot;majority&quot; of people wanted to do with the minority of people.  Same thing with the Civil war.  They were in the minority but enough people saw that injustice was being done and they spoke out about it and got things done.  The majority didn't want people of color to live in their neighborhoods, ride their buses, attend their colleges and so on.<br>
<br>
What makes this country great is that we have the ability to change and become enlighted despite what the majority wants.<br>
Take a look at the eugenics movement that went on in America in the 1920's... forced sterilization of people, usually people of color or low income.  <br>

     What's so wrong with saying a couple words to pay truibute to the country that gives you so much.  I like the country I live in, but becuase of people such as this moron am beginning to look for other options.  That example of selfishness is the kinda of thing that will eventually break this country apart.

Instead he effected millions of people that really didn't have a problem with it and now are in a uproar cuase they really believe in it.<br>
<br>
     How about this, I have a problem with people.  Man they are everywhere.  Everywhere I look there is someone right there taking up space in my country.  I cannot stand for it.  They are intruding on my freshair.  Something should be done!<br>
Yes I should make a law to change that.  They should all go away cuase instead of going to my house so I can get away from them, I will make it where no one is there to offend me.  Now this is great no one is there.......no more people to offend me......I can live my life now.........hmmmmm where is that pizza guy! <p><a href="http://xxion.150m.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://xxion.150m.com/Triple%20X%20Sig.JPG" border="0"></a>

My father, in the 60's, almost got his Real Estate license revoked because he was helping blacks buy real estate in white neighborhoods.  In fact, Ronald Reagan was govenor at the time and the govenors office was putting pressure on my dad to stop it.  My father got death threats and was terrified for his family.  So my family is very aware of what swimming against the currents of what the majority want. <br>
<br>
It was a small minority of people that put &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Alligance, as Bageroth has edumacated us, perhaps it'll be another small minority of people to take it out.  The words, &quot;under God&quot;, don't pay tribute to the country.  They pay tribute to some people's belief system.  Good grief, read the history of the pledge of alligance and you'll find it was a knee jerk back lash to the pledge communists were taking.  <br>
<br>
Tell me, did reciting the pledge of alligance when you were a kid mean anything more to you than the preamble to another day at school?   <br>
<br>
I do care very much about the separation of Church and State and would like to see some of the erosion that happened to that ideal during the 1950's be undone.  If I wanted to live in a theocracy I'd move to Iran.  Theocracies, IMHO, are the scariest governments around and I'd like to see us stay far, far away from that model of government.   Keeping religion and government  separate preserves them both.<br>

That's all this guy is doing.  He believes that the words are wrong and he is exercising his constitutional rights to get it heard by the courts.

Not only did you not understand what Barg said, but you made rediculous statements.<br>
<br>
Barg is saying that instead of the &quot;right way&quot; to say the pledge including &quot;under God,&quot; with a few people allowed to omit it, the &quot;right way&quot; should omit &quot;under God&quot; and let anyone who wishes to insert a religious reference of his/her choice do so (freedom of religion, freedom of choice).<br>
<br>
Now you manage to bring up the argument that since Congressional representatives are elected by the people they have the consent of the people, whereas a two judge panel (it's 3 judges in the 9th circuit, the main judge being appointed by nixon fyi dirra) doesn't.  That is completely illogical.  Where do you think judges come from? They appoint themselves? They buy the position?  They are appointed by elected officials who carry the consent of the people. Thus, judges also carry the consent of the people.  It's bullshit to say that congressional representatives truly represent the people (I'm not sure this is true), and then say that judges don't.  And for the record, saying that you'll be able to contact your senator to have something changed you don't like is also a joke!  In fact, I have petitioned Senators Glumnercon and Tedule multiple times with no results.<br>
<br>
As for the whole pledge issue, I'm kind of torn about the whole thing.  For starters, I don't have a lot of respect for people who feel the need to rock the boat to get attention and press their minority beliefs on others (activists).  <br>
<br>
However, I agree that God shouldn't be referenced in the pledge, the constitution, or anywhere else in government.  Like one of the earlier posts said, religion is a completely personal issue. People do not need reminders of the existence or lack of existence for God, and God does not need to be referenced repeatedly in government contexts.  I think religion contributes a lot of positive things, but it has contributed a lot of horribly negative things as well (animosity, prejudice, violence).  It's obvious that the &quot;God&quot; referred to in the pledge and other places is the Christian God, and I don't think it's necessary to shove reminders of one belief system into the face of the nation whenever it is possible.  People who are firm in their beliefs don't need these reminders, and people who don't share the same beliefs don't need them thrown in their face.  It's as simple as that.<br>
<br>
However, despite the fact that I don't think it should have been placed in there, I'm not in favor of changing it. Like it or not 40+ years in the pledge still holds quite a bit of tradition.  Also, I don't think this point in time is the most appropriate for removing it.   At a time like this, the attention of these activists needs to focus on things that will bring the country up, rather than nitpicking about little things like this.  Should it have been there in the first place and is it necessarily right? I definitely don't think so.  Is it a serious problem or is it seriously infringing on the rights of people who don't believe in God? No.  Are there much more important things to worry about? Yes, so leave it be.<br>

The fact that a majority of people want something doesnt make it good or constitutional. You can thank god and our forefather for that! <br>

<br>
I don't have any problem with our system of government per se. However, it's been perverted, which is what I was talking about. The judiciary has assumed far too much power.<br>
<br>
Judge Bork talked a lot about this in his unsuccessful confirmation hearings : We have a judiciary branch that creates far too much new law. The Congress is supposed to write laws; the Pres to enforce them.<br>
<br>
Roe V Wade, Miranda (an insipid ruling if ever there was one), and the judge in St Louis who actually raised taxes from the bench and became a School Superintendant / School Board unto himself are cases in point.<br>
<br>
If the courts have a problem with the laws, they should throw them out on the basis of constitutionality -- but it is not their place to create new legislation out of whole cloth. The fact that they are named to life long tenure by elected officials does NOT equate to them BEING elected officials. Once they are named, they are forevermore unaccountable to anyone -- and that's the big weakness. For example, note that the feller that wrote the flag ruling, if I recall correctly, was named by Nixon for chrissakes. The solution is for the courts to be self-restrained and refrain from legislating from the bench.<br>
<br>
And with that, I'm done with this stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uvernander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vernander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 9:01:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3304.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Ours government is run by parasites who take over host bodies.
