I could go on about guilds I know looking for clerics but many clerics in their guild do not have epics yet.  Blame it on a bottleneck sure.  I say there are no bottle necks when you have 30+ lvl 60's under 1 tag.  Why?  Cause from what I have seen most of the upper guilds have a mass population to serve a few.  This could be discussed about a lot of classes.  <br><br><br>Uber guilds on Drinal = zero, why?

Furthermore, it also isn't your place to imply that the epic or loot policies of some guilds aren't adequate to your taste or standards.<br><br>Yet since the discussion has been lit, might as well continue till the original poster responds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>&quot;Vice has invited mages to do Ntov with them but put in the stepulation [sic] that they cannot get any loot.  All I can say is haha keep looking&quot;<br><br>Let's look at this from a logical point of view.  Most guilds, given that there are exceptions, recruit on a basis of need.  Also, most guilds (again with exceptions), do not allocate loot to trial members/recruits.  Given that mind set, the fact that Vice is seeking mages and Vice implements a no-loot rule for new recruits (be it to respect seniority, discourage typical lot hogs from even applying, or whatnot), deems that their action of inviting Mages to a raiding ground but dont' award with them with loot to be acceptable and reasonable.<br><br>The thing about certain mages in high-level guilds are buying mage crown for MQ?  First, it may be the possibility the magician him/herself wish not to take a day out of his/her guild's time to accomplish a goal for one individual's needs.  Second, there is also the possibility that a high level guild has switched their paths to concentrate more on loot-generating monsters (NToV, where potentially everyone can walk out a winner), rather than focusing on epic work.  <br><br>Granted some epics helps out a guild greater than the loot-generating mobs (the first cleric epic, the first enchanter epic, etc).  However, at some point additional epics of the same classes starts to exemplify diminishing marginal returns as far as time spent vs rewards gained.  The &quot;bottleneck&quot; here is more so what the individual or the guild decides to do, than what the game dictated once as the original bottleneck among competiting members of the same class.  With that said, it isn't a bottleneck.  No really, it isn't.   It is a higher level of understanding of what benefits the guild as a whole.  But perhaps at some point a person would want to get an epic just to be able to say &quot;I got my epic&quot;.  Without troubling his or her guild, the person seeks help in the open Market, what wrong is this?<br><br>I digress on the original Magician epic situation, as I now turned this into epics as a whole.  At any rate, in a high-level guild, obtaining one's epic should not be what interests one to stay in the guild.  Rather, it should be the unity one enjoys when one's own guild accomplishes some feat that would have otherwise been impossible on a single group basis.  With respect to such unity, a member should follow the epic rules the guild decreeds upon them.<br><br>Your quotation that implies Magicians are only used for CoTH in certain cases might be true, might not be true.  However, ST (by word of mouth, as I've not personally been there), is primarily for melees.  People should recognize the fact that sacrificing their (casters') time for melees to obtaining primals is a significant boost to what a guild as a whole is capable of doing.  The use for this is far greater than what one individual epic may bring.  If this fact can not be seen clearly by someone, then that person needs to go back to TeamWork 101 and recollect said person's thoughts before responding.<br><br>Does it matter if there are zero guilds on our server that falls under your definition of &quot;uber&quot;?  I think not.  What matters is regardless of our guild affiliation, regardless of who we group with and what tensions may occasionally occur, we are having fun playing the game the way we are playing it, not the way people on other servers may be playing it.  <br><br>Dashaa, this part specifically for you.  You appeared out of nowhere and immediately started putting yourself in a leadership position in pick up raids and pointing fingers at established organizations for things you don't see fit.  Your intentions may be trying to establish your own reputation to start your own guild one day.  It might be just because you seek attention in a hurry (Jack in the Box comparing itself to Mcdonalds exemplifies what I'm trying to say).  It might be anything.  Whatever the cause, chill out on pointing your fingers at everything you deem wrong.  Stop it with the view that &quot;I am right on everything and if it's not going the way I think it should be, you screwed up&quot;.  This is your mentality that I quietly observed in the past month as I read threads you post or ran into raids you run.  I've no idea where you came from (though I'd put my money on an ex-Legends player choosing a new server to be a home after the TR era), and frankly, your attitude as the supreme being of Drinal isn't pleasant.<br><br>Perhaps all that I wanted up to say could be summed up in: &quot;Mind your own business, a little&quot;.

That's a for certain.  I do have intentions of joining some guild in the future.<br><br>Why I poke my nose into this is because it has been inflicted on some of my guildless, and guilded friends.  I am not afraid to open my month and state my opinion obviously.

But, when a guild *Needs* a certain class to be able to accomplish some goals and come looking for you, but want to treat you as the lessor person on such raid, again, all I can say is haha!<br><br>Also, how I ended up on Drinal is due to the fact I played a level 60 necro on a pvp server and did not enjoy it.  So I went looking for a cross server trade for Warrior gear, and I found someone on Drinal willing to trade.  Before that I had several other level 60 chars and ditched em all cause I wanted to, and tryed to quit eq.  Lasted for 5 months before I was back at it again.

Now if we invite ppl on raids, ussually we want them to join.  If you put ur time in, join the guild, you will get loot.  If you come on one raid expect to win loot over someone who has been in the guild for 6 months, you are on crack.  If you want me to buy you a couple stacks of pearls, thats fine.  But expecting loot when a guild has a fair loot system is ridiculous.  <br><br>We don't treat our guild members/recruits/temps like dirt.  We need mages yes, we in fact want mages to join the guild, not temp for raids.  So we aren't looking to take any mages and abuse them and not give them loot.  Klaria our last mage was treated VERY well, and in fact is probally one of the best equiped mages on the server.<br><br>As for mages sucking,  mages are a lost class imo, ive raided as a mage for longer than most of you have played eq.  We are most effiencet Rodding and cohing and dsing.  That is our role in a raid.  <br><br>edit:  As for 'temps' on our raids who come to help and get no loot.  Some people want to see the big mobs in eq, and see stuff die.  Not everyones biggest ambition is soloing a spider in velk or killing frogs in velk.  Temps like to come to raids because they get to see things they have never seen. <p><center><img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/klaria/fullsize/silenius.gif" height="75" width="450" alt="Created by Klaria Keebler"></center><center>[ <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113190" target="_blank">Magelo   Profile</a> ]</font></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A> at: 5/22/02 12:22:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uroenyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roenyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 12:26:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3086.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sdrawkcab</span><hr size=1> Go kill uber_mob_002 and hope to get something nice that you have always wanted, even tho it being your 10438223 million NTOV trip only to be given loot over someone that was JUST added for the raid-in trial for the guild.

So let me tell you something. Guilds and their members dislike to invite total strangers permanently. Of our about 90 members we have three mages, two of them were just recently added. So a long while we ran around with one mage and could really need some more. If the applicant has a true desire to join that guild then it should be no problem for him to go through the recruitment process, which usually includes a no loot rule.<br>An applicant to our guild starts with negative 80 points. He has to guildremove himself after the raids. Once he reaches negative 40 points he does not have to guildremove himself anymore. When he reaches 0 points, there is a voting on our &quot;possible recruits&quot; board and the whole member base of the guild decides if the person will be added or not. An applicant needs 91% yes votes. If there are certain concerns about that applicant he might go to an extended trial. If he fails the first vote for other reasons he does not get in. If someone fails the 91% extended trial vote, he does not get in. If loot is rotting then applicants are allowed to bid for it, but as long as full members are interested in that piece of loot the applicant won't have a chance to bid for it.<br>I don't think that this is too much to ask for. Afterall the guild he applied to will provide him with loot once he makes it to full member status.<br>About mages in high level guilds:<br>Their job are modrods, modrods, modrods and maybe some summoned focus items. Sucks to be a mage these days as their role changed completely from the being one of the top damage dealing classes to a pure support class. I can understand people who quit their mage. What do you think how rogues would react if their job changed to permanently bindwounding the maintank? <p><center><img src="http://home.the-web-ac.com/jokosel/pics/signature.jpg" border=0></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3086.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3086.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3086.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3086.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3086.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3086.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3086.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=3086.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3086.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3086.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
