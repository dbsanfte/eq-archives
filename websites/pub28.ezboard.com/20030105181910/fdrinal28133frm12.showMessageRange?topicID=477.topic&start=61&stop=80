Where did Baelar and Sophi come from? We all know Nezak and Kildem were heavily recruited as well, but they rejected the offer. I'm sure a few more members were invited as well, but they also refused. You got the 2 least loyal members, grats.<br>
<br>
As for CT trying to steal Cats members, show me a single person in Cats that was asked to join CT before they left Cats. Haelan disbanded from Cats first then asked to join, we never asked her to join. Same with Nixo and Zabban. Was Kaelvan in Cats, too? Don't blame CT for your members being unhappy and leaving. Look at yourselves. One of your members even complained to me that our members are too damn loyal and making it a pain for his guild.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As for the recruitment. Cats in not an invite guild, we do not actively seek membership, perhaps some people asked Kildem or Nezak, but they were sent no applications of any kind. On the other hand, Baelar and Sophi were because they REQUESTED these to be sent to them. They have their own beef with CT that I know of, which isn't exactly proper to list here, but why push that issue in the first place - they wanted the apps, we gave it to them, they gave it back to us - huzaah indeed.<br>
<br>
Nixo is on the 3 strikes and your out rule. He left 3 times for no real valid reason whatsoever, gobye to him.<br>
<br>
Zabban imo, I really doubted his position with CiH in the first place, coming from WL - not to say I don't like them he just never seemed to mesh well with the CiH members<br>
<br>
Haelan...well...she has her own problems. 1`1 /q might come to mind when you think of the perfect sequence of overreactivity that was just not meant to be seen..she wanted to /q and she screwed it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  only making it more apparent to herself and many others that she was doing this on purpose.<br>
<br>
Kaelvan? No never a member of CiH, so your a little off there my friend Jing<br>
<br>
...perhaps the grats should be, &quot;grats Gell Vilik's pauldrons of pain, and anything else he wants&quot; instead of &quot;grats, You got the 2 least loyal members&quot; - I rather enjoy Baelar and Sophi as good friends. They have the balls of free will.<br>
<br>
fyi if you take my words harsh realize that I'm not an officer anymore either, neither do I hold a portion of the guild to my will (I left before I went on vacation). So as always, treat me as me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And in a large sense I agree with Shinro's post. Honorability only got us into trouble. What did all those passing over raids for the benefit of others give us? Giving people the chance to kill CT instead of doing it when scheduled. Well in WL's case it got us a nice rush to Tormax. Honorability is in the eye of the beholder. Some call honor doing what is right for all. I call honor doing it is right for the people I care about. Right now it seems more right than wrong to relinquish some of the need to raid a zone that is now considered a pain (not because of ventani, but the actual going inside and having to clear weak weak dragons).<br>
<br>
Most of the people call CiH out as bad people because they have no idea of the inner workings. They figure, hell its a high level player that wants to have free will, Oh shit he stole my willowisp - I'm telling his guildleader so that the next pop which is 5 seconds away is actively killed by another person and my bitching will intensify and become stronger. Please, spare us the useless guiltrip of, &quot;well if you want to further ruin your reputation&quot;. What reputation? Reputation is spawned by the people in the game that AREN'T what you are, since all the CiH members cannot make their own reputation, its in the hands of the rest of the members of the drinal server. If the rest of the server wants to think, hey that guy is high level and he just ran through and killed my bear for fun - since high levels HAVE to be restricted to what they can and cannot do, never touch my fast spawning newbie mobs - reputation = down!. Of course its safe to say that many people do not care, I for one do not care. If someone deceides to not sell me something because i'm in CiH, power to em, I just won't sell them anything either. If you think I am here for your sole benefit you can fuck off. The world is a selfish place and I do intend to have my own plans in mind for when I want to have fun. <br>
<br>
Annddd .... After reading all these posts, well skimming through most of the bullshit ones, I must say its kinda funny to see some people just turn the truth around. Honor - such a funny phrase. I wonder how much honor it takes to make a post daring us to do what they don't want. You want us to call your bluff? keep it up - I was just thinking that some of the intelligent posts (Mene mostly) have been rather acceptable and made me think a bit, why wake the sleeper, lets just forget about ST. Then again - all the other shitty,  idiotic, ill informed, or the magical jump to conclusions mat posts just re-jolt me back to reality. As I said before do you really want to push? <br>
<br>
This thread started off with a valid beef, threats coming from one side saying you do xxx to me and you'll find the sleeper awakened. Very true that is not deserved and shouldn't be tolerated. However, pushing it and backing it up with information that doesn't have any plausability whatsoever is just uncalled for. Yeah now lets return to the reality that no matter who posts, they will be looked upon by who they are, that includes guild and class.  <p><br><img src=http://www.catsinhats.net/dragoonr/dragoonrsigt.jpg

<br>
Everyone listen the fuck up.<br>
<br>
--We are doing this because it is what we choose to do--<br>
<br>
Omg did it get through your brain now?!?!<br>
<br>
No amount of bargaining or anything will stop us from waking the sleeper. (even if it is not what all members want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) But, what can be done is this can be stopped on the flame board and the officers can get together and find a way to hold off on waking the sleeper for you guys. <br>
<br>
There is just one thing you guys must realize when you are talking together about this: We will NOT take an offer that is not weighed in our favor. Nothing is stopping us from waking him tommorow. This isn't meant to be used as a threat, but more of just something to think about when talking with our officers about it.<br>
<br>
This is like if CT had everything they wanted from Vulak and there was some quest with him that you could despawn him forever. If you guys said you would give Nwing to us, but you wanted something out of it, I am 100% certain that you would want to get the better deal. Otherwise what is the point in even talking it over?<br>

<br>
Things got way out of hand. 75+ people on a Nwing raid, people quitting because they couldn't handle the amount of people. Both guilds actively recruiting more and more people. It was just too much for everyone to take in. Back when it was 50ish people, then yes Nwing was fun with the alliance (I'm sure you guys had fun too). But 75+ people all entering for Vulak loot and having no exact background that can be used in the loot decision. (the decisions were very tough with people just entering because they could. Kind of like an open random on a Plate BP)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, all the negative comments are not making this any easier to change the minds of those that wish to  have the Sleeper Waken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 11:58:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb -- To Cats</span><hr size=1> what is sad is that  2 months ago we were all side by side helping each other, and now it comes to this, do you not think this would have been alot easier if a CIH and a CT officer simply talked first rather then having all this shit laid out on the table for no real reason other then to get tempers flaring.<br>

In a sense CiH won the great race because they uberized faster than any other group.  You were the first to be able to do what you wanted.  Hell, CT was still doing nag/vox when CiH first killed trak.  Because you were the first ones there, you grew accustomed to getting exactly what you wanted.  You owned the server.  <br>
<br>
As far as the alliance, the officers at the time from day one will remember that I pointed out that both guilds should stop recruitment, before the numbers got out of hand.  If you don't remember run back and look at the joint officer board I have a post there about it.  You may speak with the bulk of our recruits now, and they were told we had closed recruitment.  Through the alliance we didn't recruit for that very reason, you kept recruiting then decided too many mouths to feed.<br>
<br>
Now then, the very large problems at heart seem to be the following:<br>
<br>
1. Cats was attempting all the stuff we did in the alliance prior to the alliance, CT was not.  Its not to say that we couldn't do it, its just that already WL and CiH were farming the server much like CT and CiH does now.  I would imagine a guild like TK is about where CT was pre our alliance.<br>
<br>
2.  Going into the alliance, cats had some better gear than CT did.  I say some because Cats profited just as much loot wise as CT did, your loot whoreing members got just as much or more loot than our loot whoreing members did.<br>
<br>
3. As mentioned above, cats history, they have owned the server.<br>
<br>
From these three points, Cats feels that they are the best guild on the server.  And they are.  But they aren't so much better than some of the other guilds out there that they can dominate a server like, AL for example.<br>
<br>
I personally got very frustrated.  The end of the alliance didn't treat me very well.  The cats officers decided to place the blame of the alliance's end on me, and several members (of CiH) have constantly harassed me to no ends over some of the points that they feel I am to blame for.<br>
<br>
A person can only take so much of people implying through tells that 1. I'm better than you, 2. My guild is better than your guild.  I'm no longer the guildleader, but I do stand behind one of the principles that I used when building CT, and that is I don't care if we are the best guild in EQ or the best guild on the server or even the best guild in a zone.  We will go out and try to achieve whatever we can.<br>
<br>
CT is not, never will be, nor ever wants to be the best guild on the server.  We don't post our accomplishments on public boards so that other people can see how great we are.  We don't try to compete with other guilds.  We compete with the game itself, trying to see if we can do something we never have before, or if we have, do something better than we have before.<br>
<br>
When I personally (though i wasn't the only one) received tells, and trevize, you were not the only one, from members of cats essentially telling me that my guild has to play by these certain rules imposed by cats or we will wake the sleeper --or-- that you were going to wake the sleeper so that my friends wouldn't have the possibility of ever seeing the warders I got very upset.  What the intent of my post was supposed to be was that CT isn't going to play that game.  I hope you don't wake the sleeper, and I ask you not to and if its something you want I will get down on my hands and knees and plead with you not to wake him, because I promised to my guild that all members would get a key and get into sleepers (and the implication is obtain loot from the warders that they wanted).<br>
<br>
What my personal belief is, however, CT isn't going to be dictated how we can play EQ.  Last I checked, a member of cats doesn't pay my monthly bill to sony.  Until that happens then I will play the game the way I want to play it.  I don't pay any member of CiH's bills either, so I don't try to dictate how they play the game.  And this is what i was trying to say when I started this thread.  I don't want you to wake the sleeper, but I have no control over that.  But if you choose for whatever reason to wake the sleeper, do you know what happens?  Nothing.  The sleeper awakes, and much of the server is deprived of part of this game, but in the long run nothing.  I'll still log in and try to achieve something new or something better, my guildmates will do the same.  Cats will log in and probably do that same exact thing.  We'll just have a few less things to kill each week.<br>
<br>
So, if that's the case, why should we cave in to threats and ultamatems?  I don't own you nor portend to, but in the words of Uzzu, you don't own me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>a WOOD elf warrior.. right</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/16/02 2:33:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb -- To Cats</span><hr size=1> I don't want to flame or anything, but this thread seems to be the logical one to post my thoughts on.<br>
On AB (yeah, leave our server board and get back to your shitty Euro server), we also have a North ToV rotation between Darkwind and Mortalis:<br>
<br>
You have 48 hours to clear North Wing, after 48 hours it is FFA. If you are not done with North Wing within these 48 hours, you betterhave your members online very early the next day to not lose your dragons. Rotation switches with every respawn/patch/server maintance but NOT with a zone crash!<br>
<br>
I think that is a pretty fair solution cause this way no guild can be sure to *have* North ToV after 48 hours. This way *holding* North ToV and clearing other things first is no option. This balances a lot of things imo. Maybe worth a try on Drinal too?! <p><center>

Sure your mad and want to react in a way to punish the abuse people give you. Do you think your the only ones who take abuse? Look around the world is full of it. Many come to EQ world to have that excitement that you go through in killing Nag/Vox doing the Kings &amp; lords as well as ST. I have old friends that are in Cats that go way way back to the CBC days, I am sure many of you remember those days as well. I guess it just depresses me in a way. Because I know one day I would kill nag/vox and other high end stuff because I knew they would be there when I was able to get there. But is going to really suck that day when I find out the sleeper was awakened on drinal. Which would not only crush my hopes at a future challendge but also the hopes of so many.<br>
<br>
Guys follow your goals do what you want. There are let me downs throught life and we all have gone through them and learned from our mistakes. Just make sure what ever happends it is done with REAL thinking and not mixed anger emotion.<br>

What is REALLY surprising is it's coming from CT now cuz we were so tight for a while and I am still friends with a lot of members.<br>

You especially Gell benefited from the alliance possibly moreso than any one individual with often what a lot of people, including those in you're own guild, looked upon as questionable dedication to raiding cept when something sweet a crusader could use might drop.<br>

I know people will continue to post messages anyway...  but oh well.  <br>
<br>
First off members of both guilds tried to get members of the other to join.   You all can just let that rest now.<br>
<br>
NToV rotation:   Want to rotate?  fine.   Lets work something out.  What Nadeniel suggested has some promise to it.  48 hours to clear NToV is reasonable.   Any longer then 48 hours screws up the next respawn for the other guild.  I really don't want to spend more then 1 night in NToV myself.  Sitting in NToV waiting for dragons to respawn would just be lame.  48 hours is a good compromise.<br>
<br>
SoV Uber mob rotation:  That is more difficult.  There are currently more then just CT and CiH involved.  I would like to suggest a Friendly FFA.  FFFA if you want.  Basicly, first guild to have enough in the zone to kill the mob get him.  NO camping 6 people in the zone spamming that you're going to kill it.  You have to have the people in zone or be obviously on the way.   So you can't claim Cazic Thule and then go spend the next 4 hours in ToV killing Doz or something.  You've GOT to be in the zone or obviously on the way to the zone.<br>
<br>
SoL Uber mobs:   See  SoV :-).<br>
<br>
Sleeper's Tomb:  What I've said is SOOOO simple.  But keeps getting twisted.  Effectively ST is FFFA.   Kill Warders 2 and 3 when ever you find them up and you have enough people to kill them.  Just leave the first warder up so that when we kill the 4 warder weekly we won't have the Sleeper running around.   How tough is that?   It doesn't force anybody to abide by any body else's schedule.   <br>

In the past cih has been honorable, and we've gotten fucked over every time for it. Whether it's a flame, or someone biting the hand that fed them, we get punished for being honorable. Well what if for once we aren't honorable. What if we wake the sleeper to satisfy our own agenda, and say fuck the server that's treated us so cruely in the past. Give me one good reason to honorable, and I won't wake the sleeper. And don't tell me you won't be cruel to us, and flame us, because there will always be something. Always. <br>

Here here.  I'm tired of getting shit on by the server.  And this is coming from one of the most outspoken cats within the guild about having the responsibility of being 'good guys'<br>

Give me one good reason not to do whatever we want, because since the start of Drinal, CiH has been damned if we do, and damned if we don't.<br>

I’m deeply saddened that it was a member and officer of my guild that changed it from a discussion to a flame.  I am grateful to the majority of the members of CT who have chosen to refrain from adding to this mess.<br>
<br>
I would, however, like to comment on Nodda’s last post.  Not as a member of CT, or even a player of eq, but just as someone who has a lot of respect for Nodda and has in the past asked similar questions of myself.  95% of you will not agree with me.  That’s ok.<br>
<br>
Honor and character are about who you are when nobody’s looking.  They are about personal decisions you make about who and what you are.  To have any value, they can have no basis on what others do, think, or say.<br>
<br>
That’s not to say that you let people mistreat you without reacting, just to say that how you react must be based on your personal code of ethics, not the ethics of those around you.<br>
<br>
Any time you step out of the crowd &amp; decide to be something more, you become a target.  For some reason the public always seems to expect more of high profile personality then they do of themselves.  Nobody can stand up to the constant scrutiny imposed on a public figure and come out spotless.<br>
<br>
I know I said I wasn’t speaking as a member of CT, but I do want to add the following.<br>
<br>
CiH is a public figure.  Anything you do will be scrutinized by those around you.  The majority of those that have legitimate complaints will come here and make them publically known because your name will be recognized.  Those that have complaints based on misunderstandings will do the same.  So won’t those wishing to feel better about themselves by cutting on the success of someone else, believing that for someone to be that successful they must have done it dishonorably, otherwise, they have no excuse for their own lack of success.<br>
<br>
CT is also a public figure.  Unfortunately, we have made mistakes &amp; we have wronged people.  Never to the best of my knowledge, have we done this maliciously, but we have done it.  We have also been wronged, many times, by many people.  The struggle is to remember who you are when these things happen.<br>
<br>
Personally, I will continue to fight to ensure that CT remains honorable, even if I have to fight my own guildmates, or my fellow officers.  This isn’t a popular opinion.  Many people feel as you have stated, that there comes a time when you say “to hell with it” and just do what you want because you want to do it since people are going to fight you anyway.  I’ve known that temptation too, and have regretted it every time I’ve given in to it.<br>

<br>
Ok returning from my 4 month DAoC/Counter-Strike vacation about a month ago. The Alliance had ended Cats was still together licking its low number wounds and healing. Waiting for an influx of older members to return with Luclin etc, which happened approx at this time. We got our numbers back, alot of our old schoolers returned and the guild was once again ready to fuck shit up.<br>
<br>
As far as us expecting to get shit first no we dont and wont EVER expect to just get shit because we are cats. We have busted our asses since back on MM battling with AL for spawns etc fighting over Inno or CT or Nag or VOx or whatever. We didnt become the &quot;uber&quot; guild of Drinal just by some Fluke we acctively persued this &quot;title&quot; by spending long hours of pulling buffing dying trying to kill shit that we wherent quite rdy for. Most of us Leveled harder and more often when we realized the benefits. Guys give us some fucking credit and dont talk like the rest of the world bowed down to let us be where and what we are, we fucking took it with work and dedication.<br>
<br>
NEVER at anytime has any member of CiH seriously wanted to wake the sleeper out of spite for any other guild. We dont do shit like that never have never will. BUt still you question our &quot;honorability&quot;. What exactly do you mean? Dont do something YOU dont want US to do because its benefits you? Give me some good reasoning as to the benefits for CiH? Make us feel like we shouldnt wake the sleeper, dont be a fucking prick about it Gell and challenge us. Cause so far my friend we 2-0 when challenged just ask Old CS and Old WL they tried. <br>
<br>
CiH wont back down when challenged trust me we fear NOTHING you can or cant do, no we respect you as a guild although Gell is 1 member who needs to re earn that respect, and if asked if a nice manner not challenged and threatened as Gell the mighty or holy or stupid or whatever puts it, CT will do what CT wants when it wants. Ok if so yet your members openly admit that ntov isnt a likely week knight adventure that clearly state you dont want to race to spawns etc. We have cleared ntov during week nights etc not overly difficult getting the numbers.<br>
<br>
Kinda babbling was pissed, highly upset at the thick brained posts that are  the majority of the posts here. But ive decided not to retaliate to pricks by being a prick. Kila states it best if you want something from us ask, but remember we need something from this too. Its kinda NICE to acctually offer us a tad more in the bargain makes it more likely we will agree. We have always been very open minded about sharing spawns and not killing shit to let others that asked get a try. If we truelly chose the only guilds killing anything regularly would be Femax and IB because we technically coulda not giving a rats ass like alot of other uber guilds and continued dominating mobs etc. BUT we where HONORABLE and have always been HONORABLE yet by doing so we get shot down by Gell the Holy. Check your fucking ego at the door buddy. Cih and CT did alot together especially helped each other sustain themselves in times of trouble, now that you seem to think you have gotten enough out of US Gell you trying to burn bridges or something? Smarten up man we can all get along.<br>
<br>
Just dont fucking push.<br>

 this is what is offensive to us and comes of as inflamatory. Maybe you guys see it as being generous that you are even allowing us to kill two. <br>
<br>
You keep saying an officer from CT should have spoke to an officer from Cats first. Your officer Trevize is the one who made this public <br>
statement. No one sent us a tell first. <br>
<br>
again I spoke to lern last night and asked if there was anything we could do to work this out. He also said ST for Ntov was not a good trade. I asked him to suggest something that was fair. He said he would talk to the other officers about it. <br>
<br>
When Ubar insisted on waking the sleeper before New years day CT refused to help in this when it was mentioned on the officer boards. We did agree to help work on killing Ventani and leaving another warder up as a comprimise. Yes several members in cats have wanted to wake the sleeper for a long time and we have been asking  you for a long time not to. <br>
<br>
There are several other issues that have been brought up here that im going to address. Some of them are direct accusations some have only been snide remarks. They all add to the underlying tension between us. Im sure cats sees these things a lot different than we do.  <br>
<br>
again im the recruit officer Trevize no recruit gets considered  in CT without me speaking to them first. I dont even know Nidabu. I dont think we have ever spoke about anything let alone joining CT. Tedule asked me if we had invited/recruited her. I of course told him no. Please show me a log of anyone in CT asking Nidabu to join CT and I will reprimand them possibly even /guildremove them. <br>
<br>
we all know you are refering to Bruuss when you talk about ST and him working on his ring quest. He logged in well after ST was underway becuase he had to work late. He asked if he was needed in ST for the short time he was on or if it was ok that he work on his ring. He was told it wasnt necessary to come. <br>
This could prolly be blamed on two guilds having two separate chats. CT officers just thought Cats officers would relay this to the guild not use it as an issue against us. <br>
 <br>
Draag you have proven yourself to me to be an honest guy. A little hot headed at times but you keep your word and speak your mind. Fact is I trust you and believe what you say. Im sorry to hear your not an officer anymore. Why dont you tell your guild and Jorply the truth about the Viiks Pauldrens. No lottos during the alliance were awarded without the other guilds officers consent. If an officer was in on the lotto as gell was for pauldrens the he left he group. 3 cats officers were in on that decisison and decided not to give them to Jorply.  also I wish you and Gell could patch up your differences. <br>
<br>
As for another loot that seems to bother you all to no end. Solarflare winning Yelinak gaunts. That loot was decided by CT officers only. I was in the comitee. The only other viable people in that lotto were CT members. We gave it to Solarflare for two reasons one he deserved them and had the worst armor of anyone in the lotto and second we didnt want to appear to be awarding all the loot to CT members since they had won some nice things earlier that night. I know Trevize would have you think someone else deserved them more than Solarflare in cats but the truth is Trevize was pissed that he didnt get them for himself. He kept sending us tells during the decision process about it and how he wanted them so badly. Now those of you that know Trevize know im telling the truth. <br>
<br>
You all keep saying or implying how Gell is such a loot whore, lacks dedication and how we in CT are so stupid to follow him. You should take a look back at all the lottos won during our alliance and youll notice that some of your officers won quiet a bit as well. most of it deserved because they attended more raids.  As for Gells dedication to CT you obviously have no idea how much he has put into our guild. <br>
 <br>
Trevize you are a true politician. One day you are working with Gell on a new guild charter (we were talking about merging on the officer boards) and then the next day your throwing him under the bus and blaming him for everything your guildmembers are upset with you about. <br>
<br>
CT has not hard feelings for ending the alliance or that several cats members were adamantly against any type of merger. <br>
<br>
finally ill say again this is the truth as we see it. You may see these events from another point of view. from our side we are not dictating anything to you. we are asking to negotiate something fair to both sides and you are stating take it or leave it.<br>
