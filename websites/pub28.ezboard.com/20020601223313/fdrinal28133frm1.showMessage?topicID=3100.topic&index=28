<br>
I just wanted to say a couple of things.  I didn't post this to be flamed or to hear how this isn't going to work.  The list IS working.  <br>
<br>
None of the people on the list.. NONE of them.. are personal friends of mine or associated with me in any way.  This is not a list of my guildmates or of my friends.  This is a list of clerics that came to skyfire, that asked to be put on the list,  and that have cooperated with each other.<br>
<br>
The list belongs to the clerics.  Not to me and I'm not here to mandate it or enforce it.  As always you have a choice if you wish to be a part of it or not.  I will say however that it was so wonderful not to have to worry about someone coming in and stealing this camp.  I felt protected and confident I would have the force to take out Ragefire when he spawned because so many other guilds agreed I was next in line to claim him.  There were 3 other clerics ahead of me and I waited patiently, checking in with them every day and helping to keep their spirits up.  When it was my turn I did the time, and sat in skyfire almost 24/7 for 6-1/2 days.<br>
<br>
The list IS and has been working for the past 2 months.  Just ask Heldenhammer, Magada, Emlen, Puleo, Requiemme and myself.<br>
<br>
The only way it will continue to work is if the clerics get together and agree to make it work.  The list is only posted here for official reasons to make sure everyone has the same list.<br>
<br>
Softly<br>

My little guild is just getting our first couple of clerics to the point where their epics are approachable, but we do have a hard hitting group or three of 50+'s that can and will mobilize to help y'all fell this beast and get another Drinal cerlic their epic.<br>

<br>
The clerics camping rage in this manner should also understand that not ALL clerics read this message board, nor do they all communicate with you, or even all speak english either.<br>
<br>
Just understand that there has been times in the past and will be times in the future that your orderly list is only good for those who's names appear on it.  <br>
<br>
That said, for CiH clerics that need their epic, it is up to them how they go about it.   As a guild we'll fully support coming when they call us to kill ragefire. <p><BR>

Softly posted this because it was asked of her by the guildleader of another guild so no suspicions of foul play or favoritism as far as the list itself goes would arise.<br>

Sure there might be an asshole or two who won't conform to the list, but the majority of clerics will, and that is its purpose.<br>

<br>
Yes there are plenty of other clerics that want it, yes some of those clerics might have the the ability to call enough guildmates/friends on their own.<br>
<br>
However, the people that are on this &quot;list&quot; are the clerics that show up in Skyfire.  You might say Cleric_04 and Cleric_07 are ready for Ragefire, but if they aren't taking their time to at least stop by Skyfire, it really is hard to justify they deserve this final piece.<br>
<br>
A cleric might prefer to do this entirely the old fashion way.  Wait for it to pop and call in his/her forces regardless of whatever cleric may already be at the camp spot for the 6th consecutive day.  That's fine, but as the underlying point of Asanti's post goes:<br>
<br>
Your chances of getting Ragefire against the collective of people that have chosen to work together is less than if everyone was just working on their own.<br>
<br>
There is no need to check with every guild to see who supports it or who doesn't.  There is no need to check with every cleric that are at this point whether they want to be on that list or not.<br>
<br>
If they want to be on that list, they go to Skyfire and see what's going on.  Isn't that where you're supposed to be nowadays if you want Rage, anyways? (Rhetorical question, the answer is yes).  Consistently no clerics from said list there camping?  Then this list is essentially flawed and not working, then do whatever you want.  If you don't even take the time to go to Skyfire ever you 1) won't ever be on the list, because that's where it starts, and 2) You really don't deserve an epic if you just expect to pop in, see, kill, loot.<br>
<br>
As for guilds, most guilds already stated (and I take this to be a given) that they support the decision of their clerics.<br>
<br>
All a list does is increase the chances of the clerics on the list (or you can rephrase that as clerics that put in the time and effort for the camp) versus those that aren't putting the camping time in.  <br>
<br>
This post, unlike my other non-market posts, has no hidden meaning.  Has no sarcaism directed at anyone that I didn't blantly point out.  It's just to point out that people that are asking perhaps the clerics on this list should check with other clerics that are at this point essentially don't understand how this list came into existence.<br>

<br>
Maybe you can talk the board admin into making a forum for Ragefire here.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest that you set some rules like, if the current cleric waiting on Rage can't be found online to get Ragefire within an hour or two, or can't muster forces, then the next cleric on the list gets a shot.  List order remains the same.  <br>
<br>
I'll try to dig up some of the rules that are in place and working on other servers. <p><a href="http://nmcs.com/kingscourt/images/toocool.jpg">The Blues Sisters</a><br><font size=1><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8428">Panamah,<em> Assassin elf</em></a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8188"><font size=1>Electrae, <em>Miracle Elf</em></a>
