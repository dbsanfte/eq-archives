Not really for any other reason then to just know if I am really very unique with some of my viewpoints or if they are shared by the majority. <br>
<br>
I'm sure we'll get the usual 1 or 2 - I just post to stir up crap responses - some funny ones too - but would be cool to hear other peoples insight. There are actually a few topic's I'd like to know more of peoples viewpoints on. Today's topic is Noob. Seems to be the fad of late. <br>
<br>
Question 1:<br>
Have you called people noobs? If you answered no to this question, you may proceed to someone elses forum thread.<br>
<br>
Question 2:<br>
Define Noob: <br>
Is it a level bracket? Is it that they haven't had  number of alternate chars (e.g. if you haven't played x number of chars you are a noob)?  Is it that a person who hasn't been in a percieved successful guild? Or is it something else?<br>
<br>
Question 3<br>
How do you conduct your analysis to ensure they are a noob before calling someone a noob. <br>
A) I inspect their gear <br>
B) Well if I haven't seen them before they must be a noob C) You just aren't an expert until you have done xxxx (please fill in for xxxx).<br>
<br>
Question 4 <br>
What reaction do you think you get when you call a real new person a noob? What reaction do you expect to get when you call an old player a noob?<br>
<br>
Question 5:<br>
When you use the term Noob is it when:<br>
A) You are being serious?<br>
B) You are being funny?<br>
C) Because it is the best way to convey you are an expert?<br>
<br>

I use it as a friendly insult when someone says something groan-ingly funny, asks a poorly thought out question (i.e. so do we kill the mezzed jug next?), or acts like a goober.<br>

<br>
If I were a new person - truly new to this game, and I wound up being called a n00b or seeing lots of people talk about n00bs, I would probably think this game were very silly. I'd probably tell anyone who called me one to kiss my ass...and it would definately forumulate an impression of this game upon me right off (before I invested time for 54 levels).  <br>
<br>
I think the increased usage of the term n00b is very exemplary of the current culture of EQ...it's definately lost some glamour with age.<br>
<br>
I am also scared that I would start using some of these terms to my boss on accident - it wouldn't fly here:)<br>

2. Not a level bracket, i've seen many 50+ n00bs, I guess some could say I am one, it's not the guild, although IM seems to have a lot of them :/.  It's a person who has no idea what they're doing, a rogue not going for AC, a cleric melee'ing.  A cleric that goes for str/sta/agi, heh I bet he knows who he is :P.  The enc that mez's the target YOU are on.  The ppl who AE mez 2 mobs.  I wouldn't even call an ebay'r a noob , if they know what they are doing, it's all good, it wasn't my cash.  <br>
3. I do gear, it's actually hard to rely on that though. I watch them play for awhile in my group and decide that it's going to be hard to group with them.  Or let them do an outcry and gate away cuz they didn't heal the cleric.  Or the Warrior that doesn't go AC cuz str is l33t.<br>
4.  I don't call new people newbies unless i'm selling items and they dont' go away.  But the worst comment you can make to someone in any online game, is 'Newbie'.  So you know what response you're goign to get.<br>
5. A &amp; B, depends on situation, if i'm w/ friends and they do a lil mistake (Varggoth, falling down the pit!).  If it's someone in the group, i just talk behind their back if they suck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usaevanexpane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saevan Expane</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.facelink.com/Saevan?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#993300>(3/7/01 12:00:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open discussion - Topic 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;'after the conference was over and we were talking about their approach, my boss says, 'they're so far behind us, they're noobs' I gave him a long, hard look and almost asked him if he played eq, but didn't hehe. was funny.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br>

thats so friggin hilarious.  Good move though not asking, its better if people at work dont know you play EQ, trust me, a couple friends here rag on me alot about it.  :) of course she watches the &quot;West Wing&quot; which to me is about as fun as watching a lizzard take a crap<br>
<br>
noobs is going mainstream though, wont be long before you see it more and more in pop culture , maybe next years super bowl commercials.  I use noob all the time in real life, it was around long before EQ and will grow in use long after EQ is dead and buried.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulernz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LernZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#993300>(3/7/01 12:18:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open discussion - Topic 1</span><hr size=1> My first ski trip of the season, heading up the lift, I tell my friend next to me, look at all the noobs in the noob area.

I love a good distraction when I actually have work to do =)<br>
<br>
1.  I've never called someone a n00b directly, but I have certainly thought it.  I never saw anything positive come from insulting someone, so I try to avoid it.<br>
<br>
2 &amp; 3.  n00b to me, is someone who does not &quot;try&quot; to play their class correctly.  This really boils down to paying attention and knowing what their class is capable of.  Probably the best example from my point of view is, assume a fight with 4 frogs all of the same name and 1 person as designated assist.  For this example, we'll say we have 1 enchanter, 1 cleric, and 4 tanks.  Tank 1 is the assist.  Now assume all 4 frogs are mezzed.  Tank 1 says, &quot;assist me on this a frog.&quot;  Tank n00b doesnt assist and just F8 targets and starts swinging.  You tell him, &quot;Wrong frog, use assist.&quot;  He turns around and F8 targets another one and starts swinging.  Rinse and repeat.  I don't judge the gear of a person, as even the best equipped awesome player once had less desirable equipment.<br>
<br>
4. The only reaction I would expect is hostility, providing it wasn't done in jest.  That's like attending a beauty contest and shouting that contestant X is an ugly toad-like creature.  People may agree when you call someone a n00b, but the target of your discourtesy won't stop and say, &quot;Hmm, excellent observation, I'll go buy EverQuest for Dummies and perform research on the aspects the game.&quot;  More likely they'll just take the approach of redirecting blame or making excuses.<br>
<br>
5. I would have to go with A on this one.<br>

WEll back to his post.  I think people who go around saying noob or newbie are the noobs.  noobs to me lack perspective, patience and among other things compassion.  They get to that high place and poke fun at people that are going through the same thing they did when they started. hmm.. I feel a novel coming..  anyway...<br>
<br>
The greatest humor of it all is while people brag about what they know to those they call newbies, the newbies learn and those that don't forget end up forgetting the person that called them a newbie ever existed.  <br>
<br>
It's kinda like that guy in high school that was king of the hill and now works at the gas station or in the restaurant you visit weekly.  of course you could careless what people do for a living cause we all have to work.., but he knows, you know, he knows....  <br>
<br>
Being a newbie is all about perspective which basically means we're all newbies one time or another.  If you don't already understand that, then well..  you're a newbie =)<br>
