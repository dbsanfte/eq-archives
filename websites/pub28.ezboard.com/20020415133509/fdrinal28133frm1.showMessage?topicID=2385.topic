<br>
American told to cut the patriotism<br>
<br>
<br>
The article goes on to say:<br>
<br>
&quot;The organisers have been told by the International Olympic Committee to tone down overt shows of patriotism during the 2002 winter games' opening ceremony here on Friday <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  and not to honour the victims of September 11.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a direct quote made in the article that is attributed to the head of the IOC:<br>
<br>
&quot;These games are held in the United States and we have deep respect and sympathy for everything that has happened since September 11,&quot; said François Carrard, the IOC's director general. &quot;But let's not forget the games is a universal event.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
For those who care to read the article in its entirety, here is the link:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/bush/story/0,7369,644538,00.html">www.guardian.co.uk/bush/s...38,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for my editorial (you had to know one was coming right?):<br>
<br>
I don't care for those staged patriotic events that have as their sole purpose yanking more tears out of my eyes; yet, after reading this cheese eating surrender monkey's line of crap, I hope that the Salt Lake organizers put on an extravaganza that starts with the Blue Angels flying overhead and ends with the Girls Scouts singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; while waving boxes of flag covered cookies over their heads.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What this moron fails to recognize is that 86 countries lost citizens in that attack, and that the Olympics are the perfect place to honor all of them at the same time.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My personal thoughts are that a representative from each of the countries who lost someone should have a part in presenting the world with the Olympic flag.<br>
<br>
As far as American patriotism goes, after the comment by that French moron, I hope the Salt Lake committee decides to use the torn flag that flew over the World Trade Center as our official flag.<br>
<br>
And screw world opinion.<br>

It is not in anyway just an American thing. Countries around the world have even banned together to help the United Staes on its war against terrorism. Ignoring what happened in the Olympics is not the way to help the problem. If anything its a way to bring people from other countries closer together and show them that we are all in this together. The fact that the Olympics are in the U.S is an even stronger reason they should in some way mourn the event. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uemrok2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emrok2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/6/02 7:36:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2385.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  ...</span><hr size=1> while we're at it we should honor the innocent civilians of afghanistan that we bomed and killed...<br>

there are two sides to this arguement... and i could easily defend either one... but personally i feel that the event should honor everyone and try to unite the world, not to focus on just one of the saddest days in history...<br>

Everyone and their dog are buying american flags to put on their cars, purses, bikes, dog houses, etc... sure there's nothing wrong with saying I love America, but good god, why does it take a tragedy on our soil to bring out the "true patriotism" in our hearts? right now it's a fad, you're a better person if you have flags sticking out of your ears and have I <3 A M E R I C A !  painted on all your fingernails.<br>
Just another thing for companies to make money, and attract more people to events. like this past superbowl (which was a setup!) The most patriotic superbowl in the history of the NFL, showing soldiers bringing up player stats, it's a freakin joke!<br>
Anyway, I don't want to get on my superbowl conspiracy theory... but that's my opinion on this patriotic thing. Yes, let's honor the victims of this horrible tragedy! we can be proud of our nation and for what we have and have accomplished, but if it's all for fad, what everyone else is doing, that's just going too far. The olympics is a worldwide event, more than Americans will be watching this, let's keep it in the spirit of of the nations that are involved in the games, and not just the one that had a terrible event happen, that happens every day in smaller countries around the world.  <p><center>

<br>
September 10th, 2001. My house and my retired neighbor are the only house for BLOCKS with flag flying out front.<br>
<br>
September 11th, 2001. I don't start crying about what happened until I walk outside and have to spend 10 minutes lowering my flag to half-mast because I had knotted it so tightly at full mast.<br>
<br>
September 12th, 2001. Everyone and their freeking dog has a flag. There's a shortage of them. I can't buy a new one to replace the one I realized was getting a bit frayed and torn when I went to lower it to half mast. I notice that just about every house I pass on the way to every &lt;name&gt;-Mart in town has a flag. Not a fucking one of them at half-mast, not even my neighbor who actually has a pulley system on his flag.<br>
<br>
September 19th, 2001. George W. Bush announces that the mourning period for the nation is official over and that all flags should be raised to full mast. I take my flag down, fold it properly (wonder how many of my neighbors could do that) and stow it. If my son decides to join the scouts, I'll give it to his troop to dispose of. Otherwise I'll give it to the local troop in a year or so.<br>
<br>
February 6th, 2002. The only flag flying in front of my house now is a small one in a uncle sam lawn ornament my mother-in-law and her boyfriend hand-crafted and painted. It will most likely be that way until I manage to go a week without seeing a car go by with a flag hanging out of the window on a plastic bar.<br>
<br>
I'm a patriot. Have been pretty much all my life, but it really sank in when I was in Basic Training and I heard 5 companies singing Lee Greenwood's &quot;Proud to be an American&quot;. If you've never heard 1000 men and women sing that song at once (and I do mean <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  sing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-full volume, with their hearts behind it), then you can't imagine what I mean. Its a physical force. I get chocked up when I watch movies like Saving Private Ryan. I imagine BHD will do it to me, as well. I actually cried a couple tears watching Armagedon in the theater. Not when Bruce Willis was saying goodbye to Liv Tyler, but when the shuttle bay doors opened and they walked out onto the tarmac to board the shuttle for launch. I salute the flag during parades and when someone is singing the national anthem-doubt its a habit I'll ever be able to break. I know why the American military's salute is unlike any other in the world...do you-there's one very unique thing about it? I'll let ya work on that for a while =)<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm glad more people are displaying the flag and treating it with the respect it truly deserves.<br>
<br>
I just wish it wouldn't take 5000 innocent lives for people to feel that way.<br>

It’s the same reason families band together and forget their differences at funerals and sick beds.<br>
<br>
I’m not offering this as an excuse.  I wish we weren’t this way.  But it is a truism that people feel differently about what’s truly important  when things are going well then they do when they are faced with a challenge.<br>
<br>
The same thing happens on so many levels.  Think of two brothers.  They might fight all the time and beat the heck out of each other regurlarly, but let someone else step in and attack one of them, then they forget their differences and stick up for each other.<br>
<br>
What would be truly tragic is if something as terrible as what happened on 9/11 and the people in CA didn’t react as if it was their brother who was attacked.  That would make me cry.<br>

<br>
The IOC has bowed to pressure, and as a comprimise the WTC flag will be presented seperately from the parade of nations by a delegation composed of firefighters, policemen and other groups associated with the events of 9/11.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this still doesn't address what could have been a display of world unity because only Americans will be involved in this presentation.  I say unfortunate because the olympics are the only event where the world could actually perform a physical symbol of their loss together, and the unity that loss has generated.<br>
<br>
I guess I should be happy that Americans are going to present that flag, but I'm not.  More than Americans died that day.  With this compromise, it seems to belittle their deaths.<br>

what a pile of horseshit - one can easily defend any point of view if one is an amoral piece of human refuse - doesn't change the facts and the objective rights and wrongs involved in this conflict...<br>

<br>
1. Poeple in Alfghanistan are being crontrolled under the Talibon, most in fact are not in the Talibon. Most people in fact had to resort to fleeing their country (Alfghanistan) because the Talibons rule was so cruel to the Alfghanistan people. Basically yes innocent people who also did not aprove of the Talibon were in fact killed by Americans and they themselves had nothing to do with what happened to us and did not condone it either. I felt he made a valid point by bringing that up.<br>
<br>
2. I think the point he was saying ( I think) was that if we only Stress American pride at the Olympics, it might give the impression that all other countries are less supior and worthy.<br>
<br>
I think both points are understandable and show maybe the other points of views. A moment of silence is still showing respect for what happened while at the same time not making any other countries feel less superior and also taking into account All innocent people who died. I thought it was a good suggestion. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 6:41:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2385.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Americans told to tone down the patriotism</span><hr size=1> No Arrora, he was looking to troll =)<br>

Look at what Arrora says. That's exactly what Emrok said if you had the half a brain you need to read it. Someone without previous bias (Arrora) can see it, open up your eyes. <br>
<br>
I will be the first to admit that Emrok can be a jackass. I however got to know him and he's actually an intelligent guy. As for your assesment of my intelligence, I couldn't care less, really. I'm not the one being a closed-minded jerk. <p>Sutekh/Barid
