<br>
&lt;this has nothing to do with Balrak, or your beefs with him, strictly btwn myself and your words&gt;<br>
<br>
Whatever problems you may have with Balrak, his words towards you, whatever... you do not speak down on and scoff at my guild.  I dont know who you think you are, or why you think you can speak of ppl the way you do, but I warned you earlier today in tells.  I hear you being unjustly rude to or demeaning towards my guild and I'll have words with you.<br>
<br>
here are my words: Take your shit elsewhere, or shut the hell up.<br>
<br>
I am not one for flames, and I am not going to keep any kind of &quot;flame war&quot; up, so say what you will.<br>
You have problems with Balrak, fine by me.  He has a mouth on him no doubt, but you dont bring your bullshit down on my guild as well...<br>
<br>
Maybe now that you're lvl 56 you dont remember being killed in fear raids, but it happens, probably quite to your disbelief.  You want to laugh at some people because they die learning a zone? it never happened to you? fine. Laugh to yourself, laugh to your guild, I dont care.  You speak down on Souls of Eternity or for that matter ANYONE underserving of your bullshit, and it'll come back to you.  I have known you a bit now, and I know that many ppl are good friends with you, and many ppl dont like you b/c of the way you speak to them and the way you carry yourself.<br>
<br>
Personally, i dont care.. I dont have a problem with you, and I can look right through your BS attitude and comments, but if you call out my guild in public, I wont stand for it.<br>
<br>
Be Warned... your attitude wont carry you far.<br>
<br>
and Balrak, STFU bro... for your own sake... yeesh<br>

Synide, there isnt a guild out there that respects you, not one.  Heh, thats pathetic.  Its truthfully people like you that are causing people to quit the game.  You have some good people in your guild (why they joined you I just dont know) and you are borderline ruining it for them for your stupid remarks and comments.  Do you ALWAYS have to correct people?  Every zone you are in, when someone says something that to YOU is not 100% accurate you ALWAYS have to correct them.  Yes, ALWAYS.  Ya think that people say, &quot;Wow, Synide is pretty smart&quot;?  No, they dont, they always say what an asshole you are for trying to be a knowitall.<br>
Solution : Turn off /ooc and /shout and /auction.<br>
<br>
Its as simple as that.<br>
<br>
You are rude, the sad thing is, you dont realize how stupid you sound.  You think, &quot;hey im cool cause I know a lot about the game&quot; but your worse than Shaere when it comes to getting your message across, and thats HARD to beat.<br>
<br>
Your only hurting your guild and the respectable players in your guild every single time you make a stupid comment (which is all the time).  Take your anger out at the gym or something, Everquest is made for fun.<br>
<br>
Also, when your on someone elses raid, not yours, just STFU.  Quit barkin orders and trying to run things.  Again, ya look SOOOO dumb doing it.  Just KEEP FUGGIN QUIET!<br>
<br>
Also, ive noticed the last week you have almost never been grouped or always have LFG on :)  Ya know why?  Cause noone wants to group with you.  Grouping with you is a nightmare.  You never ever have positive things to say, just criticism(sp?) for those that dont wanna hear it again and again and again from you.  Go back to wherever you came from or just quit playing the guild.  You are literally ruining it for people.<br>

I try to stay away from grouping with 55- in karnor's.  Yes, I know it's hard to believe.  I do things for good exp.  As far as no one liking me.  Because a group or majority of people don't like one person doesn't mean *everyone* doesn't.  Sorry, I can lead a raid and you can't :(.  I got 7 nags 6 vox's under my belt.  You?  I'm lvl 57.  You?  As far as LFG, ask anyone they have LFG hell at high lvl's.  You're 52, tell me how many great groups you get.  Yes I get in groups and leave them if the exp sucks.  <br>
<br>
I do know a lot about the game.  I know how to do things right, what's wrong.  I don't know nearly everything, more of the mid lvl game, because I'm not uber nor will I ever be uber.  My words do reflect my guild, and I'm sorry.  But, kilrog you also understand.  So do Balrak's, and for that I feel sorry for you, as do you feel sorry for me.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to apease anyone.  I'm here to play with me and my friends, and I've explained why I'm LFG. It's not because no one likes me, I get invited to groups all the time, it's rather hard to get the right classes together.  That's why the bear pit in permafrost is nice, you can do it w/ 3 55+, the classes don't matter, a tank and healer is a must but that's it.  It's easy but boring.  Bleve, I enjoy you're rants, as I'm sure you enjoy mine.<br>
<br>
I'm a tard, me and shaere would seem to get a long but we don't.  So I'm assuming I'm not too much like shaere, because our personalities seem to clash somewhere.  Don't throw around the fact that I don't have friends, because I do.  The shit people spew around the boards at drinal.com are almost just some retarded flame war back and forth, and that's why I do it because I think it's funny.  In my humble opinion, I bet Balrak enjoys it.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you this, if we met in real life, at a cafe or supermarket, we'd start to fight?  I doubt it.<br>
<br>
I'll try to reduce my flaming and being bitchy, for it does hurt the 'respectable' people in my guild.  <br>
<br>
Bleve, may I ask what guild you belong to?<br>
<br>
Also bleve, I am rude.  Read your first paragraph. You've learned the art of hypocricy first hand.<br>
<br>
Kilrog, I've died in fear raids, just not w/ 40 ppl post-kunark.  You die learning things, I just used that as a flame against him.  He seems to enjoy flames so I feed his ego as he seems to feed mine.  Didn't seem like to many people came to his defense. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A> at: 4/5/01 2:06:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzenywutang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeny WuTang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#939393>(4/5/01 4:37:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Synide</span><hr size=1> Heh flame flame flame, even got me wanting to do it.

Kilrog, maybe you forgot to tell the people that stfu part was a joke. It's ok porky, just GET IN MY BELLY!!!! Darn ogers, never can get it right. <br>

<br>
Oh about the KC ordeal, I don't have a problem with CT never did and still don't. Heck I have quite a few friends there, but ya know I had more people tell me the same story, you all were not trained upon you all *the 2-4 groups that were there were sitting in a pulling route*. So and I also saw part of it for myself to show you all were in deed sitting in the CY where people pull from as a matter a fact not only in the CY but in the center of it and by the one doorway. So you see nobody trained on you and if you call 2 mobs a train then GD, the meaning of trains has changed since I last played from the other night.<br>
<br>
Synide I saw a log of you telling her to &quot;bite me&quot; so don't even try hiding it. Son you've got such a bad rep for doing that, you and your mouth in game brought that all upon yourself, you're just making yourself look like a liar here saying you wouldn't or didn't say that as we all well know you do it as a common practice. Rule of thumb as being someone in command of a guild is you act like a professional and are considerate to others, you've got alot of learning to do. I had to laugh, maybe you are turning a new leaf over by trying to be polite in your last post, I hope that is the case, but you've got alot of work ahead of you before that happens.<br>
<br>
As for her shouting you all KS'd, funny, out of over a dozen people who were not on that raid said they never saw it once. You all were asked to please move from a pulling location and you were also asked to please not take peoples pulls. Why is that so hard to respect someones wishes like that? If you're organizing a raid go somewhere other then the CY in KC, like the zone entrace, a wizard ring or druid ring in DL, and so on to organize it. Once all are prepped up then move in but you never sit in a major pulling route and organize a raid, that's just common sense. You word vs many others and a log, I think I will believe the 12+ others and the log of the event before I believe you or anyone else who says otherwise. The proof is in the pudding and I had a taste of that pudding and it was straight up, legit and as always, A GOOD THING.<br>
<br>

I didn't send her a tell, nor did I say aloud in any form of ooc/say/shout/auction, the phrase 'Bite me'.  Why would I?

Was everyone piled in the middle? possible could be that they were moving to where they were going. Problems happen so people deal with it. This whole synide thing I have no idea what is going on but I can say this, CT is a respectable guild and will punish guild members that KS and trash talk to others in and outside the guild. That goes for people we invite as well. If that happens then we will not invite them again. <br>

Just adding some clarity <br>

<br>
I wrote out something long, but decided to shorten it. Synide I don't appreciate any reference about how souls got its rear kicked or that we don't have the ability to do chardok. We got our butts kicked in fear at first, that is true. It happens to everyone at one point or another. In regards in Chardok, could souls do it alone.. no. But we have many friends and as we have aided them, they aided us.<br>
<br>
Basically I don't appreciate your put down of SoE. Such flames are the ugliness that ruins eq. I hope all of you are proud of it. I personally wish you all the best.<br>

PS...forgot to add we were working on a 12 man break, not 40. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unarvakhani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Narvakhan I</A> at: 4/5/01 10:10:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#939393>(4/5/01 10:14:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Synide</span><hr size=1> On regards to fear, i guess the 12 man break ended up a 40 man break, w/ all the corpses in there.  <br>
<br>
I don't remember saying anything about chardok.  If I did, I apologize, and obviously it didn't mean anything because i don't remember :P.<br>
<br>
<br>
You're retired, get over the game(not a flame).  i don't understand why people keep droning back to EVERQUEST message boards after they have quit.  Is the reading material here that great?  I guess it's just something to do while you're bored at work/school ;).<br>
