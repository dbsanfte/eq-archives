<br>
but GOD DAMN! I sat there for 45mins pleading with them.<br>
<br>
You wanna know what answers I got when I tried asking people for help?<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, in a group.<br>
Sorry, low on mana.<br>
Sorry, busy right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are acceptable answers, but NOT when your fucking sitting at the zone in karnor's, and I'm a fucking bard that has mana song 2 + mana song 1 (which stack),making bards able to have  THE HIGHEST MANA REGEN IN THE GAME. well, besides the necro's ability to just give all his mana to a character.....but that's besides the point.<br>
<br>
Second...they were sitting at the fucking zone. How hard is it to bind yourself to the zone. port me to EJ, then gate back.<br>
<br>
Ok...Bind = 100mana...casting time (6 seconds)<br>
Gate = 70 mana...casting time (5seconds)<br>
Winds of the south = 300mana (casting time 9 seconds)<br>
<br>
total mana cost = 400 mana (just to get me there)<br>
<br>
Bard mana song (level 30) does around 8 - 10pts of mana per tick. (around level 55)<br>
<br>
Bard mana song *cantana of replenishment* (level 55) does around 12 - 13pt of mana per tick.<br>
<br>
That goes to about 20pts of mana every 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
400 / 20 = 20 ticks for complete restoration<br>
<br>
20 x 3 = 60 seconds.<br>
<br>
so, roughly 1 minute to gain 400 mana back. that's with my twisting both mana songs.<br>
<br>
I know I know...but it takes to long *whine whine bitch bitch...etc*<br>
<br>
ok.<br>
<br>
First, they bind themselves to Karnor's.... 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
Second, they cast winds of the south..... 9 seconds.<br>
<br>
Third, I play mana song to help them get mana back.....1minute.<br>
<br>
They cast gate....5 seconds.<br>
<br>
So right there, considering that zoning takes 0 seconds, and I start playing mana song as soon as they enter the zone. that gives them a grand total of 1minute and 20 seconds with a mana lose of 70mana due to them gating themselves out.<br>
<br>
I even offered 20pp, which he turned down, that would've compensated for the 70 mana lost. which would equal 1pp for every 3.5 mana lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
BULL SHIT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now personally, I wouldn't bitch and complain about getting a port from a druid...mostly, I have boofy come and port me...but the other computer was being used. and boofy wasn't online.<br>
<br>
The other thing was, I wouldn't have made it to my corpse in time if I had to run...because my drums were on my corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, I was faced with my corpse going stale, and not being able to get a res. faced with the fact that I wouldn't make it running. And my only option was to get a port to EJ so I could 1) get my corpse summoned.<br>
and 2) get a level 49 res.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thankyou blacklotus for actually porting me after asking you for a good 30 - 45mins straight.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rude Lazy ass druids.<br>
<br>
<br>
While there were a couple there that were in the Warlord room, and other places where they couldn't just leave, there were 3 druids that were just sitting in either the zone in, or the molt, and that's just bull shit. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A> at: 6/23/01 9:30:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#939393>(6/23/01 10:03:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   *sigh*</span><hr size=1> 1) Pull labtop out of bag<br>

And, to the druid, i'm guessing....who said tough shit.<br>

<br>
that's really funny.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And maybe I don't feel like finding peoples corpses.<br>
<br>
But I do.<br>
<br>
Am I here to cater to everyones needs to find their corpse? no.<br>
<br>
are druids here to port everyone around? <br>
no.<br>
<br>
Are clerics here to resurect everyone?<br>
no.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your responce just tells me you need to find another class to play.<br>
<br>
People know what their class can do before they play em. And if they don't, they know before they hit level 15 at the most.<br>
<br>
I made an assumption that taking 2 mins out of your time to help a fellow player out when you aren't doing anything anyways was something that most people would do. Maybe I was wrong...or maybe that just shows how FUCKED UP your class is.<br>
<br>
People like you make the general population of druids look bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I always ask for a port...not demand it....when it's an emergency...I be a little more forceful, but never say &quot;PORT ME BITCH, OR ELSE&quot;<br>
I'm always curtious when I ask...<br>
I'm always greatful....<br>
I always offer money....at the least what I have on me, and if I can't pay you, I'll pay you back when I get my corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's only when I get stressed for time is when my attitude changes, and I get upset when someone doesn't give a shit. Or they make up a lame ass excuse as to why they can't port me.<br>
<br>
How many have asked a cleric or a druid, or a wizard or a shamen for some sort of favor, and they said. &quot;sorry, logging&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, logging takes 30 seconds....If it was an emergency....that's understandable, you would have hit /q...if your logging cause you have to go to bed...that's bull shit.<br>
<br>
if the person's right there, and needs help, and it only takes you 10 seconds....do it...it will gain you some rep points, possibly some extra cash, and people won't look at you like your a lazy ass bitch. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A> at: 6/25/01 2:39:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrevize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trevize</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#939393>(6/25/01 7:51:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flame on druids/wizards.</span><hr size=1> Hmmm  Running from Karnor to EJ with SoW takes about 10-15 min or so?<br>

You are probably some little 12 year old wuss you just got punked an hour ago and have to take your anger out on a flame board.  My advice to you?  Go sniff some anthrax or something. We've already got Tat and Synide...we don't need anymore losers.<br>

<br>
Okay, first off...  You are willing to leave groups, and camps to port people....yet you won't do it when you're just sitting there?  The complex actions of talking to your friend and porting someone somewhere require the brain patterns of a 9 year old.  Now, on the other hand...  If you were man-handling your dog, the only advice I can give Doof is to stay away from freaks like you.<br>

Get your fuckin head out of your ass.  First of all, Karnor Castle is like 30 secs away from FV zone.  That means 1 min to get from FV bank to Dread zone...another 30secs to get from FV zone in dread to Karnor Castle, and hopefully, if there is a druid around who isn't a lil'bitch, 30secs to evact to EJ.  That's 2 mins. (1min +30secs+30secs = 2mins *for all you retards out there*)<br>
<br>
Now lets take your approach Nadenial.  FV to Swamp zone...2mins just to find the damn zone.  Once found, 5 or 6 mins to get from FV zone to TT zone (even longer if it's dark out)  Another 2 mins to run from Swamp zone in TT to EJ (another 30 or 40mins for corpse retrieval if you aggro even one of the millions of level 45+ casting NPC's roaming through TT) and another 2 mins in EJ to find a corpse.  Now you tell me Nadenial...  Which one would you choose?  Fuckin retard.<br>

<br>
I would have offered to gate Nadeniel but the run wasn't that big a deal I guess and he never bothered to ask.  I only found out he was making the run after he appeared at the sebilis zone and waved.  <br>
<br>
The &quot;dark&quot;  oooh scary.   Greater light stone in the bank fixes that.<br>
<br>
Sow potions, cheep drums.. nice items to have in the bank.   seems very simple to me...<br>
<br>
Gate potion from a shaman..   oooh  there's a novel idea.<br>
<br>
Can't find your way around zones?   /sigh  lazy ass.   Some time when you are not doing a CR take some time and go learn them.   Nothing worse then leading other players around zones that have been in game for like FOREVER.  If you don't know your way around Kunark yet..   wow  sad.<br>
<br>
But nooo  you'd rather rely on others to insure your gaming experience is fun.   Well I got news for you.  This is a GAME where druids and wizards have fun as well.  It never was and never will become their JOB to gate you around.  Take responsiblity for yourself or get used to disappointment.<br>
<br>
I've done CR's in PoF that sound simpler then what you're making this little run to EJ out to be.<br>

You can't ask someone nicely for a sow (if you're that slow without them)?<br>
<br>
I'm always amazed that someone would sit and shout for a port for 45 minutes when they could be there and back in 20. But no, it's much easier to expect someone else to put aside their plans to accomodate your whims, and like it doesn't happen to them 20 times a night with 20 people all equally desparate for a port, a res or something else.  There's a reason people go anon, its because they're sick to death of being pestered.  As a bard that's probably not anything you're acquainted with since you probably haven't been asked to perform any public service since you were level 15 finding lost corpses for newbies.<br>
<br>
And asking someone to rebind?  Bind points are treasures.  You stick your bind point somewhere hard to get to and you don't want to more that sucker for NOTHING.  Oh, to you it may be a few minutes, to the druid/wizard that has to reestablish that difficult to get to bind point, it might be a LONG dangerous run. <br>
<br>
A little self-sufficency goes a long ways in this game.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwysteriaplushfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wysteria Plushfoot</A> at: 6/25/01 10:22:50 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=272.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=269.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
