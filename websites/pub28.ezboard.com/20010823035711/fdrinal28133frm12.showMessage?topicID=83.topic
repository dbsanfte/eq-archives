This is the biggest flaw EZBoard has, they make posts and do many actions with the information after the ?. You can no longer make HTML with the '?' post on thier forums, but now it will work from anyplace else that doesn't care what HTML you use.<br>
<br>
 You'll notice that the form is filled out for you if you are logged in. (Name and password not required to be sent in the URL now.)  This is better for you.  <br>
<br>
It is pretty easy to make your post send your password to a 3rd website as well, people were doing that a long time ago. If you really want to be safe there is one thing you can do, put *.ezboard.com in your restricted domains.<br>
<br>
If you are worried about the image links thatmake you post then just tell your browser to not download pictures.  this way you can right click on the ones you want to see, and download them, you'll never see the ones that make you post, so you won't download them.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#939393>(1/13/01 8:25:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Before you click</span><hr size=1> Everyone should fully &quot;expect&quot; that someone could obtain a password from here not just through URL passing - I don't see any encryption on this web site. It is with that expectation they should choose passwords which are different from any other accounts they own...and then the worst case scenario is that someone gets it and posts under their identity. <br>
<br>
What bothers me is the 2 threads that bump to the top of the forum, and the potential alienation of good people using this board. If they don't understand why posts were made under their name, they may not return to post. We ultimately wind up with a board dominated by people who have ample time to sit around and obsess over ezboard flaws and exploiting them.<br>
<br>
I can think of larger, more mission critical systems which are worthy of obsessing over. This is merely supposed to be a community to discuss things. Exploiting this particular system is more of an act of social violation, destruction of community, than it is a technical accomplishment or crime.<br>

I simply stole the code from another post, turned it into what I wanted it to do, and posted it.  I did both late at night and drunk after a night out.  I was merely pointing out your 'solution' was inadequate, and potentially more dangerous.<br>
<br>
Those posts were never meant to get that big, I could not anticipate EZBoard would take a step back in security with their 'fix'.  In fact if my emails to EZBoard were answered satisfactorily it never would have happened at all, and I think it is pretty funny that their fix made the problem worse.  (albeit temporarily)<br>
<br>
Anyways before you give out security advice make you you undestand what it is you are talking about.<br>
<br>
I'm going to send a nice E-Mail to CKerr now, lets see what he has to say.  Charlz does little more then delete anything he sees, sweep it under the rug and it will go away eventually I guess.  NOT! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#939393>(1/13/01 11:56:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Wow</span><hr size=1> That reply would be a psychoanalysts dream ;-) You went from corrective to ownership, falsely accusatory, and then moved to inflated perceptions all in one lil paragraph.<br>
<br>
Again, I wasn't trying to solve the password problem. If you were trying to correct me you did not do so with sound and thorough technical advice on how passwords can be obtained off of ezboard eg. the numerous ways a plain text password can be retrieved off the wire, through trojans and other mechanisms. So with your infinate industry expertise in security why don't you prepare a more comprehensive list of password vulnerabilities on ezboard. <br>
<br>
You have simply demonstrated 1 of many methods, URL passing of variables to other forms on other servers. And if that were the isolated way that one could obtain passwords, it is an issue not of theirs but of industry protocol in general which should be taken up with larger organizations such as the W3 consortium, Microsoft, Netscape yadda yadda yadda. Particularly since you have pointed out the pass through has to now occur from other servers.<br>
<br>
The issue I have addressed, which has not been corrected by you, is the social ramifications of the bumped threads with derogatory text in this particular web based community. This isn't a security asessment..if EZboard seeks to invest further in enhancing their solution,  there are several consulting organizations they can call upon with more credentials than anonymous posts on their boards.<br>
<br>
The takeaways from this dwindling dialogue are:<br>
<br>
A. Log out of ezboard to prevent multiple bumps of those posts which have the scripts included. Click on the link on the top left side of your page called logout.<br>
<br>
B. Your password is unsafe and can be obtained through a variety of mechanisms including sniffing, trojans and URL passing so choose one which doesn't impact any of your other web accounts when using ezboard and levelset those expectations of security.<br>
<br>
I was advocating for topic A. and my friend Z here was advocating &quot;partially&quot; for topic B.<br>

Ridding ourselves of these little spam threads (One about Herbal and one titled &quot;.&quot;  )<br>

<br>
    &quot;Anyways before you give out security advice make sure you undestand what it is you are talking about.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are right, I am not thoroughly reading your posts, I started skimming your threads right after reading that. All information after that point became irrelevant.  I don't expect you to understand that..but at that point I made assumptions about you and your objectives in the thread.<br>
<br>
<br>
I never claimed to be a model for security advice in this threade, and I question your expertise since you are only focusing on &quot;one&quot; of the ways passwords can be obtained. In my little (or maybe not so little?) knowledge bank I can identify 3 ways to gather passwords from here. <br>
 <br>
<br>
When you make statements like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyways before you give out security advice make sure you undestand what it is you are talking about.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here is the reaction:<br>
<br>
Here is a thought. Have your company send you for CISSP certification, prepare a portfolio of services, fees, credentials and resume attach them to a proposal and send them in to EzBoard. This would benefit you, ezboard, and the community at large.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have now re-read your threads - giving you the benefit of the doubt..but I really just see a desire on your behalf to find ways to gear the conversation to be focused on ezboard and URL passing of variables or gameplay board security in general.<br>
<br>
Example: I made a post linking to a forum which has some positive content about Drinal players. You chose to take it back down this path of security features. <br>
<br>
I do have some interest in security and if you would like to dialogue about security some time - I'd love to in the proper forum and context. I do not play the &quot;I know more than you&quot;  techie  games though sorry, I've been in the industry too long and that tires me. <br>
<br>
I don't have an interest in Ezboard security (or the other gameplay board), sorry I just don't. There are a number of reasons why. Here are two but not all of them: <br>
<br>
A) They aren't even a competetor in the market I would look at for bullitan boards so I don't see them impacting my decisions. (e.g. Delivering to large enterprises)<br>
<br>
B) The content I put up here is related to gameplay not my bank account.  <br>
<br>
As for your other blanket statements, no I don't use a dictionary and if I did there wouldn't be as many mis-spellings. This is how I speak. <br>
<br>
Call what I say motherhood &amp; apple pie (or I think you call it senseless drivel) but some people seem to have forgotten the basics of ethical mature behavior which is clear in most of these forums.<br>
<br>
Hmm what other nasty things have you said - Oh yeah I make myself look bad.<br>
<br>
So have anything nice to say today?<br>
<br>
<br>
As for this statement:<br>
<br>
The issue I have addressed, which has not been corrected by you, is the social ramifications of the bumped threads with derogatory text in this particular web based community<br>
<br>
Let me rephrase:<br>
<br>
In my first posting I was referencing the thread titled &quot;.&quot; which had an annoying function to cause it to be bumped. After so many spams, hacks of the web boards, people stop visiting. The web discussion group (otherwise known as a web based community) is dominated by spam and bumped threads rather than meaningful information. The web based community then diminishes. This, I believe, is the objective of the people who post the spam scripts. This doesn't have to do with passwords or security. You responded with a commentary on security and my knowledge thereof. What I was explaining was I wasn't even thinking about security I was sick of the dang spam caused by the little shits who put the scripts in. Is that clear enough now? <br>
<br>
I am going to agree with you this conversation won't go far...so please don't persue it in other unrelated threads. <br>
 <br>
--Edit--<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, Zar, delete your cookies cache -hmm are we authenticated? You are authenticated off information stored on the client every time you come to the web, which means it is hackable.  It can be hacked either by remaining logged in or by manually entering password.<br>
<br>
