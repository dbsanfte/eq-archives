Reports indicate both girls were unharmed. <br> <br>The suspect, Roy Ratliff (pictured left), was shot and is dead, according to Assistant Sheriff Larry Waldie of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The shooting occurred about 1 p.m. Thursday. Ratliff was being sought by authorities for a rape charge, according to Waldi. <br><br>The Kern County Sheriff's Department confirmed by phone that authorities stopped the Ford Bronco and that the kidnapped girls are safe, Waldie said. <br><br>The Kern County Sheriff's Department attempted to stop the vehicle, but the driver would not stop, according to Waldie. Authorities pursued the vehicle for a short time until it crashed. The suspect fled the vehicle leaving behind the two teens. Officers made certain the teens were secure then pursued the suspect on foot. The suspect had a gun and was killed at the scene, he said. <br><br>Waldie said that the Sheriff's Department is flying both sets of parents to meet their daughters. <br><br>According to Waldie, there were two sightings of the Bronco. One sighting involved Cal Trans workers who believe they saw the truck as it was headed North, he said. Waldie did not provide additional information on the other sighting. <br><br>Waldie lauded the Amber Alert and many law enforcement agencies for helping in the investigation. &quot;We shut down all we were doing to save two lives,&quot; he said. <br><br>The parents of the two teens expressed gratitude when they were told their daughters were found. <br><br>Herb Marris, Jacqueline Marris' father said, &quot;We had a lot of support back here. I didn't lose faith in these guys.&quot; He also said, &quot;I can't wait to see her, I love her so much. If you're watching this honey , I love you, I can't wait for you to get home.&quot; <br><br>When asked by reporters about future plans for his daughter's safety Herb Marris showed he hadn't lost his sense of humor. &quot;We're going to have a little lowjack for her&quot; he said. He also said Marris won't be allowed to go beyond a &quot;five mile radius&quot; and she'll have to &quot;be home by 8:00&quot;. <br><br>Sammie J. Brooks, Brooks' father said, &quot;If it wasn't for the media, it wouldn't have worked. I think I couldn't be a happier man right now and I hope I never, or any of you, have to go thru something like this.&quot; He added &quot;Tamara's a very strong willed person. It's going to take her awhile, but I think she'll recover from this. It's in her genetic code.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I'm just happy that she's okay and that she's not harmed in any way,&quot; said Martin Brooks, Tamara Brooks' brother. <br><br>The teens were kidnapped at gunpoint at approximately 2 a.m. Thursday and taken away in a vehicle that belonged to one of the victim's friends, authorities said. <br><br> Authorities said Brooks and Marris were sitting in separate cars with two male friends when they were approached by a man. <br><br>The suspect first forced Brooks out of a white 1980 Ford Bronco that belonged to her companion, Eric Joshua Brown, 18. He then approached a black pickup truck occupied by Marris and her companion, Frank Melero Jr., whose age was not immediately available. The man took the Bronco and fled with the girls. <br><br>The man, described as a Hispanic in his mid-30s to early 40s, sped away in the white Ford Bronco with a blue-grey camper shell with both girls inside, said a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's department. <br><br>The girls apparently did not know each other or their abductor according to Sgt. Joe Efflandt of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. <br><br> <br><br>&quot;He told me he was going to kill me but he didn't want to,&quot; Brown told NBC4. The teen, who had duct tape on his arms and legs, said he was blindfolded and tied to a post while the kidnapper took away his female friend. &quot;He just kept telling her to stay down, keep her head down, don't look at him.&quot; <br><br>Sheriff's investigators said the man poured gasoline over a Saturn, apparently trying to torch it, but was unsuccessful. The Saturn was reported stolen in a carjacking in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 18. <br><br><br>The remote area where the kidnapping occurred is a place frequented by young people, Capt. Tom Pigott said. Investigators indicated to NBC4 that it is unlikely that someone from outside the area would find the remote spot without knowing about it in advance. <br><br>Sheriff's deputies received assistance from the FBI, CHP, and the Border Patrol during the investiation. <br><br><br>Five helicopters and three fixed wing planes were used to search for the girls. <br><br>As word of the kidnapping got out, friends of the girls flocked to the scene of the incident. <br><br>Herb Marris, Marris' father, pleaded with his daughter's kidnapper, &quot;Just let her go. She's a beautiful girl. Just let her go.&quot; <br><br>A group of Brooks' friends started a phone chain to ask for prayers for the missing girl. <br><br>A friend of Brooks said she was going to be a junior at Antelope Valley High School this fall and had high grades. <br><br>&quot;She's so smart, she's strong. She had everything going for her. She could go anywhere she wanted,&quot; said Desiree Lemos, 16. &quot;She's just the sweetest person. Everybody she met, they became friends.&quot; <br><br>Marris, a cheerleader and dancer, was described by a friend and classmate at Highland High School in Palmdale as a &quot;fighter.&quot; <br><br>&quot;She doesn't let anyone mess with her,&quot; said Robin Zimmer, 17. <br><br>Sheriff's deputies used the &quot;Amber Alert&quot; system, which uses radio and television bulletins to announce that a child may have been abducted. The plan is named for Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old who in 1996 was kidnapped and later found dead in Arlington, Texas. The system also uses freeway signs to alert the public to missing children situations. <br><br>Lancaster is 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles. <br> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujukax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jukax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 8:13:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1083.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /stupid guy who took teens in CA then got his ass shot o</span><hr size=1> Good for the cops.
