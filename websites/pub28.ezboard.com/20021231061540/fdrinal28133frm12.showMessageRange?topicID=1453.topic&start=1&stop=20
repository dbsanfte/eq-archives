<br>
The joke about getting in the oven is just something that is said a lot within my school's doors, because we have a little Jewish population, and they even find it funny and say it sometimes, just because it sounds funny when you speak it when someone says something totally stupid or when you're mad at someone. So, I have nothing wrong with Jews, and I even have a few Jewish friends, I should have probably thought that most of you would take it too hard or think something totally odd like that I'm serious about killing some of the coolest people in an oven.<br>
<br>
Okay, and I'm sorry to start anot-- Wait, I haven't started a post in a while about this, but you guys turn everything onto the fact that I'm gay and so therefore I have to hate on everyone or that I'm evil because I'm gay.<br>
<br>
Now... I ONLY said the stuff about sex with people to throw you guys off your rocker. You said that you would react the same to someone posting something about sex, whether it be straight or gay, since you know, all of you men AND women seem to love lesbians (To the Ladies- please note: since the guys on this forum said that you all like lesbians also, I'm using that as a sarcastic comment.). Well, then someone posted about doing it &quot;doggie-style&quot; with a woman, and he was a man. what did the general populous of the boards do? They either just ignored it or posted something like &quot;HAHA! I R DEW IT WTH MY HAWT AZZ TROLL BACKWARZ!!! HAHA I R KEWL!&quot; which, generally, just makes you sound even more retarded. I enjoy the fact that this makes a lot of you hypocrits, and just so you know, I'm not flaming EVERYBODY here, I'm flaming the people who has said this stuff, or the people who reacted to both things totally differently (bad to mine and laugh/post how funny it is to the doggie style stuff)<br>
<br>
I thoroughly enjoy that.<br>
<br>
And then, we have the whole fact that everyone talks about homosexuality like they know what it is.<br>
<br>
Well, I have news for you, you don't.<br>

This is going to span a lot of posts that happen to be on this topic, look for your name somewhere, as it MIGHT be here.<br>

<br>
Yes. It's a disease. (please note: this would be said to your face with sarcasm like no other) I could walk up to you, and cough or sneeze on you, and all of a sudden, you would be gay. Nothing could stop you from being gay, as it would infect every single cell of your body. From hair folicles to blood cells to skin cells... you get the point. All of it would instantly become homosexual and have urges to be fucked up the ass or to suck on &quot;a_random_dude_01&quot;'s huge fleshy penis. there is no medication currently available for this disease that 11% of the world's population is infected with... and since this IS a disease, the percentage is growing exponentially throughout the world. This disease will have all of you infected within the next few months. Please, wear a mask and let nobody you know (fmaily/friends/animals, etc) enter or leave your house. You are all fucked now, and will be gay soon. *begins evil laughter and the lightening/thunder that just went off in the background as he stands over his cauldron* <br>

Our teacher is very interesting and will talk to us about anything, and somehow we got to the topic of sex. She was explaining how sexuality wasn't even a thing then, that they would have orgies and be bareback and just have sex with anyone, since STD's were basically nonexistant, and if they were, they didn't detect them.<br>
<br>
Sex back then was for pleasure, it has always been for pleasure, and it will ALWAYS be for pleasure, nobody has sex for the sole purpose of procreation. <br>

<br>
You'll find homosexual behaviors in pretty much every mammal species there is. Check out how Bonobo's like to spend their time together. A swinginger bunch of chimps there never was. They aren't particularly choosy about the gender of their playmates. They make humans look like a boat load of puritans. Birds do too.<br>
<br>
So, there's nothing outside of nature in homosexuality. Leave it to humans to turn it into something to persecute others about. Leave Briyan alone and he'll stop trying to shock everyone with his explicitly sexual comments.

 p.s. All Bryian was doing with his question was showing homophobes and heterosexuals the same kinds of questions he has to answer as a homosexual in society. If homosexuals are always made to answer questions like that, then heterosexuals should aks themselves the same questions. There's nothing &quot;stereotypical&quot; about it unless you look at the fact that gays are asked those types of questions every day for no reason then their sexual preference. Since some heterosexuals think they are just the norm, they think they shouldn't be asking themselves those questions, which is not only wrong, but also stereotypical within it's self. <br>

Arrora is right, all of you have said shit and accused gays of doing all of this morally wrong bullshit, yet, nobody will even attmpt to answer my questions? Hello, hypocrit. Welcome to the REAL WORLD. I mean, &quot;Yeah, all serial killers are gay and we're beaten as children&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh. No.<br>
<br>
A. Any serial killer is fucked up in the head.<br>
B. Probably has problems at home.<br>
C. Not all serial killers are gay, in fact, most are heterosexual.<br>
<br>
And all this bullshit about straight people talking about how gay people are gay because of their environment growing up. Hi, welcome to reality. I'm gay so therefore I have a story to tell.<br>
<br>
My family has raised three children, a 26 year old, a 19 year old, and me. We were raised in a very VERY masculine environment. &quot;Play sports, get a girl, do good, don't fuck up.&quot; Just so happens both of my brothers are straight. Oldest played football, ran track, all that stuff, and fucked up his life by breaking his kneecaps and his legs around his knees when he was tackled once. Middle brother was like &quot;Oh shit!&quot; and so he only played Tennis, and Ran, and all that stuff. He pulled a tendon in his knee and fucked up part of his upper body. Me? I don't like getting hurt that much, so I played baseball and ran track when I was little, and now I just swim, but not athletically, just for fun and stuff, was on swim team last year but taking a break this year. My father always told my middle brother and I how stupid and worthless we are because we didnt play football and all of that shit.<br>
<br>
I grew up in a pretty normal household. I knew I liked guys since I was probably, eh, about 6 or 7. If I could be straight I would, but I guess that I wasn't designed to be straight. Oh GOD NO. Just means that I don't have to put up with whiny little bitch kids, and I realize now that I hate them because I don't want to get a nasty little bitch like a lot of you people.<br>

These guys talk about stereotyping and mass murderess. Lets see if this name comes to mind........<br>
Adolph Hitler.<br>
I watched a documentary on it late one night on HBO and Hitler took homosexuals put them in concentration camps persecuted them and killed them. Out of over 100,000 men you know how many were alive to tell their story?<br>
6 <br>
These were men from his army.  Just regular guys who loved each other and enjoyed each other. <br>

Your telling that a 2 year old knows the difference between being gay and straigt.  that an controlled environment will changed that fact.  Well you are wrong.  This childs parents did everything in thier power to stop what they foresee happening to their son.  I've never seen an 4 year old know ever make, year and name of every car.  They put him in sports and he would have nothing to do with it.<br>
They cramed everything down his throat to make him more * masculine*  and it didn't work.  Now he is 9 other kids are starting to notice that there is something different about him.  My son noticed when he was 7, came up with his on conclusion (tommy ) is gay. Yes he know's what it means.<br>
<br>
I don't care what anyone says about gay's because i know for a fact by watching this child grow up that they are born this way and there is nothing you can do to change that fact.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uteauvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teauvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Whiny<s>, spoiled</s> brat.</span><br>  Posts: 605<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/02 7:20:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *ahem* Well, well, well...</span><hr size=1> fuck you nazi, you would have been next to the jews in auschwitz getting butchered. <p>~~Teauvian~~<BR>

If it were truely genetic you would see an equal distribution of gays in all socioeconomic areas of society which I really don't think you do.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes a person may, however, have genetic tendences which are accentuated or suppressed by environment.  The only way genetics factor into homosexuality is that a person may lack a genetic tendency towards sports or other parts of our culture that are considered &quot;masculine.&quot;  This combines with environmental pressures (often other people who may not like sports coming together and rebelling so to speak against societal standards) to create a gay lifestyle.  Often times as far as environment goes, a person may not receive enough attention from their parents or be the &quot;middle child,&quot; and by rebelling against societal standards they try to get attention from their parents or others.<br>
<br>
That said, Briyan do what you want in your life but don't press your lifestyle on us as &quot;genetic&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; because it isn't either, and frankly its about time for you shut up and stop begging for attention.<br>

<br>
First of all, the information you gave totally supports the environment theory.  You had older brothers who were competent athletes.  If I had to guess, they were very successful in sports and got a lot of attention from your parents and family who attended their games and cheered them on.  You on the other hand did not finds sports as interesting and did not receive the same attention.  This is perhaps because you weren't as skilled as your older brothers or simply because you did not like sports for whatever reasons.  Your parents and brothers probably pushed you to play more sports, which you resisted and associated yourself more with other men who didn't enjoy sports or &quot;masculine&quot; activities.  You hung out with these guys or learned more about the gay lifestyle in other ways.  You felt perhaps like you couldn't really attract women (perhaps correctly, perhaps not) because they were more attracted to the guys on the football team or people like your brothers who are in to masculine activities.  You then rationalized the gay lifestyle to yourself as &quot;alternate&quot; and that you were genetically different from the start.  You felt that a gay lifestyle would be a way of showing to your parents and brothers that you were different and unique and in that way acquire the attention of your parents.<br>
<br>
Obviously I don't know you so I might be totally wrong, but if I had to guess I'd say I guessed pretty correctly with the above paragraph.  You had a choice over your lifestyle to the same extent all of us have control over our lifestyles.  We are all influenced by our genetic inheritances and our environments (when I say environment I don't just mean what family you were brought up in like you do in your post.  Environment can be where in the family you are, what societies standards are, what you are exposed to, who associates with you, and the list goes on and on).<br>
<br>
Briyan the fact that you need to make all these posts in the first place, and, as you said, keep posting simply because of the shock factor and people's responses to it, shows me beyond all else that you are attention starved and crave the attention (whether positive or negative) your lifestyle gives you.  If this weren't true, you wouldn't have even mentioned your lifestyle on these boards in the first place (since no one would have known or cared if you were gay or straight if you hadn't mentioned it).  I'd be quite happy if you proved me wrong by shutting the hell up.  Like it or not, &quot;normal&quot; has always been defined by society's perceptions, and the gay lifestyle is not &quot;normal&quot; in the society in which we live, get over it.  You posting here 500 times won't change that, so do the rest of us a favor and stuff it.<br>

If you are offended well then get over it. We tell people who complain about sexual remarks and references on sigs or peoples post the same thing. But just because he’s gay it takes a different light. He is not putting a gun to your head saying “hey be gay or else!”<br>
<br>
The day gay couples wander into your house and start having sex on your coffee table you can talk about it bothering you. But what people do in the privacy of their own bedroom is their business. Not like the gay community is banging on your door telling you to stop smeggin your wife that its offensive to them.<br>
<br>
Granted Bry wanted to get some shock value out of his posts. But who here hasn’t done the same thing. GO bry for being open with who you are and leading a happy life. <br>

Every time you find a man attractive do YOU think about having sex with him? Or do you just have a natural feeling of attraction to him without even considering sex? Personally when I see a good looking guy I don't think about jumping his bones lol.<br>
<br>
Children do know when a boy/girl is cute to them. I had my first kiss in kindergarten and I know a lot of little kids that run around saying, "so and so is my boyfriend/girlfriend." It is possible that a child does know who he/she feels attracted to even at such a young age. It is also really obvious when you feel awkward because the way you feel and the things you do don't go along with the "norm" in society. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uteauvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teauvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Whiny<s>, spoiled</s> brat.</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/02 3:48:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i agree with synide <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>aka Raisst Ritter</span><br>  Posts: 2021<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/02 7:03:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1453.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/dancfrog.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Callandra, he doesn't sound very happy to me, actually. <br>

Threads should be short, and to the point.  Not long and drawn out.  Somebody summarize WTF he said. <p><center>
