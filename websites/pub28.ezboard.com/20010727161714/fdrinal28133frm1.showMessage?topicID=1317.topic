<br>
Let's look at some realistic numbers:<br>
<br>
A 5khp warrior tanks a 10khp mob, and is grouped with a 2.5khp cleric.  Say the mob deals 5k points of damage every minute, and the warrior deals 2k points of damage every minute.  <br>
<br>
This implies the battle will take 5 minutes.  Not too improbable.  <br>
<br>
The cleric has to heal the warrior for 5k points of damage every minute.  That's 25k of aggro. <br>
<br>
When the mob dies, the warrior has done 10k of damage.  This means he's gained 10k of hate points from melee.<br>
<br>
That's 10k vs 25k.<br>
<br>
That ain't tauntin no mob off no one.<br>
<br>
Let's expand on this:<br>
<br>
end of 1st minute:  cleric gets 5k hate (from healing), war does 2k damage.  Total at end: cleric 5k hate, war 2k hate<br>
<br>
The cleric now has to heal himself (2500 hp's for the cleric, cause he's decked out with buffs and all).  He now has to cheal himself twice every minute to stay alive (remember, mob deals 5k damage)<br>
<br>
end of 2nd minute:  cleric gets 5k hate, war does 2k damage.  Total at end: cleric 10k hate, war 4k hate<br>
<br>
Cleric has to heal himself again!<br>
<br>
end of 3rd minute: cleric gets 5k hate, war does 2k damage.  Total at end: cleric 15k hate, war 6k hate<br>
<br>
Cleric has to heal himself again!<br>
<br>
end of 4th minute: cleric gets 5k hate, war does 2k damage.  Total at end: cleric 20k hate, war 8k hate<br>
<br>
Cleric has to heal himself again!<br>
<br>
end of 5th minute: cleric gets 5k hate, war does 2k damage. Total at end: cleric 25k hate, war 10k hate.  Mob finally dies.<br>
<br>
It is **MATHEMATICALLY** IMPOSSIBLE TO TAUNT OFF THE CLERIC IN THIS SITUATION before the mob dies.  Not 'well, maybe you can if you're good,' not 'but if the warrior taunts...'  No, it's mathematically impossible.  Let me explain where taunt comes in:<br>
<br>
Warrior has to do 15k hate points worth of taunting outside of melee *just to break even*<br>
Last time I checked, no class can do 15k hate points worth of taunting (note this is beyond melee, which I've considered above) in 5 minutes, especially against the HIGH LEVEL mobs that ignore taunt.<br>
<br>
Ok, one more thing to take into account:  that's 11 cheals our uber_cleric01 has casted in this fight.  Any clerics out there have that much mana?  I don't know the casting cost of cheal, but I do know that high-lvl clerics have somewhere in the 2000-3000 mana range available.  I'm going to say that uber_cleric01 has 3300 mana to blow per fight.  He'll be able to stay alive if cheals cost less than 300 mana. Otherwise he's toast.<br>
<br>
We'll have to call clerics Kamikazes now.<br>
<br>
btw, I know the hp's on this mob we're dealing with is kinda low, but it just compounds the problem with higher hitpoints, because it adds up.  <br>
<br>
Btw, if you see uber_cleric01 or less_than_l33t_warrior59 in-game, let me know.  They owe me money.<br>

<br>
Say you have rogue doing 3-5k dmg per minute, and SK taunting doing some dmg, add another rogue, add a shaman for slow.  You have an easy battle, but now when you put that against a huge khp mob, say 100khp.. you're fucked.  Unless you have a ton of sk's taunting and... a warrior w/ a ton of ac/hp that can wait long for his heals so the taunt kicks in.. this isn't going to effect mobs w/ 10khp unless it's a cleric/warrior solo'ing.  But anyway verant f'd it up, a clerics job isn't to taunt, why make it that way, or try to make it for them..  it's not balance it just pisses ppl off.  They think this game is centered around the 6 man group.  It isn't.  It's even more a game of killing the mob as fast as you can.. which is really fucking hard when they got 100khp +.  wtg verant ^^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukalanapowa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalana Powa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#993300>(2/22/01 10:15:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ah, patch shows it different...</span><hr size=1> The latest patch shows that the most aggro (hate) a cleric will get for a single CHeal is 800pts, not the total points of the heal, so it should be possible to taunt off cleric.<br>

Everyone knows that big raids are already fucked.  I'm thinking about the group setting.<br>
<br>
Let's say the puller pulls 3 mobs, and the enchanter mezzes them.  For every cheal that the cleric drops on the warrior, those 2 extra mezzed mobs are tacking on hate points from the cleric each kill.  With the numbers above, that's 15000 hate points that the cleric has on each of those mobs before they've even broken mez.<br>
<br>
With the 2k cap, and each fight taking 5 minutes, that's 10k points of hate that the cleric has on the 2 mezzed mobs when the first mob dies.<br>
<br>
Through pure melee alone, all the warrior can ever hope to do is break even on the 2nd mob.  Why? because it only has 10k hitpoints (see the scenario).  At the end of that fight, the last mob has 20k of hp's from the cleric, which means that the best the warrior can hope to do is have 10k hate points less than the cleric (by pure melee).  <br>
<br>
Now, throw in the random variables of a real-eq situation and the numbers become better or worse.  Either way, compare the present-day situation with that of last week.<br>
<br>
<br>
The game mechanics are truly fucked.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;now against velketor at 4x850 some new strategies will be required, but there is always 2 invuls to fall back on, tanks should be able to regain aggro in 18 secs against these uber mobs. &quot;<br>
<br>
In 10 seconds (not to mention 18) the tanks will be dead.<br>
These new strategies...I'll have no part of bind/rez-rushes<br>

It used to be that when I would mez and tanks break the mez the frogs get on me. <br>
<br>
Mem blur stinks especially on things like seb mobs - It's like it is resisted or never works but doesn't give you anything but a positive message (xxx mob blinks)...might be nice if verant instead of nerfing everything changed mem blur to generate an error message when it didn't really wipe their hate list. I use it but if tanks require WW and no shaman is there so I am casting slow if I have to rationalize out a spell gem it's usually the first to go. <br>
<br>
If a tank brings in 4 mobs and I can't target them I may cast fascinate, root the mobs (which seems to work more than mem blur), then as mez breaks try to remez. Well it doesn't always work a frog may get on me, so I will flux then remez mob. Easy for me....until this change.<br>
<br>
Now when mez breaks in any situation - if the cleric healed during the time they were mezzed - mob gets on cleric instead of me if root or mez breaks. Not too bad really for enchanter - now enchanter just remez while mob is on cleric - and the remez doesn't require a flux and isn't interrupted. Stinks for cleric though...but I would say it isn't all that bad....but one huge exception. If the mob resists the mez it still isn't off cleric - and the resist (which used to be a nice taunt) now doesn't wipe their hate list enough to get the off the cleric. <br>
<br>
So the change in places like seb is survivable - not terrific but manageable.<br>
<br>
I think the biggest concern would be when dealing with dragons and bigger mobs (or those totally MR melee type mobs where enchanters are useless for anything but tash &amp; rune which also gets us killed). Getting those mobs off cleric will be complicated.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualdalormcvane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldalor McVane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#993300>(2/24/01 9:37:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hate/heal, mathema. impossible to taunt off cleric</span><hr size=1> Some comments...<br>

Memory Blur is not supposed to wipe the hate list everytime.  It is designed to lower you on the hate list, not remove you from it.  I am a 55 Enchanter and I've used Memory Blur ever since I&quot;ve had it.  I see many different situations arise with this spell that support my statement.  <br>
<br>
Situation One:  Mob on me.  I cast Mem Blur and the mob totally ignores me from this point on.<br>
<br>
Situation Two:  Mob on me.  I cast Mem Blur and the mob switches to someone else, but comes back after me if I sit.  This is repeated until I blur again.<br>
<br>
Situation Three:  Mob on me.  I cast Mem Blur and the mob switches to someone  else, but comes after me a few times when I try to sit, but ignores me once a bit of damage is dealt.<br>
<br>
Situation Four:  Mob on me.  I cast Mem blur and nothing happens.<br>

All of this is because your &quot;hate&quot; is reduced, but you are never at the same # or spot in the hate list.  Thus, the degree the mob forgets you is different.  This can also be seen in that if a person zones a mob and I do not fight it, the mob comes for me.  If I blur the mob he almost always forgets me.  On occassions he doesn't, but as a mob that only has little hate for me (since I didn't fight it or do anything), he usually goes away.<br>
<br>
There are lots of other situations but I can't recall them all.  Why am I telling you this?  One, to reply to a comment, but two to help clerics.  Last night in VX (Several hours) our cleric only died once to the new aggro.  ONCE!  All other times we were able to taunt off, root off, blur off, or some manner to get the mob off the cleric.  Our puller was pulling trains in most instances too.<br>
<br>
Nothing is ruined.  We killed Silverwing in Veeshan's peak last night.  IB Killed Trakanon.  Things may be more difficult now, even more difficult than Verant intended, but nothing is ruined except in those people's minds who insist on taking every change VI makes as bad.<br>

Scenario 4 seems to happen more frequently in some areas...so if I have to rationalize my spells it varies on location (particurly when slowing and low on spell gems). <br>

I don't know about the larger mobs - don't encounter them much these days ;-) Never been part of the in crowd *shrug* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 2/24/01 10:04:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrigem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trigem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(2/24/01 9:55:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hate/heal, mathema. impossible to taunt off cleric</span><hr size=1> I find it funny that on almost every board clerics find fault in this new ability to control agro.
