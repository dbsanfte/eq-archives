people say hey its a cih thing and you go posting it here for all of us cih to see<br>
<br>
UM THIS IS NOT THE CIH BOARD<br>
<br>
CIH has there own dam board. SO comeing here i guess your stickign YOUR NOSE in our buisnes<br>
<br>
this is the DRINAL board put up by TUNARIANS<br>
<br>
i posted it here because the TUNARIANS &lt;say that slowly boys and girls&gt; are voting on appoints system and I wanted to voice my opinion on points and that was the best example I have seen yet of why I disagree with them.<br>
<br>
OK no names were mentioned till some fathead &lt; hehe insert your flame response here &gt; came and mentioned her name. <br>
<br>
No insults or insinuations were made at all i even said if that's how you run your raids and it works for you and your guild likes it more power to you. <br>
<br>
Now when i want to i can type and spell just fine but usually on the boards i just rant and rave and don't even watch for any mistakes. <br>
<br>
Why ? cause what a bunch of pixel people in a video game think about my typing means nothing to me. <br>
<br>
When a subject means ALOT to me you will see a perfect post belive me cause the typos are just to irresistible to flame trollers and idiots who think that is a good reason to invalidate somones ideas.<br>
<br>
for the record <br>
i graduated college i have a degree<br>
i own my own small business, and im currently Microsoft MCSE certified<br>
<br>
Does that make me a genius no does that make me stupid NO <br>
I think it clearly shows I have a life though. <br>

<br>
A lvl 54 driud (Who is a secondary of a Lvl 50 something ranger) was able to use points accumulated by the lvl 50 something ranger to buy a druid bp off trakanon.<br>
<br>
Filtering all of the flames and just looking at statements by CiH members, the way things happened was that:<br>
<br>
A lvl 54 druid who used to play a  ranger to lvl 50-something used points accumulated by the lvl 54 druid to buy the druid bp off trakanon.<br>

Wrong,this is a drinal board only.He doesnt matter how long you played on Tunare,your no longer a TUNARIAN,your a DRINAIN now,accept it.<br>

<br>
thogg had a valid point. even if that was not the case in this instance. his point as you stated Tsai is this.<br>
<br>
if I had 2 chars<br>
<br>
Char A a warrior<br>
and <br>
Char B a necro <br>
<br>
and i played both in the planes lets say<br>
<br>
char A had gotten 18 KKP or DP (drinal Points) or PP (puppy points) or what have you.<br>
<br>
and char B had earned 2 of these points.<br>
<br>
should i be able to use the points on Char A to purchase the drop on Mob xxxx  for char A even though i came to this raid with Char B. and an essance give additional competition to or possably even take an item away from someone whos only char is a warrior who was on the raid with us.<br>
<br>
what this really comes down to is this.<br>
<br>
Do you look at the Points from a Charicter Perspective or a PLayer Prospective.<br>
<br>
If you do it from a char Perspective then you would ahve to say that no My necro only had 2 points and could not buy said item off said mob.<br>
<br>
if you look at it from a player perspective then you would say Ah that player has 18 points on this char and 2 on that for a total of 20. <br>
<br>
that is really what it comes down to.<br>
<br>
Personal opinion is this who ever leads the raid decides Loot division. and who ever uses points more power to them and who ever uses randoms more power to them.<br>
<br>
I did read CiH KKP procedures. they seemed at least to me very fair. however i think the real deciding factor would be how many loot fights they have or had back on Mith Marr vs how many times we saw loot fights on Tunare. Lord knows we had some doozies. i had more fun reading those fights than i did playing the game sometimes.<br>
<br>
Of course that might not be a real deciding factor. lets face it they came here to escape from &lt;Afterlife&gt;. I think Many peoples fear is that they will turn into an afterlife here on Drinal. at least that is what i gather.<br>
<br>
I dont know if i will ever get to te planes or even dragon raids Highest level char i ever had was Leetah at 37. so i think most of this will be academic for me. but you never know. <br>
<br>
However i will say this i am amazed at thogg putting an opinion out against doing a point system and him getting flamed so bad. truth is he never metioned names. But I can see the CiH side of it. i can see how they might feel it was an attack against them and against their system. well maybe it was attack against their system. but it does bring up a very good and fundimental point. and one that would need to be answered by anyone wishing to adopt such a system.<br>
<br>
It also brings up 1 more point now that i think about it.<br>
<br>
could i have points on char A go on  raid and buy the Loot off of Mob xxx for my 5th lvl twink? because if you do this by the player then that should be allowed. if you do it by the char it should not.<br>
<br>
I am not sure how CiH handles this but they have the most experiance with it maybe they can give some insight to what they do. I only read their rules once and well been a while 8P<br>
<br>
Lastly Thogg you and i seldom agree. and this is no exception but i would like you to know even if maybe the wording or way you posted your opinion was not very good. i thought it brought up a very valid point.<br>
<br>
anyway hasta <p><img src="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~brandysj/lee.jpg"><br>

either way it was example of how peopel with two chars can double there points i got two acounts ok ill go to fear and hate at the same time i get two points for one days work. <br>

You also didnt mention names, but you mentioned levels, and there were only two druids at that raid...<br>
<br>
Fine, Thogg hates points, then dont belong to a guild that does points...easy, eh?<br>
<br>
The reason I am posting is this.  We are all Drinal people now, I dont give a flying frock if you came from Tunare or from MM.  You are NOW Drinal.  If your group of friends wants to emulate something from their old server, fine.  But for you to say that the Tunarians are deciding this, well you are COMPLETELY wrong there.  The guild that is looking into whether doing points or not, it is THEIR business.  Also, I happen to know that a few people are in that guild in question that didnt come from Tunare.  Its a Drinal Guild, and we are on Drinal now.  <br>
<br>
I could care less if you were hot crap on your old server, you need to earn that respect on the new server.  <br>

What is the problem? <br>

If you dont want to be part of a point system dont do it. seems pretty simple to me. If its not your system and it doesnt effect you why would you even care? <br>

The reason for this is the assumption that we have X RL people in the guild.  Whether you are playing character 1 or 2 on a raid, you as a RL person are still at the raid having fun.  Because of this, points are awarded to the player and not the character.  <br>
<br>
We try to evenly distribute god/dragon loot equally among all RL people, with a participation percentage factor thrown in.  You play a lot and go on a lot of guild raids you get points faster then the person that plays once in a while.  Yes this will benifit the "power gamers" more, but in our case, the intent is to make the guild as powerful on a whole as possible.  Having a god/dragon item sit unused on a character that is never played is useless to the guild.<br>
<br>
If you go on a raid and are successful in killing the major mob you are awarded a point (or fraction of a point).  What you do with this point is up to you.  You can spend it on ANY of your characters.  Once you spend it, it is gone for good.  Basically you have the choice of saving for a really nice item for your primary character (maybe a BP from trak) or getting an item for your twinks, but you CANT have both.  <br>
<br>
Now there is nothing wrong with giving points to individual characters.  CiH chose not to do it this way.  On a server wide system, I could see traking poins per character might make more sense since people arent as apt to ask you to not play character X and instead play Y.     <p>Lern Zumbruni <br>

Everybody in CiH immediately knows who you're talking about..... I could just as easily say &quot;Well, some level 60 troll who was second in the warrior tournament, plays on Drinal, is in Dark Shadows, and started this thread,  only has 8 toes, I'm not naming names though so it doesn't matter&quot; <br>
<br>
But thats not the point. I think people took that as an attack on our system. You said it sucks. So we defended it.  <p><img

we are not tunarians or Mith Marrians we are Dinalings? (what the heck is the plural for that?)<br>
<br>
again i think points systems are not bad and if done properly would work a hell of a lot better than the old tunare senority loot system.<br>
<br>
If there were some way to a server wide way of traccking these points and distribute the points based on char not player then that might make sense on a server wide bases.<br>
<br>
Ona  guild only bases i would do the same thing as the CiH. In the wolves we look at players not chars. if i make xxx an officer then the player is the officer not the char. no matter what char he playes he is an officer. it has always been that way.<br>
<br>
anyway.<br>

Thats nice thogg, I still think you should use a spell checker. Thogg, its hard to read your cartoon characters opinions.  <br>

<br>
if i were a warrior in thogg's guild i'd be pretty pissed off to get his leftovers, i'd welcome a change. <p>_____________________________<BR>
