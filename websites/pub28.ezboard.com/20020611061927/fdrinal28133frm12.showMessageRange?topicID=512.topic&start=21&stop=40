<br>
At least you’re consistent.  No matter what happens your favorite defense is to accuse someone else of doing what you did.<br>
<br>
I give you back a spoon of the same crap you’re trying to feed us and I’m suddenly nit picking.  Well, you’re right, I am.  But then that’s the point, isn’t it.<br>
<br>
Someone comes to this board complaining of KC’s behavior.  You, confident in your overwhelming skills at rhetoric, choose to champion your guild’s cause.  When a couple dozen people jump on the thread and condemn your actions, and your defense, you entertain us with an inane attempt at apology where you somehow manage to combine self-depreciation with moral superiority.  When that illicits little more then a few chuckles, you then attempt to deflect attention from yourself by writing an entire flame based on the fact that Narv used the word ‘again.’<br>
<br>
Do I need to post the definition of the word nit-pick as well?<br>
<br>
By the way, you’re closing was appropriate.  In tennis, whether you can’t quite manage an adequate effort to return the volley, or whether you stare at your opponent and say “I refuse to answer,” you still lose the serve. <br>

your two weeks membership of UGoD was a whole fourteen days longer than mine.  Amag/Narv never came on any of my raids.  He posted a couple of times on UGoD threads I was watching but, seeing as I was never a member of UGoD, I never really paid much attention to people who were not directly involved in my raids.<br>
<br>
You can say I used UGoD if you wish.  But then again, every Naggy/Vox leader before or since who claims an item for their epic can be accused of the same thing.  One thing is certain though.  There are four other bards out there with white scales, a warrior with a red (didn't have much of a chance to run too many Naggy raids but Vox was always free) and a whole host people with assorted bags, haste items, weapons etc who probably don't give a flying monkey's, as well as a butt load of people who had a whale of a time on what was their first encounter with an EQ dragon.<br>
<br>
Asanti,<br>
<br>
You were trying to fight fire with fire.  You got a little singed.  It seems that you couldn't keep up your previous pace you switched back rehashing a couple of points from another thread entirely.  Please, you were being quite amusing up until this point.  Take a break, gather your thoughts and come back to the table.  The game is too much fun to let slide so easily.<br>
<br>
Yes, I knew about the serve thingy when I posted.  It seemed a safer thing to use than my first thought of &quot;thirty fifteen&quot; as you'd probably respond with something about Game, Set and Match.  But, in the same way that I wasn;t about to draw parallels between your usage of a childish, playground game and your posts, I didn't think you'd reduce yourself to the level you just exhibited.  Come on, man.  You can do so much better!<br>

<br>
Ama, Narv and the other names the guy goes by, let me say that at one time he WAS a good guy and friend, so I thought. I stress that word WAS, because was, is, no more. Need I remind  people about the days of Souls of Eternity and how most of the leaders (Mostly the people who kissed his ass)there followed under Narv/Amadagu left the guild high and dry? How they stole items from the guilds bank claiming to have deleted their characters then returning months later trying to act as if nothing ever happened? I'll let these past actions speak for themselves and if people wish to call him a friend, be my guest. One word comes to my mind when I see his name mentioned, backstabber.  <br>
<br>
Just the facts, that's all I'm interesting in maam, just the facts...<br>

<br>
You're an idiot.  <br>
<br>
Narva, Khel (wife), and Tehros (son) were deleted and restored with basically nothing but their no-drop gear.  Yuriko (daughter) could not even be restored and had to level up from 1, she's back to nearly 50 again.  Their characters were all deleted, and because of how long they were deleted, anything you think they may have &quot;stolen&quot; from the old SoE guildbank, well, nobody except Verant will ever see any of that stuff again.  I'm sure if those items still existed, Narv would have done his best to share them with any members of old SoE who were still around and could use them.  That's just the kind of guy he is.<br>
<br>
Narv always told me you were an ass.  I didn't know you, I refrained from judgement.  I see his point now.  <br>

Get your putrescent backside onto this threa</span><hr size=1> Ahhh, well the answer to that one is simple, Asanti.  The topic in hand was yours but was posted on a thread which I started and was a repeat of an arc in a different thread entirely.  It is scarcely my fault if you decide to re-invent the Catherine Wheel but I personally do not feel like repeating myself for your benefit.  If you are so hell-bent on finding your responses go and read the previous thread which has already been linked to earlier in this one.  Just a word of advice.  Don't be so literal minded this time or else you won't be able to see the wood for the trees.<br>
<br>
This thread was created to air a greivance and it's purpose was specifically stated shortly after its creation.  It is between me and Narv/Amadagu.  If you wish to try to hijack it for your own amusement or the perceived amusement of others then that is your own affair.  Just don't expect me to play by your rules, no matter how much sycophantic back-patting everyone else might give you for your rather transparent efforts.  I'll play ball with the doggy only so far but you can fucking well lick your own arsehole.<br>

Oh Shadow, is that how you reallllly feel about me? I'm sorry I hate to say I won't be losing any sleep over your sterotype comments. Now, if I may I want to enlighten you both on some key elements you both left out of your arguments. Read up, and pay attention you two, you may just learn the basics of how an argument is conducted, and the thing you DO, and DO NOT do, in an argumental writing.<br>
<br>
The official steps in developing an Argumentive Paper/Writing<br>
<br>
1. Claims and Assertions: What is it about, where is it going? This I was asking myself when reading your replies, where are the facts at?<br>
<br>
2. Assumtions: Personal Beliefs and opinions. Oh you both broke this one, naughty, naughty!<br>
<br>
3. Evidence: They are provided in examples. Where's the beef? No wait, where's the evidence??<br>
<br>
4. Facts: Something that can be verified from a record, documentation, non biased source. Your sources are from a biased party, I however have unbiased facts, can you say the same?<br>
<br>
5. Statistics: These are numbers that represent facts. <br>
<br>
6. Opinions: A persons thoughts based off accurate facts. Wow you two really missed this one, huh?<br>
<br>
7. Beliefs: These cannot be argued, so SEKE and SHADOW how you FEEL about me is a BELIEF hence you both cannot make a valid argument from those, you have NO facts, just a belief.<br>
<br>
8. Predjudices: Opinions and beliefs that hold little or no truthful evidence, Again SEKE and SHADOW you have nothing more than hearsay on your side, where are the facts? Hence, another roadblock in your argument towards me.<br>
<br>
9. Examples: A point being made. Yup I am making an example out SEKE and SHADOW right now by showing you just how impropper you two are at an argument forum. <br>
<br>
10. Expert Opinion: Someone who is considered to be an expert of a subject or topic, this person also has verifiable proof and documentation of his or her expertice. This certainly would not be either SEKE or SHADOW since they based their arguments off one persons words, you two need to RESEARCH first before you come picking fights. Btw are you an acredited bullshiter Shadow, I see no other credentials from you.<br>
<br>
11. Appeals to readers needs or beliefs: This is when you try to convince someone to believe in or accept that they already believe or accept. Sort of like the fact that SEKE and SHADOW need to learn the 12 do's and don't of argumental writing. I just appealed to the needs and believes of people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
12. Argument: Should be RELIABLE *SEKE and SHADOW, take notes boys*, accurate, relevant, adequate, representative. In short before you come bitchin here, you best know what it is you're talking about.<br>
<br>
Other things to look for that go on the DO NOT do list;<br>
<br>
Fallacies;<br>
<br>
1. Evasion: Changing the argument or topic when your points not strong enough to go up against your opponent.<br>
<br>
2. Oversimplification: Saying something is far more simple than it really is. To also water down an argument with irrelevant information, a generalization.<br>
<br>
Things you MUST do in an argument that both SEKE and SHADOW failed in;<br>
<br>
1. Appropriate subjects: Subjects that everyone can agree on but can also be argued.<br>
<br>
<br>
Judging;<br>
<br>
1. Going beyond agreeing and disagreeing<br>
<br>
2. Evidence, is it true, relevant, and sufficient?<br>
<br>
3. Reasoning and Logic, to be a valid source, inductive, deductive and it has to make sense.<br>
<br>
4. Respond to the oppsition: In an argument you need to always know your opposition, and where it is they stand on topics. When they are finished you should always address each point they have brought up in a mature manner.<br>
<br>
So looking over all that I can clearly see the many &quot;FALLACIES&quot; you two commited. So please, next time you wish to engage in argument with me guys, at least know your RULES first, it's just the propper thing to do in adult communication. Anyime you wish to carry this debate or learn more by all means send me a tell in game, I'll be more than happy to enlighten your mind.<br>

I dont need to quote etc, not worth my time.  Your actions and histories speak volumes and as such I don't have to.<br>
<br>
Balrak, I knew you would take this opportunity and jump in, fair enough, lets tell the tale in full shall we?<br>
<br>
During the time of SoE I attempted to help alot of people, Althenax was one of them I spent days upon days helping.  Shortly after another guild was merged into SoE, we *the officers of SoE* were looking into new officers, My first choice was Althenax due to her dedication.  Then in retrospect I withdrew that recommendation because I was concerned with you using that position to enforce your thoughts and beliefs.  Something I was unwilling to do to the guild because of how belittling you were and still are.  I did not say this to althenax nor you because I felt it wasn't necessary to bring it up as she was unaware that she was even being considered.  After I took a break, I came back to find out that you/she were told that it was because we felt a person from the other guild would help cohension between the merging guilds.  Once you point blank asked me about this situation I told you directly what was going on.  You blew up, told me what a piece of shit backstabber I was, etc.  How Althenax deserved to be an officer etc etc.  Other incidents were brought into light... Aka her wanting to lead a naggy raid just to claim a cloak of flames.  I stated that I would not endorse any such raid or make it a guild event because it was the epitomy of greed.  Then there was the incident with sol b and her grouping with some people; someone was gone for 5 minutes and she wanted them booted instead of getting free exps. I felt that was rude and unjustified.  But then lets not forget me arguing with the GM ON YOURS and HER behalf about her losing her surname and Redline alledgely(sp) scamming her Rastor, or me sitting there for 2 days helping her with her recamp of rastor.  In the end she left after Sorshia said 'If you are going to be that way *see the incident with the group member being gone for 5 minutes* she would rather she did it without the SoE guildtag.  I attempted 5 times that night to talk to her with no response.  I tempted again and again over the next few days, still no responses.  Then finally when she does send me a tell, I explain the situation and then the next thing I know you are telling me I am harassing you.  Not once, but 15 times, so then  I /report the text, explain the situation to the GM and YOU were instructed to stop harrassing me.  If I was wrong on Althenax and her being an officer so be it, but you will at least speak the entire incident.<br>
<br>
What I stole from SoE?  Are you nuts?  99% of the stuff in soe to start was mine.  In fact your little paladin twink was running around in Narva's Deepwater armor that you didn't want to give back when I returned and I never asked again about, wasn't worth it.  All those spells, talk to Tarnaris, Kilrog and some of my other friends, they were gifts to me to use at as I pleased.  If it was for the guild, that was my choice.  When I did return, *mind you I GAVE ALL OF MY ORIGINAL STUFF TO THE GUILD, EVERYTHING!* Sorshia and Voices on my behalf, tried to recollect my gear, many avoided them like the plague and much gear wasn't returned.  That was just gear, wasn't worth issues.  *I will remind you that you were the first to say, 'Bud if you ever return, I will kick the ass out of the people that hem and haw about you getting your gear back.  You hear that all, THIS IS ALL AMA'S GEAR' funny how you were one of those that didn't want to return it *laughs*.  Lets not forget that all raids, all coffins, all stones for all events were funded from my personal bank account.  I heard about some blue diamond incident.  During some fear raid a blue diamond dropped and I kept it, yes.  Those that jetted out of fear as fast as they could didn't bother to even find out the situation about the stupid thing, and the census was for me to keep it for dieing so much during my pulling.<br>
<br>
If you want to flame me, flame.  Balrak your history speaks volumes about you as well.  I don't need to flame you, you do it yourself and need zero help. <p></head>

Seke you still have no case on your hands, sorry to dissapoint. Now onto my favorite topic, the one with Narv. You say lets lay our cards on the table, alrighty then.<br>
<br>
The night we met in fear many months ago was it not I who was the only one defending the raid you attended, in fact I was thanked by you and many others for coming and getting into CiHs face over the entire ordeal, in fact I believe it was I who brought all the heat on CiH by people I knew who contacted their officers and flamed them for their actions, which in turn ended that standoff. Now lets move from there shall we. Lets analyze this bit by bit shall we.....<br>
<br>
Narva said<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> uring the time of SoE I attempted to help alot of people. <br>
Now if this were true why on a nightly basis did I recieve complaints about you FAVORING other players? In fact I addressed you up front about the concerns players were sending to me. As I remember you blew that off as if it were nothing, obviously it was a little more than that or SoE would still be around now wouldn't they?<br>
<br>
Narv said; Althenax was one of them I spent days upon days helping. <br>
<br>
I'll agree you did only because I was on your cases to help her afterall she busted her buns helping you MANY MANY times and your family and other members. As I see it, you scratch my back I scratch yours is how it works. So that cancels out.<br>
<br>
Narv said: Then in retrospect I withdrew that recommendation because I was concerned with you using that position to enforce your thoughts and beliefs.<br>
<br>
Yes you did because you were not MAN enough to keep the fight between us, you had to be coward and hold it against my dearest friend in the world. THAT was unjust and uncalled for and only a coward resorts to such action. May I ALSO remind you of the tells you sent her giving her a hard time.<br>
<br>
Narva said: Once you point blank asked me about this situation I told you directly what was going on. You blew up, told me what a piece of shit backstabber I was, etc. <br>
<br>
I would like to add to that I did not only say a backstabber but only a fucking coward would act in such a manner and hold something against another person who had NOTHING to do with anything. You talk about just, you tell me where that's a justice? Only a backstabber acts in such a manner, that  I said and that I hold to because that's the truth.<br>
<br>
Narv said: her wanting to lead a naggy raid just to claim a cloak of flames<br>
<br>
At the time she was fairly new to naggy raids and the ones she attended the leader was claiming dibs on such loots, so tell me how is a person to know when they were not aware this really isn't how its done. As I said the prior 4 raids she was on I believe that's how they did it and as I remember her asking me about this I told her that's not how it's done and she insisted she didn't think it was fair but she didn't know THAT&quot;S why she asked for peoples thoughts in guildchat, instantly you and some other bastards began flaming her, I saw the tells she was getting. Don't talk to me about your being nice, your so two faced it's not even funny. Get your facts right Narva again I had her log the rest of the tells and conversations. Which leads on...<br>
<br>
Narv said:Then there was the incident with sol b and her grouping with some people; someone was gone for 5 minutes and she wanted them booted instead of getting free exps.<br>
<br>
This I believe happened that day to, I remember by a friend who was IN her group he told me that they had some punk cleric come up and then said brb and after 15 minutes of being AFK with two druids doing all the healing there her group began sending her tells saying boot that cleric. So with growing pressure by the group she asked you all in guildchat what you would do. Instantly you and some other stupid ass officer began giving her shit calling her names, sawing how unworthy she was, again you want the logs, I got'em! I again read the tells you boys in SOE were sending her, the threats, the harrassment, that's when she decided she was being mistreated and rightfully so she left SoE shortly after that. So you're telling me that if you have a guy who keeps going afk in 15 minute stretches that it's OK to keep them in a group? Narava you again are such a hypocrite, I've seen the way you are on raids, you boot people for the same reasons then you go criticizing my lady for doing what you did any other time? Don't go there boy, you really don't want to go there.<br>
<br>
Narv said:I felt that was rude and unjustified. But then lets not forget me arguing with the GM ON YOURS and HER behalf about her losing her surname and Redline alledgely(sp) scamming her Rastor, or me sitting there for 2 days helping her with her recamp of rastor. <br>
<br>
First off I would have to say it was about time you helped her out on her epic after all the help she put in to helping you and your family get their epic pieces. Again I was nearby during that raster fiascal and yes I thanked you for talking to Valindor and yes I remember he threatened you and me both, in fact I was banned by him but I was unbanned after I reminded Valindor of a little law he just broke and how I would seek legal action now. I also remember defending you with the GMS several times in the past too, so what do you want an award? If that's the case you owe me some as well.<br>
<br>
Narv said: I attempted 5 times that night to talk to her with no response. I tempted again and again over the next few days, still no responses<br>
<br>
Yeah attempted to harrass her is more like it. Again I say this, I tried to keep my nose out of it and I did till the next part, I had enough of you harrassing my lady and that is where I draw the line. Its a game I have no problems with people nailing me but the minute you go out of the game and begin to harrass my lady, well that's when you made a big mistake.<br>
<br>
Narv said:Then finally when she does send me a tell, I explain the situation and then the next thing I know you are telling me I am harassing you. Not once, but 15 times, so then I /report the text, explain the situation to the GM and YOU were instructed to stop harrassing me. If I was wrong on Althenax and her being an officer so be it, but you will at least speak the entire incident.<br>
<br>
Yes I did get on that day and I said in a calm manner please stop harrassing Althenax, you've done enough damage now you need to let her be or I will contact the gms about your harrassment. The next thing I know I have a guide contacting me about harrassing you! LoL, I laughed even at the guide I told him do what he must and I will make a phone call and do what I must and all will end right there and then. That was the last of it, I had Alth put you on ignore and on that ignore your ass will stay, go it? <br>
<br>
Now Narv lets also remind the people about the Chardok raid Althenax came to help her friends get their epic pieces, when she showed up you went balling to her guildmaster Ninnin at the time and he sent her a tell asking her to please leave how Narvakhan was bitching about you being there. What I'd also like to let people know was you were there to HELP do a CR by a botched up Narvakhan led raid. She was there to HELP pull bodies out and help all her friends were stuck and you go pulling another bullshit stunt like that? Oh and maybe I will make mention how after that she asked if she could please get a gate out and how you were telling people not to help her? Basically let her die in chardok. DO NOT DENY IT, I HAD FRIENDS THERE! They ALSO took logs, directions from Amadagu. Now must I email some people I know and have them come here and post about the way you treated her? Hmmm, do you REALLY want me to go that far because I will and you know I'd do just to show you up and make you eat your own words.<br>
<br>
About your helm, as I told you but you obviously didn't see I gave it to a member who needed it months ago, was an SoE member I may add. You did indeed steal from the SOE bank, you up left, quit and &quot;deleted&quot; your account, which I knew was a load of crap from the word go, you're stuck on EQ and always will be. So if you didn't steal that stuff in the bank was every single item returned back to it's rightful owner? I don't think so, many of my items were in that bank also some of Alths. I saw some old SoE's tonight, the praises I got for getting in your face Narva and not backing down. You want to pull more cards out of the deck, lets go for it. I've got alot more to say, but for now I'll leave you pondering these thoughts. Remember wasn't me who abandoned my guild twice, walking off with the goods the members donated for the guild. It wasn't me who was playing these childish petty games and sending rude tells to a player after they asked for advice. Yeah I got in your officers face only after they sparked some crap with me and my lady, I don't deny the fact I stuck up for her. <br>
<br>
Oh and when you did return I did tell you to come get your gear and you said nope, you weren't staying so again Narv, keep trying to make the excuses I'll just sit back and shoot them down with the truth. Oops did you forget about that part? Sure looks like it, well as I ALWAYS said, the truth hurts.<br>
<br>
The part about me flaming myself, nah I'm actually more liked then you would think. Sure there are some on here who hate me, but that's because I put them in their place at one point or another. Funny when i get into the game all the tells welcoming me. Yup I guess I'm really hated. To bad I don't really care about some of the things said because considering those saying it, well lol, I'll take it as a compliment.<br>
It's all goood baby, now I'll just be placing your annoying words back on /ignore ama.<br>

<br>
Jesus fucking christ, man - let it go.  How long has it been since you were in SoE?  You weren't in it when I was there, so that puts it back at least 10-12 months.  If you can't let something that happened IN A GAME go after a year, you really should see a shrink.  These kinda of grudges don't do anyone any good.  If you hate him so much, just ignore him.  There's a whole feature built into the game just for ignoring people.  When you see his name on these boards, don't click on the thread.  There's a lot of people in the game that I don't like.  Most of them I don't ever have to deal with because I just ignore them.  <br>

About this nonsense with him running off with the guild bank.  Did you ever SEE the SoE guild bank?  There wasn't enough stuff in there to sell off to get anything really valuable.  I've PERSONALLY given away probably 5-10 times the total value of the SoE guild bank in items to friends in the last month and a half.  That's not counting things I've given out through the UC guild bank.  Why are you so worried about the SoE guild bank anyway?  Did you have anything in it?  If so, what?  I'll be happy to personally replace anything you lost.  If you care only because it's more fuel you can add to the fire of your rage, fuck off and find some mood-altering drugs, because you've got a serious fucking problem.   <p><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0n86l/maesig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukilamyan00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kilamyan 00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Here for all<BR>your EKP needs!</span><br>  Posts: 494<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 10:13:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Balrak...Trewayn</span><hr size=1> HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa<br>

It's a history that only you seem to remember.  Pathetic.  You're called to justify your own accusations and you sidestep the issue.  Many would see that as being particularly evasive but I'm not at all surprised that you're incapable of defending your lies because they are indefensible.<br>

Thank you for proving my point.  The case rests, m'lord. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24811">Trewayn Fifate</A>, <font size=1><EM>Virtuoso, master artisan and all round good egg</EM>
