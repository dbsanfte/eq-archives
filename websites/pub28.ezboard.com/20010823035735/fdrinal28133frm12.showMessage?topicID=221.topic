And then don't hand it over to Trillsurge and he rolls higher than you after he left the group cause he was as disgusted with you as I was?  I hope you're happy with the plat that brings you.  <br>
<br>
A rogue only weapon, and I'm the rogue who pulled it, and I'm the rogue who would have used it in his offhand.  In the months I have spent in KC and Seb and places like that, I have never seen anyone demand a roll on an item someone else in their group needed and would use.  Never.  I've handed over items worth 4 or 5 times as much as that thing without even asking a question to someone who would use it.  Grow and up and realize that you're just making things worse for yourself by being a greedy prick.  <br>

I hated going in to Karnor Castle, just because I owned ES arms and ES gloves, so whenever they dropped, some fuckin tank or pure caster got them, just so they could sell them in Freeport.  Where's the Need before greed there?  Why aren't those ES arms taken outside karnor and given to the first non-ES arm wearing druid to make it to the front of KC?  Because of greed.  You are JUST as greedy as he was whenever you loot a piece of class specific droppable kunark armor that you can't use, but someone else in this damn world can.  What did that guy get out of killing that scryer?  He did the same amount of work as you did.  Yeah, you pulled it, but he probably healed your damn ass when you got back, buffed you to all hell right before you pulled, rooted the 6 other things you trained, and kept your bitching greedy ass alive.  Greed exsists, but why should only the few be fucking greedy, and the rest bashed for trying to get their share?<br>

<br>
Your pissed cuz you own a lore item you can`t loot them over a pure caster or tank who would go and sell them ? And what exactly are you going to do with them if you could loot them since you already have them, shove them up your ass and gyrate merrily É&quot;/&quot;)&quot;)/&quot;)/&quot;/&quot; ?<br>
<br>
I don`t think if someone is in a group, guild or not that it is greedy to try and sell an item if everyone who can use it has it, and no one needs it, and this is regardless of if its a guild group or not. The idea of running out and handing stuff to newbies simply to not be greedy is ridiculous, as this would only make the server economy even worse than it is. People should have to do something to earn the better stuff :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugwenhyfar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwenhyfar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#939393>(5/28/01 10:24:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: sorry..</span><hr size=1> I believe in need before greed, and I'm sorry that that happened to you Seke. I would have left as well, and I'm a shaman. Yah, it's okay to roll something between group if: <br>
a. class that could use has better/wouldn't use. <br>
b. class that could use does not want.<br>
c. class that could use already has.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other than that, it's like a monk being in the group in KC and the stupid skeletal warlord spawns and BAM.. staff drops, he loses to some cleric who is gonna go make 100k on it. I'm sorry, you just do NOT cheat someone out of a loot like that. It will come back to you.. wait until like you're trying to get your trak bp, OOOOOH ES drops.. some warrior decides &quot;Hey, it's just as much mine as it is his&quot; and initiates a random and you lose to some fudgehead packing necromancer who would only sell it. Come on.. what has this game come to? <br>
<br>
I will NEVER and have NEVER /randomed on an item I could and would not use (unless we were doing full random because no class could use or class already had/didn't want). People who do that are the greedy ones. If you wish to call me greedy, than so be it.. but this game should be need before greed. <br>
<br>
I used to be pissed when I think it was JSmedly said he wanted to make all items no drop.. but now I understand why. What's the value in a no drop item? Only valuable to the one who can use it.<br>
<br>
Sslith, guilds are NOT the only ones who do need before greed. In every group I go in, that is how I play. You will find most post 50 groups are like this as well.. the ones who aren't will get what's coming to them. People don't think people do it, but I have a list of names of people I won't help or group with ever again over certain things.. and trust me, a lot of people have their lists. <br>
<br>
But on another point, why do you guys think people do guild-only raids and guild-only groups? Because they don't trust people out of guild, and would hate to see something nice go to a non-guildie or non-friend, only for them to sell or do who knows what with.. level 10 twink that will never be played! I am starting to become like this (not wanting to group out of my guild), because my friends and I have been screwed over too many times.. but yet, I still trust people.. /boggle<br>
<br>
I'm sorry.. but when you start grouping post 50, things get harder. Loot is more rare (good loot anyway), experience is harder to get, and the game is just much more frustrating. It's easier as a newbie almost.. because everything is easy to obtain and it's still like Christmas everytime you loot something.. <br>
<br>
But let's face it, when you get post 50, drops are rare.. and to find some chump making you random against something you could and would use, is just WRONG. I know of several people who are post 50 who have randomed in an item and said they would use it.. then went to NFP and tried to sell it. How would that make you feel if you were REALLY going to use it and NOT sell it? AWFUL. <br>
<br>
Was grouped with a druid (not going to name his name.. because I'm not going to flame him like that.. but he knows who he is) in Chardok and he was like level 46 at the time, and woot! Sarnak Battle Shield drops.. and he is like 'oh oh.. I need' and I'm thinking.. &quot;hmm.. he isn't THAT Twinked.. and would a level 46 druid spare his wisdom?&quot; Well.. I went ahead and randomed him for it and he won.. found him in NFP later that night auctioning it. Needless to say, I was pissed. But hey, when something he wants drops, and some shaman says they will use and goes to NFP to sell, he will get his karma. <br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is.. this game would be better off if people didn't care so much about money and loot. I gave away 17k to my guild because I thought that the more money I had, the greedier I got.. and now I give everything away.. why? because it makes the game funner and more challenging to not have everything handed to you on a platter.. and not be able to afford everything. <br>
<br>
Basically.. when the game becomes all about loot.. enough to the point you screw your friends over, then the game is basically over for you. Anyways, I'm done rambling.<br>
<br>
Sorry that you got flamed Seke, and Boofy.. *HUGS* lighten up dear.. =) step.. away.. from.. the.. computer.. before.. it's.. too.. late.. =-)<br>

Err, I dunno why you think that I thought that, I agree most players above 50 are cool about it.  Nothing you can really do if some dishonest asshole lies about how he is going to use the item. But hey what would I know, I`m not in my 50s ;)<br>
