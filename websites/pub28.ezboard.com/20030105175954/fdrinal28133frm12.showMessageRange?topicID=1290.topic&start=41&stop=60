<br>
1) you KS glyhped, and you pissed some of our members ROYALLY off. We had been waiting 6 straight hours on this opportunity and you gotta try to understand the frustration.<br>
<br>
2) two of our members DID ninjaloot from you, and I was the one that called a GM to me to straight this up. I was even in group with the ninjalooter and I /reported the looter since I got the loot message. Now, you gotta understand that even tho I was quite disappointed on CiH and how you acted with this. We even CR'ed some of your guys earlier and by KSing you show the appreciation.<br>
<br>
3) I straightened the ninjalooting up, but I didn't kick the ninjalooters out of the guild - because people do stupid things when they are pissed off ( or always if they are member of Cats in Hats it seems to me )<br>
<br>
4) I have gotten quite little appreciation from CiH for helping out. In fact, I can tell you a lot of people who straight out called me an asshole because of the incident. WTF ? Thanks for letting me help you guys out. <br>
<br>
5) CiH keeps telling the story where they killed Glyphed and where the nasty Vice ninjalooted. I have yet to see ONE posting where CiH KSed something 40 vice worked with for 6 hours, where 50 CiH hangs over their shoulders, adding insane lag - leaving no room for making tactics, treating Vice like shit and the second something goes against you - you petition, whine, swear and f*ckin cry. Guys... You made your bed, now you are forced to sleep in it. YOU shape your opponents, and they will give you the same respect you give them. <br>
<br>
6) when we were working on summoning glyphed, 1 CiH member sat silently in a corner watching until we moved a bit, then trained a warden up the tube to stop us from getting the spawn. What kind of shit is that ???  I *SERIOUSLY* doubt that 1 ranger is enough to kill glyphed, so don't come here and say you had sufficient force and was in right to do it.<br>
<br>
7) the day before, both vice and CiH meets up to do glyphed, Vice started killing taskmasters and CiH suprizingly (not) started KSing us. Heck, you guys even ninjalooted Altec's pouch that he needed for emperor key. ( I'm pretty sure you remember because I accused you, fattee ) We continue to work through the taskmasters, and gets to the rhoz, whereof he gated and went under the world.  Of course - CiH blames Vice and tells us we were really bad people for letting it gate ? Why would we want that ??? I guess that thought never crossed your mind.<br>
<br>
Who's the real asshole here ? Why do I get to deal with all this CRAP from CiH ?? What give you the right to be a rightful asshole of the server ? <br>
I won't lift a finger to help CiH before I get some appreciation for helping out, otherwise - why would I care ?  You certainly don't seem to care. <br>
<br>
How can I tell my members to be nice to people that treat them like a dick ?   And by &quot;them&quot; I mean me, the leader of vice. The way you treat me - is the way you treat whole Vice. I'm more than willing to straight up people, but not before CiH stop acting like a hurd of assholes when I work to my extent - and at the cost of my members - for nothing but crap.<br>
<br>
If it was a proper guild, like WL/CT/FeMax/IB/Darkmoons... you have my word I'd do something about it. But CiH ?   They don't care, it wouldn't mean anything to you guys. That's my experience anyway. And all of you know me. I don't get upset - even when I use rather harsh words, I am always willing to talk about situations and solve them, I go for the fair deal - even when I loose on it. But I'm being worn down by all this shit, and now I'm so tired I don't know if I wanna lead any guild that shares CiH's server - which would change Vice to a guild into something you don't want. Ever thought about what would happen if we changed leader ? It has proven that agressive officers has done a lot for vice during it's growth.<br>
<br>
CiH said it themselves anyway, there's no rules between guilds for them, now accept it or change attitude. <br>
<br>
lol, yea... throden had a great one &quot;so you train and plan to KS TK's aaryonar ??? oh god you guys are low&quot;.  Heh, checked the mirror yet throden ?? =)  <br>
-No, we didn't train them - but I was playing a char that saw what happened....who also died when -TK's- monk brought eashen and all his friends to camp. When an int caster has time enough to both see people die like mad - AND have time to get 2 gates intterrupted - you ain't the trainee.<br>
-Yes, according to our PREMADE DEAL, we had the right to try aary when they wiped ( since they had 1 or 2 clerics ). <br>
<br>
CiH does it easier.. They don't deal - they just do it. Saves time to not respect others, but as you see - you do risk to piss people off, and that DOES change people and their respect for you.<br>

<br>
anyway you gusy rez in and death loop yourselves while glyphed is healing up, and when he gets to 99% xzavierx trains glyphed on us.  he ran from your raid's spot to ours with glyphed right on him, and died in our camp.  did we train you trying to kill you? nope!  intentional training is a bannable offense<br>

then your members ninja loot it cuz they have no chance of getting such awesome glyphed loot on their own.  ninja looting's a bannable offense too<br>

<br>
You can't base the actions off of 5 or 6 people on the drinal board and apply it to the whole CiH guild just as I cant expect cih to judge vice via 5 or 6 ppl on the flame board. Make sense?  It'd be almost like me basing my opinion on vice as a whole when Feardwolf came up to me for the first time ever and out of the blue called me a stupid bitch + a long string of insults <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for developing your own opinions of the guild based on the guild's actions in game, yea i can feel for you there. But as you know, there's always two sides to each coin and everyone has their own sob story. To be perfectly honest, seethur and fattee were always two of the biggest supporters for vice that i know of in cih, so i was kind of shocked to see him flame a member of vice here. :P<br>
<br>
I think for the most part, both parties have been alot more mature about what happened as opposed to how it could have ended up. I was shocked there wasnt a 20 page thread on it the day after it happened. I didnt log on until CiH was killing cursed so i wont even pretend to know what really happened as to the &quot;i was here first&quot; arguement.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what went on when you dealt with CiH's officers regarding the event, but I'm confident they tried to handle it the best way possible and tried to stay mature about it. That's their job.<br>
<br>
sorry for rambling, i have this massive headache and cant think straight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><P>

 If you belive -3- people can put a stamp on vice as a whole, why on earth can't 50 cats set their standard ? You are a cih, you are no better then the 50 others, and you haven't even tried to defend it.<br>
<br>
&quot;xzavierx trained us&quot;  <br>
1) he didn't, unless he had a sudden race change to iksar. ( I saw it - it was an iksar pulling it - and I /assisted glyph to see who pulled it, and it was noone of ours, just cant recall who it was )<br>
2) would it make a difference ?  I bet 50 cats werent in the basement for the xp.<br>
<br>
Heck, a CiH member even ADMITTED to me that they was against the order they got from the officers to pull our glyph.<br>
<br>
Dunno, put yourself in our boots and imagine how it'd be to meet people like you. Every time we treat you like you treat us - we always end up here in flames, where you cry your tear out. <p><BR>

When lots of players go inactive, they have to recruit(see accept applications from other guilds) to get their numbers up.  And should people return from inactive states, you end up with periods where you have more online then you need.<br>
<br>
I dunno what you meant about kicking people when they are inactive, I am certainly glad that CiH doesn't do this for I have taken 2, 5+ month breaks in the 3.5 years i've played.  Breaks are a good thing imo, keeps the game more interesting and gives me the chance to see sunlight for atleast a few months a year! <p>Aleal the Tactician - High Sorceress of Neriak</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urullan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rullan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I eat da mudpies!</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/17/02 7:39:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Richie you mother fucking newbie</span><hr size=1> Kutch no fucking way did we KS you.. we watched you wipe out to Glyphed over and over again all day then we said fuck this shit we aint gonna let this spawn be blown.. then on your 3rd Glyphed pull you get fuckin owned and we go in and begin the cycle.<br>
