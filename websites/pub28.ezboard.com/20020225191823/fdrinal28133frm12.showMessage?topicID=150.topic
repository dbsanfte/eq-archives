Thraxx, as you all know is a e-bay trade off froma 60 wizzy on another sever. He seemed like a good guy and I have grouped with him on many a times. While I was in a Howling stone group with Vert, trevize, domoguul, seandar and thraxx, I let him borrow my tunic till he got his from seb. I even told him that I was letting him use it because it helped me with damage vs healing. He said thanks. Well, a week later I asked for it back. On 4 separate times, I went to the zone he was in because he was anon, I asked him first where he was and that I was coming. Each time he logged before I got there. I am not stupid but I chose to try to give him a chance. Finally, today I had enough and told him I wanted it and I was coming to get it. He was in perma. True to his false nature, he logged before I got there. Now I am pissed. When he loggs in later, he  has me on ignore. My friends in guild start telling him he needs to fix this, that was when he says that he gave me 40K and a sash of the dragonboarn for it. Who in the hell would pay that much? I obviously do not have it so then he says he told me he was giving it to my alt. An alt that I do not even have. The point here is that thraxx is a thief. I was a fool for trusting the scum, please do not make the same mistake I did. He also tried to get stealthier (danielson) his tunic by taking the tunic and him logging in another character and giving him a traq staff. Something I discovered after he fucked me over. Thraxx is a fucking thief. I am a fool for trusting him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unarekstigmata.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Narek Stigmata</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 8:25:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thraxx the e-bay monk turned thief</span><hr size=1> Welcome to the f-in club.

I remembered after I got to West Commons that I had forgotten them and told him. He never offered to give it back to me...and well to be frank I was a little embarassed to ask him about it since I was always broke and a 4k item probably had a lot more value to me than him. Finally one day I asked him about it - he had given the item away to someone. /shrug suppose it could have been someone in his guild maybe not. <br>
<br>
I always thought it was a pretty shitty thing to do. I'd personally ask the person before selling or getting rid of the item. (not like Tat wasn't on every single night of the week).<br>
<br>
He's in your guild. I wonder how many CiH would scream at me if I had put his name in the headlines in here. Guessing a lot -) Kinda crappy thats how it works.<br>

But you should consider a real world example. Because no matter how much someone tells you &quot;I'm just an asshole in the game, in real life I'm a sweet person&quot; you know its not true.<br>
<br>
In the real world, if someone joins a hate group, or a militia organization with known domestic terrorist tendencies, or even the Boy Scouts (to use a juxtaposed example), its fairly valid to consider that the joiner shares at least some essential beliefs with the organization being joined.<br>

Look at the Frizzy ordeal...posting in here solves nothing. It irritates me that it was in here..and they were left to defend themselves..because well I know what it feels like to have to defend ones self.  I am not saying I hate your whole guild but you guys have definately shown a trend of your values....<br>
<br>
I have seen posts against Mysthyl for ks'ing a door spawn for months, Frizzy, pheonixx, thraxx , &quot;ME~! gating&quot;, yadda yadda yadda yadda. Hoooray CiH the renegade rep killers - well kiss my ass!<br>
<br>
I wrote up above about an incident where someone (you probably know and love as a guildmate ) did something I felt was dishonest too. But what would you do if I put his name in the headlines here? You would run to his support and give me all kinds of grief, of that I am certain.<br>
<br>
With the backing of your guild people are afraid to challenge you. You are protected when you use use inappropriate methods of resolving your disputes......but you know what Frizzy, Mysthyl Thraxx, pheonixx, &quot;Me~!&quot; and all these other people you attack don't have that that type of protection.<br>
<br>
Why do members of your guild get survival when others don't? Politics! I am saying what many of us know but won't say due to politics (they want to be in your guild, or don't want to tick off the uber's etc) because I have nothing at stake any more.<br>
<br>
Other guilds hold &quot;standards&quot;, values, write charters, and expect their members to behave a certain way when resolving disputes...they often require things like maturity in dispute resolution by &quot;walking away&quot; or recommending them to resolve things in tells or via council - disallow forum flaming. Why are you guys immune to the same good values? <br>
<br>
So I am going to stand up for Thraxx because damnit someone needs to. I will stand up for Frizzy, I will stand up for Phoenixx and I will stand up for myself.....anyone who is subjected to this type of &quot;screw them out of a good reputation- hence forcing them out of the game&quot; approach. <br>
<br>
I don't give a shit if &quot;your&quot; ancient cyclopse was KS'd mine was too once and I didn't have to come in here to cry about it. I don't give a dang if you were ripped off, your guild mate ripped me off and I didn't bring it in here. Countless others are subject to disagreement, misperceptions, actual malicious acts daily - unless they are &quot;all&quot; brought forth execution style &quot;none&quot; of them should be. And trust me if **every** misunderstanding in this game came out in this flame forum as xxxxx is guilty, there wouldn't be anyone left to PLAY THE DANG GAME! (Except for Cyanan because he's never been misunderstood hehe).<br>
<br>
I will not believe a word you say until I hear Thraxx's story. What does a level 60 accomplish by &quot;ripping things off&quot; anyway? It sounds hardly beleivable - and he is perfectly capable of getting that tunic in a group some day I'm sure at level 60! <br>
<br>
I refuse to rule out the possibility that he has an explaination and I don't think confronting him in here or any forum like this is the solution.<br>
<br>
I could be proven wrong - but I will not believe otherwise until &quot;proven&quot;.<br>
<br>
You guys used to complain that this forum was all about people complaining about CiH...more frequently than not now it is CiH pinpointing specific individuals.  <br>
<br>
Sorry to devaluate what you are saying but I'm not scared to challenge any more of these flames validity -and to challenge that the flames could be wrong. I no longer have anything to lose....and I don't need to participate the &quot;politics&quot; because I don't give a heck what you guys think about me ;-) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 4/9/01 2:50:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unadeniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadeniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 3:27:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> LOL, Tat, wtf are you talking about? People are scared to say that members in CiH suck? Then they don't have any balls. Every guild has good and bad persons. And CiH also has a lot of persons, so you will find all types in one guild. Maybe you had a bad incident with a CiH member but well, ask for your item when you win it, not a year later...<br>
And for good old Banner, I trust him, cause people could always trust him as he always had trust in others. When he took a little break he gave some stuff to friends, guildmates, persons he just knows from the screen and expected to get them back when he started to play again. As far as I know everyone gave him the stuff back. Banner is not a little child who is crying over some fucking pixels, but is disappointed that someone abused his trust and that is understandabale in my eyes. You though, my dear Tat, have found a new playground to cry over your little item you did not get because of your own stupidity and therefore bash a whole guild for it. Pretty lame in my eyes, shrug. But who am I to judge you as I do not even know you. I do not give a flying fuck what you think about me as I guess you think the same about me, but to try to drag Banner's name into the dirt is plain and simple bullshit. And to clear it up: No, I am not a member of CiH so I do not have any necessaty to defend them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 3:31:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> So Nadeniel what is Thraxx's perspective on the whole thing since you are full of wisdom and insight?

The fact that other members of my guild may have been assholes or worse at some point has nothing to do with this. Bannion was just pointing out a situation where someone, according to him, blatantly ripped him off and is trying to keep that from happening to anyone else.<br>
<br>
If Thraxx wanted to defend himself he could, right here. His silence is either an indication that he doesn't read the board or that he doesn't care. Sooner or later people will question him about this and either he'll respond to defend himself or he still won't care. Keeping these things in the game is not the way to keep the most people informed. Would you suggest that Bannion run through every zone with a shout macro as long as this post to inform people of what has happened? Then for kicks, Thraxx could run through Norrath spamming his defense?<br>
<br>
The beautiful thing about message board posts is that you don't have to read them. If you don't care what Thraxx has been accused of or don't think it should come to these boards, then don't read it. Some people like to keep themselves informed of well known rip-off artists and KSers so they can be avoided in the game. I am not in any way indicating that I think Thraxx is guilty, in fact I'd like to hear his side of the story. But seeing as you have absolutely no knowledge of the situation, how can you possibly defend anyone? The only person that can defend Thraxx, is Thraxx. By the same token, the only person that can accuse Thraxx is Bannion.<br>
<br>
Not sure exactly why I decided to post, was kinda bored heh. Been seeing a lot of high horse posts lately with no logic to them, guess I finally reached my limit. *sigh* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 341<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/9/01 8:37:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ....</span><hr size=1> I've said all I'm really going to say about it...accosting him here to defend isn't the right place.

<br>
You can come up with any variety of reasons why - the reasons are clearly outlined in my above posts - I can think of four instances of where CiH either scammed me, impacted me or hurt someone else and you guys wouldn't want to be nailed in public forum either.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of any other post in here - why should Bannions post hold any more validity than the accusation of the kindred selling spells as a scam or Frizzy scamming AC boots? It shouldn't. Very rarely if ever are these flames accurate. All I ask is that before you exercise your power to &quot;destroy&quot; someone’s game - you get all the details and be very certain before posting accusations...because few if any ever hold water. <br>
<br>
You are behaving too frequently lately like grade school bullies - well your actions are far more impacting than you wish to recognize apparently. And for Christ’s sake look at your own posts - in general you guys don't like getting flamed well how would you like to be flamed as an individual especially if it is a false accusation of your ethics which in general extricate you from the game.<br>
<br>
Get the data, confirm, validate, validate again, and validate one more time before coming in here and pissing in public - I only see &quot;one&quot; person saying Thraxx is a scammer not &quot;multiple&quot; incidents..and I don't see his rebuttal. Similarly you said Frizzy was a scammer. You said Mysthyl was an intentional KS'er (I know much better), you accuse Phoenixx and their whole &quot;guild&quot; of being ethically challenged, and you accuse me of being ethically challenged. Well as far as I can see &quot;no one&quot; is right -so what grants you the privilege to be the &quot;more correct&quot; and choose when to extricate someone from the game.? <br>
<br>
Like I said ,you are not all purely ethical bystanders in this process - I can think of four incidents where I think you breached ethic or a general standard of conduct. You guys have moved from defense to offensive. I do feel bad if Bannion was truly ripped off, but at the same time you guys have been crying wolf so why is this incident different from Frizzy?<br>
<br>
Come up with any response you want...insult me...beat on me...tell me various reasons why I would make this post - it just shows me you aren't open to listening. It means that you will, in a closed manner, keep barreling over other peoples feelings irregardless of the circumstances and sometimes without a &quot;proven&quot; valid reason. <br>
<br>
Welcome to Drinal, where Cats in Hats are the ethics police - only when they deviate from ethical, mature behavior, is it acceptable! Enjoy your stay on our server.<br>
<br>
I commend you for apologizing to Frizzy. That is the first apology I have ever seen, but rather than repeating history how about finding a new solution to resolving problems? Or is it that you think plastering Frizzy was the right approach to problem resolution still? Let's just keep doing it over and over again until the whole server has been implicated in some way or another...oh yeah everyone but you and your friends. It's stupid - this is my opinion - it will be hard to sway.<br>

I realize I am dramatizing the point, it is intentional. If everyone comes in here and accuses without validity or for actions they themselves are guilty of, then we won't know when the real problems exist.<br>
<br>
As for Shol, Nadenial etc. tsk tsk you people don't even know me assuming &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot; I do/say anything is a pretty far stretch. Few people really knew me on this server well, the ones who do fortunately spent time with me in game rather than reading this message board. Of course I don't think I've done anything terribly unethical - except that it is apparently taboo to have a real life or not tolerate it for extended periods of time when people aren't respecting others time or game play experience. <br>
<br>
As far as you know you could have grouped with my char this month.....and liked her ;-P<br>
