And reached lvl 60 just hours prior to the first warrior BOTB tournament. As a player hes been around since beta.<br><br>As for what hes done? and why his name is notorious accross so many servers? not sure i can cram it all into one thread but i can highlight a few things from my memorys of him.<br><br>I've known Thogg since the opening of Tunare (the first &quot;new&quot; server, having been openend shortly after the game went live in the US and coinciding with the world wide release in australia and several other countrys).<br><br>He was the first Troll i saw in the game, as very few traveled around on the first day the server opened, but he walked right over to freeport and started chopping away.<br><br>He was one of the first well known merchants, along with myself. He knew the game well enough to hunt places like paw (most people didnt even know where this was the first week) and sell the armor. I did the steamfont to north ro trade route importing derv rings and mino axes between the distant citys. I used to trade him for armor to take accross, and he'd take my axes into the swamps for newbie trolls/ogres.<br><br>Later when banded armor and fine steel weapons became available we found ourselves grouping up, exploring new areas and power leveling.<br><br>There were so many firsts back than, most of which would be considered routine by todays standards, but often times the groups we ran with were first into places like Cazic Thule, SolA, SolB, Lower Guk, and more. Many of these mid to high lvl zones were unexplored, thier items unknown at the time. Just by going there and discovering new things to post about made some take notice of everyone in our group.<br><br>By the time we reached lvl 40, our group was the first in full rubicite (best armor in the game at the time) and was making a steady profit selling off demon claws (prior to the name change and lore tags on the armor/weapons)<br><br>Around that time he lead Tunares first &quot;zergling&quot; rush at vox in permafrost. There was only around 12 people on the server over lvl 40 at the time, and the 100 or so that tagged along to try were mostly lvl 20-30. Anyway, it was considered historic, and though we failed miserably it was a learning experience none the less. One thing we learned was we werent going to try that again with more than 40-50 people.. dam lag...<br><br>Hrm, by now he'd also started his infamous fued with Charron (Tunares most well known (future) leader of large events) which used to lead to pages and pages of essay length posts on the Tunare boards. None of thats really worth debating over anymore as its old and trivial at this point, but it contributed to his noteriety and made for good reading material.<br><br>By the time Plane of Fear opened we had done just about everything except kill Nagafen and Vox. We raided fear non stop with groups ranging from lvl 35-50; we didnt even have a lvl 50 in each class yet. Due to the shear mass of shaman armor drops and the rareity of shaman going to fear, Thogg created Thoggette (which became a scandal in itself ill get to later). Thoggette, lvl 1 Troll shaman, first in full fear armor.<br><br>Anyway by the time they added the revamps to the zone and the lvl cap we didnt even have an ENC high enough to zone in, and no where near enough other players to continue in the zone. We went back to leveling and trying to get others ready and high enough lvl for fear.<br><br>The rest of that first summer was more or less quiet, we had our first 50s in each class, and mapped out most of the zones. Started farming Ykesha's (best non planer/dragon 1hs of the day) so that we stood a chance retaking fear.<br><br>The end of that summer for my wedding event we killed Nagafen and shortly after Vox; both for the first time (on our server). Those early raids were server wide cooperations with the more well known players leading the events. <br><br>Charron eventually took over leading most large scale events which lead to more endless posts/flames on Tunare about any topic you can think of. Much of which involved Thogg, myself and the few other high profile players.<br><br>Anyway, by the time fear raids were back in full swing, Thogg ended up with the only Bladestorm on the server, which was than promptly removed from the game.<br><br>Bladestorm has caused more flames.. trains.. arguements... debates.. and endless posts from Tunare to the warrior boards than i could possibly attempt to list...<br><br>Eventually (original)Thogg sold his character. Leading to more famous flames...<br><br>(new) Thogg made quite a name for himself, and was in general excepted by most of the server. He was quite well liked and played for nearly a year on this character.<br><br>Sutekh (the very first ebayer of any server, and who ive known since being the only 2 people hunting in oasis) eventualy gave (original Thogg) a lvl 29 shaman named bosozuko(sp?)<br><br>(original Thogg)Boso, came back with a vengeance and began his power leveling to catch back up with the rest of us and rejoin the high end game. By now the server had long since began attempting to split raids by guild and it was only later with the release of Kunark that gave us more breathing room to spread out.<br><br>Eventually (original) Thogg took back Thogg the character from (new) Thogg (trade?, sale? not sure, but it was amicable)<br><br>The formerly (new) Thogg started a new monk named Denik, and with his extra (ebay) characters power leveld up to 50 and rejoined the high end game quite quickly.<br><br>Denik eventually left the server to join Sutekh (who had since sold his character) on a brand new (non split) server. Denik started a Troll Warrior named: Thogg<br><br>In the mean time with the return of (original) Thogg there came the scandal of Thoggette's armor. Boso turned up one day in a full suit of fear shaman armor and it was widely flamed that it had been duped and than &quot;no drop traded&quot; over onto boso. Was this true? who cares at this point, there was never more than speculation and finger pointing involved in those endless debates. I mention it here only because it lead to even more noteriety of &quot;Thogg&quot;<br><br>(original) Thogg along with his Bozo shaman once again became part of Tunares elite, and joined us in rampaging Kunark and exploring all the new zones.<br><br>With the release of the epic weapons Thogg was quickly in the lead (of any server) and was once again widely known across warrior boards, Safehouse and Tunare boards for his posts on the topic. Due to a ninja looting incident Thogg was unable to complete the epic first, but is widely credited with discovering and releasing the largest portion of the quest info.<br><br>By the time the Warrior BOTB tournament came around he was 59, we power leveled him to 60 the night before, and he entered the tournament without even having a chance to raise his skills (which were still mostly lvl 58ish). He won on Tunare and in an odd twist of events both (original) Thogg and (new) Thogg (Denik's warrior) were in the semi-finals on Test.<br><br>Due to poor judging, last minute rules changes, and the GM forcing (original)Thogg to enter his last match without a discipline (after having given his opponent time to refresh) Thogg lost the finals by a very slim margin.<br><br>This once again lead to endless flames and noteriety across many boards... (recuring theme?)<br><br>Another thing while discussing pvp, Both (original) Thogg and Denik (while playing Thogg) were  widely known for endless duels against anyone, and usualy won. Since the &quot;duel message&quot; for winning was sent to all zones, this was yet another small part of his name being widely known.<br><br>(side note: it actually somewhat annoyed me that they changed it to be zone wide, i myself had a history of famous duels, and used to quite enjoy the endless /tells while slaughtering people enmass to /corpse summon accross sky heh)<br><br>Eventually he moved to Drinal, and though i did play briefly on the server before retiring this character i couldnt really tell you much about his history here. So as to whether he still plays this character, or who he plays now, youll have to ask someone else.<br><br>I could probably post another few pages of Thogg pre Drinal history, but this seems to be a reasonable summary... i'm sure others may like to add thier own notes - or in most cases flames.<br><br>----<br>Who am I to post all this? Ive known Thogg in game forever. and my own history could fill pages of posts as well. So just briefly to allay your concerns on my credibilty: First rog to 50 (on Tunare - 3rd overall in the game; first 2 were from Veeshan (Fires of Heaven) guild). First rog to 60 (Tunare, 2nd overall). First epic weapon (Ragebringer) of any class on any server)... yadda yadda yadda.... i really dont feel like listing it all out...<br>----<br><br>Oh, one final note, (original) Thogg is also known through out the game as the worst typer in EQ history. (leading to the infamous: THogg~ spelling of his name). This has been discussed on many boards throughout the web. Most of us who know him well can read his typing easily; however, to those that havent spent much time around him it can appear garbled at times.. and this leads to endless additional flames and noteriety... (yea.. definatly a reccuring theme in Thoggs life..)<br><br>---<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    ~Kaylum Prince of Thieves~</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    Behold, I come as a thief.
