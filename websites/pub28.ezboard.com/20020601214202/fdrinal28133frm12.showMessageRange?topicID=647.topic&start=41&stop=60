How do you know this? are you useing some sort of packetsniffer to see what was said between Gotk,BC, and the lead GM? I happen to know what happened first hand. As the necro that was FD in skyfire was mine.<br>
<br>
All he had been doing for the last week was FD in skyfire. that is all. The Lead GM told me that I had to leave because THEY (BC) were camping RAGEFIRE first. Then i countered with Well isnt VI's official policy that there are NO camps in the game. The GM said that is correct, but when two groups cannot come to a comprimise, then the GMs have to step in. Now I explained to the GM that BC had all of 12 ppl online at the time. Gotk by itself, had 48. Im pretty sure i could have called in a few favors and gotten it up much higher. <br>
<br>
But since I told the GM the truth, which was I was not there the WHOLE time since server came back up from emergency patch 36hrs before. BC blatantly lied to the GM and told him that they had been there the whole time. This is completely untrue. There were times where I (the FD necro) was the only one in the zone. I also did NOT tell the GM about the bullshite that BC tried to get me (FD necro) killed. The first attempt was running up and casting a benificial buff on me. Good thing VI actualy fixed that bug. The Next attempt was they pulled an AOE casting mob over to my FD location. I have logs of all this.  <br>
<br>
I logged in this morning, BC and The Kindred were in SF. Guess what, BC was whineing to a GM again that someone was actualy in a zone they were camping. The GM this time Ruled that whoever has enough force first to kill a mob, gets the mob. Part of the problem is im pretty sure that BC lied to the GM again about being there first. Several ppl in my guild were some of the first on when the server came up today. Guess what, no BC were online.but TK was.  Im pretty sure that if RF spawned in skyfire, TK pwned him. cause lets face it, BC couldnt fight their way outta a wet paper bag.  <br>
<br>
As for this &quot;agreement&quot; between GOTK GL and BC, After 8 different ppl from BC clamed to be the Guild leader, and after 3 hours of tells from these ppl. My GL, Mantik told the last one that &quot;we were not activly seeking RF, but if he did spawn, we (Gotk) would make an attempt for him&quot; That is the way it is on Drinal. <br>
<br>
I could really give two shits what you actualy think Balsac. Yes im going to stoop to your level and call you a name. Where is this any of this your consern? Are you even in BC? This rant was about guilds calling a named spawn. I too Happen to be an ELDER as you call it from MM. BFD, this is drinal, if you do not like it, pay your 50 bucks and take your ignorant ass back to MM. I am going to send in all the logs i have to cust support, not like i actualy believe anything will be done.<br>

<br>
GotK flaming BC does your guild no justice. You all look like a bunch of greedy children. And the name calling is no way to resolve your issues. Forming small alliances would only serve to help each other in the future as no guild has its full power online 24/7.<br>
<br>
When I camped rage for epic like 6 months ago it popped in USA prime time NC raids on Korean time and barely anyone was there. I looked up a few friends and they were more than willing to assist. 7th ward yielded to my camp and even assisted as well. It was funny as they were holding a wedding in the Naggy lair when RF popped and had the numbers on hand to KS me.They showed a little class. An extreme rare pop on this server now adays <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Thats the way it should be. I camped that damn RF for a week and a half. Took 2 weeks off from work RL just to do it. Had someone came along and KS'd me it would have been incredibly disappointing considering the RL time arrangements that had to be made. I am still dubious after 6 months to Wife faction. <br>
<br>

You all think about the days when your clerics had to use mana to rez countless carcasses and the DOWNTIME involving it. This could make or break a guild.<br>
I´m not saying I agree that people should be petitioning and claiming this as a camp but I damn well can understand that some members of BC feel dissapointed not having a chance in hell to make something better out of their guild.<br>

<br>
MM server had no list. AL dominated the server. if you waned to kill anything all you had to do was beat AL to it. there where no Lists.<br>
<br>
Tunare Everything has lists like months in advance. alot of people that left Tunare did so because of the psyco lists. <br>
<br>
Drinal became a no lists server. now when we say no lists. we (players of drinal) meen that there will be no special board that has a calender with every mob reservered unill the apocalipse.<br>
<br>
when drinal first opened CiH and like 2 other guilds made a list for Trakanon and VS. because having 3guilds and 150 people all in the trakanon prep area all bitching about who go there first was dumb. so we came up with a rotaion for those mobs.<br>
<br>
if guilds want to they can come up with Lists(rotations) for certain mobs. but it will not be recognizes by the server as a whole, just those guild that are part of it. <br>
<br>
<br>
by the way. CiH has like 7 or 8 clerics twinks that we will be needing epics for so we will be concentrating our raid efforts on ragefire..just kidding just kidding hehe :) <br>
<br>
hope you guys work out your ragefire Gore problems.  <p><center>

<br>
to say that a guild is limited in the number of epics it may have is interesting to say the least.  let's assume (for a brief moment) that the statement that only 3 cleric epics are needed for the &quot;high end game&quot;, and only 18 people are needed to &quot;raid high end mobs&quot; is actually true.  i would like to know what happens to the other clerics in the guild that already has 3 cleric epics?<br>
<br>
do these 3 epic clerics then have to be at all high end raids?  are they the &quot;raiding clerics&quot; that have to attend all guild functions?  do we not allow a friend to have their epic because the guild does not need anymore epics to do uber encounters?  if you are cleric #4 in a guild with 3 epics already, then does that mean you are never entitled to or allowed to experience the end of a quest you may have started at level 1?  can you never enjoy helping others with a rez stick in non-raid/non-guild encounters?  can you never be a generous rezzer of the fallen heroes in places like sebilis or chardok or wherever just because you have the &quot;bad luck&quot; to be the 4th cleric in a guild that &quot;has all the cleric epics it needs&quot;?<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
also, since seke has pointed out that Unconquered successfully killed the past 4 ragefires, and 3 is the &quot;magic number&quot; for cleric epics in any guild, do we make them out to be a &quot;greedy&quot; guild too?  are they excused because they &quot;let BC have the ragefire camp&quot; from being called greedy?  shouldn't they have allowed BC to kill at least 1 of those 4 ragefires?  did seke ever confirm the existence of any list that BC claimed to be on, even though BC stated (to the GM even)that the list came from seke...?<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
i hold no animosity towards anyone in this game.  some guilds don't get along, that is fine.  but to tell someone that they cannot/should not get their epic (an item that they have probably been dreaming of attaining since level 1) because their guild has &quot;enough already&quot; is just wrong.<br>
<br>
please understand that trying to kill someone (training AOE mobs over FD chars) or /petitioning to force them to leave the zone, or any other attempt to force someone to do something that they have no desire in doing is a sure-fire way to make someone quite upset.<br>
<br>
this is why funno is upset.  this is why molgar posted.  this is why GOTK (and other people who have all the facts) are defending funno.<br>
<br>
GOTK has been helping other guilds and other players for a long time, and will continue to do so for a long time.  we do not/have not/will not ever KS a mob from someone who has already attained aggro, and has sufficient force to kill the mob.  nor will we ever knowingly force other people to leave a zone, or train other people's camps, or behave in any otherwise disrespectful and discourteous fashion.<br>
<br>
GOTK will kill ragefire again.  funno will get his epic.  BC will get their epic cleric(s) too.  in the end, more epic clerics for the server (no matter what guild he/she/they are in) benefits the server.  so it's all good.<br>
<br>
just please don't anyone try and dictate how other people are or are not supposed to play; or tell me whether or not i am allowed to have my epic.<br>
<br>
that is all~<br>

Really, the only time anyone cares about this is when someone from Tunare uses the word &quot;port&quot; instead of GG and much laughter is had at their expense.<br>
<br>
I have never seen a thread on here where people were supporting lists.  You either have the force to do it on your own or you *gasp* work with other guilds. <br>
<br>
Oh well, we just need Arrora to come in and straighten this out.<br>

<br>
Balrak - This is DRINAL server.  Not MM.  Not Tunare.<br>
<br>
There is no transfer of rules.  On the outside chance that there was, you wouldn't be making the calls on them.<br>
<br>
The rules are what has been agreed upon by the general player community on Drinal.<br>
<br>
First in zone with sufficient force takes the spawn.<br>
<br>
This means if two competing guilds are in the zone, and one has a sufficient force while the other does not, they have every right to take the spawn.  It doesn't matter if the unprepared guild is kiting/mezzing or in any way keeping aggro on said mob - first with force.<br>
<br>
So quit arguing about it.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I do not speak for UC as far as policy.  Sometimes UC handles this type of thing differently...like considerate human beings.  But we don't &quot;give&quot; spawns to people.  You want the spawn, you work for it.  Lists are for the lazy and the greedy. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97846">Azael Azureberry</a><BR>

<br>
first of all: balrak is no officer of this guild and what he said here is not in any way what i feel or think. this is not the opinion of BC.<br>
<br>
i agree there is NO list for dragons. camp has been given to us by UC and a few of our members took that as like next spawn is OURS and made it a very personal matter to them, they didnt knew bout the spawn being a who first hits with enuf force gets mob. i corrected that and they all know now. as i did yesterday to a member of GoTK who spoke to me i again here openly APOLOGIZE for all what happened between BC and GoTK at the rage camp (i know some of the gotk peeps and i respect the guild and even those i know deeply).......even thou the gm on the first petition said rf is ours i think he was NOT right !! (wasnt right to petition on that in the first place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
after we had same probs with TK who got RF right now....(grats sinsual on clicker) i talked to guild and other officers and we follow now ALL the same rules for all dragons as all guilds (meaning whoever gets first to mob with sufficient force to take down mob and has agro gets the mob period).....THIS WONT happen again.......and i beg u all not to hold the actions of a few guildmembers of BC against the whole guild!<br>
<br>
to that claim we petitioned about ksing gorenaire.......err we NEVER camped gore and NEVER claimed anything there NOR made any fuss bout that........sorry but u must have some missinformation there!!!<br>
<br>
okay theese r me 2 cents to all this......i am really sad bout all this and partly ashamed what happened on our side here (tho i must say that also some rude and harsh things came there from other side which were not correct and got some of our folks into a selfdefending role and made all this personal for them).....if u have further questions, info or anything regarding this contact me in game.......<br>
