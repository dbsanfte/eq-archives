If Tat is a female, well then allow me to be the male bastard pig you think I am, but honestly I don't give a flying fuck what sex Tat is out of the game so why does everyone else? Does it really pertain to anything? <br>
<br>
I will admit, Tats pushed the wrong button with me in game once before with her bashing males the one time, so the next day when I saw her, I came down on her in group with a firestorm of female bashing. Now that I look back on it, I laugh because it was just fun to rattle this person. Anyhow, as I've said before, I do my thing, this Tat person does their own and we leave it at that, but who really cares what sex this person is? <br>
<br>
Yes Tat I know you work with the oil companys so tell me then, when are the money hungry sons a bitches gonna quite milking the hell out of me for their FALSE gas shortage they themselves created on purpose. It's a fine coverup excuse they use, it's what we call in part of the business world as passing the buck. Oh and don't even tell me there is a shortage, anyone who reads into that line is as gullable as they come. Oops, I changed the topic, good cause this Tats a he/she thing is getting a tad old don't you think? Who cares!!!! <br>

What have you done this time pray tell?  Lie? Umm.. make up stories?  Try to make like your the poor innocent victim (when its really you who was bad).  Harassing folks?  Stalking them them on the boards under false names?  Charging your guild mates to do the guild website? Manipulate your guild officer into tagging your level 1 character when you have been told repeatedly that the guild rule was no tags until alt was level 8?  ....<br>

No one intentionally charmed your little level 15 orc LOL...ok you can get over it 2 years later thx. Y ou have had a cow over that for 2 years now. <br>
<br>
I hosted a web site for my guild on my hosted NT environment using ASP (Active Server Pages for the technically impaired) &amp; a database connectivity (a little more to grasp than your simplified HTML)..it had a cost they pay or they make their own site. I also paid for the domain name. Please check prices at www.interland.com and look up NT w/SQL genius. It was my web space to begin with and I just tied a different domain name to it. If they wanted a different application they were going to have to write it themselves or use the version I had already made in NT w/ a db backend.  Not sure how that became your business but you are a nosy wench so you can't help it. Perhaps if you weren't stalking me because I charmed an orc in highkeep you thought was yours (when 5 of my group were engaged on it) and actually knew me you would know the full details instead of partial crap.<br>
<br>
You are definately creative in your delusions. There was no manipulation to tagging a level one char. Mysthyl my friend created a char named Tatiane (and he still has it)...that was his char at level one and still is his char now. Perhaps you should get a clue.<br>
<br>
Hmm what else do we have stalking oh yah stalking...the seedy bitch who couldn't get over the fact that I charmed an orc my group was killing in highkeep who followed me a year later whining to the guild I was in about it. Damn who cares a year later who charmed what or even for what reason. Good lord you hold grudges. The only thing I should have done in the first place was made sure that I sent that letter to EQ customer service and not put it in public forum so that you could not harass me for a year and a half you fucked up bitch. You know these forum flamers in here suck but people like you actually suck worse thanks for making me recognize it because you are a freakish little manipulator/stalking bitch.<br>
<br>
I came here to get away from bitches following me around and making me part of their business because they couldn't stop crying that I charmed an orc they were fighting in highkeep...when I had just figured out what the heck the spell did.<br>
<br>
Go back to your trailer park err paralegal job...and stalk people on your own server for ks'ing firebeetles at level 2.<br>
<br>
BTW thks Meneldil for drudging up this stalking freak from Mith Marr by posting in Afterlife boards!<br>
<br>
Ok we are waiting for follow ups now from your brother and whatever other people are stupid enough to follow you around and wipe your ass for you..but in the end, in my mind, 2 years later you are still the freaky wench who couldn't get over an orc berzerker in highkeep. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/29/01 10:39:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/01 10:49:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Im happy to help you out in anyway i possibly can Tat <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 550<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/29/01 10:51:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> Well pardon the whole forum when they don't cry you a river because you wanted me to stop posting at the same time you intentionally stir up a shit storm.<br>

<br>
Despite the lies and crap she was dishing out against me and everyone associated with me (she made it a point to attack innocent people just because they were my guild mates or friends) -- I tried to resolve it like an adult.  I tried to work things out (I joined her guild...OOH imagine that face to face controntation) and Tat couldn't take the heat and she quit rather than sit down and discuss the issues like rational adults with mediators to resolve it--after she said she would agree to that. <br>
<br>
HOLD EVERYTHING.. so sorry.. mistaken.. Tat is not rational, delusional and paranoid perhaps, but not rational.<br>
<br>
And its fairly low to charge your guild real life money and game items to host the web site AFTER THE FACT... but then again they got smart and punted ya for that.  Just like a lot of other guilds once you showed your true colors.<br>
<br>
Yeah I see how your reputation has grown by bounds and leaps here on Drinal.  To bad its in the negative direction.<br>
<br>
OH YEAH... I remember how you were so concerned about your private life (in posts you wrote and claimed I did after getting the personal info on you thru a friend, like why would I even care??) yet here, you brag and brag about all this personal stuff about your job and all that.  Funny how your /coughs privacy is not so important anymore.<br>
<br>
Tat your biggest problem has always been that you just do not know when to shut the hell up.  Ya ought to try it sometime....tho, I think its a bit late for that.. you have a list of folks who dislikes you a mile long on Drinal from what I see here.<br>

It just happens that it pissed you off to the degree that you followed me a year later in to my guild and then wrote a fucking thesis (pretty sure I still have it) about how your little orcie was stolen. A year later!! <br>
<br>
That my friends is the lesson I have been trying to teach. You see if you take your issues to public forum they are still an issue a year later when some freaky stalking wench is following you around and writing letters to your guild about the orc you stole from them in highkeep. <br>
<br>
A little history the way this whole &quot;Drinal&quot; debate began, Ceen, was because I emphasized that bringing issues to the public forum wasn't the right approach to solving problems I learned a lesson from your being an annoying/freaked out bitch about a posting I made 2 years ago when you petitioned about my charming an orc. The post was a letter written to customer service in the Sony forums I thought were designed for their recieving information (I was clearly wrong about that since what I wound up was 1.5 years - now two of a freaked out nosy bitch following me around)<br>
<br>
Good lord I was glad to get off the server with you. The only reason I ever accepted an officer position in my guild was to ensure that you wouldn't be accepted in to the guild because you wouldn't leave me the fuck alone.<br>
<br>
I don't have any need to keep my job or age a secret since you published it all in forum 2 years ago anyway. But everyone knows here anyway that I am lying and I'm a 2000lb man eating bon bons so it doesn't matter ;-)<br>
<br>
I can drum up a number of people who think you are a bitch Ceneedra I'd be worried about your own reputation instead of so focused on other people. <br>
<br>
Talk about 15 paragraph postings this girl had a 10 page Legal Deposition about how I charmed her orc in highkeep.<br>
<br>
So the bottom line still is - and has been- that posting in public forums accomplishes nothing (except you may get a freaky stalker chick who tries to follow you from guild to guild,and writes your guild about your forum postings 10 years later because dangit you stole her orc in highkeep and she wants it back ).<br>
<br>
Don't worry the excitement hasn't ended. She'll follow up then her brother will follow up too with a couple of anonymous accounts. They've been following up for 2 fucking years. You thought I posted a lot before that was just a warmup... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/29/01 3:20:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uceenedra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CeeNedra</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/01 3:04:03 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You have an obvious bad memory.  And many many many holes to your versions here.  I'll pick one.  A year later?  Dear... I still have all of the stuff on a system back up.. the complete thread from the EQ boards... everything.  Shall I expose you once and for all the liar that you are?  <br>
<br>
If my memory serves me correct, you were given the unofficial warn by Sr. Guide Lili in mid January 2000, I joined your guild the end of March 2000 and one of the reasons for doing so was to try to resolve the issues between us.  Do the math. Three months is not one year.  <br>
<br>
Also, EQ never apologized to you, according to what you said before they simply stated you did not receive an &quot;official&quot; warn, (but you were given a soft unofficial warn) because you wanted to know if it was on your record.  Besides, Verant doesn't apologize, we all know that.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is you got caught by the guides exploiting the use of a spell (charm) in order to take a mob that you did not attack first and for the purpose of denying others the right to kill that mob.  While your group was busy killing a few mobs you were busily charming all the others so that the other 2 groups as well as myself and my partner couldn't get any.  You even shouted your intent to charm.  You got caught red handed and you simply do not feel you were wrong. I was not the only one who petitioned, and Lili wasn't even the guide I talked to when my petition was answered.  But, she was there because of someone else's petition along with other guides who were invis I am sure, and YOU GOT BUSTED.  blah learn a lesson and move on.  I did that night.  Decided it wasn't worth hunting at HH with all the jerks there.  But instead you took it to the boards and attacked me and others by name to get back at me for you getting busted for your own actions.  And you did it for months on end and was determined to ruin my reputation by that and personally attacking by name anyone I was associated with.  All because I was the only one who admitted openly to you that I petitioned.<br>
<br>
BTW, Verant did remove the entire thread as well as every post you made on those boards when you were reported for Terms of Service violations.  I bet you wondered what happened to them huh?  )  <br>
<br>
Now, as for the stalking, you claimed I was stalking you, but wasn't it you that would seek out my posts I did in completely unrelated forums and post more of your shit and attack me for no reason during all of this?  I did not seek out your posts other than responding to you in that thread you started, but you were the one who sought out all my posts not just on that boards but on other boards as well.  And since when is it a crime to be in the same zone as you?  Just because I happen to be in the same zone as you, you said you petitioned I was stalking you?  That was pre Kunark btw, not many zones to pick from for level 20's and last I knew I could go to any zone I wanted and did NOT need your permission.<br>
<br>
And, contary to your delusional belief (no surprise there), I did not see any posts on Afterlife boards to find this place.  I stumbled by this ezboard quiet by accident while searching EZ boards and have come back because I seen so so much potential for &quot;entertainment&quot;.  You amuse me. But I am sure you do not think its fun being on the other side is it?  I didn't come here looking for you, but I found you anyway and was soo glad to see you get some of the same treatment you have dished out on others.  The difference is, you deserve it, the others were your victims.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I look forward to seeing more of your wonderful web creation ability.  That *is* what you do isn't it? Hacks have an amazing way to make things up and post it then claim their intended target created it.  Another of your famous tactics.  So, post something dear.  We all know you can do that easily enough you work with web stuff all the time.  It is so easy for someone with the web abilities you have to hack something apart and put it together to make it look like what you want then claim someone else did that.<br>
<br>
I can blow holes in your stories so big you're in danger of falling into the abyss.  But, you do keep me amused...So what are you going to come up with next?  =)<br>
<br>
/sits back to watch the show<br>
