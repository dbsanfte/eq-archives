There were torches along the walls, but they did little to keep the shadows at bay. These shadows he took advantage of. Sliding forward some more, he scanned the hallway as it ramped down deeper underground. Movement up ahead caused him to freeze. It seems his information was correct, these ancient ruins were still inhabited. By what, he could not find out past rumors and speculation. Some said Dark Elfs, some said more of the lizard race that inhabited these areas, still others said frogs such as those that used to inhabit Guk until they were wiped out by Dark Elfs and Trolls several years ago. It did not matter to him, a guard was a guard. If they found him he was most likely dead, something he did not wish to experience at this point in his life. He crouched down and watched until the guards, whatever they were, rounded a corner at the far end of the hallway and disappeared from sight. After a few minutes observation, he decided the guards up ahead would not come closer. It seems they, whatever they were, enjoyed the surface less than he enjoyed being underground. <br>
        His knees creaked as he stood up and slid back towards the entranceway. Having accumulated enough wealth over the past two years to finally purchase a home, he realized he missed his old chair and fireplace back in Al-Akanon. It was certainly better on his knees than crouching in a cold, damp passageway under a ruined city in the middle of nowhere hundreds of miles from any working fireplace. Contemplating how good a mug of fine Gnomish ale could be, he almost missed the faint sound of leather brushing against stone behind him. Instinct took over as he whirled, steel flashing as the dagger appeared in his hand. He reached for a leg and pulled, sending the intruder sprawling to the ground. Behind the figure now, he brought his knife around to slice the intruder's throat. Recognition halted his actions.<br>
        &quot;You would do well to listen when I tell you to stay back, Teir`Dal. You might live longer.&quot; A spot of blood, almost black in color, appeared at the point of his dagger as he pressed it against the Dark Elf's throat.<br>
        He could almost hear the amusement in her voice. &quot;Death does not concern me, rogue. Innoruuk protects. Besides, if there was any danger, you would be dead and I would be away from this place.&quot;<br>
        &quot;There is a danger, and I'm not dead yet.&quot; He left the dagger at her throat until he was sure her smile was gone. Blood trickled from the pinprick as he pulled the blade away and stepped back, his weapon disappearing into the cloak he had wrapped around him to try to keep the dampness away.<br>
        A`tlael rose to her feet and turned to face him, green eyes glowing faintly in the dark. &quot;What danger? This place is supposed to be deserted.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Not anymore.&quot; He watched with some satisfaction as she pulled out a small piece of cloth and dabbed at her wound. Of course, his face showed nothing. &quot;What do you think killed the Knight and his party?&quot; A`tlael shrugged at this. &quot;There are two guards at the far end of this hallway. They will not venture closer. Wait here until I return with his corpse.&quot; Ignoring her, he pulled out his map he had drawn and began to think about how to proceed. It wasn't the best map. Few had ventured down here, even fewer had returned, but he was sure it was accurate. An 'x' marked the spot where the Knight had died. But what if his corpse wasn't there any longer? It depended on how intelligent these...<br>
        &quot;Wait.&quot; His thoughts interrupted, he turned to look at A`tlael. &quot;This will help you if you run into trouble.&quot; <br>
        A look of concentration crossed her face as she began to cast a spell. He could barely hear what she was mumbling, let alone understand it, but he could hear the high-pitched wail that began to build up and seem to surround her. A`tlael reached into a hidden pouch and pulled out a gem. Tracing a pattern in the air with her other hand, she tossed the gem at him. Before he could blink or even reach out to catch it, the gem flashed out of existence as if snatched up by some unseen being, and the wail surrounded him. In the next instant the sound disappeared. Somehow he felt healthier, stronger. It was hard to describe, but he knew he would survive wounds and blows that would have killed him before she cast the spell.<br>
        &quot;Thanks. I'll be back shortly. Try to stay hidden.&quot; That wailing sound always made him uncomfortable when that spell was cast, but he had long ago learned to ignore his uneasiness.<br>
        &quot;Of course, M'Lord Rogue&quot; With a look of slight amusement, she stepped back into the shadows and seemingly disappeared. Only her dimly glowing eyes could be seen, and even then he had to look hard to see them. He couldn't have done a better job himself, though he would never admit it.<br>
        Niltik turned back to his map. He committed the path he would take to memory and slid the small piece of paper back into his pocket. He thought briefly about using his Dark Elf illusion for seeing better in the dimly lit passageways down here, but decided against it. He didn't want A`tlael to know all the tricks he had up his sleeve, and he might one day find himself needing to visit Neriak again. Plus, his small gnomish size would be an advantage here. <br>
        He made no sound as he crept from shadow to shadow, moving down the ramp. He strained his ears listening for the sound of any movement, and his eyes took in everything, but all was silent. His black cape and armor blended in perfectly with the shadows. Anyone observing would see A`tlael, as well hidden as she was, before they saw Niltik. He was in his element, and he was good enough to go anywhere he wanted to. <br>
        He quickly reached the end of the hallway, which stopped at a door. From a dark corner a few feet away, he examined the door and its latch, looking for any sort of device that would alert others of it being opened. It was made of a cold, grey stone, much like the walls of this place. The only difference was the pattern that was etched on the door. He noted this pattern and filed it away in memory. Preparing himself to get closer and check for locks, he almost stepped out of his hiding place when he heard the shuffling of heavy feet behind the door. He stopped, motionless, and held his breath as the latch turned and the door began to open. These must have been the guards he had seen earlier. Two figures stepped through. They weren't Dark Elfs, nor were they of the lizard race as he had thought. They were of the Froglok race, such as he hadn't seen for a long time. So the Teir`Dal hadn't wiped out the Guk frogs like they had boasted. Something was different about them, though, like the difference between Humans from Qeynos or Freeport and the roaving bands of Gypsies who had no town. They may have sprang from the same race, but it was obvious that time and distance had caused changes. He filed this information away, too. At the moment, he needed to get past them.<br>
        Unfortunately, they seemed to not be cooperating. He could not understand their language, but it was easy to tell they were having some sort of argument. They went on in their guttaral language, making gestures with their hands to punctuate what they were saying. One kept pointing to a flask that the other had tied to his belt. It must have been an argument about who's wine or whatever frogs drank was in that flask. He didn't much care for their argument. What he cared about was the fact that they were standing in front of the open door. It was impossible to sneak by them, and his knees were beginning to ache again.<br>
        As quietly as he could, he felt around for a rock or a pebble on the ground near him. He dared not take his eyes off the frogs to look. After a few moments search he found one. A little stone the size of a grape, he picked it up and clutched it in his hand. A quick glance to his right, and a flick of the wrist sent the pebble flying down the hallway to clatter into a corner halfway down. The argument stopped as the frogs turned to peer in that direction. &quot;Gluggluck!&quot; one said out loud, and started heading down the hall with a hand on his short sword. The other took a look behind him and then followed the other frog.<br>
        That was all Niltik was waiting for. His knees aching, keeping his eyes on the frogs, he peered through the doorway to make sure it was empty, and slid silently through. The passageway ramped down to the right and turned a corner at the end. The corner was hidden in shadow, and this was where he paused to examine his surroundings, for the passageway, turning to the left, opened up into an underground chamber big enough to fit two gnomish windmills in it.<br>
        There was a deep channel cut diagonally across the chamber, with what sounded like running water at the bottom. The floor was man-made, and had a dark-grayish color to it. The ceiling disappeared up into the shadows, so he could not see if it was also cut. He could only see two of the three bridges across the channel that he knew to be here. One on the far end that led to the other half of the chamber, one to his immediate right that led down a passageway, and one around the corner to his left that he could not see. It was this last one that he had to cross. <br>
        He stiffened as a pair of frogs came walking out of another passageway across from him. They crossed the bridge and seemed to pause to talk to another frog that he couldn't see. After a few minutes (during which he took the opportunity to stretch his legs), they continued walking towards him, turning to walk across the bridge to his right. Meanwhile, the guards that he had snuck past could be heard arguing again at the door. He had to move.<br>
        Scanning once again to make sure no one would see him, he darted to the edge of the channel and leaped over the low wall (for a human, he mused) and into the water. The cold nearly knocked the air out of his lungs, but he held on and dove deep. The sound of his dive was thankfully drowned out by a waterfall nearby. It was a perfect 180. A pair of Dwarven brothers he had met in Freeport had shown him how to dive in Lake Rathe. It had been a while, not since last summer, that he had been back to the main continent. Someday, he would have time to go home. Someday, but not any time soon.<br>
        In the meantime, he had to make it through the channel. Coming back up for air, he spotted a small ledge across the water that he could rest up at. It wasn't far to swim, but the cold water was leaving him more exhausted than he normally should be, and he had to make doubly sure he hadn't been seen. He climbed up on the ledge and looked around. The bridge wasn't too far off to his right, and it looked like he could climb up the side of the ledge near it to the passageway beyond. <br>
        He pulled out a strip of jerky from his ration pack and chewed on it, ignoring the fact that he was shivering from the cold. He could hear frogs casting nearby, which settled the question of their intelligence, and wondered how quickly one of their wizards would heat him up. Probably less than a few seconds, but of course he didn't want to find out. He had some trinkets that would help resist their effects, but he knew they wouldn't help much. Finishing the strip of jerkey, he got up and scrambled along the ledge to underneath the bridge. It helped that he was a good climber, too. He was, after all, a thief, and made short work of the climb to the top. It was dark here, thankfully, because when he snuck a peak over the side he saw three more frogs standing above him in conversation. Ducking back down, his heart pounding in his ears, he moved over to to his right along the side of the channel. He only needed a few feet, his padded boots would muffle any sound he made as he climbed over the top and ducked back into the shadows. He peaked back over the top. The frogs were about 10 feet away. Gathering himself, he pulled up and dropped down on the other side of the low wall and ducked into a dark corner. One frog glanced over his shoulder..he was getting sloppy in his old age. Staring at the frog, he willed it to look away. His heart was pounding in his chest, and he knew that the frog must have heard him. He got ready to pull a dagger out, knowing that he would most likely die, and held his breath. <br>
        After what seemed an eternity, the frog returned to the conversation, and Niltik crept back down into the passageway. He rounded a corner and finally let out his breath. That had been too close even for him. It was dark here, and he knew he was safe for the moment. It wasn't too much farther and he would to the spot marked 'x' on his map. His gut instinct told him to get to it and get the hell out of there, but then again he hadn't lived for so long as a thief doing what his gut told him. He paused to check his surroundings, listening for sounds of footsteps, looking for movement, anything. <br>
        The passageway was very dark, damp, and seemed to be warmer than up in that main room. Although, as wet as he was, he couldn't tell for sure. It was by sheer force of will that his teeth weren't chattering. He hadn't been this cold since he stole some ancient wand out of that dragon's lair up near the Barbarian city of Hallas. He still wasn't sure how he had lived through that, and looking back, he must have been insane for even trying. But then again, that necromancer had offered a huge sum of money for it, and Niltik had needed to pay off a couple of debts. <br>
        Thinking of sneaking into that lair with the dragon in its home, and getting in and out in one piece, he felt better. This was child's play compared to that. He took a breath and crept down the passageway, keeping one hand on the wall to guide his way. He couldn't see at all, and decided now that he better use his illusion. He reached into a hidden pouch in the lining of his cloak and pulled out a mask. Slipping it on, he felt his skin tingle as the mask seemed to become a part of his face. His viewpoint changed to roughly twice his gnomish height, and it became lighter in the passageway as his eyes changed to that of a Dark Elf. This mask was a very well-kept secret, 'acquired' from a Dark Elf High Lord's home in Neriak a few years back. He had done some research on it, and found out that it had originally come from Guk, probably a trophy looted out of the laboratory of some frog wizard. For all their haughtiness and claims of 'superior race,' Dark Elf's weren't that much different from anyone else.<br>
        He crept forward farther, and found the spot where the Knight and his party had died. It wasn't that hard to find. With his augmented vision, he could see old dried blood on the walls and the floor: Human blood mixed with Dark Elf blood mixed with what he assumed to be frog blood. It was fairly obvious they had been massacred. But where were the corpses? For a moment he panicked, thinking he had come this far for nothing. But his eyes picked up trails of blood that were obviously from the corpses being drug away. He followed it for a ways, and saw the corpses piled in a far corner. He smirked, thinking the frogs weren't so smart as to clean up these bodies. At least they weren't cannibals. It was a grisly sight, and if he were younger he probably would have retched. He had seen a lot in his lifetime, though, and this barely phased him. He scanned the bodies until he found the one he was looking for. The Knight's face was unrecognizable, but his armor was distinctive. Niltik crept down the passageway further to make sure he was alone. The passageway turned to the right and ended at another white building, guarded by two huge beetles and what looked like a statue, although his information told him this statue was alive. They were closer than he would have hoped, but if he was quiet he shouldn't draw any attention.<br>
        He crept back to the corpses and set to work. He stripped the Knight's body of his armor and wrapped each piece individually, finally wrapping them together in a large backpack. He couldn't drag the corpse out in one piece, there was just no way. Pulling out a knife, he cut the corpse in pieces. One arm was already half-torn from his shoulder, and there was little blood. He tried not to think about what he was doing as he placed the pieces in another bag and tied it shut. Wiping what blood there was off his hands using one of the other corpse's tunic, he gauged how heavy his package was. It probably weighed close to three hundred pounds, about three times what he weighed. Niltik had survived many experiences, though, by being prepared, and this was no exception. He pulled a small pouch out of one of his cloak's pockets, and pulled a vial out of the pouch. This vial had been bought at a high price from a shaman that his cousin knew from Hallas. &quot;Drink its contents and you'll have the strength of ten barbarians,&quot; the shaman had told him. Niltik pulled the stopper and drank the liquid. He grimaced, it sure had the stench of ten barbarians. Almost immediately, he started to feel the effects. His packs felt lighter, and he had energy like he hadn't felt since his youth in Al-Akananon. The shaman had said it would take a few minutes for the potion to take full effect. So he waited, testing his strength with the packages. Sure enough, after a few minutes, it felt like he was lifting feather-down pillows rather than a dead Knight. He strapped the backpack containing the armor on his back, and tucked the other backpack under his arm, and headed back up the passageway.<br>
        Fortunately, the three frogs he had run across were gone, and after watching for a while to make sure no one was coming, he slinked across the bridge to the side of another white building that he hadn't seen when he jumped down into the channel. This must be the building that leads to the exit, he thought. It was odd, but all his sources had told him the exit was in a different area than the entrance. Hearing movement behind him, he ducked into the entrance of the building to watch another group of frogs wander by. There was a door opposite of the corner he crouched in, and when it was safe he crept up to it and tested the latch. Opening it slowly, he saw a short hallway with another door at the end. He pushed through and closed the door behind him. No one was in this hallway, but he still approached the door with caution. He could see light under the crack of the door, so he set his packs to the side and put his face against the floor, trying to peer under the door. He could see the feet of a frog on the other side. He had hoped to not meet anyone, but he knew the frog wasn't going anywhere. There was no other way out of the next room except the door he was at and the exit, and the frog wasn't going to go outside. He thought for a second. It looked like the frog was standing with his back to the door...<br>
        Suddenly the latch turned on the door behind him. He jolted upright and froze. The door opened and a frog carrying a torch entered. Uh oh, Niltik thought, this ain't good. The frog's jaw dropped as it's eyes met Niltik's, but it recovered. Dropping the torch, it shouted and drew the sword at its side.<br>
        Niltik reacted quickly. A flash of steel was all that could be seen of the throwing knife that buried itself in the frog's neck. The frog let out a surprised gurgle and dropped to the floor. Whirling as the door opened behind him, Niltik barely had time to dodge out of the way of a quick sword thrust from the other frog. Instead of getting stuck in the back, the blade sliced his arm. Ignoring the wound, Niltik whipped his already drawn dagger around and stabbed the frog in the back as it stumbled forward, off-balanced. This dagger was a rogue specialty, with a hollow blade filled with fast-acting poison. Clawing at its back, the frog dropped its sword and fell to the ground, paralyzed.<br>
        Niltik didn't have time to watch the frog die. He heard footsteps coming as he snatched up his packages and ran through the door. The door opened up into a room with another door at the end. He ran to that as quick as he could and threw it open. Skidding to a halt, he saw it was a dead end. There was no where to go. The exit should have been there! The only thing in the room was a rotten chair in one corner, a raised platform across from the door, and cobwebs. He turned as he saw four frogs come streaming out of the door. He whipped out two throwing knifes and launched them one after the other, dropping two more frogs in quick succession. Another began to run toward him with sword drawn, while the other one stood there and began tracing patterns in the air with his hands. A wizard! Niltik began to back up into the room. He screamed in agony as the wizard's spell went off and steal lanced into him. He couldn't believe he was going to die to these stupid frogs thousands of miles away from home. The frog with the sword came closer and took a swipe at him, and he jumped back, dodging the swing...<br>
        And landed outside the entrance! Haha! he laughed to himself, a stupid teleport! Then the pain of his wounds set in, and he almost fainted. He was back in gnome form, the teleport must have canceled his mask's effect. Slipping it back off and tucking it away in his hidden pocket, he wiped off the blood..his blood, that was flowing from countless wounds. He dropped the packages and snuck back towards the entrance. It was a one-way entrance, magical in nature, and he couldn't get back in without having to go through that ordeal again. Shaking from loss of blood, but still alive, he spotted where A`tlael sat hidden in shadows and let out a bird whistle. Her head whirled, she must have been staring down the hallway. Her eyes widened as she saw the state that he was in. She stood and closed her eyes in concentration. He saw her mumbling as she began to cast. She ended the spell with a jerking motion of her hand, and disappeared. Niltik had a moment's of panic, thinking she had left him to his own demise, but realized it was a simple gate spell. Turning around, he saw her standing behind him, casting a second spell already. He wondered what she might be casting as his vision began to dim. A dim voice in the back of his head told him he was dying as he slumped to the ground. <br>
        He awoke what must have seemed an eternity later, but what actually must have been only a few seconds. A blue aura was fading from him, and he realized that the Dark Elf cleric had cured his wounds and saved his life at the last moment. He wiped away the blood from his eyes as he stood up.<br>
        &quot;I thank you,&quot; he said.<br>
        She sat down, a weariness passing across her face, gone almost as soon as he noticed it. &quot;Innoruuk protects,&quot; was all she said as she sat, her eyes on him. &quot;Did you find what we came for?&quot;<br>
Niltik nodded. &quot;He's in that satchel there,&quot; he pointed.<br>
        &quot;Not a very tall Knight,&quot; she said as she looked at the backpack.<br>
        &quot;Not now, no.&quot; She raised an eye quizically.<br>
        Niltik didn't say anything, but walked over to the backpack and dumped its contents out on the stone floor. He heard an &quot;oh&quot; from A`tlael as he rearranged the body parts back together.<br>
        &quot;Yes, he is tall. To be expected from a human.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You can...repair this, right?&quot; Niltik asked. He had heard she could, which was why he had sought her out.<br>
        &quot;Yes, it will take a moment to prepare.&quot;<br>
Niltik nodded, and went off to the corner to rest. As he had expected, the wizard's spell had dried out his clothes, and blood had never bothered him. He would clean off at the stream he had discovered in the jungle on the way here. There wouldn't be much time, though, before he had to meet up with the rest of his companions, so they would have to move quickly. There never seemed to be much time these days. He thought of home again, and decided that soon he would retire, and for good this time. He thought of his chair and fireplace again, imagined maybe a Mrs. Niltik stirring that night's dinner in the kettle in the fireplace..<br>
        His head jerked up to the sound of A`tlael mumbling encantations. He must have dozed off. He rubbed his eyes and watched. This spell was different from the ones she had casted before. He had seen it maybe once or twice in his lifetime. The air shimmered with the workings of true power, and a whine, barely audible at first, began to swell. The Knight's naked body began to glow blue, faintly at first but getting so bright that Niltik had to shield his eyes. He did not want to look into that blue light anyways. He had once, and it had given him nightmares for weeks after. The whining began to die down, and the blue glow faded away. He looked back to see A`tlael slump to the ground, the price one payed for working powerful magic.<br>
        She mumbled a barely audible &quot;I must rest. He will begin stirring soon,&quot; and crawled off to rest against a wall. Niltik got up and went over to the other backpack. He emptied out the contents and unwrapped the pieces. He laid out the sword and shield next to them, and sat down to wait.<br>
        Soon the Knight began to stir. His hand twitched, and clenched into a fist, as if around some unseen weapon. He rolled over and groaned. Once, then louder. Then his eyes shot open, and he let out an inhuman scream as he remembered the pain of death. Niltik shivered at the core of his being, terrified at that blood-curdling sound as he had been but few times in his life. He saw A`tlael raise her head and stare at the Knight, then lower it again as she fell back into her meditation. Clerical skills were best left to people with more nerve than he.<br>
        The Knight lay still for a few more moments, then he sat up and took in his surroundings. He looked at Niltik with unblinking eyes, then turned to look at A`tlael.<br>
        &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said in a dry voice.<br>
        A`tlael looked up at him. &quot;Innoruuk protects.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Innoruuk protects,&quot; he returned, and Nitlik saw something unspoken pass between them. He decided it was best to pretend he hadn't seen that. The Knight turned to him.<br>
        &quot;Thank you.&quot; Niltik nodded, then pointed to the Knight's belongings. The Knight got up and went over to them. He looked them over, nodded to himself, then began putting on his armor after a moment's pause. First was the underclothing, then the padding for the armor, and finally the armor itself. It was of a dark color, almost black, with a hint of red. Won on the field of battle against enemies of his god, its finish had dulled with age, but remained undented. Such was the equipment of a Knight of Innoruuk.<br>
        Lastly, he picked up his sword and shield. He held the sword there for an instant, examining its faintly glowing blade, then sheathed it. He turned to Niltik.<br>
        &quot;Thank you again. I am endebted to thee. Alas I admit I am curious, though. Why return me from the dead? And why not the rest of my companions. Surely thou hath a reason for such.&quot;<br>
        Niltik nodded. &quot;Indeed I do, Lord Norsith. I was sent to retrieve you for information that you hold. This information could not be lost due to your untimely death. So I was told to recover you.&quot;<br>
        The Knight thought this over. &quot;At least thou knowest who you bring back from the depths of hell. Who hast sent thou? And what information doest thou think I might hold?&quot;<br>
        Niltik looked at A`tlael. She appeared to be meditating, but he knew she would hear. No matter, a larger purse would ensure she forgot. He turned to the Knight. &quot;Lord Sorich, stationed at the Teir`Dal outpost on this continent sent me. At this very moment he assembles forces in Karnor, with the aid of the Drolvergs, to take down the dragon Trakanon. He was told that you know where Trakanon is, and how to kill him.&quot;<br>
        Norsith's eyes widened, the first emotion Niltik had seen cross his face, but it quickly passed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw A`tlael look up. She was obviously interested. Who on this continent couldn't be? He might have to kill her after all.<br>
        &quot;Yes, I do have that information.&quot; Niltik noticed A`tlael return to her meditation. &quot;And I do know Lord Sorith. I doubt thou art foolish enough to come up with such a falsehood. If thou art, however, you shall regret it to your ending days, as few as thou willst have left of them.&quot; <br>
        Niltik nodded solemnly. He had heard worse threats in his lifetime, but a threat from a Knight of Innoruuk was nothing to trifle with. &quot;If you are ready, we must hur-&quot;<br>
        &quot;Trakanon resides inside this city.&quot; Norsith pointed at the entranceway.<br>
        Niltik's jaw dropped. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw A`tlael's eyes widen. To his dying day he would remember only this once in his lifetime being shocked speechless. He would have been less shocked if someone had convinced him his mother was a dwarf. This city that he had just wandered in to, thinking all the time that it was like a walk in the park...<br>
        He thought he noticed a twinkle of amusement in the Knight's eye. He recovered enough to close his gaping mouth and form words. &quot;Lord Sorich...must know immediately.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Then we must hurry,&quot; Norsith replied. Niltik nodded and scrambled to his feet. He looked at A`tlael.<br>
        &quot;If you are ready, Teir`Dal...&quot;        <br>
