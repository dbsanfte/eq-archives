<br>
<br>
I was bound in Skyshrine. Why skyshrine?<br>
<br>
because of a raid I did earlier in the week.<br>
<br>
it was a pickup raid, and a druid ported me to dreadlands, I ran to karnor's, and got a port to EJ.<br>
<br>
we went far into CoM, and died past a door that was locked.<br>
<br>
I waited for about an hour for this rogue to help pull corpses. He couldn't, so we needed a necro to summon.<br>
<br>
I spent another hour trying to find a druid to port me to dreadlands from Cobalt scar...the druid who ported me the first time logged off.<br>
<br>
I found a druid. thanked him, and ran off to karnor's to see if I could get a port to EJ. <br>
<br>
when I got into karnor's there were 3 druids in there.<br>
<br>
I asked the first one kindly, and explained my situation...he said, sorry, i'm in a group.<br>
<br>
I asked the second one...he said sorry, i'm the leader of the group.<br>
<br>
I asked the third one, and he said he was in the warlord room.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, at least  2 hours had past.<br>
<br>
I asked the first one (blacklotus) if he could disband for a few, and port me....I really needed the help.<br>
<br>
sorry if I get lost quite a bit while running...I have a shitty graphics card, and the clipping plane has to be at minimal for it not to lag up and crash.<br>
<br>
blacklotus responds: sorry. low on mana....<br>
<br>
at this point, I know he's feeding me bull shit excuses.<br>
<br>
so I try to argue my point that it's really important, and that I can give him mana song to compinsate for lost mana.<br>
<br>
after 30mins or so...45 at the most, I get a port...<br>
<br>
<br>
Now it might have been faster to run...but coupled with the fact that my graphics card is shitty, and my clipping plane has to be at minimal, and there's a good chance I could get lost...I didn't want to take that chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
and at the same time, I had the necro wanting to leave, cause he was tired...<br>
<br>
I know a corpse lasts 1 week before rotting, but to get a res, it only lasts 3 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had people ask me to drag corpses for them all the time...weather i'm in a group or not...i'll help em out...unless it's a raid that i'm on, and i'm not at a point where I can leave it to help. Or, if i'm in a place in a zone where I can't leave.<br>
<br>
<br>
Could I have run to CoM? sure<br>
<br>
Would I have made it? maybe<br>
<br>
in the long run, it probably would have been better for me to run....I can't rely on ANY druid.<br>
<br>
but I guess it's my fault for thinking that others would be willing to lend a hand when someone needs help.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, if you're going to be an bitch, and not port someone....say it to their face. tell them.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to port you. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Don't feed them bull shit answers like....Sorry, I'm in a group....or sorry I'm low on mana. or sorry, i'm about to camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's what i'm really upset about here.<br>

<br>
Take some responsibility for your gaming experience rather than expecting others to make up for the short-comings of your equipment.  If you expect that from others, you'd better be making some solid friends in this game who don't mind taking some time out to rescue you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrevize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trevize</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 8:34:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flame on druids/wizards.</span><hr size=1> Nice quote of mine out of context Boof.

I can see your point Doofy, but look at the other side of it. Until we can evac from anywhere, the evacs have to come from Karnor's. I get into Karnor's wanting to group, because *Gasp* yes I too would like some experience for the money I pay per month. Just because &quot;You&quot; ask for a gate, doesn't mean that 30 people in front of you haven't asked too. Now if I were to be saying &quot;Okay sure, I'll port everyone till they are where they need to go&quot; I would never get a group. I play a druid because I would like to be able to port myself around, Sure there are times I go in there and just messing around and bored, so I port people around. But I don't appreciate when someone is &quot;expecting&quot; me to port them. What if there was nobody in that zone for 3 hours to port you, Are you going to sit there for 3 hours asking for a port? That's a little silly to me. So you are telling me you chose a bard so you could ask for rides all the time and expect them to kneel before you oh great one and port you so you can continue your gaming exp, so what if a druid loses a spot in an exp group, you got to where you needed. That sounds a little bit selfish to me. If you needed to be ported around all the time, why didn't you make a druid or a wizard? As for binding, Why should we &quot;have&quot; to bind in the spot to accommodate you? What if we are bound in a spot, because maybe we had plans later and needed to be in another bind point? You could have had drums in the bank, sow potions, etc.. I do realize to you this was an emergency, but how many emergencies happen everyday? All of these people think it is a dire emergency that they be ported immediately so their corpse doesn't rot too. After asking the druids and or Wizards in the zone if they could do it, whether they wanted to or not was their choice, You chose to wait around till someone felt bad enough? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucloemystletoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CloeMystletoe</A> at: 6/26/01 7:05:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwysteriaplushfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wysteria Plushfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/26/01 9:51:14 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wait a sec</span><hr size=1> Amen, Sister Cloe!  <br>

Lets rewrite the complaint slightly...<br>
<br>
Now, I admit that Donald Trump did come through when I desperatly needed $200 to buy a bus ticket from kansas for a pig calling contest.<br>
<br>
but GOD DAMN! I sat there for 45mins pleading with him.<br>
<br>
You wanna know what answers I got when I tried asking people for help?<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, working.<br>
Sorry, low on money.<br>
Sorry, busy right now.<br>
Get a job you bum!<br>
<br>
These are acceptable answers, but NOT when your fucking sitting in a cornfield in kansas, and I'm a fucking farmer that has several bales of hay (which stack),making farmers able to have THE HIGHEST HAYSTACKS IN THE  COUNTRY. well, besides the rancher's ability to just give all his beef to a butcher.....but that's besides the point.<br>

You are saying that you are flaming this particular druid and all druids and wizards, because they didnt drop what they were doing to gate you somewhere?  Last I checked this is a game, and those people have things they might like to be doing as well.  If the person was in Karnors in a group, and you asked for an evac, you expect them to up and drop group (leaving them short of a evacer, nuker, healer) and hurry to gate you, so that they can then gate back to wherever they are bound (might not even be in karnors) so they can go back to group.  <br>
<br>
Thats insane!  I know quite alot of gaters that go out of their way, and spend more time being taxi's than actually playing...but you are mad because one is actually getting some playing time in and wont drop it all for someone they barely know if at all?<br>
<br>
Best thing would be for you to ask your guild, or a friend for this.  If you are not able to because they are busy, then why are you getting mad that a complete stranger is busy also?<br>

BTW, I seem to remember you ranting against druids before, and on the druid website last time.  Please remember, this is a game, and no one HAS to buff you, or heal you, or gate you, or drag your corpse.  People do these things because they have the time, and they like to help usually.  I would be more than happy to buff you anytime you ask, and I am right there, but NOT if it means I have to leave my group, and spend over 10 mins doing it...<br>
<br>
Of course, I could be totally confused about this.  I really cannot see anyone complaining about something as crazy as that.  <br>

Gosh, Aleal must of read my suggestion in the &quot;suggestions for the board&quot; area about edits.  Honest, I asked for Tat to get her edit removed, not me, lol.  Oh that is too funny.  If you all want a small chuckle, go check out my post there.<br>
<br>
Okay...to edit the above message... <br>
<br>
I run to Sebillis all the time from FV...all the time.  Its easier for me to do that (takes 10 mins tops) than beg around and see if guild has someone who can drop everything to gate me...its not that far.  It is only a few zones away....FV to Swamp to Trak to Seb, easy sleezy.<br>
<br>
I have never died on that run, and I have made it naked before too.<br>
<br>
Find me in game, and I will be happy to show you the tricks to get there running from FV...its just wall hugging mostly.<br>

<br>
<br>
so lemmie break it down.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) druid that could port was IN KARNOR's.<br>
2) Druid that could port was at ZONE.<br>
3) Druid's only excuse was that he was in a group...which had another druid in it that could port...so it wasn't like he was required for the group to function.<br>
<br>
Now I guess the point isn't so much that he wouldn't port me, it's that he was making up excuses NOT to port me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I could have raised him back to full mana within a matter of a couple mins...the whole thing would have been alot safer, and faster if he would have accepted. So other than the fact that they were lazy, I have no problems.<br>
<br>
If he would have said off the bat that &quot;how much time you got left on your corpse?....you think you can make it running? cause I just got in a group, and i've been porting people all day.&quot; I would have been happy with that answer, and gone on my &quot;not very marry&quot; way.<br>
<br>
But he gave me the answer &quot; sorry, in a group &quot;....which doesn't mean jack when you're in karnor's at the zone.<br>
<br>
and then he gave me the answer &quot;sorry, i'm low on mana&quot; my response....I have 2 mana songs that stack...I can get you to full mana in a matter of a couple mins, and I really need this port.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Boofy did not sell his account...he gave it to me. I now have 2 accounts, and 2 computers....one of the computers was unusable during the time.<br>
<br>
I do play boofy from time to time, and I do port people. However when people ask me for ports, and I don't want to port them, I let them know that i've been porting people for the past (x) amount of time, and I'd rather not...but if it's an emergency, such as the one I had...then I make an honest effort to help the person out in some way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=272.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=269.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://clicks.about.com/157/spkcpa.asp?PM=485_d_ezboard_spcpa&rURL=https%3A//sprinks.about.com/userforms/create_user.htm%3Fpc%3Dd_ezboard" target="_blank">
