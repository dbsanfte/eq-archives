Take me and Jorply, he has been raggin my ass ever since I wouldnt let him help me because he knows he had a rep of stealing sheet from people's corpses (when you could do that sorta thing)<br>
<br>
But do I bad mouth him to others or post on boards about how Jorply is an ass etc etc etc?<br>
<br>
No of course I dont, I am not that way and people who KNOW me know I dont do stupid shit like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its when I get a tell from someone saying, Jorply said you were an ass or whatever (which has never happend, just and example) then I would be a little peeved that a person I have never played/grouped with was judging me based on someone else opinion.<br>

I dont recall this.  I was a total ass i'll admit when I started playin this game, and i wasnt really aware that it would come back at me, but it did and I learned from it.  But before you come here and try to start some shit with someone you know nothing about, and call me a greedy prick in tells, and someone that everyone should steer clear of, u gotta ask yourself a question. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?  No one knows you, and you're just acting like im the big bad asshole pickin om some innocent person here.   I *OFFERED* to help you get your corpse way back when, and you ignored me, and said that i'd steal your stuff (Which I have *never* EVER done to someone - i'm still waiting for you to post these mysterious persons that I have stolen corpses from)<br>
<br>
And you know what if you can't accept me for who I am then tough shit, right?  People that actually *know* me know that im not the &quot;prick&quot; you make me out to be. I'm doin fine in this game, and I got lots of friends, and i'm in a wonderful guild.<br>
<br>
You know people really have a lot of nerve coming here posting things like this on a whim about someone. You dont know jack about me, you dont know jack about who I am, and you dont know jack about what you're talking about. But now that I know much more about you, I am going to make sure that I go out of my way to make your ingame time more hectic. You can thank yourself and your big mouth!<br>

=( I can't imagine him being a mean guy ever<br>
<br>
and he had the balls to even admit to being an asshole when he first started playing<br>
<br>
Whoever you are, let it die.. this stuff happened a long time ago. you say you wont "flame" him.. but basically, you just did. I mean.. LOOK:<br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>"But do I bad mouth him to others or post on boards about how Jorply is an ass etc etc etc?<br>
<br>

<br>
You basically just came here and bad mouthed him.. look.. you called him an asshole, even if you didn't directly say "Jorply is an asshole", you emplied it very well. I think you are eating your own words and owe Jorply an apology, because the way it sounds.. he has already apologized to you, and you are taking the first chance you get to come here and make a complete jerk of yourself. Well you know what? I just died a stupid death, I am tired.. I am pmsing.. and my neice is sick and may have to be in the hospital on iv fluids.. too much info? I don't care.. how's this: EQ IS A GAME.. GET OVER IT!<br>
<br>
It's funny how some people hold grudges until the day they die. If you ask me, it's rather pathetic. Give it up already.<br>
<br>
I don't know you, but it's obvious you have already done some stupid shit.<br>
<br>
I think I need to stop posting. goodnight.  <p><br><p>Elaylie D`Eris -

<br>
I was told, not even a week before, you asked to 'help' me with my corpse in lower guk.<br>
As if a 40+ cleric (at the time) needs help getting a corpse outta lower guk dead side :roll:<br>
<br>
I am sure Jorp is a great guy, but I will never know because of those things he has done to me personally.<br>
<br>
You have harrassed me ingame for no reason.<br>
<br>
We all know who gives tells to who ingame, and I only came on after Jorply started harrassing me ingame again in WC very recently.<br>
<br>
He knows what he did and when I mentioned Jorps name in guild chat, someone told me about this board and I came here and lo and behold Jorp's banging on me here too.<br>
<br>
All I was saying was give the guy (Colaneb (sp) ) a chance IF you dont know him.<br>
<br>
I KNOW what guild Jorp is in, and Jorp, I have been around as long as you have (in EQ).<br>
<br>
We just dont like each other, never have and never will, our reasons are ours alone, no need to get into all the details.<br>
<br>
<br>
****Formal announcement****<br>
<br>
I have no proof (as if any could be offered in EQ) that Jorply stole items from corpses when he would tell people, &quot;Hey consent me and Ill drag your corpse to zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Back when you could do such a thing in EQ.  <br>
<br>
Anyways I have no proof he stole peoples items from thier corpses.<br>
<br>
****End Announcement****<br>
<br>
There Jorp you satisified?<br>
<br>
Just stop giving me tells ingame, I considered the matter over-with almost 18 months ago.  YOU keep bringing old business back, not I.<br>
<br>
The matter is over and irrelevant as the harm you may have done (if the allegations are true) is against persons who are long gone from EQ.<br>
<br>
Remember Jorp you asked me, &quot;Why did you let me help you in Lower Guk?&quot;<br>
<br>
I gave you the answer why I didnt let YOU help ME.<br>
<br>
Sorry you dont like the answer.<br>
<br>
***Reponse to Gwen*****<br>
<br>
I was giving an example.  If you can re-read what I posted and determine its meaning you would see that I said I DONT come here posting that Jorp is an ass, that does NOT insinuate he is one, OR that Im saying he is one.  It just states I dont come here saying he is because of this reason or that reason.<br>
<br>
Please graduate the 5th grade before flaming somone please.<br>
<br>
Anyhow it was YOU that said he apologized for being and ass, so you agree that he did some stupid shit in his early years.<br>

<br>
 You know very well that on these boards, all you have to do is mention someones name. You wanted to start something with Jorply, and you did. (EDIT: You say you meant no disrespect.. well think of how you would feel if the tables were turned, and you had some slut coming on here slandering your name across this board and saying "oh, but I am such a nice person, I don't flame anyone, I mean no disrespect" You know what.. I MEAN TO DISRESPECT YOU.. I mean everything I am saying now. Got that? Good.)<br>
<br>
Now YOU tell ME to graduate from the 5th grade before flaming someone? What the fuck ever. Get your fucking tampon out of your cunt before coming here and opening your goddamned trap you skank.<br>
<br>
I play this game to have fun, that is all I do. I am sick of people judging me for being silly. Do you fucking jerks have no sense of humor or something? I am sick of all the bitchy everquest people who cry about every goddamned thing that doesn't go their way. <br>
<br>
I am nice to everyone and try to treat everyone how I would like to be treated, when I see someone being treated wrong, I will say something. It's obvious as I have spoken in the previous post.<br>
<br>
I don't throw a pitty party everytime someone makes me mad or things don't go my way.. it's obvious you do. <br>
<br>
You ARE insinuating he is an asshole, everything you keep saying is just that. Bringing his name into your posts is saying "I think Jorply is an asshole" You came to a post that had NOTHING at all to do with him and brought his name into it. You could have just used an anonymous name and let it be. But it's obvious you are an attention starved whining crying fucking cowhead with bleeding utters. <br>

I didn't even call you any names or be mean to you, I just said "Get over it" oh.. my bad, did I hit a weak spot and piss you off by telling you to get over something that happened a long time ago? <p><br><p>Elaylie D`Eris -

<br>
Jorply for president!<br>
<br>
So anyway if you have a problem with someone dont be a jerk and try and hide behind a false name while you point fingers and cry, just makes you less of a man than Jorply to begin with. <p><P>

P.S. Windaylia, this Moonbaem (can't spell beam apparently) is a real chick in EQ. Not gonna say what guild she is in because it was her doing the bitching, not her guild.. but she's not hiding behind anything, except her computer. <p><br><p>Elaylie D`Eris -
