Apologies to Arrora, didn't mean to be rude. Was nice to see you on the thread. That's what I meant, didn't come out that way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Meinea, you call me names I call you names back. Point is you just admitted to what sexual harassment is and if you check on my posts before you'll see that i respect women's wishes to be left alone. I would kinda like you to admit that you were wrong about the whole thing. Not gonna call you names, cause i'm above that. Yeah, holier than thou if ya like. cause you kept hammering stuff you don't know what you talking about just repeating stuff like some parrot. Well, everyone is wrong at least once, no?<br>
Yeah to those folks that pointed that I involved some names, like Aubree. Yeah I admit, u're absolutely right. Sorry about dragging her name into this, although she did start the whole thing. <br>

<br>
When you're done pleasuring yourself, please remove my vibrator from your ass and.... On second thought just destroy it... I have no idea how I'd sanitize it.  <br>
<br>
As has been pointed out by others, you don't know when to quit.  If your final word on every subject attitude hold the same to hitting on woman, I find this very easy to believe.<br>
<br>
Fact is I've dealt with people just like you all too many times.  From guys who won't let me even try out for their band because 'We need a guitar player, not a chick singer' (been playing for about 22 years now), the slime ball at the bar who won't stop making lewd remarks until my hubby steps in and asks assmunch_063 to step outside, to the guy at the office who feels the need to whistle any time I wear a skirt.<br>
<br>
You wanna pickup on easy chicks then complain about how they're never loyal... keep it to the personals, singles bars, and all inclusive adult recreation facilities.  EQ is not the time or place for it.  If you find some 'hot-chick' toon that gets saucy with you, by all means proceed, but your first assumption of every toon you meet on any server should be two fold... 1) said toon is being played by a male.  2) said toon is a minor (I know that statistcally EQ players are over 30, but better safe than sorry).<br>
<br>
As to calling names, you started it.  Right off the bat you flamed ALL women everywhere as unfaithful whores whose only purpose was to lick your balls.  You claimed two contradicting things to back paddle... hey!  I'm only role playing, and you were angry.  Well guess what?  You made a lot of enemies because you evidently don't have enough sense to to think before you speak.  This ain't no role playing forum (oh and btw Role Playing Games have very little to do with what I perceive your definition of role playing is), that's the unused section over there somewhere.<br>
<br>
Now let's take a real world example.  Husband/Boyfriend gets all mad and beats the shit out of his girlfriend.  Later he confesses that he was just really angry and he blew his top... sorry honey.  Well guess what?  It's too late.  Unfortunately for the world too many woman live in these types of relationships (I am NOT one), but none of them should have to and in fact there are laws to support us.<br>
<br>
Your post, while not physically damaging isn't very different from this example.<br>
<br>
You want this all to stop?  I have a recommendation, stop.<br>
<br>
As to you being above me.  I don't know what planet you live on, but where I come from we scrape shit like you off our boots before we go indoors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugauzesponge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gauze sponge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>1st post by this guy</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 8:23:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   here</span><hr size=1> /em hands star a shovel <br>

It must be hard for you to say that u're sorry and just shut up.<br>
I pity any man that comes your way. Even if u were a sex bomb, but I did'nt like you, all your assets and titties wouldn't do u any good. I'll just ignore you. Woman like you can't be satisfied period. Why bother with you, u live in self-denial.<br>
So u're married an jealous that I'm single and I can check out any booty i want. Just answer me one question. Do you think that women are superior to men then? Because that becomes obvious from your posts. I already told you what I think about ppl like you. No need to repeat. <br>

<br>
Were did you get the idea she was jealous of you for not being in a committed relationship? She turns other men down. She is sick of other men cackling and making cat calls at her. It's rude and makes women who have men thankful that they can use the "i have a man" as another reason for men like you to FUCK OFF! <br>
<br>
I've been staying away from this, but your vision of women is delusional. We aren't on this earth to keep men satisfied. It's not our job. Every time you type out these posts all it does is show how desperate you are for something that you will never get. It's like you created your own ideals and fantasize of how you thought women should be through your porns. Then went out in the real world and actually expected things to be that way. WAKE UP. The closest you'll ever come to "titties" is when your mom used to breast feed you. You need to come back to reality. Women don't care about men like you and we don't run around pleasing men. The only men that have the slightest chance of grabbing our attention are ones that treat us like equals and nothing less! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeienea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meienea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of the Cat  bag</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 12:22:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: here</span><hr size=1> Thanks, I think I will eat a dick tonight.  Not yours of course, assuming you have one.<br>
<br>
I can shut up, however I am being addressed here so why should I?  I will be satisfied when you shut your sexist mouth and crawl back into your cave.  Am I jealous of you?  Ha!  My husband and I have something you will never know.  We have a real relationship, with real emotions, an active sex life that doesn't require us to get checked for STDs or use latex.  We own two houses, have a beautiful son, our own garage recording studio and are doing really well... you?  Don't bother, cause I really don't care.  If a man doesn't look, (even my man) he must be dead (same goes for the girls btw).  There is nothing you have that I would ever want.<br>
<br>
Women superior to men?  Where the hell did you come up with that?  Again, don't bother, cause I really don't care to hear your bullshit.  I believe in equality between the sexes.  We are different and thank God for that.  You're actually the one who touted the superiority of the male sex, so go suck a sock and stop back peddling.  Actually if you knew any of the men in my life (real or game) you'd know that I have never shown any form of gender, race, religious, or political bias toward anyone.  I don't despise you because you're male.  I despise you because you're you.<br>
<br>
As to saying I'm sorry.  I can do that too.  However there is nothing I have said to you that I am sorry about.  You are worthless piece of shit and the more you type the more you prove it.<br>
<br>
Now for an appology.  To all the folks who are sick of this rage against Sternolad, I really am sorry.  The sooner he shuts his mouth the sooner I'll stop having to shovel his shit back in it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/02 12:47:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: here</span><hr size=1> Please dont apologize Meien, no need, and this is very entertaining read.<br>

<br>
was at the movies with my wife and a few friends, buddies and I had walked over to a bar to grab a drink while the ladies were getting tickets...<br>
<br>
after a quick shot and a beer, walkin back over to the theatre, we see a couple of baggy panted teens trying hard to pick up on the girls, they of course just blowing them off when one of them says, and i will never forget this ' oh come on you know you wanna fuck '  right to my wife, just as we walked up... it never felt so good to openhand smack someone across the face like that, and to see that little pissant lying on the concrete crying his fucking eyes out... <br>
<br>
so starn, do us all a favor, and try some of that macho bullshit out in public, if were lucky someone like me is standing just around the corner ready to beat your pathetic ass down<br>

If you really like I'll answer your issues one by one, but here I'm going to address a few other people's post. Ok, how many times I have to say, that this is NOT RL. Read it again and see that this is NOT RL.<br>
If after reading this you still think this applies to RL and you post that you think I'm like this in RL, then you're a hopeless case. Second, there are all sorts of situations in RL where some conduct is acceptable, some bordeline and some is not acceptable. The examples posted here and a link implied to me were clearly of the conduct that was not acceptable. Check my posts and see if I said anything that would apply <br>
, again, in RL. <br>
Third, Meienea. You keep hammering the same issue.<br>
I already said that I'm sorry and apologized to everyone on the ill-fated post and you can verify that. What you did however which annoyed me very much is that you just did not accept it. You keep on hammering and hammering the same shit over and over. It's like keeping to hit your opponent who already gave up. Now, when you do something like that do you really think that person will say, gee oh thanks for adding on top of that.  No. There is a line that draws a victor from an abuser. So, at this point I consider now you as an aggressor. So I started giving back to you. I said that i'm sorry for the post and I said that i don't think men are superior, it was not enough for you. Naturally, I started thinking perhaps you hold that men are inferior. <br>
The comments that I've made about you were in response you made about me. If you look at your own posts carefully, you will that you call me a piece of shit and other colorful adjectives in every post, plus adding certain personal piece of imagination in assigning my character, traits and everything.<br>
And when I used the tactis of reflection in the mirror, you got all amazed and innocent now. Come on. Maybe that tactics works when you deal with your kids, but not with me. I don't have to take any shit from you either. You despise me and I don't like you. So leave it at that. Arrora, I never made a pass at Meinea so your argument about how other guys hit on her and stuff is without merit. If it is, it doesn't apply to my case.<br>
Also, remember the rule, speak for youself. Yes, I broke that rule with my bad generalization in the opening post, but I admitted that I was wrong.  Now, how many times do I have to say that I'm sorry? I'll tell you. I said it, I admitted it. Case is closed. Don't push it. Nothing is ever clear as black and white. <br>
Araefel, you are a sick bastard. If you're so much into gay sex, find yourself someone and leave me alone. Ok? That is an express request. I like girls and despite what some think (as if I cared) they also like me. So drive your drivel some place else. Zenia, obviously in your example you didn't think that I would agree with you no? Surprise, I would react much the same way as you did. Also, concerning the ass-handling, it is wise not to make any statements before you consider the opposition no? Just like in the game, you /con the mob before u attack it. Similar concept. Big man doesn't necessarily win the fight, and if my words by themselves don't convince you, then take it from someone with a black belt in karate. <br>
Now to the rest of you. Before you post people and continue flame. Next time don't just state your presumptions/assumptions or whatever else that comes forth with your imagination but try to support it with facts, quotations etc. Then it would be much easier to discuss stuff.<br>
I too can say, hey you b**** prove that you are not an ass.<br>
Well, how would you prove that you're not? It's a famous trap.<br>
People are not stupid here you know :-) <br>
Until next time. You want to have last word. Earn it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ustarnolan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starnolan</A> at: 5/22/02 8:11:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaraefeldown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AraefelDown</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Down!

You know shit - you do not have a belt, you are like those complete asswipes in grade school that say, &quot;I have a black belt in karate - dont mess with this.&quot;.... right before they get their ass handed to them. Get a life little man - you have shown your true nature with every post, apologizing wont help - u r screwd. As for me being in gay sex *lol* ask anyone (/nudge Caria) just how &quot;gay&quot; I am - that is your father you must be thinking of after he realized he married a chimp. Women dont like you - why the hell do you think you are posting and askin for nude pics of women - b/c you GET NONE. I look at your pic - and I lose my appetite, as does any self respecting woman who isnt your mother (even that is at risk). /em hands Nolan another bar of soap to drop for the crowd<br>

I know your kind very well. The big mouth spewing forth terrible insults and attempts to inspire fear with all that talk, while deep inside you are a coward, and when it comes to a little manly chit-chat you run with your tail between your legs. But I digress. There gotta be a line drawn somewhere between what is EQ and RL. Between what people post about both. Since your insults now focus on me as a RL person rather than my char you have crossed the line. I am a peaceful man and a follower (more or less) of buddhism. But sometimes, ppl like you need to be taught a good lesson. I'll see you sometime next year at the fair then, and if you (or any other self-righteous prick who takes upon himself a duty to show me the true way) decide to challenge me i'll gladly oblige. Until that time, let's stop wasting time on idle talk. Regards<br>

<br>
Sterno, you aren't worth my time.  You can twist things anyway you want to make your behavior OK in your sick little mind.  Bottom line, your reputation here is trashed.<br>
<br>
I'd watch who I call to the line though if I were you.  Even if Araefel is a 98 pound weakling (not saying he is btw), he has the respect and backing of many of us.  Hell if I were at said fan faire, I'd make sure my hubby was there to back him and hand you your ass (and it wouldn't take much prodding, he already wants to wring your neck (one of those lurker types)) and I don't know Araefel beyond these boards at all.<br>
<br>
As far as attacking the oponent who has already conceded.... When I see you concede (i.e. stop posting), I will stop.  I don't stalk you in other posts (other than that lame post about forming &lt;Losers&gt;), and I know you don't stalk me either.  As long as you're going to keep posting this drival trying to back peddle and make your views seem tolerable, we will all be here to force you to swallow.<br>
<br>
Oh and just for the record, you're Nolanstar on Drinal right?  Just want to make sure I put the right person on the ignore list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ustarnolan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starnolan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Talion</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/02 7:13:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: here</span><hr size=1> Meienea, <br>
Regarding your hubby. I don't give a damn what he thinks.<br>
If they want to gang on me instead of an honorable one on one fight that speaks of man's honor code. No, I don't fight kids or women (never hit either type in my whole life) Men is a different subject all together. I have a certan personal code of honor that I follow and if someone tramps on it I'm going to defend it whether i win or lose. Second, your concerns regarding my reputation in game are noted and dismissed. This is a game after all. On the record, yes my drinal name is NolanStar and yes currently i'm a mage 51, camped in City of Mist. I don't care about your guilds or groups because I choose the way I play and I have some friends who know me enough to support me and who will group with me with no problem and after seeing all this board trash talk. <br>
I have posted under my game char some views (again under emotional stress) which are frankly absurd, fair enough I got trashing and I apologized. Now, regardless what i think of my char views, he is entitled to them as a char being. <br>
If you continue to press your views and opinions on him for adoption then u are not better than all those religious freaks in the history who claimed that their view of the world and opinion on the conduct is the only correct one. I doubt that I have to remind you, now that you have disclosed a certain personal information on the other thread that might and majority may suppress the ideas, they may never defeat them in headlong rush. That's the way of diplomacy and politics. Oppression of anything and anyone brings resentment. Again that doesn't mean that I do not agree with your views regarding the topic, mind you, not my char or RL persona (to which you have a right to say your opinion) but the presence and truth comes out of a dispute. So we disputed and you are right. What happened next is people starting attacking my RL personage and I gave them back.<br>
So, make a distinction again between what is real and what is not. This becomes very much like Matrix. <br>
Regards<br>
<br>
P.S. Since I've posted my char name and level, it would be nice if you could post yours as well, Meienea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=772.topic&start=101&stop=109>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=772.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=772.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=772.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=772.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=772.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=772.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
