Lose credibility? are you frigging serious? I posted becuase your Pal Phoenixx is posting a load of crapola? We believe in people earning their gear, to be perfectly frank if you wanted the low level chracter to loot on such an item, it should have been stated at the begggining to us, which it was most definatly NOT.<br>
<br>
Sad because I lost? NO I am sad because of all the people that could have deserved it, including those in your own frigging guild, who had to watch a character who did not deserve it win it. This would not have even been brought onto drinal, as it is a sad sad reflection of game imbalance and player selfishness. Reason? Well despite Phoneixx's claims, I sat in the game fuming for a good 20 (twenty) minutes before logging out after he said &quot;hed talk to me&quot; about his decision. I realized after 20 minutes, whats he going to do? justify it? He can't so I logged.<br>
<br>
Finally I said i was not going to post here on this again, and you attempt to mock me on that because your pal Phoneixx is posting heresay and trying to present fiction as facts.<br>
<br>
Why is it whenever anyone does something, they can never admit they are wrong? I am amazed that you would publicly annoouce you all think this decision is just and tell those &quot;like it or don't join our raids&quot; well friends, no one is going to want to join your raids with stuff like this going down.<br>
<br>
If I heard this going down and I wasn't even a part of the raid I would still get angry over something like this. So put your comments of greed, and &quot;gimme gimme&quot; and give your 34th ranger a page, maybe he can help you on your next Trak raid.<br>

Whups, hed die in the first 10 seconds.<br>

P.S: Most of us did not know the shamen was not the owner playing, and none of us knew that he was lottoing as a 34th ranger, If agreed to previously everyone there would have lived with him lottoing as a melee, if the melee in question was deserving, a 34th ranger is not reflective of that. IF it was a 54th Ranger, an entire different situation and the only issue would be not knowing about it previously. The big problem here is that we have guildleaders who are 55+ (i think) saying its &quot;cool&quot; to allow 34th level players loot 60th level gear off uber mobs, and that my friends is discouraging. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A> at: 3/26/01 10:51:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#993300>(3/26/01 9:57:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Check this SHIT out Divinus Verties (sp) fumingSL</span><hr size=1> Yeah man why the hell don't people respond well to a good public scathing? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaktunka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aktunka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#993300>(3/26/01 10:17:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Check this SHIT out Divinus Verties (sp) fumingSL</span><hr size=1> I was there the other night as well. I was there as Akuk level 51 troll warrior. I can only relate the events as I understood them.<br>
<br>
I cannot say that I heard anything at all about how loot would be handled BEFORE we killed the turtle. I also did not hear anything about that Osteopath was being played by someone who would be looting as a tank BEFORE the kill was made. After we made the kill and the items dropped were announced, then I did hear Phoenixx say that Osteopath was actually being played by someone else for the sake of the raid and would be lottoing as a ranger. <br>
<br>
I personally do not have any problem with someone being able to lotto as thier main character if they are ASKED to bring a different class character to help for the overall good of a raid. That has been done many times and again I see no issue with that. I do, however, feel that if this sort of a thing is going to happen that it should be announced to ALL people and this should be before the raid or whatever even starts. I think that where the biggest issue came in here is that nobody knew (at least I didn't and apparently Slinker didn't either) that Osteopath was being played by the ranger and would be lottoing as ranger (perhaps the guildmembers did know this, but the rest of us didnt appear to). Not to mention that this only came up after the loot was announced.<br>
<br>
I think that the way it should have been handled was to make it very clear up front before the raid how loot would be handled. If everyone is clear on the rules and agrees to them, then they have no leg to stand on when making complaints because they agreed ahead of time or ahead of time they can ask for changes to rules. If they don't know the rules until after the fight then I can understand getting a bit upset. Anyhow, I guess at this point it doesn't matter since can't do anything about the no drop piece now. <br>

<br>
Damn Slinker, if it really matters to you at all, then it's pretty &quot;fuxor&quot;?ing amazing that you made it to level 60 without learning to ask when joining someone else's raid if there are any loot exceptions that you should know about.  Obnoxiously flaming someone else about your own mistake on a public message board is just...  well... stupid.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether anyone believes that a level 34 character should be allowed to participate or to roll, it was openly announced before things started, and anyone who didn't like it was free to object then or to leave.  As long as exceptions are announced before things start then you have no cause to complain.  If not everyone heard it, then maybe communication needs to be better next time, but it was also announced before anyone rolled for items, and people again had the chance to object.  To not only bitch and whine about it after the fact, but also flame about it on a public board, is just plain childish and shows a real lack of character.  You were even offered the chance to state objections after the roll, and you chose to log instead.  If you don't like the way someone handles loot then just don't participate in their raids, it's really not that tough.<br>
<br>
This is a sad example of why so many guilds don't like to allow non-guildmembers to participate in their raids/events.  The fact is, DV had enough people to kill Lodizal without allowing anyone else to participate, and if noone outside of the guild had been permitted to join then none of this would even have come up.  I hate to see guilds driven to excluding people based on experiences with a few immature loudmouths.<br>
<br>
What I really find amazing is that so many people who weren't even involved with the matter not only take the time to form their own opinions about what happened, but go so far as to post them.  Those who now seem to have some sort of vendetta against the ranger who looted the map are especially ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Regarding whether or not a level 53 shaman can land slow on Lodizal, I assure you that they can.  I've landed it with my level 51 shaman (third try, I believe, once Tash took).<br>

<br>
1.) Who led this raid?<br>
It was lead by Divinus Veritas, and thus the rules on looting items are set up by them.<br>
<br>
2.) Were outsiders invited or did they ask to join?<br>
They asked if they could join in on the kill, and Divinus Veritas glady accepted the help.<br>
<br>
3.) Why did Divinus Veritas get that particular shaman?<br>
The shaman was picked because Phoenixx knew who he was, and he was easy to get in contact with. Why would Phoenixx go looking for another Shaman if he already knew one he could easily get?<br>
<br>
4.) Were the looting rules stated before the raid?<br>
Yes, and it was clearly said that this ranger would be allowed to loot. If you had questions or concerns on who this ranger was all you had to do is ask, or type /who &lt;Ranger's Name&gt;. Then you would have easily found out what lvl he was and voice your opinion. Phoenixx would have explaned the situation, and then you could have made the choice if you wanted to stay or not. If you stay you still get your fair chance on the loot, and if you leave you have to wait for the next spawn.<br>
<br>
5.) Did everyone get a fair shot at the loot?<br>
Yes, everyone was given a fair shot on each item droped, and the ranger in question only lottoed for one of the characters that were there. Phoenixx could have been unfair and let both characters lotto, but he didn't. Therefore, everyone got the same chance at winning an item.<br>
<br>
6.) Did the ranger in question deserve to loot the item?<br>
In my opinion yes, but how can that really be determined. How do you credit someone who deserves to loot something or not? Do you determine this just by level? Do you do it on how much impact that character had on the raid? How would you determine that impact? Do you do it by how many other raids this character has been on? etc. Basically, you have NO right to say that this ranger did or didn't deserve the loot this item. This is in fact the second time he has been there to help out with a Lodazil kill.<br>
<br>
Overall Slinker, your argument has a bunch of holes, and you should just deal with the fact that a character much lower then yours won the lotto. This raid was run by Divinus Veritas, and the rules were stated before the kill was made. Stop your complaning and go back to playing the game. Remember, EQ is just a game not real life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uhaxtk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hax TK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#993300>(3/26/01 11:54:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> BOOFY!<br>

Would winning the Item and giving it to a secondary or Alt char have been any different? If I would have won the ring, or shell or what ever as a 53 Shamman and handed it to my 35 Ranger, would you have cared?  I understand that the item is no drop, so not quite the same, but the principle is.<br>

<br>
    First, making an exception to  what most of you are considering general looting guide lines doesn't mean this is how I handle all lotto's. We were up against a time table of getting people together quickly, buffing and killing the turtle before someone attempted a ks. I was not going to randomly do a /who all 50 60 shaman while kiting a 300 quad hitting turtle. I knew the ranger could bring his cousins shaman so I asked him to do so. So by asking him to help out, he very well deserved a chance at a loot item as much as anyone else who particapted.<br>
<br>
    As far as knowing the looting rules before hand, they were stating before the turtle was brought it. This was done in /say and not guildchat. If you didn't pay attention because you were busy talking in tells or afk for a second, it's not my fault. And if you aren't used to raiding with certain people, you should have asked or sent me a /tell asking for the rules to be explained to you. The looting rules were also stated AGAIN at the time of death. Everyone rolled, he won and AND THEN Slinker started wining. Why did you bring it after the lotto was done? Because if you had won, there wouldn't have been a problem. Everyone would have had their fair chance and you would have had your map piece. I also told you I would gladly hear any aruments AFTER the lotto'ing of all items was done. I noticed you departed from our group while lotto'ing the last of the loot ( spells), I attempted a tell which was never recieved-because you LOGGED or went LD. I attempted a second tell mintutes later with the same result. If you had gone LD, you should have sent me a tell saying so and presenting the arugment instead of taking it public. Let's be honest here. Right or wrong, I am telling it how it went and taking the flames for it because people disagree. And that's OK. But at least speak the truth and perhaps try to structure your feelings into something constructive rather then flame after flame.<br>
<br>
     To Boofy and the multipe alt's you are probably replying to this thread under, go away and come back when you've grown up. The only lil bitch here is.....well you get the picture.<br>
<br>
      Forestsun, no reason to feel bad. It was my call, not my guild leaders ( Ember who was present at the time of lodizal's killing)nor yours. If people want to disagree and pubilicly flame me for it, I'll gladly waver through them.<br>
<br>
      Win, lose, right or wrong, I allowed him in the lotto because I was looking at everyone who took part in the raid. My intentions were to have everyone roll fairly for a single item. I wasn't bias, I didn't look at level, guild, diety or any other bias some people come up with but rather the people that gave their best effort and that were part of his slaying. <br>
      Even though there's been very little in the way of constructive posts here, to avoid further arugment in future raids with people I do not know, I will probably handle it slightly different. But you CAN count on me being straight forward and fair with lotto's and next time, if someone disagrees, that person can leave the raid or accept the decision and absolutely keep their mouth shut and have no reason to &quot;fume&quot;.<br>

TALLON: the rules were not stated before the lotto<br>
<br>
And yeah your right now we know how they do lottos so at this point this dicussion, other being humerous is kind of pointless, they have stated they feel that 34th level players lottoing on 6oth level loot is valid. <br>
<br>
<br>
I got it, next time instead of watching the turtle for an hour we just kill it.<br>

<br>
Just a quick question is anyone not a part of this guild that agrees with this type of loot decision? /shrug or am I missing something here to feel it is wrong.<br>
