align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /rant It's about time Israel kicked Palestinian ASS</span><hr size=1> Ok Arrora lets try and get this back to a civil debate instead of you and Zand flaming each other.  I never said the USA has done anything wrong to the middle east. I never agreed with your point that we have done things to deserve or provoke this hatred from arab muslims. So lets get back to the case at hand what have we done?<br>
<br>
First lets examine your last response:<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, like this guy above just said, the only reason we even give a shit about the middle east is because of oil. That alone is sticking our nose in their business.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please explain how us buying their product would make them mad at us. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look at the damn gulf war. We didn't need to be there. Look at all the troops we have stationed in places all over the middle east. We don't need to be there. The only reason we act so concerned about the middle east is because we get all of our oil from there and we don't want to use our own oil. It's not brain surgery Barg. &quot;<br>
<br>
Do you know what the gulf war was about? Lets just assume you do know that Iraq invaded kuwait unprovoked to steal their oil land and wealth. The kuwaites along with several arab countries asked us to help them kick Sadam out of kuwait. We did that with the help of said arab nations. SO why would this be a reason for them to hate us?<br>
<br>
How many bases do we have in the middle east? Please tell me? What countries are these bases in? I will give you one Saudi Arabia. This is a base the Saudis gave us and allow us to use. Why would this make them want to kill us? <br>
<br>
&quot;Stop trying to act like it's some tough thing to figure out, it's something that is commonly debated about and I'm sure you know all this, so stop arguing over nothing. You know the US gets involved where it doesn't belong sometimes and you know the US isn't perfect so stop trying to pull arguments out of your ass. &quot;<br>
<br>
Im not trying to figure out anything except what you understand about the entire matter which at this point seems to be very little. You still have not given any hard evidence of USA wrong doing or explained your position at all other than generalized &quot;we stick our noses in their business and we take their oil&quot;<br>
<br>
I will give you one last chance explain your position coherently or admit you dont know what the fuck your talking about. <br>
<br>
Bargeroth<br>
&quot;who hopes you know its ok to admit you bit off more than you could chew once in a while damn it!&quot;<br>

Every country has problems, we are humans and humans are not perfect. But we're closer than anybody else so when I see some moronic comments like that, then yes I am going to set the record straight and I started the comparison with your place of birth because it seemed as good a place as any. - quote Zand<br>
<br>
You just admitted the point I've been proving all along. Instead of arguing about it and trying to bring my ethnicity into it you should just re-read your comment and all of my posts.<br>
<br>
The point was not whether or not we are one of the best countries, as I agree we are. The point was even though we are great we have still made mistakes and wrong decisions. PERIOD! You and Barg both admitted it so why are you arguing something you openly admit to be true? It's pointless.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Zand bringing someones ethnicity and flaming it into a civil debate is uncalled for and RACIST! Yes your sand spitting comment is a RACIST STEREOTYPE. It is not the harsh reality, it is a racist comment stereotyping arabs.You are not Moroccan, you have no first hand knowledge of Morocco or our culture and you represent it as crap which it is not. Morocco is not perfect and has a ways to go, but it in no way makes your debates legitimate and doesn't prove any point except you are narrow minded, racist, and stereotypical. Since you claim to have a brain I'm sure you know that one womans story does not apply to ALL women. As I have said I have 6 aunts that live wonderful, happy, Moroccan lives. Thats 6 women, from Morocco, born and raised that were not oppressed as you claim ALL women in Morocco to be. If you want to make a point about appreciating ones country do it without your racial slurs and stereotypes and remove the ignorance.<br>

That is kind of far from the truth.  The U.S. gets something like 80% of it's oil from Saudi Arabia (not looking it up but the figure is close).  The rest of the Middle East really does not interest us as far as oil goes.  We are involved with Israel because we have always thought of them as close to a Democracy and almost like a little sister, right or wrong.  <br>
<br>
I heard someone comment that Saudi Arabia is our crack dealer and they are presently bitch slapping our little sister, Israel.  It about hits the nail on the head.  We have a base in Saudi Arabia because they want us there.  We defend the right of Israel to claim their homeland because who else will?  Convoluted as it can get, but were are really not there to protect our interests in oil, but to do our best to maintain peace in a frightening region of the world..<br>
<br>
We have little interest in Kuwait's oil.  We got involved in Kuwait to because we were asked by our allies overthere to do so.  Did you really want to see Iraq prevail and take over?  May I also point out that many other countries played a huge role  in the Gulf War.  <br>
<br>
It is all to far gone for the U.S. to wash its hands of the Middle East and say let them all kill each other.  Should we let Iraq continue to build weapons of mass destruction given their history?  Should we stand by without trying to prevent a nuclear war between India and Pakistan?  Should we allow the Saudi's and Palestinians to over run Israel?  Should we let terrorists that have directly attacked the country we love to go unpunished?  Should we have let the Serbs destroy the peace and people of Bosnia and Croatia?  Did we intervene there because of oil? <br>
<br>
The U.S. finds itself being the peacemaker of the world because we have a supreme military and the will to aid countries that cannot aid themselves.  How this creates hatred is far beyond me.  I think the hatred stems from our affluence, which is resented by those that have little.   <p> <center> <image src = "http://home.attbi.com/~renw111/wsb/media/12544/graphic.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ublazeodead.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blaze ODead</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Damned if I dont, Damned if I do</span><br>  Posts: 410<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/7/02 5:05:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=265>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /rant It's about time Israel kicked Palestinian ASS</span><hr size=1> Fuck ya'll need to simmer down and just flow.<br>

I have asked you several times to support any of your claims with a fact. Im begging you please tell us the other side of this story if you can. If you really did learn 1 single fact that supports your position we have done something wrong and injust to the arabs, the palestinians, the middle east. Please let the rest of us in on it we would all really like to hear it.<br>
<br>
Here you are saying the same thing over and over but really not saying a damn thing:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure you can take some time to learn to be unbiased and educate yourself about all the things the US has done to hurt other countries.&quot;  WHAT???????<br>
<br>
.&quot;I am saying that our government is not perfect and has made many mistakes in the past and present that has aided hostility between ourselves and other countries. The news normally doesn't go over the mistakes the government. I've taken a couple US world studies courses however that give you both sides of the story from an unbiased stand point and let you be the judge&quot; WHAT MISTAKES????<br>
<br>
&quot;A couple of the time I really did think the US was out of line, but of course I would always side with the US. Even though we have done some things wrong, I think out of the larger picture we are well developed.&quot; WHAT WERE THESE COUPLE TIMES?????<br>
<br>
&quot;Does it mean you don't love your country? No, it means you aren't an idiot and you can evaluate 2 sides of a story.&quot; FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AN ALL THATS HOLY TELL US THIS MYSTERIOUS EVIL OTHER SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
You see once you actually answer the question we can have a logical debate on if your position is valid or not. <br>

Barg incase you didn't notice I wasn't talking to you, I was still talking about Zand being a racist. You are just annoying me. If you openly admitted you knew the US has made mistakes why are you know acting like you are clueless. You just feel like arguing over something you already admitted. Like I said you are just wanting to hear yourself talk. Don't agree with someone and then argue with them about the same thing you just agreed with. It doesn't work and I don't feel like taking up my time digging up info because I know you already got the point.

<br>
Ok, you're right there.  The Taliban, in your eyes and some of others, was suppressing women.  That was ok for some of them though, I'm sure.<br>
<br>
Let me try and put this into an analogy.   Our diet here in North America contains almost x2 as much fat as our bodies need.  Fast food places don't do anything to reduce the fat, most people don't.  We've been eating like this for years, right?  It's ok for us.  What if someone of Asian origins, who's family ate carbohydrates mainly and have quite good diets saw this and thought we needed to be liberated of our crappy eating habits?<br>
<br>
Sure, it doesn't have the same weight, but I think it gets the point across.  Things we(being north americans) think are ok, aren't to others.  Things that we(again north americans) perceive to be evil/bad/unhealthy/unjust/etc aren't to others.<br>

Barg:  You're right, beating women isn't right.  Not every single man in the middle east beats his wife/random woman though.  It happens here(North America) also.<br>
<br>
On the other side though, if you're brought up from Day 1 to believe that all women are for is to have babies/cook your food, is it really wrong for you?  For people who grow up in western societies, where this is portrayed as &quot;bad&quot;, its wrong to us.  We view the others as barbaric, etc.  Yet it still happens here... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
