I don't care for all the drama and heartache and headache that has surrounded this camp.  I certainly never wanted to step on anyones toes.  That is just not my personality.  Alas, before I knew of this list Ragefire did pop when no one appeared to be around, (not even me.. I was botted)  Yet, there was a cleric there.  What happens then... big fight, big drama, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Before I knew of this list, I started to create a formal list in my mind.  I would buy ragefire.com or make a board or something.  I would post the idea on every public board Drinal has.  I would get very little support.... <br>
<br>
I was very happy to meet Magada aftter I stepped out of the shadows in Skyfire.  I learned of a list already in place and I was more than happy to get on it.  From what I was told, the original clerics randomed for thier spots, and after that it was whoever asked to be on it got on it.  There were not really any rules, and we don't really like too many rules.  They always get broken.  Broken lists are not that great.<br>
<br>
Camping Rage is not all that bad (as it could be) when you have so much support.  I respect this list, just as I have after becoming a part of it.  When he popped for Puleo, both of us were sitting there dead asleep.  Someone in my guild got word he was up.  My friend called shortly after and woke  my boyfiend.  He woke me up,  and I nuked and feared Puleo for like 30 minutes until he finally heard it and by that time -both- CS and UC were en route to kill Ragefire for -Puleo-.  <br>
<br>
No one can say that this list will not work, because it HAS.  The only thing you can say is that somehow, this list will suddenly stop working.  But, how is that?  <br>
<br>
Now that it is semi-formal/official, people have different theories on how it should work, etc etc.  There is no way that it can be perfect.  There are good reasons to keep the list off the boards and there are good reasons to put them on the boards.  Right now it's both.  It's still working.<br>
<br>
My only concerns with this list is that names are getting shuffled and bumped and added to the top.  There is a cleric on top of the list that I didn't have anywhere on my list.  I've seen the same cleric get bumped off or down 3 times.  Another cleric bumped down one.  Another cleric bumped off totally.  I was also given a 'shitlist'.  I won't go into that.  Its VERY easy for this to happen and no one is to blame.  It just happens.<br>
<br>
That is the only problem I see with keeping the list in game.  I wouldn't say that it's -such- a terrible thing because it encourages clerics to be &quot;agressive&quot; about their spot on the list- to spend time in Skyfire with the other clerics and make sure that they don't get bumped or moved or whatever.  Also, you could make friends with someone that way, instead of just knowing a persons name on some list.<br>
<br>
May I request that the Ragefire channel be named 'Ragedance'?  It was the same everytime I was there with Magada and Puleo.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I support this list 100% for what its worth.  <br>
<br>
Gratz to all the clerics who have kicked Ragefire's ass. <p>~/~ :<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=93681">Requiemme</a>... <br><br> <a href="http://www.unconquered.org"> <img

Or they had control of the list I would have steered clear of the situation.  That however was not the case.<br>
<br>
In almost every ragefire fight on Drinal it wasn't even the cleric's that were fighting, but rather the guild officers of the represented guilds.  It almost all those situations the clerics were offering to random or whatever it took to stop the guilds from fighting.<br>
<br>
Enter the list.  This was set up, and maintained by the clerics themselves.  The people in guild_01 - guild_10 are simply stating they will support their clerics.<br>
<br>
Chindra is on that list, and she is a member of UC, so long as she supports that list, I and we will support her.<br>
<br>
This list will not last forever, its just the nature of things, but while it exists, lets appreciate the harmony, can we? <p><center>

Fierrie was NOT on the list before quite a few ppl were on the list and needs to be put in the proper place.  I have helped or offered to help every cleric on the list and will continue to do so even after my time has come.

<br>
I would like to ask one favour though - since it looks like this list is moving forward, is there any way we can keep the list on the first post in the thread?  For convenience sake, it would make it a lot easier if all could just be able to take a quick glance at the list without having to scroll through other messages <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I for one have tried to camp Ragefire in the past for 6 Weeks straight, but gave up because ppl never resepected me being there, so I gave up on Rage all together. This was approximately 2 months ago. I figured there was no way to get my last piece. I support this list. Please lets be fair to all clerics and keep list in the same order as it is with no bumping. I have awhile before my turn is up. UF is there for each cleric when it becomes there turn, just give us a holler.<br>
<br>
P.S. Has the Ragefire Channel been set up and if so what is it?<br>

First off, the order that the list presently is posted should remain as is. No need to get into who should have been where and when, that's all water under the bridge. I was bumped down 3 positions also and I was the one who brought up posting the list in black and white somewhere to keep a written history for all to see. Now that it has been posted it needs to remain the same unless a cleric asks to be removed or wants to change positions. They should then post that fact here, and work it out with the present cleric on ragefire watch.<br>

As for the Ragefire channel, please do not post any type of channel here. The cleric on ragefire watch should create and maintain a channel of his or her choice and inform ONLY people who are supporting this list. We don't need people who blatantly have said we can stuff this list, knowing when Ragefire pops. By creating a general channel that is open to all of Drinal, you only open yourself to being KSed by people who don't want to work with the people who have come together to make this camp work.<br>
<br>
Grats again Boomi on your Epic, and good luck Ramor when the next RF pops up.<br>

dont see it working honestly, and what about clerics who remain guildless?<br>

and id also like to point out one minor little detail...if people had RESPECT, there would be no need for a list, meaning a cleric pops into SF, sees another cleric sitting near RF spot (this happened during healdenhammers camp) cleric #2 plops his ass down at RF spawn point and says hes camping him too? hello....a cleric already there, have respect, get the hell out and pop back in another time.<br>

The list in itself will be hard to maintain, as Funno stated he was &quot;dropped&quot; down the list supposedly, but I suspect that the same thing happened to him as happened to me. He fought the idea of this list and did not throw his hat into the ring right from the get go, and in the meantime other clerics showed up and were listed. He will just have to be patient, and so will I.  <br>

But didn't mean it in a rude or condescending way.  I was just pointing out that the guilds already backing the list have *extreme* mobilizing skills.  Only guild I think that moves faster than CT is CiH, and I believe they have finished all their twink/bot clerics already. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94210>Rashnar</a>

 You know that HH and I had decided to take turns camping RF 1-2 months ago. You came and we chatted on how this was a great thing that clerics from other guilds can get in line and work together instead of fighting for the camp. I know you believe this works. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
HH helped me with my RF and I helped him with his. The honerable clerics will keep the list straight. I will come help when I can on RF kills(still looking for revenge).<br>
This can work out. It has worked out. It still will work but every cleric has to keep that list posted.<br>
Good luck all clerics and I hope this works out for everyone.As for /rude people that want to steal RF from these clerics in the future, shame on you for not waiting  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It really sucks to have that RF killed infront of you after you been camping over 100+ hours <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload\density\density3.gif"boarder="0"></a><Br>

Most agree that the list is a good idea, and it has tremendous support from Drinal's guilds.  Here's a link to the new forum and the message about how the list will be publicly maintained.  Clerics should not fear that they were not added to the list, because they will essentially be adding themselves by following the instructions on this link:<br>
