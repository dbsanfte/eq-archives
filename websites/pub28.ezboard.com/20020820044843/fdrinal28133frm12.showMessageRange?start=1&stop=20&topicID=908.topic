Well, shit happens. I'm not saying that we don't do everything we can to get bona fide convictions -- and now, with DNA evidence and such, it's getting easier.<br><br>Your other arguments are OK, I guess. While I think that the death penalty is a good thing, and may deter capital crime, I think the best argument against it is the argument that the State, in taking upon itself the power to kill, is assuming the same power that the murderer assumed -- and eventually, life is cheapened when the State can take it away. This is the same argument that blames violent crime and baby killing by high school girls and stuff on the Roe v. Wade decision and subsequent avalanche of abortions -- an argument that I don't buy either.<br><br>There is a dichotomy, admittedly, between people who are in favor of the death penalty but are anti-abortion; this is a paradox that I haven't personally resolved yet. Yes, I am pro-life but I am pro-death penalty as well. Had I taken a logic class in college, I could prolly work through it lol but alas, I haven't. I would suspect that in fact this is a false dichotomy; an aborted foetus didn't do anything to society or anyone else; a murderer has committed a premeditated sociopathic act or acts.<br><br>Doof, I would ask you though -- let's say Osama bin Laden were still alive (I doubt he is but let's assume) and were caught by the US Government and tried and found guilty of the murders of 9-11, a conviction that would be highly likely given the evidence and admissions etc. Would you lock him away for life, or in his case, would death be OK?<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.fast.net/~mikem/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Life</span><br>  Posts: 1065<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 5:33:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ... </span><hr size=1> life in prison would suck, i'd rather get sent to the gas chamber/death chair than do that shit.  <br><br>=0) <p><a href="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/ppgquiz.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/bubbles.gif" border=0 alt="Which PPG are you?"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Life</span><br>  Posts: 1403<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 5:57:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> See...out of the posts in here, the people who have responded say that they'd rather die than spend life in jail.<br><br><br>I'd rather see a crimal get what's comming to him, than to get death.<br><br><br>-Doof <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 689<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/20/02 6:00:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Course, for a tard, life in prison ain't a punishment.

I chose to start a life, if you ask for my opinion, I think you should have the baby, but really it's not my call to make.<br><br>On the DP, I'm a bit of a fascist despite my liberal tendencies.  I think Death Penalty cases should only be handled by Juries first of all, none of these bench trials.  Second the Jury should understand that if they sentance a man to death that immediately following the sentancing they are going to witness that death.  Take the convicted person out back, strap him to a tree and complete the sentancing.<br><br>However all that said, I'm actually against the Death Penalty for reasons stated previously by Doofy.  I can however imagine an even more perfect world for the murderers and rapists and other life in prison folks.  Why the hell do we spend any money on their maintenance?  Send 'em all (the life with no possibility of parole con's) to some damn island (or France) and be done with them.<br><br>Yes I realize that my ideas are over the top and I'm probably gonna get flamed, but think about this:  Not only does the death penalty seem to have no impact on the rate at which violent crimes are commited in this country, but the threat of prison time currently has little effect either.  Now let's go back in history, hangings didn't deter Jesse James, the Guilotine(sp) didn't deter anyone, what will?  Not much in my opinion.  It would not suprise me at all if science were to uncover a hormonal/gene/chemical imbalance that leads to violent crimes (at which point we'll probably outlaw prison sentances too seeing as how all criminals are just freak mutants).<br><br>Now for another side of this story.  My father is a criminal defense attorney.  In fact his specialty is death penalty law.  For many of his cases he determines victory not on by getting the guy off, but by getting him life instead of the chair.  In the 30+ years he's been doing this (criminal defense, not necessarily death penalty cases) not once has he been fully compensated (even at the ridiculously low rates court appointed attorneys get) for a death penalty case and not once has he had a client who was found guilty and evidence later came up to disolve his guilt (however some have won on other appeals and had sentances reduced and such).  As to the costs associated with death penalty or any other form of trial, the state is obligated to insure that a defendent receives adequate legal council and representation, however in most areas this does not seem to include acutally paying those lawyers for their time.  My father went bankrupt over this and has now left the legal profession due to that and the severe emotional and mental stress that comes with it. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker<BR><BOLD>THE</BOLD> sweet little druid from Rivervale<BR>Co-founder and servant of the <a href=http://www.throneofdrinal.com>Throne of Drinal</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 361<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/21/02 7:34:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Sick thought but put the executions on PPV and see how cheap it gets then. <p><img src="http://scarecrow.clickhere2.net/images/oaksiggy_new1.gif" border=0></a><br><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=253834">Saurakk Rex</a><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=253870">Oaker Treeweaver</a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucrollwynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crollwynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/21/02 8:37:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> curious...how is it less expensive to keep slime alive in jail rather than fry em?<br>Ive always had a problem with death row crap...why in the hell are these people sitting there for YEARS? give em a year to appeal, if no appeal filed or new evidence uncovered, SEE YA<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>There are a dozen men that were recently on Illinois death row that thank their lucky stars you didn't get to make that decision. The reason it is more expensive to execute is because we are attempting to make sure we never execute the wrong person. Speeding up the process loosens those safeguards. Think about it for a second. We seem to have recently had a fair number absolved of their crimes through the introduction of DNA evidence. If the process had been faster would we have caught those wrongly convicted? How many other wrongly convicted and executed might have been exonerated if the technology existed 20 years ago? Life in prison is civilized choice because it gives us the opportunity to go back and correct mistakes that we may have made in prosecution. We cannot give back years of incarceration but at least we didn't inflict the ultimate infringment of human rights on the wrongfully convicted. The supremes were correct in this decision and I applaud them.

Not killing a murderer cheapens the value of life not the other way around. Saying ok you killed this person/people/family were gonna give you 60,40,20 years in prison as doofy said means that this persons live is worth X amount of years. Killing you for killing someone else means their life = your life. Id say that a life for a life has much more value than years for a life.  <br><br>Now everyone here whos saying they would rather die than spend life in jail is young and barely lived 20 years. I can tell you at 35 20 years doesnt seem very long at all. I bet at 60 20 years seems like a minute. <br><br>I sure as hell dont wanna die before I enjoy every single last breath of my life that I got coming to me even if it meant being in prison<br><br>btw the argument that the death penalty is a deterent is PURE BULLSHIT. It is retribution. it is a penalty for a crime committed period.  <br><br>How many of you have seen a documented execution either by electricution, hanging, lethal injection, or gas chamber. Ive seen em all and they are all scary as hell. Not to many people goin down are very brave in the end. They get to feel maybe for that day or few minutes how their victim/victims felt and maybe just maybe truly repent in their soul, mind or what ever it is you believe in, for the evil they commited.  <br><br>As for this particular case its unbelievable to me.
