What in the heck are you doing!!?!! Eq relationships? Good lord who needs em. There are plenty of real men out there who would be happy to fulfill your needs. And if it is long term intimacy you are avoiding in real life, I  am quite sure' if you just walked up to the average single guy and said, lets have sex' - 90% of them won't pass up the opportunity.<br>

Flesh and blood men much more gratifying!! And much more responsible for the consequences of their actions too.<br>

There was a long standing flame that all women chars were really men in this forum.<br>
<br>
I personally think that all men hiding behind their puters on the web are really pigs, pimply faced geeks, married and not paying attention to their real life matters, or generally adverse to emotional attachment in RL. There may be some others that fit in there...but if you think about the opportunity for a walking hormone like a 16 year old boy to fake people out on the web ....no way I see them passing that kind of opportunity up. <br>
<br>
Maybe I'm a cynic but the really really good ones are even hard to find in RL - filtering through the web nonsense to find a good one just seems like looking for a needle (an itty bitty needle) in a haystack.<br>

<br>
I think EQ relationships are STEWPID, atleast romantic ones.  If you get anything from an on-line relationship, it should be a good friend or 2 that you can just talk about things with, and not have the obligations of a real time face to face talk.  You can bring up things that normally you wouldn't and maybe get a second oppinion on what you're thinking.<br>
<br>
The introduction of the internet has increased the amount of communication among peoples vastly.  However, you lose the intamicy of a face to face conversation.  Body language, face expressions, and the dialation of a person's eyes are missed when communicating on-line.<br>
<br>
Did you know that how wide or closed your puples are dialated determines whether or not you like or dislike someone or something?  Have you ever had that feeling where you walk into a room and you just KNOW you're not welcome?  Its because we as humans see that difference in dialation.  Generaly when you dislike something, your puples will close, slightly, and the opposite for liking something.  This was built in when humans lived in clans/packs and when a stay person stumbled on the wrong clan, they knew it before they were killed, heh.  Its a proven fact.<br>
<br>
But you lose this over the internet.  Thought that was kinda interesting and I'd share it with you all.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, 9 times out of 10, if a girl that a guy found relativly attractive, asked him to go fuck for the hell of it, they would say yes, if you aren't just kidding around.  I can say thats true IMO because that happened my first year at my new college in the first week of this year!<br>

<br>
Your illusion of these geeky pimple-faced losers behind the screen is totally off-based.  Yes, it's true....  Those people DO exsist.  You may have seen pics of all the fan fairs held, and seen all the winners that showed up.  But those people that showed up make less than 1% of the total population of EQ players.  Don't expect anyone who has a life to be able to even make it to a EQ fan fair, even if it was a block away from where they live.<br>
<br>
Yes, I played Everquest, but did you ever notice when I got on?  I played from about 1am till about 7 or 8am.  All my friends are asleep.  Everything is closed.  I have never been able to sleep well, so because I found something kinda fun to do with my time instead of tossing and turning all night, I'm branded and this weak, twisted, sick, pathitic loser?  <br>
<br>
Now do I think getting married to someone in-game is stupid?  Yes.  I think it is the most retarded thing anyone has ever come up with, and I imagine 90% of the people that actually got married in EQ are those pimple-faced geeks you refer to.  I imagine there have been a few Girl-Guy marrige's that have been roleplayed by two guys.  Who knows.  But to say that all guys sitting behind a computer are losers, what about you?  You didn't care to mention anything about women behind the computer screen.  While assuming that all guys behind a computer screen are geeks (something which I'd say 90% of all guys are known for AKA the love of playing video games) you forgot to ask an even stranger question:  What the fuck is a chick doing behind a computer screen??  Since the dawn of video games, everyone (guys and girls) have known that guys play video games, and girls don't.  Now you are saying that there must be something wrong with a guy for him to be playing an online game, yet all women who play are perfect....<br>

I had a strange change in life when in college where I started tearing apart PC's, programming &amp; networking for fun. <br>
<br>
Before that I was hanging around dancers, drama majors, &amp; musicians blowing my brains out with art &amp; liberal politics.<br>
<br>
Stuff happens? In college I majored in CIS. I had 5 machines in various half built configurations at all times at home. When I'd study I'd load up Warcraft or Age of Empires and read a chapter - play an hour - read a chapter -play an hour. Worked out pretty well I always had good grades:)<br>
<br>
There are a number of women who work with me  so I am not alone as an IT professional, but I don't ask them if they stuck with computer games too when they graduated. <br>
<br>
Now I focus primarily on business development aspects of technology. Imagine that Boofy there are females &quot;shiver&quot; who can use the left and right sides of thier brains!<br>
<br>
And you are right the women too can be pimply faced geeks etc. - I just wouldn't go there on line,  it is like starting off with a lot of ambiguity and odds against you. You can cut through a lot of that red tape by seeing the person you are hitting on.<br>
<br>
And no boofy I am not a &quot;fukin dike&quot; as you like to call me, it was my ex-boyfriend who taught me 40% of what I know about technology. I don't see how you correlate complex logic, technology and gaming with ones sexual preference. If I were a lesbian I probably still wouldn't like being called a &quot;fukin dike&quot; either by some simple minded homophobe on the web. <br>
<br>
It's 2001, time to wake up women earned their right to vote in 1920 and to be considered equals in society thanks to great people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. If you don't know about womens rights you may want to go read up on the subject we earned them 81 years ago - apparently some of you guys are slow in adapting. Hmm you weren't even born then it just boggles me that some poor *woman* gave birth to a moron like you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 6/8/01 4:42:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uitseabitsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Itsea Bitsy</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(6/8/01 5:55:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Info for women</span><hr size=1> Love of video games, fantasy role playing games and technology is not a gender based thing.

EQ is a bit more than a game, it has turned into a sub society and many friendship form there.  Friendship form from people who have simular interests....and everyone in EQ enjoys...or should enjoy EQ.<br>

No.  So why, all of the sudden, when women begin broading their horizions, and play a massive multi-player online game, are all men suddenly branded as pimple-faced geeks?<br>
<br>
I can say for certain.....without a doubt in my mind...that at one point or another, EVERY single guy in the USA (had to rethink that...was going to say the world, but then remembered 3rd world countries) has played a video game atleast once in their life.  Doesn't matter if it's some pimple-faced Erkel, or Brad Pitt.  Keanu Reeves could've actually been playing EQ between takes of Matrix 2 and Matrix 3.  Don't be so dense to think that just because EQ is an online game, that only the supreme losers know how to play it.<br>

But in real life.. people don't do that. <br>
<br>
 In real life you see a ton of fat women with skinny best friends and even fat women with gorgeous men.<br>
<br>
 Who the hell cares what you look like? It's so immature to base someone entirely on their looks, it's so fucking superficial. It doesn't matter, because eventually, the woman is gonna stop shaving her legs, have kids, breasts will sag.. and you will still love her and your whole outlook on how women should look will change when you fall in love. Love is blind to what people look like. <br>
<br>
 I hate how in this society, women think they have to be models to even be liked by another guy. It's sick. I can't wait until that gets put on the guys, when the guys are scared all throughout jr high what the girl thinks.. or if he is too fat or too skinny. <br>
<br>
 I hate the &quot;women should do this&quot; &quot;women should do that&quot; remarks. Women should do whatever they damned well want, and that goes for men too. <br>
<br>
 I hate how men don't always take us seriously because we are women. My ex-fiance would say &quot;I will never group with another woman on everquest again..&quot; and it would piss me off. And anyhow, he is the one who got me into everquest. So yah.. women do play EQ.. and sure, there are people who spend 24/7 on this stupid game.. and sure there are people that would fall into the loser category. But who knows, your best friend in game could be that loser, but you don't care when you're talking to her/him.. you don't see that. <br>
<br>
 So drop what people look like. Why does it have to matter so damned much? The world isn't going to end if someone is fat or too skinny. Those fat and skinny, and pimply faced geeks all have personalities and lives.. as well as *GASP* FEELINGS! <br>
<br>
 So come on, quit hurting peoples self esteems. You know when you call someone a name, even if it is just a game, you are talking to a person behind a screen, and it can bring them down. And don't say it doesn't.. because people will say &quot;oh, I am laughing.. this is so funny&quot; but really they are flat out pissed about the situation and typing as fast as their little fingers can go. <br>
<br>
 With that being said, next time you guys call someone you cannot stand online a name like fatass, chubbycheckers, stickpick, peperoni face.. etc, think about your best friends and your guildmates in the game.. because chances are.. one of them.. if not you.. fit that category. You'd hate to insult your best friend.. <br>
<br>
 Everyone of you who replies with some comment &quot;I don't care, they are losers&quot; has some issues, because in all reality, you do care. You cared enough to make this post an issue, you cared enough to bring up that someone is ugly. <br>
<br>
 Usually when someone insults someones real life status, it means they either a: are insecure and are actually putting themselves down through that person to make them feel better. or b: have such a big assed ego and doesn't give a crap about anyone but themselves. Either way, I'd definately hate to be in either situation. <br>
<br>
 So when you want to go and insult someones real life status, insult them with facts on what you are mad about. Don't go tear down their self esteem. Or don't go tearing down your best friend online's self esteem.. they COULD be thinking &quot;Oh man, he wouldn't like me, I didn't think he was like that&quot; or something.<br>
<br>
 Whatever. Don't be so superficial and say how everyone in game are ugly losers, because some peoples trash is anothers treasure.. and not everyone has to be a model to be accepted. Roseanne, Rosie Odonnel, Oprah.. etc. <br>
<br>
 The only thing you are doing is making the issue bigger. &quot;Women need to look like this to be accepted&quot; When chances are, you will never date a model, you'll never date anyone who looks like Angelina Jolee (or whatever). <br>
<br>
 Inside we are all the same.. we are all wanting to be accepted for who we are. So start accepting and stop being so harsh on each other.<br>
<br>
 Next time you call someone fat, or a loser, think about how if your best friend was calling someone that.. and you actually thought you were a loser, think about how that would feel.. or how it would feel if someone you respected called you a fat ugly perperoni head or something.<br>
<br>
 I'm done ranting, I just wrote an epic and I'm sorry.<br>

edit: This post was not aimed at any inparticular. I was just saying in general. <br>

There were three examples looks, bieng a pig (that is my reference to generally jerky men - attitude), neglecting marriages (that has to do with cognitive aspects of the individuals and more), 16 year old boys faking out women to believe they are older, and I also threw in an exception category - meant to capture all other factors that would lead one to move to cyberspace in search of love instead of depending upon body language, character, tone, responsibility!!, emotion of real life human beings. <br>
<br>
If someone chooses to ignore all those key factors of &quot;getting to know a person&quot; then they shouldn't be surprised that a person isn't who/what they expected. You miss far too much about an individual when you are only dealing with text on the iternet, you can't see their nervous lips twitching when they are lying, or their eyeballs moving from woman to woman as they walk by - there is no validation other than blind faith and trust....if someone wants to put themselves in to that situation then they can. <br>
<br>
The usage of the word &quot;should&quot; was probably incorrect...because they &quot;can&quot; and they could but I am not sure why they would ;-) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 6/8/01 1:34:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugwenhyfar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwenhyfar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#993300>(6/8/01 1:30:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Info for women</span><hr size=1> I know hon, I wasn't trying to flame you or anyone.

<br>
They all play video games....yet, i don't see to many of them being called pimple faced geeks.<br>
<br>
God, every single &quot;Mtv Pad's&quot; eppisode that I watch...when they go to a guys house, they always have 3 things. A pool, a bar, and some type of video game system. But if you checked out all the women's houses....they'll never mention a video game....why? only God knows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tat you have some serious issues....no really.<br>
<br>
<br>
Me....I'm no sex symbol, but I'm not some pimple faced ugly ass nerd.<br>
<br>
I work Grave yard shift at Qwest communications. And to top it off, I work weekends.<br>
<br>
Now, you might say &quot;why the hell would you want to work that kind of shift?&quot;<br>
<br>
Easy. I'm 18, almost 19...I make twice what other kids my age make.<br>
<br>
The average kid my age makes between $7 - $9 an hour.<br>
<br>
They pay for college, have medical/dental. and all the other benifits of a major cooporation.<br>
<br>
The only draw back is that my days off Include Tuesday, wednesday, and thursday.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree, that there's probably some ugly ass people that play EQ.<br>
<br>
I agree that there's some freaks that play this game.<br>
<br>
I agree that people who get married in the game have some issues.<br>
<br>
But I don't agree that everyone is like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
You tell me somthing better to do at 3am on a Wednesday, and i'll do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I actually don't even play EQ as much as I use to now that boofy quit.<br>
<br>
The only thing that really made this game truly fun, was leveling, and advancing with other people, that you know in real life.<br>
<br>
Anyways, i'm getting down off my soap box. Think what you want Tat....but you'll be wrong.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
<br>
I'll never go to one of those conventions, even if it's a block away from my house.<br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
I'll never post my RL picture on the board, or email it to anyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=231.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=211.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
