I remember when level 47's were useful, but ever since the Kunark Expansion, a level 47 char will never get invited on any raid ever, because they are too low.....God!  Too low!  All that work to get to level 47, and I'm still too low.  By the time I'm high enough to go on a raid, Verant will of changed the max level again.  *sigh*<br>
I couldn't go on a naggy raid cause the new level minimun is 48 for druids now.  When I was level 36, the level min. for naggy was 40.  When I was 40, the min. was 45, and when I hit 45, the min. was 48.  Geezz...I have a feeling I won't get to go on a naggy raid till I'm 53.  I never thought I'd say this, but god it sucks being level 47<br>

Suck alot of dick so you  get on alot of raids, never log off, buy a bucket and put a seat on it, you won't have time to piss or shit while you play 24/7. Buy lots of cd's, get a gun. Cds for good listening, guns for shooting holes in your walls when people piss you off. This is all you need to become a EQ fag lol.<br>

In the real world when you get in a fight...you both get your ass kicked, and the one who says he could do it is just arogant and more then likely not smart enough to realize the truth.  <br>
<br>
Anyway I think i might leave Qalar alone about kicking his ass if you want to get into it.  Even though i have never met a football player that was actually anything but big muscles...From my perspective of being a martial artist, I get owned by wrestlers :P<br>
<br>
But anyway...shut up Drakan..you impress no one, may as well go kill yourself now.  You hate the world, the world hates you.  Mission accomplished, go become an addict with your friend...maybe he would care if you could kick his ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualealthewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleal the Wiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~fuellg/bobspinanim.gif height=10 width=10 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress Fingerwiggler</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#939393>(1/19/01 8:34:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PS</span><hr size=1> Where did you wrestle Qalar?  That would depend on how much merit I put on winning 8th in state wrestling.  I took 3rd my junior year then shatter my wrists my senior year so no title for me.  But, my state doesn't have the best program so if I went somewhere like Iowa, Nebraska, or Cali, I would have been lucky to finish 30th heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#939393>(1/19/01 10:57:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PS</span><hr size=1> one time...at band camp.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=85.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=104.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
