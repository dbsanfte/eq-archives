These rules are based on systems from multiple other guilds and have been borrowed and incorporated into the Dark Brigade Raid Point System.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Points </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
All Dark Brigade members can earn points. <br>
<br>
Recruits earn points during their recruiting period but may not spend these points until they become full members except on no-drop class specific items.<br>
<br>
Points are awarded on a per player basis. Unless otherwise agreed upon with the officers prior to the raid, the character attending the raid is to be considered the current “main” for the purpose of “can and will use”. A player playing 2 characters on a raid will receive the same amount of Raid Points as a player playing a single character.<br>
<br>
Points are awarded after a raid. (i.e.: You had 10 points before the raid. The raid is worth 10 points. For the purposes of bidding during the raid, you have 10 points (not 20) to spend). <br>
<br>
A wrap up of each raid awarding raid points will be posted on the board with attendance and RP expenditures. The Master Raid Point Total List will also be updated. Members have 3 days from the post of the wrap up to post discrepancies. After 3 days the wrap up stands as posted and no further adjustments to members RPs will be made.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Earning Points </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Points are earned by attending Dark Brigade events. If you arrive at an RPA event late or leave early it is your responsibility to inform the RP officer.<br>
<br>
There are three types of events. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1. Scheduled Guild Raids requiring sign up (generally held on Saturdays) are worth 10 points.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> All raids requiring sign up will clearly be noted as such on the board and in the guild motd as RPA (Raid Points Awarded) and will be posted both places at least 2 days in advance. <br>
<br>
§ To earn full points you must attend sign up for the raid in advance and over ½ of the raid. <br>
<br>
§ Attendance to the raid without advance sign up is worth 5 points<br>
<br>
§ Attendance to the raid without advance sign up and staying less than ½ the raid is worth 2.5 points.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2. Scheduled Guild events not requiring sign up (generally held on Tuesday evenings) are worth 10 points.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
§ To earn full points you must attend over ½ of the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3. Epic kills that cannot be planned in advance are worth 5 points. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
§ To earn points you must attend the entire fight<br>
§ The spawn must be a rare, random epic spawn unable to be scheduled.<br>
§ For points to be awarded there must be at least 10 Dark Brigade members attending.<br>
§ An officer must be on line and announce the call to arms and the awarding of raid points for the fight <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Spending Points </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
With the exceptions below, items that drop during a raid will be given a point value to start bidding at. The officers will come to a decision on the value before the Loot Officer announces the bidding.<br>
<br>
Twink junk/armor 2 points: (smouldering brand, giant scalemail etc.)<br>
Major drop gems 5 point (diamond &amp; blue diamond)<br>
Minor Items: 10 points. (something that a main would use)<br>
Major Items: 20 points. (an OMG item. Like IGS, or a class BP)<br>
<br>
Exceptions:<br>
<br>
§ Epic Pieces are awarded by decision of the officers based on who is furthest along on the epic requiring that piece and player’s participation in the guild.<br>
<br>
§ Minor non-quest gems are sold for reagent recompense and guild funds.<br>
<br>
§ Quest gems will be held in the guild bank until such time as a guild member has received a drop and is in need of gems. Quest gems are on a first come first serve basis.<br>
<br>
§ Spells will be held in the guild bank until such time as a member is of sufficient level to be able to scribe the spell. Spells are on a “first come first serve” basis.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bidding </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A character that will actively use the item always has the option to buy it first.<br>
<br>
The RP Officer will announce the item and the opening bid price.<br>
<br>
If your character presently being played can and will use the item you may bid on it starting at the announced opening bid. Bidding will continue auction style between players desiring the item until such time as one person remains bidding. The item will go to the highest bidder, who will have the final bid total deducted from their raid point total. No other characters bidding will lose raid points. You may not bid more points than you presently have on an item. <br>
<br>
If no one that can and will use the item wants it, the item is placed in the guild bank. Items in the guild bank are posted on the board with an opening bid price in Raid Points and may be bid on by anyone in the guild. If there is interest in an item, bidding may continue for 7 days, after which time the item goes to the highest bidder for the final bid's Raid Points. If after 14 days there is no interest in the item, the item is removed from the guildbank and sold for guild funds. <br>
<br>
No Drop items are a special case. The normal rules apply unless only one character can use the item. If that is the case the item may be purchased at the opening bid cost. If the player chooses not to pay that price then the item rots or is destroyed. A player may still buy the no drop item if they will go into negative points.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Negative Points </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A player may go into negative points ONLY on class specific, no drop items that no other character on the raid can and will use. If a character is in negative points, no bidding on items may happen until the character is back into positive point totals.<br>
