Qoute:<br>
<br>
========================<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
========================<br>
<br>
<br>
As the author of one of the main EverQuest server monitor tools (EverMon) over the last 3 days I have recieved several e-mails from people asking about why EverMon, as well as all th other everquest server monitor tools that exist our all showing player counts of 1 for each server. <br>
<br>
Yesterday, I recieved e-mail confirmation from SOE that they have decided to remove the ability for people to know how many players are on each server. I have also learned they will soon be doing this to the in-game player counts you see on the server select screen as well. The official reason I wsa given for thos change is that SOE feels people are more interested in thestatus of a server (if it's up or down), rather than the number of players on that server. <br>
<br>
We are very disappointed to see SOE make such a wide spread change, especially this far into the life cycle of EverQuest. Now only have player counts assisted in allowing players to determine which servers were the most and least crowded, or in deciding when the best time for them to play was, based on graphs similar to what we have provided here on EverLore, they have also helpd to server as diagnostic tools as to knowing if your the only person who is having problems connecting to your server, or if many people are. <br>
<br>
It's our hope that this latest nerf by SOE does not set a trend for how they plan to handle their future MMORPG projects, such as the upcoming SWG. It's are belief that a company like SOE should attempt to find ways to further enhance their tools and information provided to the paying customer, and not focus on ways to further restrict them. <br>
<br>
The changes made will effect all server monitor and server status tools that have previously reported player counts. Further, we will soon have to remove the server graph sections here on EverLore, as their is no longer a  source of data for them. If you have any questions as to how this will further effect EverMon, or the EverLore stats, please feel free to contact me via e-mail. <br>
<br>
========================<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
========================<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, I don't complain about SOE or Everquest policies very often.  In fact I try to see both sides and understand that there are good and bad parts to every decision...  But <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.everlore.com/Comments.asp?ID=488007&amp;pg=1&amp;sortby=4#Comments">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is just stupid.<br>
<br>
No matter what thier fears are about losing population to other games or having to create new servers because of over population, this will not solve anything.  (I have heard both arguments and they are diametrically opposed to one another)<br>
<br>
Not only have they removed the monitoring tool, but they are going to remove the population numbers from the login screen, that is just plain STUPID.  I can't think of any word that I wouldn't turn red saying to describe it.<br>

<br>
On the other hand exactly how many people have netmon implemented and how is it operating? Does it add overhead to the servers? Not sure how it is designed but if removing netmon improves connection/game performance I am all for it.<br>
<br>
Personally if I were them I might think about taking that ability away too, I wouldn't want people having solid reports on server availabilty =) <br>
<br>
Is it really in Sony's interest for people to have detailed log files on their server availability? Hmm yes your servers were down 20% of the time this year Sony please reimburse all users of your service xxx dollars.<br>

and they say the same thing (made clearer by the mature version)!  I'm so proud of you Tat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The mature version provokes a similarly mature response, which I will provide here..<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, you have a point there, Tat.  In truth, I saw his post here and actually posted to everquest board about the subject.  Hopefully others will do the same, and Verant will realize that we actually do want to see how many people are playing and perhaps change it back.  Or, at the very least provide a better reason for the change other than 'Up or Down is good enough for the players.'<br>

So lemme get this straight, because you've seen it on this board means you go along and be just as rude? My dad always liked to ask me, &quot;just because everyone else steps in a pile of shit, does that mean you do too?&quot; I got the hint, and I now consider it some of the best advice he ever gave me. This advice I give to you =)<br>
<br>
Oh, and a personal request. Don't dumb me down by typing remarks about how people's perceptions and assumptions vary, causing me to waste thought on something that I've known since I was 3 (people think differently! oh my!). I'm gonna guess that you're trying to send some sort of message to your reader when you type stuff like this. The message I get is that you're putting way too much time into justifying why you need not look at any one else's point of view but yours.<br>
<br>
My statement was an effort to end his post so he wouldn't get sarcastic condescending replies. I obviously failed in this effort. <br>

Don't justify it, because we know your intent is to be an asshole here and deviate conversation back to the topic that interests you most whether the dragon you killed is a diameter in size larger and bigger than the one that WL did so that you can gather attention and be the egoist you are? Why are you writing to me about all this other condescending stuff when you are the one to lay the first blanket statement? I assume you must be doing this because you believe your point is valid for stimulating thought in the audience. <br>

This advice coming from the man with the poopy slinging monkey? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 8/30/01 3:58:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#939393>(8/30/01 4:31:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://wsphotofews.excite.com/002/7O/UE/aN/7V68762.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Yep.  Poop flinging monkies don't hurt, only stink really bad (unless they been eating small sharp rocks, I suppose).<br>
<br>
You're making progress, but we still got a long way to go.  <br>
<br>
Here's an exercise for you, Tat:  If the thread concerning the dragons is not a pissing contest, then describe what it is.  Your reply must not include any sarcasm or condescension or other negative remarks, and should not include quotes or be edited.<br>
<br>
I'm at home and getting ready to log on EQ to have some fun, so I fear I won't be replying for a while.  If anybody else wants to post some honest-to-goodness words of encouragement, please feel free =)<br>
