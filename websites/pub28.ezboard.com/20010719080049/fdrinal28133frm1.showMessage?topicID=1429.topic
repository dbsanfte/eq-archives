<br>
there was a guild called Clan Bloodclaws on Mith Marr, mostly beta players and they where the shit. they where basicly the best of the best. they where the first on our server to kill the big named mobs. when a server would go up Clan Bloodclaws (hearby to be refered to as CBC) would have Vox and nag dead in like 2 hours. now people would try to set up raids but there were not enough high level players to get a raid going fast enough,. and if a mixed raid was scheduled alot of poeple didnt show up. and since we hardly got a shot at vox or nag, when we did get a raid and beat CBC to it. we got our asses kicked. and CBC would come in and clean up the mess.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you want to kill vox or nag all you have to do is beat us to it&quot; it was that simple. there where no if, and's or buts about it. they where the toughest kid on the block and they made the rules. so eventualy Divine Destiny was born. this guild was made up of pretty much the rest of the hgih level players that where not in CBC. they went head to head with CBC and the momentum started to  change. <br>
<br>
during this time Thott and some other people decided to make 1 build guild that had all the hardcore Raiders in it. and they where going to form up and take on the toughest challenges the game had to offer. that was when Afterlife was formed. key members from Divine Destiny went over to AL. and the server was back in the same situation it was in before. now AL controled mobs on the server and if you wanted to kill one, &quot;All you have to do is beat us to it&quot; so this is the way it went. AL could form a spur of the moment raid and be anywhere they wanted to in under 30 miuntes.  VS and Trak would be dead within like an hour and a half after the server coming up, this was when only like 3 or 4 other servers had killed trak. <br>
<br>
The only way to get things done was to make big guilds, or make a small guild and have a good rep. then go and take what you wanted. if someone was there already, oh well you just wern't fast enough. this was bread into us from the beging, &quot;If you want it, you just have to beat us to it&quot; setting up a schedule for alot of us would be borring. you could take your time and dilly dally all you want. part of the challenge of the *uber mob/plane* is getting there first. <br>
<br>
but we do have a rotation set up for VS and Trak. that curently has i think 6 guild in it for VS, im not sure about trak. back on Mith marr (before the upgrade) Fear and Hate where just regular zones, and where empty like 75% of the time, if no one was up there you went up. if someone was then you looked for soemthing else to do. <br>
<br>
Dont take this post the wrong way, im not sayng that a callendar sucks etc etc.  im just saying that for alot of us its just to forein. having a callendar for us is the same as if someone thought that selibis was to crowded and it should have a callendar.<br>
<br>
well I realy should get back to work. take care.  <br>

When you are trying to get it going on just an honor system, there are way too many variables. Many people might not know about the system. Many wont care. Some might be there form different country. Lots of problems there. I think the only way it works is if Verant makes the zones controlled to the point that they have to spawn the zone for the raid as they move in on a time that they set up with verant to raid that zone...and I really don't see something like that really making anyone happy...<br>

<br>
Sounds to me from their rules they tried to make it self regulating in a few ways. First if a guild were to go up there without knowledge of the system they would quickly learn that there are &quot;several&quot; guilds participating, therefore, they would find themeselves at odds with several guilds not just one voice if they didn't heed to the system. That could have several impacts. <br>
<br>
Imagine the type of membership they would retain if at odds with other guilds. Does anyone (or a majority) really want to be in a guild which is incapable of getting along with other guilds?<br>
<br>
The sheer numbers involved with those who are participating in the calendar become a force to be reckoned with, and probably too much of a force to have fun disputing with.<br>
<br>
Seems from their rules if the calendar is not adhered to they aren't able to go post on it for 30 days. That is a consequence for them to consider before taking action of not heeding the calendar.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am curious to know why you think Verant should implement rather than the players. We tend to be self-regulating in almost every other social aspect. Not saying that is right or wrong, but just wondering why.<br>
<br>
Someone made a comment that this calendar was implemented by brute force of a larger more dominating guild. It would make sense to me that they would be the ones to implement it, but it also shows a significant effort on their part to do something about the planes dispute issue.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I totally disagree with the approach of no calendar if you get your forces together fast enough you get the plane mentality - but it does seem that there are a lot of people who are sensitive to that.<br>
<br>
I still haven't quite figured out why it is they have some special stipulations on the boss mobs. It appears from some of the postings they do not want to allow the mobs to sit for some period of time and may call in some special force to clear them out. Not sure I understand that fully.<br>
<br>
The biggest issue I see is that someone has to &quot;want&quot; to maintain the system, looks like a lot of work but feasible. <br>

<br>
Ok I read what I wrote, and I didn't say that inadvertantly. Thanks aakla for a well thought out reply.<br>
<br>
Zenia, you sure you speak for &quot;everyone&quot;..? no offense intended at all, but I remember some pretty passionate debates about it at one time. <br>
<br>
I remember a while back when there were some people<br>
very pro-raid reservations (think they came from Tunare)...problem is they<br>
never seemed to be able to get the consensus they needed...but it didn't<br>
look like a consensus &quot;building&quot; exercise took place.<br>
<br>
I just found it pretty fascinating that this other server did manage to accomplish it, since it was a pretty futile debate on ours..that was the only thing. I spoke to someone about the game he said they live by a calendar, spoke highly of it and I thought it was pretty cool that they were able to build the consensus to make it happen.<br>
<br>
I found their forums and their debates to be more detailed and focused around a calendar than on PMR, Thogg, Shaere etc. but that is just an additional benefit. <br>
<br>
I am not really impacted either way, and it didn't bother me much in the past either. I am probably much more rudimentary in my thinking though. If we got to hate and someone was there already more power to them. It was never important to me, particularly after the 2nd or third time up..Always felt like well we could find something better and new to do instead,but I was never someone who picked out pieces of armor and said &quot;I need to go get that from xxx plane&quot;. Whatever landed in my lap is what I wore and it turned out pretty well that way. <br>
<br>
So I didn't get a halo from hate, well a crown dropped in PoG which I wasn't expecting nor new existed, and that was kewl! The game is and was always much more about the &quot;encounter&quot; to me, I liked a good group/raid who enjoyed playing at their best, that could not be done by revisiting the same plane over and over again *yawn boring*.<br>
<br>
I don't see any value in my proposing a calendar, do you? I do think that there was a time when there were a lot of people in this forum strongly in support of one. I guess if I were them my first step would be to see how other people managed to do it.<br>

Even if we had only 2 days a week that people in guilds and what not would stay out of the planes and let people in that situation schedule and plan their play time it would open up new avenues for a lot of people that only dream of going to the planes but can't.<br>
<br>
Also, your comment about calenders only working for a few guilds does not fit the reference we are looking at.  If you will visit that link and click on links you will see that the guild participation on that server in the calendar program is very large.<br>
<br>
The reason a calander isn't currently in operation on Drinal is because a handful of guilds refuse to work with the community.  I would bet that a majority of the guilds out there would entertain the notion of a calendar system to make life easier.<br>
<br>
Besides a schedule is only work for the persons doing the scheduling and it's not much work at all for what you get out of it.<br>
<br>
Also, many guilds let others come join their raids so it would also create an open venue for people to make contacts and look forwards to up and coming events.<br>

You always have someone that doesnt know or ignores it. If Im up in Hate and we're killing stuff and what-not, and another guild pops up and says &quot;but we had this time reserved on the calendar&quot; my response is &quot;so?&quot;. You are there first, you get it. I dont see the large guilds on drinal being so discourteous that a calendar is needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugozaro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gozaro</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/gozaro_head.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#993300>(3/27/01 11:52:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh great, here we go again....</span><hr size=1> Well all it really takes is a few committed people/guilds.  Our guild has always respected EVERY post made to the raid boards and always will.  I guess that's the best we can do against the first come first serve mentality.<br>
My responce would have been &quot;DOH.. well it's broke now come on in and sorry we missed your post.&quot; <br>
..but of course we never miss a post =)<br>
