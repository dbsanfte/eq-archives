<br>
It's been a year, and it took me that long to get past enough of the shock and the pain of what happened to cry. I remember hearing something was happening in New York...something everyone assumed was some terrible accident. I turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane crash.<br>
<br>
I sat there, dumbfounded, as fires burned and finally, the towers fell. I remember walking out to my front porch to lower the flag I had flown there for years to half-mast....a position it had never had to be in. It took me 10 minutes just to untie the old knots. Five minutes of that time was spent with one arm around my wife and one hand holding the half-untied string-I stared at the clear blue sky and thought...&quot;My god, its a beautiful day to be such an awful day&quot;.<br>
<br>
My wife asked me to go to school to get my daughter (who was in first grade). At first I tried to convince her that it wasn't nessicary, there was no danger here in the middle of nowhere. Then I realized I needed to hold her in my arms as much as my wife did...it wasn't fear of an attack, but the need to be with our loved ones. I walked the three blocks to school, just marveling at how quiet everything was...I think everyone was inside watching TV-I honestly don't remember seeing a single car on the road. I got to the school and passed the police officer that had been sent over and asked to pickup my daughter.<br>
<br>
They told me it wasn't nessicary, everything was safe. I just kind of mumbled something at them about wanting her home and they didn't say anything more except &quot;we'll have her ready in a minute.&quot; We spoke in hushed tones about what had happened while we waited...when my daughter finally walked into the office, it suddenly took all my willpower not to scoop her up and run home, but I stopped myself so she wouldn't get scared.<br>
<br>
We walked home slowly, drinking in the beauty of that day. It took me about 5 minutes to answer the question she asked me when I first picked her up &quot;Why do am I going home early?&quot; I realized I had to look at her and destroy a small piece of her innocence...to tell her that there was evil in the world. How do you tell someone two days before their seventh birthday that there are some things that mommy and daddy can't stop? Some evils too great for even those gods she calls parents to prevent? Finally I just told her &quot;some bad people ran a plane into some buildings in New York and they think alot of people have died.&quot; I spent the rest of the walk home watching a small bit of the light in her eyes fade as I explained why people would do that and she started to comprehend exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
And I took the pain that started to rip apart my soul and tucked it away so I could be strong for her. Strong for my wife, who still wasn't sure if her family who worked within a few hundred yards of the towers were safe (they were, thankfully). Strong for my four year old son who now, at five, still doesn't quite know what happened...there's that small blessing, at least.<br>
<br>
I spent the next several weeks, hell, still to this day, trying to explain to my daughter why this happened. We have a newspaper from September 12th and I still find her sometimes looking at that picture on the cover of the ruined buildings with the words &quot;Today, our nation saw evil&quot; above them. And a bit of darkness passes over her face...darkness that shouldn't have had to be there for a very long time.<br>
<br>
And so, today, sitting up in bed with my kids tucked in and my sick wife asleep next to me, watching some concert for New York on VH1, I finally cried. I finally dug deep enough through the shock to let that pain start to come out...pain for 2800 lives lost and tens of thousands more destroyed...pain for the children who will never see their fathers and mothers again...<br>
<br>
But mostly, I cried for innocence lost. <p><table border=1>

He was a hippy wouldnt even let his kids play Mario Brothers cause he thought it was teaching kids to hurt people. But here it is 1 year later and hes still gone. The thing that makes me the most upset is that we as a people didnt seem to think it could happen to us. I never even dreamed anything like this could happen. On the lighter side today there are more people proud to be from the U.S there there where before. sorry cant think of what else to say.<br>

your not the only one who cried, yesterday morning, on my way back from a dr appt with my 5 yr old, at the exact time the first plane hit 1 year ago the radio went silent for a full minute, and i remember exactly what i saw and felt that day. i cried that day and many since then, my heart still aches for all those hurt by september 11th.<br>
i decorated my car with red/white/blue ribbons, they were on my car for 9 months before they were removed....and replaced with new ones the day before my husband came home from sea duty. they will be there for a long time to come.<br>
&lt;3 to all my friends, and even those i do not know that just need a hug or a smile.<br>

<br>
Real men do cry, a real man isn't scared of his tears.  A Real man is strong for his family, a real man takes care of his wife, his children and those he cares about.  A real man looks into the eyes of the most beautifull little girl he has ever seen, and tells her the truth.  A real man stands behind his actions and knows he is strong enough to take the effect of what ever may Result.<br>
<br>
A Real man don't cry you say ?   I only hope that 1 day, when I have children .. I am able to show half the strength that Higar has shown us today ...<br>
<br>

Little late in the responce, but it has taken me this long to figure out what I wanted to say, and figure out how to say it.  Thanks for allowing us to share in something with you, it wasn't easy .. but I think you proved, jus exactly what a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> REAL MAN </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> does for his family ...<br>
<br>
Take care, /hugs for the wife and your children ... there is nothing more I can say <p><img src="http://www.lvcm.com/darkelf/fuq_cih.gif" border=0 alt="Kill the Cats!!  We are the Cats ... oh, right .."></a><br>
