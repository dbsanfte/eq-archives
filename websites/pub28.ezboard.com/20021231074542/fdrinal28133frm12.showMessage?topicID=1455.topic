From what I know of this alot of good items were taken and a character was deleted.<br>
<br>
Apparently the person was banned ( by EQ ) for doing this. Too bad they can't ban their ISP addy.<br>
<br>
The persons name was TYONA who was a member of Crimson Twilight I believe ( chanter ) Arjoo is the person talking who is TYONA.<br>
<br>
 I think a person sent a misstell with the password of the first account to TYONA and TYONA took full advantage of it by logging on and then getting passwords from their friends accounts--which is quite easy considering they were all pretty close, trusting friends:<br>

recent events have brought things to a halt at the loss of a new family member, my mother is on vacation with her manfriend in arizona and if you know anyway to more quickly contact them through some other way than cell phones because they are turned off, please do suggest anything, calling every 4-5 star hotel in scottsdale/phoenix will take awhile<br>
if you dont have anything to help the situation, please refrain from trying to put me down, thank you <br>
