Wish I could remember the article but her son had severe emotional problems before he played EQ, would not cooperate with counseling, wouldn't cooperate on taking his medication.  At the point where he killed himself he had withdrawn into a severe depression for a couple months.  Noticed the article barely mentioned any of that in even a sentence.  <br>

<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
To Wendy Mesley, Reporter for CBC News:<br>
This E-mail is in response to the Everquest news story <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/health/everquest/">cbc.ca/consumers/market/f...everquest/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Brief background on myself so you know where I’m coming from here:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m 23 years old, happily married, employed, with a college degree.  I started playing Everquest when I was 20, and have since logged many hours in-game.<br>
<br>
Okay, on with the rant:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My issue with the news story was not in the accuracy of the content, but in the obvious bend of the story in the favor of the mourning mother, pointing the blame at the big power-hungry corporation that markets the product.  You failed to appropriately present both sides of the story.  The single mom we got to meet at the beginning of the segment was your only moderate proponent of the game as an innocent form of entertainment, and the narrative did its best to openly contradict her and mock her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Everquest, and other online games of its type, are addictive.  There, I said it.  I think the REAL issue here is our definition of addictive.  If by addictive, we mean, like cocaine, which actually alters chemical balances in your body and creates a physical addiction to the substance, then we’re pretty safe saying that games are not addictive, at least not by that definition.  If we define addictive as simply conducive to an increased desire to play, then maybe we’re getting somewhere, but that’s still not quite enough.  People committing suicide is a bigger deal than just an increased desire to play.  I find the best definition of addictive, when referring to video games, is the one we find in Webster’s Dictionary under “addict”:<br>
<br>
1 : One who devotes or surrenders (oneself) to something habitually or obsessively (addicted to gambling)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Note the careful usage of the word “oneself”.  Notice that nowhere in the definition does it say that the gambling is the source of the action.  The addict “surrenders” himself to the addiction.  Whether consciously or not, the action lies with the addict, not with the addiction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using this definition, we can therefore lump addictive video games into the same category as delicious food, entertaining television programming, movies, music, and others.  They are harmless, in and of themselves, and the companies that produce them are merely using good business sense when they make them appealing.  Why do I order a Quarter Pounder with Cheese every time I go to McDonald’s?  Because I’ve had the sandwich before, I enjoy the taste, and I have surrendered myself to habitually ordering it upon entering the restaurant.  Why do I eagerly await the release of the next album by my favorite artist?  Why do I spend money to purchase it and then listen to it over and over again?  Because historically, I have greatly enjoyed the music of this artist, and I anticipate greatly enjoying it again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the person behind the counter messes up my Quarter Pounder and it doesn’t taste right, do I commit suicide?  No, I complain to whoever is near me, maybe I order something else next time, maybe I forgive and try again.  If my favorite artist puts out his next album and all the songs feature Yanni and Zamphyr, do I freak out and hang myself?  No, I just probably won’t call that artist my favorite any more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Notice that I am the one doing all of the action here.  I am the one eating the burger.  I am the one buying the CD.  I am the one deciding what I do with myself.  If counseling can help a person with an addiction, then it is truly the person who was the problem in the first place, because the addictive product remains.  The existence of non-addicted Everquest players, non-addicted cheeseburger eaters, and non-addicted music fans proves that the product can have only as much control over a person as they allow (See surrender, devote).<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The suicide of Shawn Woolley was tragic, but the accountability for the situation cannot fall on a group of CEOs hundreds of miles away trying to successfully market a product.  Personal accountability is a lost idea in our world, and we as a society need to learn that tossing blame around will never solve anything.  Shawn Woolley decided to take his life based on his perception of the world around him.  He decided to play Everquest, he decided to load that gun, and he decided to pull that trigger.  The only person that could have saved Shawn was himself, and he chose against it.  We can all sit here and say that his family should have done this or that, but then we’re just throwing more blame.  His mother can sit there and say that the game makers should have done this or that, but we’re still pointing fingers.  Shawn decided to play the game, and Shawn decided to take his life.  Suicide is never someone else’s fault.  Other things can influence the person, but in the end, the person decides to take their life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is B.J. May, and I’m addicted to Everquest.  I have made rules for myself to help me be responsible about my time.  My wife has a day job, and my job involves much more variance in hours.  Some times I’m home when she is not.  These are the ONLY times that I allow myself to play.  When my wife and I are both home, the game is off… period.  I have made these rules for myself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In closing, please, in the name of honest, accurate reporting, please do more than just grab the side of the story that has the most emotional impact and run with it only.  Don’t confuse good marketing and high product quality with addiction conspiracy.  Sony is doing the same thing your newscast is doing.  They are trying to produce compelling entertainment, so that revenues will stay high and customers will stay loyal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is B.J. May, and I’m addicted to Everquest.  I am.  Me.  Nobody made me.  I chose to buy the game, and I choose to play it often.  I am accountable for myself.<br>

Those same news programs are marketed exactly like anything else, that's why you only see the sensational stuff.  It keeps people coming back, or should I say.... ADDICTED? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And I guarantee more people have committed suicide after watching all the depressing shit on the news than playing EQ.<br>

They wouldn't get much attention from a story whose headline read 'Everquest: A good Pastime'. <br>
<br>
The story in itself is tragic, and also what happened to the mother. As far as I understood it a year ago she wanted to find out her son's name on Everquest to try and find out what happened, what people he knew, etc, but Sony chose not to divulge that information. All in accordance to their privacy poilcy which protects all of us, but i do understand her reaction to the whole ordeal.<br>
<br>
That said, EQ cannot ever be to blame for how different people react to the way life treats them. It's an addictive game, but that is the way it was deisgned.<br>
