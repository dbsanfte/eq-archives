Everyone is like ok np...<br><br>I get on my YZF R6 (crotch rocket) and get on the highway to head to the closest convenience store open at 3am. Get my cigs and pop and get back on the highway heading back. My bike goes 0-80 in about 2 seconds so I get off the ramp and open it up just a moment after a car passes in the far left lane. He was easily doing 80 . In a few seconds I am almost passing him going into a turn banking left when all of a sudden his car cuts across me missing me by about a car length. He cuts over three lanes hits the curb hits the beginning of the guard rail. The rail rides up over his hood and cuts the roof of his car off. His car rides under the guard rail for a quarter mile until the front of his car digs into uneven ground. The sudden halt of forward motion of his car launches his wife and 3 year old out through the now open roof of his car launching them a good 30 yards. He was launched head first into the guard rail that is still over the top of his car.<br><br> As soon as he sliced across in front of me I slowed down and got to see the whole thing. I slow down and pull over to see the most gruesome thing I've ever seen in my life. His head was wide open with half his brain hanging out. DOA. Wife is in the brush just a bloody mess conscience but moaning in the worst agony I've ever heard. At the time I didn't know the child launched as it happened so fast. Once the paramedics showed up they found her even further away than the mother still alive. <br><br>No idea why he lost control. It was good road conditions. Drunk, fell asleep at the wheel, or fighting with wife is all I can imagine. I had to wait for two hours to give a statement to the police. I smoked a whole pack of cigs in the two hours waiting. I never did get to hear what happened to the mother and child. Very sad incident. There are a dozen things that could of held me up one second on my travel home from the store. Thank the lord I am here to type this every day now. I didn't ride my motorcycle for two weeks after that and I still get nightmares on occasion of the whole bloody scene. <br><br>Judging by that severity of that accident in that pic it looks as if the driver and or passengers would have died on impact. Never understood why people laugh at others misfortune. Maybe a psychological coping mechanism. /shrug<br><br>Needless to say the group was a little pissed that it took over two hours to go get cigs but didn't care I was still shaking and my mind wasn't into the game the rest of the night. Anywayways group broke up and I logged to go have a good long talk with wife about the whole deal. Thankfully she was understanding and didn't mind me waking her up in the middle of the night to chat. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujarakmase.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarak Mase</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CiH Asshole</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/02 3:29:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.opeth.com/images/still_thumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  The Curse of Kedge Keep</span><hr size=1> First time I ever stepped foot in Kedge Keep with my Paladin in late '99  he got raped in about 10 seconds.. I decided not to go back for a long time<br><br>Second time I went to Kedge Keep, Rogue was level 55 going down to help a wizard with Epic Quest, while I'm in the dungeon, a neighbor kid is bugging me to see my bird, awesome lovebird, finally let the kid, and when I wasn't paying attention, the kid was booking home as fast as he could.. he was, for some god only knows reason, opening the door, evidently to get the bird fresh air, and it flew away.<br><br>Third Time in Kedge Keep, I was down with Jarak he was level 60 helping yet again for wizard epic. about 1am in the morning, I hear a loud crash outside, I think it's punks hitting baseball bats on garbage cans. I try to ignore it. few seconds later, hear another crash, this time I jump up to the window and yell outside, "HEY!" hoping to startle them, so they would run along home. about 30 seconds after that, I hear another crash. Now I'm pissed, I run outside to the backyard with no shoes on in shorts and t-shirt ready to kick some ass. I hear another crash, I open the fence on the side of my garage to walk along the front, as soon as I walk through the gate, a white SUV comes crashing through, from the side of my garage out the front of it, lifting the garage door about 20 feet in the air, barely missing me, I get freaked out, run back in the house, thinking that someone is deliberatly destroying my garage for some reason, possibly has a gun, and I didn't feel like getting shot, thousand things running through my head, so I run in the house and call the police, watching out the kitchen window, the garage is half standing, supported only by the back wall, and the wall closest to my house about 25 feet away from the kitchen window, the SUV then backs up into the fence, knocking it over. Pulls forward, then backs up again faster hitting a tree. now I'm thinking they're trying to run into my house, I yell outside, "I'M CALLING THE COPS!" the SUV the pulls out and accelorates rapidly out of sight, followed by another crash. it is silent for a few seconds, then I hear a man moaning loudly "help me!!!" still on the phone with the police, I tell them of the person I hear, and he is probably seriously injured, so they sent out an ambulance. I run back outside to find the SUV crashed at a concrete garage with the driver's side door left open and still running, up the alley a bit, there's a man lying in a ditch, the neighbor's garage to the right had also been hit, and came on at a different angle, tearing the entire front of their garage off, and plowed over a row of small trees that had bordered their yard. The man lying in the ditch had a punctured lung, and his knee was split open, and bleeding out the back of his head. My garage, was completely trashed, the neighbor to the left had a corner taken out by the SUV, and the garage past that, where it finally stopped, had a large gash in the corner.<br>The story leading up to the disaster:<br>The driver of the SUV was a 14 year old girl, trying to escape from the man that was lying in the ditch, he had attempted to rape her, and she fleed in his vehicle, he had jumped on top and broke the glass on the driver's side and was trying to grab onto her, she was swirving all over the alley trying to get him off, he had first fallen off when she went through the trees and into the first garage, he climbed back up, then she drove into my garage, he was still on, when she went completely through my garage, at the time when I came out to check what was going on nearly getting hit, he fell off again, and then crawled up to the ditch, still in panic, the girl drove off, when she finally crashed at the concrete garage, she got out of the vehicle and started running, knocking on random people's doors trying to get in and call for help. she was later picked up at a gas station 3/4 mile down the road where she called the police from a payphone. The man that had fallen into the ditch last I heard is at 30% lung capacity, had his left leg removed and was in the hospital. this happened last August, and I can still remember everything that happened perfectly clear. Something, I think, that will stick with me forever.<br><br>I have not returned to Kedge Keep since then, in fear of a plane crashing on my house =\  but I gotta get that damn Corrupted Sea Horse for Adinus' epic... wish me luck! <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=40772 ><br><b>Jarak Mase</b> (60th level Assassin)</a><br><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=100614">Adinus Griffonheart</b> (53rd level Wanderer)</a><br><img src="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/inny.jpg"><br><br><i>"Marauder,staining the soil, midst of stillness.Beloved fraternity to an end,red eyes probe the scene.

A drunk driver ran a red light killing all four people in the car with my sister.  This was many moons ago.<br><br>Then late last year I had to post this to my guilds boards<br><br>...start cut and paste...<br><br>Last night I got home from work and picking up my son and saw I had seven messages on my phone. After kicking off my shoes, changing into something more comfortable and pouring a stiff one (it was one of those days at the rat wheel) I started going through them.<br><br>All seven of them were from various people informing me that my husband was either in or on his way to ICU and where do I want the car towed. His car had been hit and demolished by a tractor trailer on his way home from one of his clients.<br><br>In sweats and slippers Dan and I were back in the car and off to the hospital. I had little to no details at all at this point, only that the car was totaled and Rob had been seriously injured enough to end up in ICU. Needless to say my heart was pounding and it was all I could do not to go into hysterics.<br><br>The entire left side of his body is a gigantic bruise, he has 18 breaks throughout his left leg, both arms, left hip, shoulder and ribs, and a mild concusion. He was unconscious when I got there and finally came around about 2:30 this morning, a little confused as to how he ended up in a stiff white suit. Doctors say he's going to be fine, but the road to recovery might take a while due to range of injuries sustained.<br><br>It seems the truck involved was not paying attention to the lights or flow of traffic and made a left turn into oncoming traffic. He smashed into the drivers side of the car and then went up and over the roof of the car.<br><br>I was at the hospital all night, but I'm back at work today.

His story had been printed on Darwin award shit.  He had an accident where his face was blown completely off.  From the nose down.  The picture showed him stomach down on a gurny, &quot;face&quot; propped up with his arms crossed under him.  A tooth was dangling from the bloody flesh on one side...you could clearly see his uvula...and his tongue was hanging down, having lost the support of his lower jaw.  His eyes were looking straight at the camera.  The guy was friggin conscious!  Don't know if he ended up living or dying, but all I could do was imagine the pain and the fear I'd feel being in that position.<br><br>I saw this picture and was completely freaked out for weeks.  Old childhood fears of the dark; pictures of myself recovering from having lost my face floating around in my head.  Finally, my sense of humor kicked in and I wrote the following onto the picture:<br><br>&quot;Damn paparazi!  Can you at least wait till I put my face on?&quot; and &quot;Wow! Those were some STRONG jalepenos!&quot;<br><br><br>I got what you were saying Doofy. <p><br>---<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126557" target="wolfran">Me</a> / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126564" target="alt">Twink</a><br><br><b>"Hanlon's Razor:</b><br>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umelegaunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melegaunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/29/02 9:27:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~eckerman/KOTG/pics/familiarface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: yeah...</span><hr size=1> Wow, reading this post has really depressed me.  <br><br>My own story:  one of the least popular girls in high school that everyone made fun of dies in a car wreck my senior year -- next day most of the popular people in the school are acting all sad when it was them who made her life miserable to begin with.<br><br>I hated them with a passion. <p><p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://personal.msy.bellsouth.net/~dentont/eqpics/Melegaunt.gif"><BR><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/arcasylum">Arcane Asylum</A> |<A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39165">Profile</A> | <a href="http://www.drinal.com">Drinal</A><BR> </CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umelegaunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melegaunt</A> at: 3/29/02 9:29:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulalluieni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lalluieni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/30/02 5:40:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dr. Hibbert Syndrome #1</span><hr size=1> nit picker!  nit picker!!!!  damn you and your incisiveness tyyche <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>and give me that hat back!  unless of course, you're also going to wear a corset... then i might let you borrow it for a small price... say, a picture or two?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>and doofy, i'd say dr hibbert's syndrome could possibly work.  people who may well be offended by it should now know not to look <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Life</span><br>  Posts: 1188<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/30/02 9:00:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   yeah....</span><hr size=1> I think from now on, i'll look for pictures where someone got hurt doing something really stupid....or just a picture that makes you say &quot;what the fuck?&quot;<br><br><br>Car accidents are to common, and tragic to use as a dr. hibbert syndrome....a person who see's a picture of a car accident might think of a person they knew who was injured/killed in a car accident...and thus you get what we have in the past 5 or 6 posts.<br><br>So, i'll look for different pictures. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uchrysaniatallanvor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chrysania Tallanvor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/31/02 4:52:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=677.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.vestlund.net/col/images/chrys2.jpg width=144 hight=164></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: yeah....</span><hr size=1> Yeah look under Darwin Awards, Doof.
