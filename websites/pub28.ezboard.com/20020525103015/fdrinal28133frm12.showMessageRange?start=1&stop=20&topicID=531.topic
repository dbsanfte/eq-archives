Following Clan's win on Telkorenar in West ToV, The Kindred, a very well known and honorable guild on our server, moved into HoT. Members of Clan were upset because they felt they were going to return to HoT for Dozekar. Understandable. However other members with &quot;seniority&quot; decided not to go which was gracious of them since with the numbers Clan had at the time they could have easily taken HoT. Now many who were disgruntled would complain as we all do.. I Myself am in dreadlands heading to KC....don't worry there is a point to this long winded story...... anyway... Certain members.. let's call them... A and B.... send me a tell in game for real names of these pricks... A proceeds to mock and attack those of clan who were upset about not goin to HoT. I spoke up and remarked &quot; It's understandable that they would be upset so why don't you show them some respect&quot;. Player A proceeded to attack and insult me.... now over the last few months people like this were begining to wear and tear on my patience.. so i /guildemoved myself from the notorious clan Skallagrim. Upon my leaving i amd sent close to about 30+ tells asking me why i left.... Player A decides to be a total liar and claim that i left due to Not winning the Lance of Thunder off Telk... <br><br>Now anyone who knows me in game knows i Weild the Black Rock Maul of Crushing.. a weapon MUCH better than the lance of thunder.... my use for the lance is null and i wouldn't take it even IF I HAD EVEN BEEN IN TOV.. which i wasn't i was in DL... <br><br>I try to explain that my reason for leaving was due to the complete lack of respect my &quot;family&quot;, as they like to think of themselves, showed me. No one deserves to be in any guild that has people that have no respect for the feelings of their fellow members. It's not fair and the game loses purpose then. <br><br>Now.. I attempt to state these feelings on the clan message baord. Low and behold my board access has so swiftly been removed by some person.... we will not infer who that is yet... cause even i don't know....<br><br>I wasn't even allowed the chance to tell my side of the story. i was simply denied. That's outright censorship. Clan officers with board admin ability OFTEN delete posts that speak negatively about how the clan is run or when a member leaves and is unhappy.. i have seen it done.. one minute a &quot;goodbye clan&quot; pos is there the next minute it's gone. This is customary to how Nazi Germany was run.... <br><br>So i am forced to post here.. hopefully many Drinal players will see this an Know once and for all the truth behind clan Skallagrim as now i have decided to cut my ties.. i do not wish to be associated with a guild that wishes to steal spawns in HoT from other guilds who were rightfully there or a guild that has no respect for anyone but themselves and even then their respect for fellow guild members is lacking.<br><br>Now do not get me wrong there are MANY wonderful people in Clan skallagrim.. Those of you who DID show kindness to me ( you know who you are) i will miss you and forgive me for this but it must be done... no one else will do it....<br><br>I spoke to Clan Skallagrim's leader player B.... oh screw it we know who he is.. the loving Kaldrani! /applaud............<br><br>seriously now... I am told that my side of the story is irrelevant and that i will not be permitted to even have somone reitterate what i say in Guild speech.... basicly i get sent to an internment camp never to be heard of again.<br><br>Ahem... i wil not be silenced.. i will not be ignored..<br><br>I am a human being... and as we all sem to froget sometiems this is a game.. and behind those pixels and polygons.. REAL HUMAN BEINGS with real feelings and real thoughts exist... Clan seems to forge this fact often as how they treat their members.. i am not alone in this treatment many others have left earlier than myself due to these policies. <br><br>To sum all this up... I left Clan Skallagrim cause they refuse to change.. and those in power or who hold seniority refuse to be respectful to anyone that is not bearing gifts for them. <br><br>I care nothing for lances or loot from you i merely wanted your friendship and a place to rest my head on Drinal.... and once again i will go Lobo and enjoy playing the game again becaue Kaldrani, Player A.... and Clan Skallagrim are no longer a part of my life... <br><br>I urge ANYONE who was planning or considering applying to Clan Skallagrim to think twice and weigh your options heavily.... because you might even quit this great game which has brought so many new and interesting people into our lives simply because they don't know how to be human.<br><br>Once again i use general terms like they only because if i used a list of names it would be even longer post... There ae hose in Clan at this moment who are good people and are wondeful to play with.. it is sad they choose to remain in clan and soil their names even further... i will gladly still group with those kind people they know who they are.... i Urge them to seek another place as well... becasue in the grand scheme o things..<br><br>Clan Skallagrim is like a Sinking ship... i am the first Sailor to hit the waves....<br><br>thank you and Good night.<br><br>Ashrahm Soulcrusher<br>Gravelord of the 60th Circle of Innoruuk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utheteaira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>theteaira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Man on the moon?</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 7:28:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The TRUTH about Clan Skallagrim</span><hr size=1> Sorry to hear that ash =( *hugs* wasn't there, eq isn't working, so know nothing of what happened, send me a tell in game when you see me on so we can talk ..<br><br>Teaira<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uashrahmsoulcrusher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AshrahmSoulcrusher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 7:30:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Tea Tea &gt;.&lt;</span><hr size=1> i will miss you teaira.. you were one of the gems *hug* always so kind to everyone.. even the ones wh didn't deserve it.. i hope my leaving won't change anything for our friendship... i will send you a tell asap  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uvernander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vernander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/14/02 7:42:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The TRUTH about Clan Skallagrim</span><hr size=1> From my point of view(it could be wrong) it looked like you were bitching and whining about killing cov dragons since it messed with your hard earned faction and there was nothing for you to gain from it.

You made your own truth, you believed it, you had other people in your guild believe it, and the ones that don't listen to propaganda bullsh<font size=2>it have no problems with me.<br><br>so yeah, I bring this up when I get the opportunity to show people how great Clan Skallagrim is represented by their leaders. At one time a respectable guild that I was proud to be a part of, as were many. You had good intentions on keeping the guild alive after alot of nasty sh<font size=2>it went on, that I'm still not fully aware of, but really don't care. You had things lookin good for the guild, but then after I started getting ideas, suggesting it to officers and yourself, getting ignored, scolded for putting RL above the guild overall treated like garbage, I was sick of it. You don't even know what went on cause you wouldn't listen. So instead, make up your own truth so you can feel better about yourself. You said I tried to destroy your guild and bring members with me to start my own guild, this was true, but! the members I had asked to join were members that I helped recruit into CS. Other members inquired about the guild, so I told them about it. I didn't randomly, or strategically go through the members and ask them.<br><br>anyway.. go ahead, tell everyone "the full story" and I'll have a chance to point out your flaws and correct you this time around since you won't have anyone to delete this entire thread and block my access to the board. <p><center><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/2.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
