The other post had 50 replies wonder if the positives can get just as many...Here's a few of mine.<br>
<br>
Going in to a new zone and being scared about it.<br>
<br>
Getting a pull you think you have to evac from and pulling it off. Hmm on that note when you do have to evac and everyone lives.<br>
<br>
Meeting new and knowing old nice people...that was one of the cool things about coming back from a long break to a new split server.<br>
<br>
Ogre's &quot;incoming&quot; messages - they are always hilarious<br>
<br>
Happy people when you help them with something e.g. a new person with a quest or helping them through a dangerous zone or a tough cr.<br>
<br>
When you wind up in a group not expecting much and they rock the house.<br>
<br>
Going on a planes raid not expecting anything and winning a really cool drop that you didn't know was there. I stopped looking at item lists for that reason...<br>
<br>
Levitate - reminds me of those dreams you have about flying.<br>
<br>
When a random Shaman runs by and slows a mob you knew you couldn't solo and you win<br>
<br>
When the ooc channel is filled with happy chatter on a successful raid.<br>
<br>
People who role play well (I don't do it well, but some of them crack me up).<br>
<br>
Happy newbies who got a drive by clarity...<br>
<br>
My first quest (Stein of Maggok) had so many ppl helping me and was tons of fun.<br>
<br>
When you think you are going to die cos you have a huge mob on you and a cleric has major snap and stuns it off....and other similar scenarios with other classes<br>
<br>
When you are in a potentially nasty situation (e.g. some type of spawn fight etc.) and the people turn out to be really cool about it...and you wind up with a new friend.<br>
<br>
Killing anything difficult for the first time...<br>
<br>
Encountering an unexpected tough mob ...mez doesn't work...root won't hold....but by some miracle charm works and I have a new damage dealing pet...<br>
<br>
When I came back from my six month break I was totally naked but went on some raids explaining to them I could just buff...and in two of those raids necro's (supposed to be evil folks) trusted me enough to lend me their gear during the raids when I hadn't asked ...they rocked.<br>
<br>
Being an enchanter...I had no clue what I was doing when I started this game so the fact that I played one was just luck...but I love my spells.<br>
<br>
The first time I solo'd a sand giant...<br>
<br>

BoTB tourny.<br>
<br>
What made the event so special was that I was talking to a friend at the time and I <br>
stated that if THoggs team lost in any of the matches, THogg would come up with some<br>
excuse why they lost and he would blame someone/something other then himself.<br>
<br>
And sure enough he proved me 100% correct.<br>
<br>
Other nice in game moments for myself were<br>
<br>
- Entering upper guk for the first time and finding out what a train really was.<br>
<br>
- Finally getting halfway into 20 and not worrying about losing the level, since I <br>
lost that level 7 times<br>
<br>
- The day Verant implemented the med while sitting and not having to stare at <br>
the spell book - hands down the BEST change ever!!!!<br>
<br>
- Grouping with Dyer and Phatal at any of their platinum camp spots.<br>
<br>
- Logging on the day after a Fear raid and learning that I was awarded a CRoA from<br>
the previous nights Cazic kill. Mostly becuase it was the first thing ever awarded to me.<br>
<br>
- Getting a Gilded Cloth after camping the Noble for 60+ hours. The relief was amazing.<br>
<br>
- Watching people I knew deserved stuff get stuff. Nothing topped being in Fear the night<br>
that Grunties got his Breastplate. Or Joli finishing her Carmine set. Or Aleal finally getting<br>
a piece of loot from Vox. <br>
<br>
- Watching Trakanon die on Tunare.<br>
<br>
- Sephy! quack,quack!<br>
<br>
- Last but definately not least, all the good players and good groups that I was in. You know<br>
the groups where there is no bullshit happening and you are sad when the group has to <br>
break up for the night. Hell one of the best groups I was ever in included Bosozuko <br>
(THoggs alt for the unenlightened) - imagine that! I still recall fondly the hotkey Boso<br>
had for smacking his pet in the ass with his stick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualealthewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleal the Wiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~fuellg/bobspinanim.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#993300>(3/2/01 8:22:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: here</span><hr size=1> - My team winning ToT1 was a big one for me.<br>

<br>
After playing for a few weeks straight (it seemed) and getting WAXED in e commons by those nasty Griffons with my first ever character (my warrior i recent started playing again) finally one day i saw someone shouting that they wanted everyone in the zone to help kill a griffon there had to be 30+ people casting/whacking this thing, ?Back then i thought i would NEVER see one of these fall!, and to top it off i got the killing blow lol 1hp of damage!<br>
<br>
Since i never have a required &quot;donation&quot; when providing GG for people, when people ask me what I charge for a GG i tell them no certain amount, but accept donations, and one time i looked in the trade window, adn someone gave me a Charred Guardian Shield as the donation, and this was soon after kunark went live and the shields were still around 1kpp!! Wow was i happy.<br>
<br>
The first time i solo'd a HG has to be up there, also another mob i NEVER anticipated that i would see fall, since they were so nasty running to the derv camp in w commons taking out whole groups of derv fighters with what seemed like one fell swoop!<br>

I look forward to big fights.  From 6+ skellys in a VX camp to taking down the big boss mobs.  That final charge or the chaos while the mobs are still out of control is a rush.<br>
<br>
I love it when everything goes smooth on a raid.  Who doesn't? (Best quote: 'Put on your game faces!')<br>
<br>
Pulling keeps me playing long after I should have logged for the night.  Always has.<br>
<br>
Being in on 'guild firsts' and helping figure out what to do. <br>
<br>
Taking down that mob when everyone says we'd get owned.  CiH rocks.<br>

<br>
I could take an analytical stab at that and say that people in general are pretty driven by negativity in this game. Put a post up about Thogg vs. PMR, such and such doing &quot;whatever&quot; wrong, or world vs. xxx guild and it immediately solicits a response. <br>
<br>
Makes you ponder human nature....so before you ask me &quot;why someone plays the game..they ought to just quit&quot; or whip out your latest disagreement with someone and try to nail them on credibility ...take a good hard look at why you do. <br>
<br>
I have found it phenomenally easy to throw stones at something someone has built, but in general I think it is against most peoples nature in this game to build something positive themselves. <br>

Enchanters were scouts(har har).  Qalar was not, Qalar was KoS.  Qalar did crowd control with no group.  Qalar wins lotto for first MM serve Insidious Robe, over 2 enchanters who &quot;scouted&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Qalar is happy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushadowcasta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadowcasta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(3/6/01 2:56:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> LMAO</span><hr size=1> /rofl Durgle<br>

Hmmm....I'd say soloing my first spectre when it was yellow to me.  Revenge for all those millions of times medding on the docks and bam! You have been slain by a Spectre...Loading zone please wait...<br>
<br>
When I first saw cazeltake out a whole group of lvl 50's, that was so awsome...<br>
<br>
When I conned an HG and it was yellow, I never thought I'd see the day!~!~!  <br>
<br>
Grouping with my friend that played 2 char's at the same time and we killed everything in permafrost all the way down to Vox's lair entrance :)<br>
<br>
Falling asleep when autorun was on in Oasis, I was found at the zone wall in the middle of the ocean by a GM.  That was funny.<br>
<br>
When I've been in a group next to zone and we are able to take out a train without any deaths!<br>
<br>
The most memorable moment is when I have crack!  and a crack dealer =p  Chanters rock :)<br>
