I know kids who go to logos ( a highly private christian school in my town) who are even foul mouthed.  I know parents who are, in fact most people have foul mouths.  I love it when you try to get to me, but you don't really.<br>
<br>
Btw, I'm 16.  Does that have any effect on me when you try to say I'm a teenager?  You know why it doesn't?  Because, you were 16 once.  Unless you just skipped that age.  Well, you were prolly some lonely pussy bitch.  I bet you're working at some surveying company calling up people and asking them questions for 5.50 $. <br>
<br>
Incompetent parents?  Try parent, my dad bailed yes he is incompetent*, but my mom does a lot more work than you.  Let's see you raise a kid on your own?  You prolly couldn't raise your dick on your own, much less a kid.<br>

And to jorply, exactly what point are you trying to prove?<br>
Oh yeah 9 out of 10 cat members have their epics, ROFL, right I believe ya, 9 out of 10 officer ass-kissers have their epics, if they are good at it. =) Hey jorply, I know exactly what's going on in your guild, would you be surprise if I tell ya I have access to your private board and I can read your guild chat anytime I want to? I know every little dirty secret in your guild, Ha, talk about greed, fights and arguments over loot decision. For those who don't know, officers decide who gets the loot every time an uber mob is killed, tell you what, this system doesn't work for shit, they are losing many members due to this crappy system, they left because they're fed up dealing with officers getting the BEST loot, period. Here are some examples: a guy named apocalus, who had already won bo staff of trorsmang in VP mind you, no doubt the BEST monk 2H Blunt in the game, got sleeper key before everyone else and won the priceless velium battlehammer. You guessed it he is an officer. Talk about GREED! and they said they are trying to avoid favoritism, LOL. I bet you're going to see Apoc wins primal! on their front-page soon. BTW talk about ST key, they had a huge fight over key distribution, 4 out of 5 officers got the keys, so they can get the best loots, AKA: priceless/primal weapons before everyone else.  what does that tell you? even monkey knows that CiH officers are the greediest people on drinal,(everyone hail to king of greed terok) Did you know CiH are recruiting new members? you guys know what kind of players they want? quote from Lern, &quot;we want people who want to kill uber mob and don't care about loot!&quot; LOL, sure sure sure, don't care about loot, there isn't any loot to care about because all good loots are going to the officers. CiH officers are treating members like they are idiots eh.<br>
<br>
Gee, flame boards are fun aren't they. Here are more dirty secrets that they don't reveal. Back to epic, jorply was bragging about how many of their members have their epics huh, hmm.. wasn't malosii trying to ask the guild for help to kill general few days ago? doesn't bizaro need that last piece from sky? and how many members just gave up their epic because there is zero chance that the guild will help? they all had to beg for other guilds for help didn't they? how pathetic, where is your guild support CiH? you guys don't care about your own members do you? are officers' epics more important than some of your guildmates'? or you just don't give a damn cuz you've already gotten yours and the only thing that matters is getting better loot for yourself and your friends? Oh I got it, you guys are just bunch of AL wannabes, tell you what, you aren't even close, do you see AL members asking other guilds for help on their epics? I don't think so. Did you know that AL members can spend 20dkp and the guild will guarantee to help that member on the hard part?  Heh, CiH top ten guilds in EQ? /LAUGH!, when the guild doesn't even give a crap about its own members, keep dreaming pussy cats.<br>

You aren't in the guild so why would you even care? Besides, we've lost about 4 members over the past 6 months, and I can almost garuntee that is much better than the loss your guild has had, if you even have one. Another thing, why do you think the officers and some members get better chances at loot than others? If you read our page and didnt come post on this thread blindly intending to stir an uproar, you would know that raid participation and attitude and all the other stuff thats listed under the rules list contribute to winning loot.<br>
<br>
So until you wanna get the fact straight dont talk on this board, cuz all you do is try to get attention and to dog on cats. And by the way things are going, it looks like we are accomplishing more than you or your guild will ever accomplsih ever in EQ, even though we are ran by &quot;lewt wh0res&quot; and &quot;greedie&quot; bastards.  <br>
<br>
Now I dono who you are, but you coming on this board and trying to start an uproar about Cats, when I can almost assure you that you know none ofthe members is pretty ignorant. Maybe you should stick to spiders in WC for a bit longer, and you wouldnt be attracted to these boards<br>

Ok tell me something, is everyone in this game for loot?  Some people actually just enjoyed killing things, I enjoyed the first time I fought trakanon, he ghosted to the bridge and gated and solo'd me.  That was fun as hell, good times.  Tell me if CiH is in such a hellish state.  Why are the members still sticking around instead of forming their own right guild, the same pattern that is repeated endlessly in EQ.  You quit a guild, take a string of members, create your idea of what a guild should be.<br>
<br>
CiH must be pure hell to be in.  If you don't like it quit.  If you like it more power to you.  I didn't like cih that much til towards the end.  I was antagonistic in this game, don't know why, would've been much more of a ride being positive and less sinical.  If you're not in cats, and not competing spawns with them(usually is pretty tough to compete with uber guilds).  Then who gives a shit, you can read their private board, wow, big man.  You can read their guild text, I read it, I hardly saw any discontent in it.  I temp'd for raids, knew some people in it.  They most likely are taking a strategic seniority (of some sort, not purely) give members who need the gear and play the most so they'll be there with for the next mob every time and can kick it's ass using it's new gear.

I'm just wondering, but do you have access to Afterlife's guild message board, or their guildchat to make a fair comparison, or are you just going off a hunch?<br>
<br>
Wanna know what I think?  I think you are one jealous person =).  it must suck to know guilds like ours can kill things you can't even imagine, to get items you can only drool about on EQ'Lizer, and to play with people who actually make this game fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
let me share with you how you get a raid to get something done.  its not whining and bitching in guildchat for things, its called get the information about the raid you wanna do, what classes you need, what they need to bring.  Then you go around giving people TELLS asking if they can come, if it be now or in the near future.<br>
<br>
Haha, favoritism...if you only knew =).<br>
<br>
<br>
But I think most of all, is one thing;  I own you in everything.  You are my bitch.  I don't have PERFECT spelling, so you probly got me beat there...maybe, but I own you in everything else.  I go to college, I get good grades, I meet alot of kick ass women, I lift weights and work out, I played college sports, I got a job that pays me 25 dollars an hour for the largest power company in the seattle area and I'm a junior in college, and I OWN YOU IN A COMPUTER GAME ON TOP OF THAT!  <br>
<br>
it sure does suck to be you eh?  Wasting your time looking into my guild's private stuff, man, what a life.

They are called endurance lifters, not all weight lifters go max out and leave, that is called power lifting.  Endurance lifting is for the people who want more tone, not pure muscle mass, getting up cardio vasculor muscles, (ie the heart).  More flexibility is induced with that kinda lifting, also.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqalarrubican.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qalar Rubican</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/3/01 8:36:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flame is like this long, come on read!</span><hr size=1> Gee, that wouldn't have anything to do with baseball would it synide, *giggle*.<br>

Dalarian, please just stop talking.  Please, close it before you choke on your foot.  You are sooo jealous of Cats in Hats.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Man, I wish I could play with those guys, they can kill near anything in the game.  but look at me, I am worthless x_x&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats what ya are, worthless.  You will never be able to join CiH, not because you're our bitch, but because you just plain suck...at everything.  So, you have to 'try' to put us down to make yourself feel better.  Sure does suck to be you =(<br>

<br>
A very good 60 signs up for your guild.. good attitude, everything.  He/She wants to be a part of something bigger.  You see a need for his/her skills, you just going to say 'No thanks'?<br>
<br>
In most cases, I doubt it.  Well played characters are hard to find, and they are what set the good guilds from the not so good guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=81&stop=92>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=195.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=195.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=195.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=195.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=195.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
