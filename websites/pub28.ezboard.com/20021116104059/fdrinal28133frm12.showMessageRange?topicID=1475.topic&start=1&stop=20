<br>
UF - neutral guild, friendly - just barely big enough to get onto this list, I'd give this guild a personal 5/10 score. They aim a bit low, but their friendlyness pulls up a bit.<br>
<br>
UC - neutral guild, very friendly. They aim a higher than UF tho and they seem to want to move on with higher goals.Good leader there too imho, Seke was never hard to talk to and he would always approach you with best intentions. 7/10, attitude and goals pulls up, not being able to enter ntov, ST and such - pulls down. <br>
<br>
WL - Aims high, but don't seem to rather wanna do things with others, and by doign that see higher end of the game - than go there by themselves. If you look on it from a certain point of view, they are in many ways like vice, they also came from nowhere and was a sudden challenge to most other high-end guilds, which caused them to be flamed a lot. 6/10, the fact that I've not seen them do anything on their own since I left them - pulls down.<br>
<br>
CT - Aims high, but don't seem to rather wanna do things with others, and by doign that see higher end of the game - than go there by themselves. I have, however, seen them do stuff on their own - and they do seem to manage just fine. I've approached their leaders now and then, and they seem to be mature - if you can get proper contact with them. Good flamers and I've noticed many times that they think they deserve a lot. All in all, it's ...shady but ok leadership. It seem to work. 7/10, They are like WL, xcept better. Better leader pulls up.<br>
<br>
FEMAXIB - Aims high, does really well.  All asian guild(s) tho, but still. They work well and they really seem to make a difference. Good skills, good leaders. 9/10, not having had the chance to talk much to them due to language problems, pulls down.<br>
<br>
Vice - Aims high, still to new. It's very much in motion, and have grown fast to a competing guild. It's birth was very much like WL's, but Vice aimed far higher. And they reached their goals - and then some, just like WL did. Leadership been changing a lot lately, but they seem to actually hold a steady course even tho many people seem to dislike vice for people that is no longer in vice. I'd give them 8/10, change of leaders pulls down, as does the flaming against em. Their will to keep working pulls up, as does their loot system.<br>
<br>
CiH - Aims very high. But you only really like CiH - if you are a member, because their twofacedness has seen no equal. But they are the only one to kill Emperor so far, and noone else has entered VT. They use a quite good loot system that keeps things even for all, and both rangers and clerics seem to get epics real fast. Putting a number on what grade to give these toons is hard. Their &quot;rules&quot; that they expect the entire server to follow pulls down a lot. Same does that they are against all form of ninjalooting and KSing....as long as they don't profit from it. You never know what rules they have this day and the next. I think I'd total it on appx....7/10. Pulls up that they get to VT and their system of drops, pulls down a lot that they act like a bunch of 13 year old kids that don't wanna share their candy. Pulls down more that they tend to lie to be able to flame and blame others.<br>
<br>
GoTK - kinda like UC, they are really oldschool. I've had many good moments shared with these people. They are capable of a LOT, often they surprize me with what they are capable of. They can aim higher if they want to, their call really. Their next step will be big, when I lead vice, I hoped to help them up that step, like I wanted to help UC up their next step. 7/10 on these puppies as well.<br>
<br>
Darkmoons - Euroguild first of all, seems ok stable, their leaders are out of this world generous with their players. Skilled people, even tho they are few, they do seem to make the most of it.They don't aim too high tho, but they might be just preparing for higher end mobs. Euro people should join here, if it wasn't for Vice, I'd be Darkmoon. 7/10, good goals, but they work hard to get higher. Pulls up that they are euro guild, and their wicked pulling skills. <br>
<br>
That's how I see things, noone can change that. And for Vice's bad reputation, which was given to vice by people who ain't vice anymore - I hope it disappears with me. Let vice have a chance, they are good people and they do deserve better than the treatement they have gotten. Joining a wave is just too easy, being fair is harder.<br>
<br>
I've played Kutchek, Kutch, Lenwe and Svarte during my times. I've met many people, I've seen many things. I have never KSed, I have never ninjalooted ( except when kutch took svarte's nodrop sword GAH - and almost again when he won yelinaks head ), I think I have helped WELL over 100 people with their epics, I have ressed far over 1000 people in my times. I've been a part of killing most mobs in the game and I've done exploring into things few had done before.  <br>
I have more importantly seen people give it all for the ones they belive in, as well those who don't wanna risk anything. It's just a game people keep telling me, and sure it is. A game that have been able to actually destroy families, and belive me, I'm not letting it destroy mine. Evil someone say ?  Nah. It's like drugs, actually. It gives you what you want, some is in control of it - others ain't. <br>
<br>
Guilds is the biggest drug, you get close friends, you see new sides of people you thought you knew from some bad episode/flame/whatever. Heck, I bet you that over 90% of the people you dislike, could easily be your best friend if you shared guild. Anyone remember the WALL of flames and hate between me and Kilamyan ? Whenever we met ingame/irc we'd sit back and laugh, sharing info and generally having a good time. Now I see many people getting things wrong. <br>
my motto:<br>
99 % of all KS'es and bad things that happens, are misunderstandings.... the remaining 1% is CiH.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm gonna boardlurk a bit tho, but I'm not gonna log back into the game for....I dunno... ever I think.  If someone wants my chars atleast, who knows. I'm gonna dedicate all my daily time to my job and my wife. They are all in my life atm. Sintil and Tekai are the new leaders of Vice, be nice to them, they do mistakes like any other human - but they are like born for the task they are facing.<br>

You have been one exceptional friend in EQ, a great player, a very good leader, a good dorf, a mediodecre ogre (too good mood) and a lousy darkelf (illu only).<br>
<br>
I wish u all the best in RL cause u deserve the best<br>

<br>
On Tribunal, back, Pre-Kunark, we had two guilds.  Elitists and the Vagrants.  They both fought over high end shit, they were the only ones to do Vox/Naggy, and they would camp the planes.  You would need to ask permission to do anything high end, of them.<br>
<br>
Now, they've combined, and another guild has come up near EV.  The Companions.  They used to hold NToV, and would pretty much keep it down, so no one else could use it.  If you wanted NToV gear, you ask EV and Comps.<br>
<br>
The point is, when you have uber guilds, that can do stuff like that, and a guild that wants to, the guild that can, will walk all over the guild that wants to.<br>
<br>
People bitch and moan about so and so guild steamrolling them on the Class01 Epic spawn, or nice spawn01.  Knock it off.  90% of the time, the uber guild is doing it to make sure they DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN (Important point).<br>
<br>
Back in the day, E and V were good to me, because when they came through, I would ask them if they needed help, joked around, and if they steamrolled me (Which has happened once), I would get pissed off at the GAME, not at them.<br>
<br>
I took this quote from the Trib Flameboard (Fuck all you anti-cross server people, some of us play on more than one /rude).  I think it explains how I feel about VI and EQ these days.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Comps killed the emperor and whatever else today THOSE BASTARDS!<br>
<br>
Do I hate the comps as a whole or really any member of the companions....not at all, quite the opposite, the comps have great players and people that break their ass day in and out just like ev.<br>
<br>
Want to know who I hate?<br>
<br>
The worthless mother fuckers at VI who think its so important to limit the number of certain virtual items in &quot;their world&quot; that my &quot;team&quot; of friends wont be able to have a good time tonight killing the emperor. Is this the comps fault? fuck no, they got the people they went and kicked ass, good for them. <br>
<br>
But should the fact that OMG a few more pair of envenomed slippers (or whatever they are called) drop keep them from having emperor on a 3 hour timer so my &quot;team&quot; could also have fun killing that bitch? I say fuck no.<br>
<br>
In their infinite wisdom to control a few stupid items from being in the game they instead bring pettiness, jealousy, greed and hate towards other people into the game. I played this game to join a &quot;team&quot; and kill the npcs. Hell Im not against competition..id love a race against the companions to see how few people it takes (or how little time) to kill X mob.<br>
Id put the pantless ntov ev archery team against the comps team anyday.<br>
<br>
So grats comps on killing the emp, and fuck you VI for trying to bring out the worst in people because you dont want another pair of fucking slippers floating around in &quot;your world&quot;<br>
<br>
/cheers comps<br>
/rude VI/sony/(the rest of team stupid)<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thanks Cartug for the quote, and gratz on Emp kill Comps.<br>
<br>
Again, good luck out in the world Kutch and Fullav.  Try not to come back, that shows you're a true addict <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>
