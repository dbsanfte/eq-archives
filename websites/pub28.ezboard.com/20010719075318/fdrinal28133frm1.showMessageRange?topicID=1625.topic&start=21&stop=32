<br>
First of all, I think Verant screwed themselves in the sets upon sets of rules they implemented.  They should have kept things simple, it would have saved them a hell of a lot of headache.  <br>
<br>
The play nice policy and the naming policy, for example, are just silly.  Why not keep it simple: no offensive names, no blatant harassment.  Sure still open for interpretation, but MUCH less vague.  Who cares if someone is named something copyrighted or stupid?? Its a game!  The /report feature takes care of harassment.  Sorry, nothing we can do about KSers.  If the person follows you from camp to camp stealing your kills (blatant harassment), report them and we'll come watch.  Sorry, no xp res' under any circumstances, only corpse retrieval or getting you unstuck.  Sorry no item replacement unless due to a widespread bug (one that makes the patch message).  Sucks, but simple, dont like it? Dont play.  <br>
<br>
In trying to make all these policies and rules, they open the floodgates to pissed off people who feel they've been wronged by their system.  Or, more frequently, pissed off people who never even get a reply to their /petition, or wait hours only to be denied.<br>
<br>
I agree with Aubree, most people who go into dealing with GMs/guides (that have angry stories) have their dukes up from the get go.  When they relay their tale, they are always the innocent, wronged.  Not to say you and your friends werent, or that some of these people werent, only that I'm sure the GMs/guides get sick of taking shit, and end up screwing people with real problems, by dismissing them as yet another hothead thats just out to yell about their 10$/mo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umellan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mellan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#993300>(5/30/01 1:01:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do the crime, pay the time</span><hr size=1> awwww /blushes im cute.<br>

Supporting verant for keeping him at work is something I do not choose to do.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, he's an idiot.  He really doesn't think he's here to help us, the players.  He doesn't think, that any of us matter.  He doesn't believe that we, the players, pay his salary.  His quote to me was, &quot;Your 10$ is hardly my salary.&quot;  Well, my 30(3 accounts) may not, but if enough people don't like you and leave, maybe it will make a difference one day.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udachandecatsnhats.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dachande Cats N Hats</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#993300>(5/30/01 8:10:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do the crime, pay the time</span><hr size=1> ALL I GOTTA SAY ON THE VALINDOR MATTER IS.<br>

I could go on and on why but will try to make it short and sweet.<br>
<br>
1. Removed surname from &quot;Bustinn Amove.&quot; OMG this is very offensive, please if your kids are playing make sure they dont see this name.<br>
<br>
2. He replaces a scalbard for someone when it is known to have a main inventory slot open but wont replace lost items on a KNOWN bug in Rathe Mountains that he admitted to knowing about.<br>
<br>
3. During a guild event in WFP, we had a not so friendly person train guards on us while trying to kill Lucan. We logged it, screenshot it, petitioned it, had witnesses that saw him say he did it yet Valindor told him to &quot;be nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
My 1st example may be weak but by the sounds of it, he could be doing alot more useful things for people that have been waiting 4 hours because they are stuck somewhere than running around removing surnames. By reading all I have so far it is very clear he is a hypocrit and is not cut out for the job. As someone said earlier, he would rather run off or threaten someone rather than try to work things out. Yea some of you have been treated well by him but alot of us have been screwed. I was on the MM server before I came to Drinal and those GM's were great! They took the time to help, they were understanding and knew the meaning of customer service. Why do you think Drinal is called &quot;Urinal&quot; and &quot;The little yellow bus.?&quot; Come on people, wake up and see who Valindor really is...are we just making this stuff up because we are bored? Sorry I and alot of others have better things to do. I will use the e-mails provided above to help see that this lower than life scumbag is replaced.<br>

With the exception of one time when a GM let me loot my corpse at Chardok zoneout, I have had responses and actions that have left me on the verge of bitter. I just don't bother anymore. I didn't have a main inv slot on my epic open and I lost an item. I just went back and redid that portion of my quest rather than petition. I usually get some junior guide asking me to repetition Valindor when he returns to work in a couple days anyway. Why bother?<br>
<br>
The really bad exp I had was concerning a Wurmslayer trade I did a few months ago in NFP. The guy I sold the Wurmslayer to did not have main slot open and he dropped the sword. I didn't know this and neither did he until like 10 minutes later and by then I was in Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the guy I traded with asks me if I picked it up and I told him no. He harasses me a bit and I keep telling him that I don't have his wurmslayer. Valindor gives me a tell telling me to give the sword back to the guy. I am confused and I tell Valindor I DO NOT HAVE THIS GUY'S WURMSLAYER!!<br>
<br>
He tells me hes knows for a fact that I have it and demands I give it back to him. POOF I am summoned to some sewer shaft in Queynos trapped. And he demands I give the wurmslayer back to the guy. He says he has a log entry of me picking up a wurmslayer. I in fact did pick up a wurmslayer that I accidentally dropped a few days ago. I tell him to check the date of the log where I picked up a wurmslayer. He discovers his error and tells me &quot;Well when I asked you if you picked up the wurmslayer why didn't you tell me you did?&quot; WTF?<br>
<br>
Long story short, he finds the guy who did actually jack the guys wurmslayer and all is well. Only thing is, I have been bullied and called a liar and basically humiliated. The biggest thing was his attitude towards me. Very assuming, arrogant, just annoying overall. A couple weeks later I accidentally sold my Swarmcaller to an NPC vendor and I petitioned. Valindor says &quot;Sorry, can't help you&quot;. That was my last petition ever. Someone else petitioned the Chardok thing. Hint: if we all stop petitioning, they will all get laid off and have to finish high school...<br>

Anyhow thanks everyone for the support and your letters you've sent to Verant, at the present one week later they have refused to comment on my case. Actually, I've yet to even get a single reply back, their own GMS on other servers refused to comment on the incident and about others I asked them about that you all posted here. What is this musical chairs with verant on getting an issue resolved. Anyhow thanks again for the support folks, it's appreciated and I just ask you copy and paste these stories onto a form and send it into Verant as the one gent placed the proper addresses. Remember, it's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil. If you raise enough noise VI won't have any choice other then to act upon the issue brought forth to them by all of us, that or they just ignore you the player again, two words for them if they do. I quit. Anarchy is looking mighty interesting.<br>
G'day to all and if you do need some in game help, well, gooood luck.  ;-)<br>
