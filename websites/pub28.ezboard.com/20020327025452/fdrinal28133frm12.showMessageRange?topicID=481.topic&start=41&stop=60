<br>
I was at my Christmas party for my company, Dec 2000, and as it turns out the boyfriend of one of my co-workers was in CiH.  I said 'oh, you moved to Drinal eh?  I play on Tunare'.  Next words out of his mouth... 'Really?  You know this guy named Thogg?'<br>

IMO the only reason Greycloud won was due to equip... equal level and gear and you would have owned him.  Not an ass kiss, but a simple observation from someone who was there =)<br>
<br>
(btw, I thought Xave was still server GM at that time...)<br>
<br>
On that same note, I think Thogg really would have given you a run, if not beaten you outright.  I saw him duel several times and was as equally impressive as you were.  Thogg really knew his shit involving EQ... he just didn't come across with any tact nor did he know how to rally people well.  Had you put the same knowledge through a translator and good speaker, you would have had ONE HELL of a warrior.<br>
<br>
Of course, it all comes down to ifs and maybes, so whatever, doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
My favorite sight of all time however was the name Jorply Ownedthogg or whatever it was before the gm took it, LOL. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/Everquestakirotag/JAROUTTAG.html"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#FF0000>Drinal Ally</font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 559<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 11:46:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: you have to be kidding me</span><hr size=1> Jorp if you were so good.. why didn't you beat greycloud?(I do understand your good now) He absolutely sucked at pvp, that's why he got SMASHED in BoTB on test, he'll admit he sucked at PVP too, he had undoubtedly the best gear at BoTB and just got annhilated.  <br>
<br>
Thogg wasn't even close to the best gear, what was it full indo. and wurm slayer? heh he did a helluva job.<br>
<br>
I liked thogg, I dunno, he was a complete moron.. but I have a friend that reminds me of thogg.. so I can't help but love thogg.  Thogg knew the fucking game as good as anyone else.. and he was about helping people, and also helping himself.  He wasn't good at covering his alterior motives very well but whatever.   EQ was about loot.. he wanted it, can't blame him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>

I liked raiding with thogg though, it was cool.. shaere was fun cuz we always hated each other =b. But sometimes we just lived with it. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

botb <br>
<br>
I used a botbe and a borrowed fungi tunic..<br>
<br>
armor?<br>
I had a cobalt boots gloves and a loaned set of arms..<br>
<br>
I did not even wear them in most my fights as the fools in the botb who were concerend about ac had no idea HP RULES.<br>
<br>
ask anyone now and they wont be caught dead without there hit point gear..<br>
<br>
back then people ridiculed me for saying it now everyones doing it. <br>
<br>
I lost by 30 hp to a guy who SLOWED ME TWICE with a togors hammer and who had hisdiscipline and did 800 hp damage to me with it..<br>
<br>
if it had beena best of 3 i am sure i would have raped him as he would have not had his disciplines up..<br>
<br>
on tunare .. i beat every oponent i had without loseing more then half my life..<br>
<br>
jorply .. I do not care if you had to fight every other war on your server. THE war who WON YOUR SERVER got raped in the finals. <br>
<br>
and i raped the guy who raped him. <br>
and he had the same gear he won your server with  <br>
<br>
If there was one thing i knew it was PVP and im dam good at it..<br>
<br>
in the end of the finals there was SUPRISE me and 3 other trolls from the PVP servers..<br>
<br>
 jorple has beaten me in ONE duel out of what 30 ? he put on a fungi tunic and would RUN like hell every time i beat him to almost dead regen then atack again. <br>
<br>
in all honestly kandownz was probly the best dueler i ran into on drinal.. he would listen and ask me how do you beat me so badly I would tell him what he was doing wrong and next week he would do much better. <br>
<br>
I am no statesmen nor am i a socialite.. if i neeeded something i organized a raid to get it tried to set it up so i would get it.. But i also was the first to help anyone else get what they needed or to give away anything i had that they needed.. <br>
<br>
I must say one thing..<br>
<br>
in the end.. you cant go to a single server and not find a Thogg playing on it.. <br>
<br>
I had my impact.. is my head swollen ? nope i was just a player who was good at pvp and believed in fair play .. <br>
<br>
whats your legacy jorply?<br>

I also think the wurmslayer is under-rated. Yes it is heavy,   but the damage to delay is very nice (25 to 40 i think). thats about a 10 to 16 weapon, except for the fact that its very heavy. It doesn't compare to primal weapons, but in my opinion, it is very underpriced<br>
