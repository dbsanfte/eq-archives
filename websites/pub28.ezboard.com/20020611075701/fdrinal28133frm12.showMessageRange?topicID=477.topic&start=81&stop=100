And I'm sure with the outspokenness of CiH members if they were upset with me they would let me know it.  And I'm even more sure that I'd hear it from Kilamyan first :-).<br>
<br>
During the alliance all decisions were made with agreement of the officers of both guilds.   <br>
<br>
At the end of the alliance and after it, Gell had some personal issues that I understood but found frustrating with his commitments as an officer.  He stepped down as leader of CT but is still an officer, which to me means having responsibility for the functioning of a guild.<br>
<br>
I spoke with Gell before I posted about Sleeper's Tomb.<br>
<br>
I always considering bringing up officer loot decisions in public forums as rather bad form.... /sigh but since you also left out certain points in an attempt at something.<br>
<br>
-First off, yes Grats Solarflare you deserved them.  Don't ever think otherwise.  <br>
-Solarflare had just finished his trial membership.<br>
-Solarffare didn't have faction with Tormax<br>
-There were at least 15 other CT/CiH members with a significantly longer membership and had faction with Tormax that were also in the lotto.<br>
-You also left out that after the lotto you told me you felt you guys made a mistake in your decision, based on the above reasons.<br>
-You also left out that I told you I didn't care who won as long as they have faction<br>
-Yelinak can be killed weekly and the head drops every time so it really doesn't make too much difference who wins since everybody will get guants eventually.  It makes sense however to not have rotting heads in peoples banks for extended periods of faction hunting.  Since Solarflare had just joined, as a new member he was maximum KoS to Tormax or very close to it while other CiH members at MAX ally and been present at raids since the first time ever that Yelinak was killed on Drinal and entering for guants the first time.<br>
-As I see it, a very good CiH guildmember got a great upgrade and a hefty motivation to get his Keal faction up.  Therefore I'm a winner and everybody in CiH is a winner.  <br>
<br>
People who call people loot whores in an officer decision system need to have their head examined.  How can you by a loot whore with a commitee deciding who wins?   /boggle   You can argue faults and flaws all day long of a decision based system but one thing that is never argued is that the person who wins does so because they are a loot whore.   This goes for anybody calling Gell names over loot as much as anybody else.  We've been through that so many times.  People sending obnoxious tells to the winner of loot are out of their mind.  The winner had no part in deciding whether or not they were going to win.  The officers deciding the winner do!   Got a problem with who wins?  Take it up with the officers who made the decision, not the happy winner of an item.<br>
<br>
Yah  one day during the alliance we were all working on the idea of a guild charter.  We tossed ideas around and argued pros and cons.   Ummm..    so?    ok...   What of it?    There where some good ideas and some things that didn't work out.  Obviously after SoL was released the alliance no longer made sense.   Sounds like you are trying to flame me for ideas that everybody was working on.<br>

As soon as we get those 2 robes all we are going to &quot;really&quot; care about is Nwing and/or waking the sleeper.<br>
<br>
If you guys can agree to stay out of Nwing, even though we  have the ability to beat you to Nwing every time* see below* then I'm sure we can agree to not worry about ST. <br>
<br>
I am not an officer, but I do care very much for CiH as a guild. If we are not getting the better benefit of the agreement I can guaruntee you that our officers will not accept anything. <br>
<br>
**This is not only because I feel the core members of CiH will log on extremely early if need be (25ish people) just so we can get it, but also because the majority of CiH is on Eastern Time. This means we have a full raid force almost 2 hours before you guys do. This is not a threat, just a simple fact that alot of our members are talking about. They're saying &quot;why does it matter if we wake the sleeper, we can get to Nwing before them&quot;.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukildem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kildem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/16/02 11:52:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sleepers Tomb -- To Cats</span><hr size=1> is it going to kill you to wait 4 weeks to accumulate those 2 robes you need, or do you absolutely need them in the next 2 weeks.<br>

we need primals, we need them faster then ever since we understand theres a very good chance you guys will be waking the sleeper in the very near future, therefore not allowing us to kill the first warder along with the other 2 hurts pretty badly<br>

<br>
And for all you morons who thinks Gell wins anything he wants, he was in on Palladius Axe of Slaughter last weekend, he did not win. He was in on that shield from Cekenar or Sevalak (I forgot which) during the alliance, and he did not win that either. He is usually not even in on most things. But if you're dumb enough to believe he has a Brother Xave's Headband, you probably won't believe any of this. <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>

<br>
As for this thread, there are some good things coming out of it in the way of guild talks, so rather than bitching or trying to tangent the conversation, I'd much rather see point of views on different situational wants and needs instead of &quot;I'm never going to see primal&quot; or &quot;so and so did this and you say this so we're going to turn this around and say this and that&quot;. Anyone up for some cool info? it only took me about 40 ST raids to get my spear, boo hoo, I never complained about that on a daily basis. My priceless was just quite fine up till I got my primal, then subsaquently got my mryoklar's.<br>
<br>
As for what you said about me Barg I appreciate it, but send me an email to learn a bit more of my thoughts on the pauldrons situation, other than that lets leave that one alone also for awhile.<br>
<br>
(kaiser-1@attbi.com)<br>
<br>
Imo, best to focus on the what and now rather than the what if's. Assuming only leads to massive loads of trouble, just like when people assumed we would free the sleeper. Hell let me say from my own personal standpoint, if I had the chance I would have. I'm gungho to complete my goals and releasing the sleeper is one of them. Then again this thread when reading the real insightful comments does happen to raise the question about giving to the others in the game. While it does interest me a bit - we all are very selfish - I'd like to point out that at this time as far as I can tell we have no plans on releasing the Sleeper. Of course I'm not 1000000% sure, but unless a third party comes in and slays the remaining warder, there shouldn't be exactly a problem. So right now I'd rather focus on if we are going to do a rotation, or at least a *wink wink* decision of rules, thoughts would be welcomed :P <p><br><img src=http://www.catsinhats.net/dragoonr/dragoonrsigt.jpg

You'll all be spared the drama, but I wanna point out something that nobody seemed to notice.<br>
<br>
CT kills Warder #2 and Warder #3.<br>
CiH kills Warder #4.<br>
<br>
Using the magic of addition and a mastery of knowing if the number two is bigger than the number one, we can come to the conclusion that this scenario results in CT getting 2 warders and CiH getting one. Here's a chart.<br>
<br>
|----0----1----2----3----|<br>
<br>
Numbers to the right are greater than those to the left. As you can see, two is more than one. Stop pretending you're getting short changed. Your suggestion of "fair" is CT getting all 3, and CiH getting NOTHING, unless we want to be branded as huge assholes by killing our one warder and waking the sleeper. Rock and a hard place, as usual. <br>

<br>
so mebbe cih should decide if and when they're waking the sleeper, cause evidently it will happen, and let us know so we can figure out a plan that fits both guilds <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39628>Kildem Ferme</a> <br>

<br>
I'm as impartial as you can get on this since I have friends in both CT and CiH, and was never in either guild.  <br>
<br>
It seems to me that a viable and fair solution to this problem has already been put forward.  That solution being:<br>
<br>
CiH kills 4th warder each and every time he is up (not a big deal since unless things have changed, they are the only ones who can kill him)<br>
<br>
CT kills two of the other three warders (I would think killing numbers 2 and 3 would make more sense, and then once you have farmed primal 1H'ers for a while, you go back and kill 1, and, either 2 or 3, so that your casters get the mask drops)<br>
<br>
This seems completely fair to me as an outside observer.<br>
<br>
Now, someone stated that they recieved a tell stating that once 2 more robes dropped then CiH was going to wake the sleeper.  Well, I don't know if this statement is true or not, but to be honest here nothing anyone can do to stop them if they want to.  I personally think it would be a pretty shitty thing to do since everyone knows that there are people still farming the first three warders, and some of those people are friends of the only guild capable of waking the sleeper.  If no one was farming the first three warders, then I would say &quot;wake the bastard up and take that ss&quot;.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, CiH has a chance to really score some goodwill with the server if they don't awaken the sleeper (not sure if that matters in the least), or they can waken the sleeper and say, &quot;the hell with the server, we could do it so we did&quot;.  CT on the other hand needs to be more flexible and not kill all of the first three warders, anthing else and you guys are guaranteeing that the sleeper is awakened.  And, the way my math is working you still get two warders to their one.<br>
<br>
And if the reasonableness of this just doesn't strike home with some of you who seem hell bent on flaming one another, look at it this way ..... Whoever flinches first and causes the sleeper to be awakened; well, the other group gets to flame 'em from the high ground.<br>
<br>
Either way, its a win win situation =)<br>
