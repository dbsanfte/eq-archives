Grats Dyscord on your new BP, i know you worked hard for your BP, all those gates back and forth to karnors evac EJ.<br>
<br>
Of course people outsite the guild cant understand our rules, even most of them would love to be in a guild with a poitn system from what i heared.<br>
<br>
However you deserved the BP, not only with the highest kkp standing.<br>

<br>
On paper the point system seems to be the best and fairest way to distrubite loot,<br>
but does it work in game? Dunno, never been part of point system raid before, but<br>
if it works for your guild, then by all means use it.<br>
<br>
On Tunare, seniority = point system. But usually seniority was obtained by your level <br>
and how buddy buddy you were with the raid leaders. Which is the primary reason <br>
the majority of us left, becuase it sucked.<br>
<br>
Level 54 druid got loot of Trak!! - YOU GO GIRL!!!  I remember one quote from Tunare <br>
boards where it was stated that &quot;No person under level 55, preferablly 57, will get any <br>
loot of trak...&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufeline123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feline123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/25/00 8:37:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The exact reason i wont use a points system .</span><hr size=1> Maybe you guys think thogg is just simply voice his opinion(s).

Thogg you knew damn well we would come here and stick up for &quot;Your Example you used&quot; when you posted it. The question is not that.

<br>
Your involvement on this message board to this date has consisted almost entirely of flames and trolls - if you can't stand the heat, get out of the lava.<br>
<br>
To Thogg's apologists - yeah, his opinion blah blah blah - whatever - he stated an opinion that got others worked up? others posted opinions back - seems fair to me.<br>
<br>
CiH? I don't have anything to do with them even though I am from MM - they do things their way - good luck to them - it doesn't matter one iota to me, my guild or my gaming style.<br>
<br>
If Thogg was posting this because a certain guild of Tunarian descent is considering a points system, then maybe he should have posted his opinion on a private guild board instead of posting publicly. Regardless of what he posted and how he worded things, he ruffled feathers publicly, and those who were involved in the actual event Thogg mentioned are ENTIRELY justified in being offended and responding in kind.<br>
<br>
Seriously Thogg and friends - you need to pull your collective heads out of your asses and understand the nature of a public message board.<br>

<br>
Granted, the system doesn't work for everyone.  Some of us had time differences which made attendance at point raids difficult at best.  But where the system was highly detrimental to someone with my work schedule, it works flawlessly for ten other people.  As Verant has stated repeatedly, you can't take everyone into consideration in a MMORPG.  You have to do what's best for the majority.  I dare say more of them leave a raid satisfied than in a raid where only the highest levels get anything.  Leave them be.<br>

sorry i will never see a secondary get items bassed on what that person has done with there primary at any raid i run its not even fair to the other people there.<br>

Now if the secondary has earned the point put in the time fine i can understand that but this was just rediculous.<br>

seriously, you can opinion the hell outta the point system.  i don't care 2 cents what you think of it, and i doubt anyone else in the guild does.  but when you start talking shit about one of the nicest people on the server, you're going to piss people off.<br>
<br>
Insinuating Dyscord didn't deserve her bp is pretty damn low.  It wouldn't have taken much effort at all to ask around and find out her dr00d has been her main since way before Drinal was even a twinkle in VI's eye.  And no bullshit about not mentioning names, please.  If you didn't want to piss people off who knew her, you wouldn't have posted here.<br>

<br>
Did I mention THogg used to claim seniority for whatever character he was on, whether it was the other characters he played because he sold THogg, or his shaman? <br>
<br>
Did I mention he played both at a Vox raid (playing two characters at Vox is very effective of course) and went in for caster loot when it dropped?  Oh yeah, I did.<br>
<br>
I so rarely flame anyone, but I can't stand it when people are hypocrites. <p>Alendora Ehren, 56 cleric

<br>
     OK here goes. I have heard it discused about how Thogg likes the seniority system cause he has the most time spent playing for any warrior and he would get the Cobalt BP first. and if DS went with a kkp system Thogg would not get it Automaticly. that is what alot of people are saying about thogg ( no not just in CiH I have heard it with none CiH i have groped with that are from Tunare) so when thogg posts about kkp. the first thing people say is "Thogg dont want kkp cause it will threaten him getting the best loot first" <br>
    So thogg could be honestly just posting an opinion and does not mean to flame in any way. but due to previous posts etc etc. 90% of the people that dont know him are going to think that he is either flaming or being sarcastic<br>
<br>
well im going to go play. oh rememer this is just somthing that i picked up in game. and are not my personal fealings towards the situation.<br>

When I heard you guys use *kitty kat points* to distribute loot I laughed my ass off right through the movelogging. <br>
THogg didn't flame anyone, but you guys took it that way.<br>
So you all jumped his shit. Take a deep breath, let others give their opinions. Peace. )<br>
