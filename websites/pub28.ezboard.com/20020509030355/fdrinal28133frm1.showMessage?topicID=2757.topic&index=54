In a pure exp grind group with that many Melee, mobs will last approx 45 seconds (If that!).  20 x 45 seconds = 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
One quad takes at least one minute to round up, and another 5 minutes to actually snare and do the damage if there are no adds to deal with.  Then after the quad, Wizards need at least 10 minutes (with a KEI) to med back to full.  That = at least 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
You were saying that Quadding is TONS better than a regular exp group? Riiiiiight...<br>
<br>
Okay, now you want to backtrack. Now instead of quadding you want to say: &quot;AE groups are better EXP than all!&quot;<br>
Well, no argument here.   But there are currently what. 5 zones where it's possible to AE for exp in all of EQ?!?  Right. when was the last time you've seen 3 AE groups in Old Sebilis?  You didn't, Seb can't support 3 AE groups. And there have been cases where AE groups have been petitioned out because they were there in the zone and no one wanted them to be.  AE groups are rare.  Plus in an AE group you typically have a Cleric, 3 Chanters and 2 Wizzies or a Cleric a puller, 2 chanters and 2 wizzies.  (or maybe another AEing class in stead of a wizard. a Mage or even *GASP!* a druid yes I've seen it done.)  Know what the exp is like in a single camp in Seb with an AE group? A yellow of AAexp an hour.<br>
<br>
Waaaiiit. You're thinking &quot;That can't be right? I've gotten near a yellow of AAexp an hour in a regular group!&quot;  Well Duh. AE groups in Seb would kill faster, but a lot of the time are sitting around FM with no mobs to pull.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that's Seb. there are other places that are better exp and have more mobs to pull for AE&quot; (that's what you were thinking right?)  Well, First off, someone has to go out of their way to START one of these AE groups.  Reputation counts a lot in AE.  An AE group in say, The Deep would not just /who wiz all 56 60 /who cleric all 56 60 /who enc all 58 60 and just pick random names out of a hat.  If you don't AE, and people don't know how well you AE, chances are you aren't picked.  Say someone does pick an AE newbie for a more difficult AE zone.  What happens? one or two wipeouts. And that's negative exp gain.<br>
<br>
AE grouping is not just 'done'.  Please people, do some research get your facts straight before arguing about something you're jealous of. If you think a Wizard is overpowerful, start one up, and play to 60.  NO!  Don't Powerlevel yourself. Look for groups. Try to solo at lower levels.  Earn your wizard levels like the rest of us.  Just to stop those of you from saying &quot;I got level 60 in a month, and I've never had a problem!&quot;  Well, chances are your Magic skills (conj, div, abj, alt) are probably lacking, as well as other skills, plus you probably went LOIO,OT,DL,KC and your dungeon skills and aggro management as a wizard are totally out of whack.<br>
<br>
Playing a wizard is a lot more than /assist, /stand, /cast 1, /sit.  And thinking that getting one to 60 (Let alone the minimum 23 AAexp) to get Manaburn and then not feel you've earned the right to let loose a huge blast is just silly.<br>
<br>
Manaburn is a 1.5-2.5 Mana to damage ratio.  Approxamately 6000 to 10k damage.  Almost all fall in the 7-8k range.  Sunstrike our big KUNARK level 60 spell is 1618 for 450 mana.  That's a ratio of 3.58 to one.  Ice Spear of Solist is 1200 for 300 mana a 4:1 damage to mana ratio.<br>
<br>
6 Wizards cast Sunstrike on Gore? That's 9698 damage. Now one wizard run in circles like a madman Flux spamming and getting summoned twice while the other 5 wizards cast Sunstrike again.  8090 or 17788 damage.  Aggro switches to another wizard who runs in cirlces getting summoned twice while the other 5 wizards Sunstrike for another 8090 or total 25878. Aggro switches again, and repeat.  Each wizard will get aggro only once or so, and 2 minutes later, dead Gore with 6 wizards.  And this has only used about 2 bars of mana, whereas manaburn will have wiped out everyone's mana, and a drolvarg will wander by and kill half the group before someone gets enough mana to root it.<br>
<br>
No Kunark Dragons were ALREADY trivial if by trivial you mean it can be done with a single group of wizards.  If you were a 60 wizard and some other 60 wizard sent you a tell from another guild asking if you wanted to 6man Gore, you never met this person and you were of doing your own thing, would you join?<br>
<br>
So, in this post I've stated that Wizards Don't get exp easier or faster than it would take another class to, and given the reasons.  And when a wizard complains about never finding a group, it's because they can't find a group!  And don't say they can just go off and exp somewhere else, we can quad, but you know what? Reputation plays a huge part in EQ. and if a wizard quads all the way to 60 he's f*cked over in the end game.  Plus quadding is as boring as playing /gems.  In fact. I've chosen to play /gems over quadding because it was that much more interesting.<br>
<br>
HEY FELLOW WIZZIES!  Trueshot is so buggy, it can't be said as being too powerful. Please lay off the rangers.  Dire Charm too powerful? Look at the classes that get it. <br>
Necro: *&amp;^# They deserve some freakin' slack! They've had a Nerf bat shaped like a ketchata koro mis shoved up their ___'s for so long, they're nothing but Twitch bitches in the end game, I'm all for them getting an ultra-powerful pet. <br>
Enchanters: I'm sure everyone is agreement that a Chanter getting more exp is a good thing.<br>
Druids: Well, they can already solo better than a lot of classes. Frankly, I'd love to see them solo faster. that way when I'm killing in skyfire, I don't have to wait for a druid to finish off his 20 minute named mob root/dot before the next named spawns which I could take out in 2 minutes. Dire Charm may be a powerful skill for this class, but the effect it will have on the image of druids will be more terrible than it already is now.  if anything, Druids should be against getting Dire Charm for their class for the sake of reputation.<br>
<br>
Manaburn only on 75k+ mobs?  PLEASE!  If anyone is using anything other than a Bane, Elnerick's Electrical Rending, or Sunstrike on a mob with this many HP and doesn't have a fleet of Rods of Mystical Transvergeance waiting for them I'd smack them.  Starting off with manaburn to do the same damage as 4 nukes while they wait for the nuke call, and modding back to a decent amount of mana to continue to deal damage doesn't really affect much in the long run.  It'd take a total of 15 seconds less to kill that mob. oooooh, yay. BIG difference.  Please, Manaburn is totally not as powerful as you think it is.<br>
<br>
And any Wizard MB groups that form to wipe out Trak or VS are doing it for what?  VS drops nothing that a wizard with manaburn would want except maybe to twink.  From what I have seen, these wizards came in, killed the mob outright, and let the people that were there first loot.  if I were a bard, and just as I get to Trak's room for my epic 6 manaburn wizards somehow make it through lower seb and MB trak for me, I'd be happy!  Epic here I come.<br>
<br>
As someone said before. as soon as MB wizards start monopolizing on spawns, then it's time for something to be done. I really don't expect 6wiz kunark dragon kills to become popular and common at all.<br>
<br>
Well, I think i've argued long enough.  Please keep Trueshot out of this, Remember how unfair Dire Charm is to Mages, keep the gloves ON, and please continue. <p><a target="New" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385">Xarinthus Nihilflare, Wizzynuker of the 58th</a> <a target="New" Href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127970">(and 18th)</a> <a target="New" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385">Degree Burns</a><BR><img src=http://astalus.50megs.com/xarsigy.jpg ><BR><a target="New" href="http://www.norrathfellowship.com">Norrath Fellowship</a> Quellious<BR><a target="New" href="http://www.circleoflegends.org">Circle of Legends</a> Bristlebane <BR><BR>"In the beginning there was nothing.

No amount of howling on these boards is gonna change a thing, one way or the other.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, GM's have to handle another /petition almost every time a Kunark Dragon is killed, because an MB group ports in and blasts the dragon while someone else is nearing the ability to attack it by more conventional means, you can bet yer butt that the Dev team WILL hear about it, and a nerf is FAR more likely when we make their jobs more difficult.<br>
<br>
And people ARE gonna /petition. While some of you may find those Kunie Lizards trivial, the loot isn't. Priced a copy of Malo lately? Or a CoF? Neither is the reward of actually killing one of these guys once in a while. Neither are all the Quest pieces. Oh yeah, folks will /petition.<br>
<br>
And why would an MB team do this, if it's so trivial? Why do high-levels farm green MOB's anywhere? 'Cause they can, and 'cause it's easy money. On one Dragon kill, a 6-man team can split as well over 100K plat for a few minutes work (and with ports and MB a few minutes is all it takes). Contrary to popular opinion, there ARE some greedy folks in this game, and almost ALL of us are attracted to an opportunity for an easy XP kill with a large payday attached.<br>
<br>
So here's my guess: If Wizzies DO make MB'ing Kunark Dragons as regular an activity as they COULD, a nerf will likely find it's way into the game. If not, the Dev team will probably never hear about it, and neither will Wizzies once the memories of specific incidents fade.<br>

Aye, there are greedy people in the game, but in my time I've only met 2 maybe 3 greedy high level wizards.  It is in my experience and in the experience of a lot of wizards that the difficulty to get a level 60 wizard and the responsibilities that come with it weeds out the loot-whores and the d00ds after the over a year trek just to get 60.<br>

Heh, I guess you don't know who has killed all of the kunark outdoor dragons the last 3 or 4 spawns eh? Heck, even some of the dragons inside VP from what I understand. How many times of them doing it does it take before it officially becomes monopolizing of these spawns? And I can guarantee you that when they do it, they aren't letting anyone there loot it besides themselves. They are being farmed for high level items, period. On this server a CoF or RBB sells for 60-100k. Green scale sells for 100k or more. Get lucky and get a copy of sunstrike or torpor and you have just got yourself another 100k on this server. When you have 6 people that are all on at the same time that can make 150k or more from a single kill that takes less than 5 minutes to do and takes no risk, you don't think that will become common? If a wizard has manabutn, and sees those mobs up, all they have to do is give a call to the other ones that have manaburn. Those guys dont have to look for a ride since all of them can just gate themselves there. Go stand near your friend the dragon that doesn't attack you because you have good faction. Press manaburn at roughly the same time. Dead dragon, collect yout 150k+. Yeah, if I was able to collect items like that for no risk, I certainly wouldn't do it either. You are right, if i were able to kill for a CoF with no risk every time it was available, I wouldn't do it. nope.  give us a break. 6 wizards without manaburn arent going to kill one of these mobs with no risk. 10 wizards without manaburn wont kill these mobs with no risk. 10 of any class without manaburn wont be able to kill these mobs with no risk. the only class that can kill these mobs with no risk with 5 people is the wizard, and only because of manaburn. anything else you people are talking about doesn't apply. <br>

Sylvann, you really put the 00 in dr00d.<br>
<br>
Go work on your own AA skills and stop calling for nerfs.  Manaburn making an encounter like Gore trivial is meaningless since, for any guild with 5 or 6 manaburning wizards, Gore was already fully trivial 6 months ago with 5 or 6 regular players.  I don't care if it takes the regular players a minute longer, trivial is trivial.<br>
<br>
In short, give a shot at thinking before you open your mouth.<br>

I know for a fact that the &quot;holy trinity&quot; all have plenty of room to complain. If you don't think being considered one of the most important classes for raiding in the end game doesn't come with its own form of hell, then put down the crack pipe and go back to your quad-kiting. I personally see room for improvement for pretty much every class in this game. I also think nerfing manaburn is one of the worst things VI could do...it made the game fun again for a class that traditionally has been a bitch and a pain in the ass to play and level up. I'll stop now before I go off on a rant-I don't want to fill up five pages with text. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F3F4F8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udmitrythewizzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dmitry the Wizzy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#273C82>(4/12/02 12:58:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2757.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webprofessor.org/avatar/liberty.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A CONSPIRACY</span><hr size=1> By the WAY!

With manaburn I can expect about 6 to 8k dmg if I don't crit...for ALL OF MY FREAKING MANA!<br>
<br>
Put that in perspective while killing an uber mob...with a full manabar I can do more than double that.  The only real benefit I have is mobs with half a million HP that I can manaburn right away and med to full cause i'd be waiting for aggro to build up anyways..... OMG 6k free damage on a 500khp mob yippie!<br>
<br>
You fucktards really think a bunch of manaburn wizards need loot from kunark dragons? you fucking kidding me? You do it for kicks, that's it...or maybe to score a spell or two that a buddy might need.  Kunark dragons are killed 99% of the time for spells only anyways, they aren't really uber mobs anymore...far far from it.<br>

Please dr00ds and whomever else get your heads out of your asses before you call nerf.  Kunark bosses are gimped by all classes already, wizards are no different.  What a waste of time this thread is. <p><html>

That is the core issue.&quot;<br>
<br>
OK lets deal with this. The question you have yet to answer is why its any different if its 6 wizards, or 6 of varied group of classes. Where do you draw a line? What if those 5 wizards needed a tank to pull, would that then be ok? What if they needed a chanter to stun the mob for a bit, would that be ok? What if they needed a cleric to keep them healed a bit, would that be ok? Still just six people.<br>
<br>
The problem is you are confusing your argument. You clearly dont have a problem with 6 people of varied classes taking Gore down, if you did then you have not stated so. But you do have a problem with 6 wizards taking gore down. The key question that no one has answered, here is why? What is the big difference?<br>
<br>
Shaman are capable of soloing dragons, why arent you crying for nerf? That is the real question here. Everques has bigger problems then mana-burn, and yet you guys obssess over this one in paticular, and in a matter that is totally out of context. If we even accept that manaburn unbalances the game (something that I dont), we still cant escape the fact that there are several other examples of this outside of wizards. <br>
<br>
You guys want to isolate manaburn and argue about. Unfortuanately, this precludes you from looking at the big picture.<br>
