But last night I was helping out a Naggy raid after the leader refused to reply to tells my GF had sent him to get in. Shes a monk btw.  Anywho, eventually they kill big red, he falls and everyones happy. Yeah oh yeah, then they come to the loot, two cofs drop and some other items. A nice drop for once, finally.   <br>
<br>
Ok so where am I getting at, well this is what I would like to know, since when has it been practice that a bard is permitted to roll and win a cof?  Cof of course being a cloak of flames. That bard was of course the raid leader as well. Now grant it leading isn't easy but never ever on 50+ Naggy raids did I ever see a bard get a cof, even if he led. That to me boggled me and I am curious has this server turned into EQ's most greediest server?  When I questioned this gentlemen he refused to reply, why do I ask this? Because I think that was pure greed and there is no need for a cof on a bard when you had 18 or so other tanks who could of used it. I'm curious, I spoke to some guys I know in CiH about that and they to had laughed and said, to their knowledge it wasn't standard practice, it was a melee only item. Now some may say he was the leader he deserved something, well tell that to the bards I went there with who before when a cof dropped they did not roll because it was melee only. If you want something take a blade or something, thats usually common.<br>
<br>
 Oh well, as I said not a flame but just curious is the server this greedy or is a new policy that I never heard of that people will just take to town and make a mint off of. I guess thats greed again. I just felt bad for the melee there that needed it. That was a true shame it happened, tisk tisk and I don't approve of that. Had I of known that would happen I would of never assisted this gentlemen on this raid. Yes I was to high to fight naggy I was there to heal them for fgs and buff them for naggy.<br>
/shakes his head and shrugs<br>
<br>
Oh well, just curious what else has changed since I've been away on break.<br>

What does the bard care about the other people having faster haste.  Sure, long ago, before uber guilds, when it took the cooperation of high lvls from the whole server to kill something big it was a taboo thing to do.  Now, I don't think anyone cares...<br>

Sure, a rogue/warrior/monk would have more overall output, but its gonna help the bards output also.<br>
<br>
And if it was just a pick up raid, like someone else said, the bard isn't going to care if he &quot;takes away a cof&quot; from someone else who might put it to &quot;better&quot; use.  Chances are he's never going to group with any of the people on the raid again.<br>

Bard Lead Raid <br>
Bard made rules<br>
Bard posted rules<br>
Bard yelled rules prior to raid several times<br>
<br>
Bard state that he would take the red dragon scale for his epic IF it dropped and IF (and only if) it dropped he would then remove himself from all other rolls<br>
<br>
Scale did not drop <br>
Bard did not claim<br>
Therefore Bard rolled<br>
<br>
If you or other members of your guild are upset about prior posted, shouted, yelled, screamed, discussed, explained, loot rules on any raid, Don't go.<br>
<br>
and for those that will flame me I am not a friend of the Raid leader, I am not in his guild, and I have never grouped with him other than on Dragon Raids which he takes alot of time and effort to put together.<br>
