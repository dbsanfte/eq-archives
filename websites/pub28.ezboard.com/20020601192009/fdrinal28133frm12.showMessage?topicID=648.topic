Let's see what the people crying foul really want:<br>
<br>
1) BC flames GotK because GotK worked their asses off to get cleric epics for their guild while BC has none. BC sites this lack of epics in their guild as reason why GotK should have let BC have the spawn. I think this sounds a bit like COMMUNISTIC HIPPY CRAP! That's right boys and girls, the only thing lists do is turn a server into a hotbed of hatred, and split it into factions. Guilds that CAN and want to do things themselves, and Guilds that CAN'T and want to be spoonfed while they bitch about how unfair everything is.<br>
<br>
2) Many pro-list mush-for-brains people say lists are inevitable and drinal will become a list server. Horsecrap. They site rules and other bullshit they come up with and try to enforce on everyone, but ya know what? No one has to listen to your delusions of authority, the only rules ANYONE has to abide by can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/index.jsp">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. <br>
<br>
3) You can't walk in and 'camp' a dragon/ubermob01 with a couple people, you need a force that is ABLE to kill said mob. Crying and bitching about Ksing and sniping is just fooking annoying; we DO NOT care to hear about how guildX came and killed sev with 20 when you had 5 in the zone. Now if those 5 were MB enabled wizards on the other hand, that'd be another story, but gating your xp group somewhere to camp something while the rest of your guild gets its collective thumb out of its collective ass to get there is horsecrap.<br>
<br>

<br>
Gah now trying to remember what the hell I posted... <br>
<br>
Silvius your obviously not a cleric and asked all of CS to come camp RF with you for a week straight. I know for a fact you wouldnt be able to get enough CS to camp that long with you to have the power on hand to do RF. Don't even try and tell me you could because I know first hand as I was in CS once. <br>
<br>
RF is not like other dragons. Its a quest mob not a regular dragon. And probably the most contended mob in Norrath now. <br>
<br>
What happens(or used to happen in Solb) is the cleric with the quest pieces camps RF alone and when he pops puts out the call to guild and friends to come help. Ideally people would respect that clerics camp as it takes a lot of time and effort and multiple guild raids to get to this point. And no ones guild has full power 24/7 and sometimes it takes a little longer to mobilize guild members on line and round up the additional help. As was the case when mine popped. Thankfully no greed monger loot whores rolled on me in Solb as mine was the pre changed RF. <br>
<br>
/rude verant for putting RF in a zone like SF. When I did rage over 6 months ago I moved my druid alt to a sliver of a safe spot amongst the FGs. I had to bind there as every 4 hours a roamer would come through and kill me. I would have to quick power off to avoid a death loop. People would come into the zone and /ooc is anyone camping rage. I would reply camped and they honored my camp. <br>
<br>
As for other dragons /agree they are fair game... better move quick or you lost your chance.<br>
<br>
It really seems the last few months game etiquette has gone out the window to lame greedy children.<br>
<br>
It went something like that I think my first post explained things better ahh well...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=toldarraywood>Toldar Raywood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 12:46:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame lists, whiners, and comunists</span><hr size=1> I'm pretty sure Silvius is talking about this post to...<br>

<br>
I was mainly just trying to point out that Rage should still be awarded to the cleric that camped him non stop and is holding the camp when he pops. Solb insulated the cleric from losing his camp and the latest Verant SNAFFU has made this camp a joke. No time seems to be given anymore for the poor cleric camping him to assemble his force.<br>
<br>
The irony is you will see GotK on this flame board crying bloody murder the first time they assemble to kill RF and some other more powerful guild (and there are many) roll on them in SF. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A little courtesy goes a long ways in PR. <br>

As every flame on these boards have stated, the guild that gets their force into SF first gets RF.  Guess who's gonna get there first?  The biggest, bestest guilds.  <br>
<br>
The cleric in a small guild that's made a lot of friends used to be able to put his ass in SolB and let his friends know to be ready for the call.  This cleric could put out this call and have a reasonable amount of time for his &quot;pickup&quot; forces to array.  <br>
<br>
Now, you need to have the backing of a completely uber force to complete your epic.  They must have the required 20-25 level 60s on at the time that RF pops or else some other guild that does (the required &quot;uber guild&quot;) will take it.  Its no longer up to the work of the cleric doing the quest...its up to the guild to provide full support for that cleric at the time that RF pops.<br>
<br>
There's no one to complain to but Verant.  Everyone that's posted against lists and for &quot;the one that has the forces gets the mob&quot; is completely right...but that doesn't make it suck any less.  Again, the game, like RL, makes it much easier for those that already have to gain more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then again, I'm just a level 53 newb in a midbie guild that doesn't know anything.  Go about your business and ignore me. <p><br>

<br>
Wolfran, Cleric epic's serve the guild not the individual.  A L56 cleric can rez himself just fine with a vendor bought spell, it's obviously the manaless regen rez that allows lower downtime recovering from a mishap/dragonfeeding thats of value on this item and that means the guild needs to make the sacrifice if it wants the reward.<br>

So in one respect yes it's true that a single cleric un-anon or a FD monk if it was his alt and had his cleric parked there in Naggy's lair could camp Ragefire and at least on our server be 90% sure that someone wouldnt come and gank it from under him.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I dont see it as unreasonable to expect a guild thats committed to having epic clerics to decide that its worth it to have a force capable of killing Ragefire either on hand or with in easy porting distance, which is very simple considering SF is a druid port zone.  In fact your &quot;grats clerics on being guild tool's&quot; statement is even more true in the old way of doing the quest when the Cleric was in Naggy's lair alone and everyone else was off having fun or doing those day to day mundane things like work, sleep, school etc etc.  <p>Grumbles<BR>High Priest of The Kindred<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964"> See my profile </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uteleanthus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teleanthus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/24/02 5:44:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame lists, whiners, and comunists</span><hr size=1> Pindk, genuinely curious here, what is your problem with GotK? OK, I'll cheerfully admit to being a comparitive 'n00b' as I have only been playing 19 months or so, and don't even have a 55+ main, but they are one of the few guilds I know that is relatively clear of stain on their rep. Do you have some info I am not privvy to?<br>
As far as the whole BC/GotK thing goes, /shrug, have known/do know people in both guilds. Whole Ragefire mess is the usual VI feck up, as both groups are good people. Saw the same thing happening with two other high end guilds, again, knew both clerics. Not well, but enough to have a good idea what they are like. The aggro and animosity that was shown was just NOT what they are usually like, but is very easy to get a guild riled when they feel one of their friends is being hassled. And please note, so far as I know both GotK and BC are primarily guilds of FRIENDS, not formed with one thing in mind, raiding. Heh, maybe I'm not seeing the whole picture, but this saddens me. Is a game in there, but something you have to understand is the polygons you see have real people behind them. People with friends, feelings, emotions and thoughts. /shrug Hell, done rambling. <p>Teleanthus Wynterhart <br>Pathfinder of Drinal <br> <br>Jumped into the gene pool while the lifeguard wasn't watching...<br>

<br>
No issue with GotK what so ever. I have several friends in GotK that we were in a former guild that folded into CS and for whatever reasons didn't work out for them they left and many ended up in GotK. <br>
<br>
I think it was partially due to the fact that the roles were reversed a few months back. If you dig through the flames pages (I don't expect you to) you'd find a nifty thread of rants about how eeevil NC (my guild) is for rolling on GotK with the Sev spawn. <br>
<br>
Truth be told I don't know how it came to be that NC was aware of Sev. I was told in guild chat one of our members was camping in EJ and when he popped we were instructed by our leader to ALL move to EJ to take down Sev. <br>
<br>
We mobilize fairly quickly or used to at least and when we got there there some people (not enough to raid on him) from GotK and a few from other high end guilds. <br>
<br>
Well a big fiasco broke out I assume similar to the one in SF with BC and GotK. GotK petitioned as our leader at the time said buff up we are taking Sev. About the time we finished buffing a GM shows up to resolve the issue. I was not privy to conversation but I assume he gave the standard VI formal response of there is no such thing as camp in EQ and the you do not own a mob yada yada... and made the decision we were the first on hand with a reasonable enough sized force to challenge and told us to proceed. <br>
<br>
This is the good part... what actually happened... we failed at 20%.. we only had one bard at the raid and our resists weren't up to par. EVERYONE died. Well if you read the rants of GotK a slew of misinformation came out in rants in that flame thread. We stole your spawn, we trained the spawn on you.. we are the biggest KS'n guild on the server... Just a retarded immature response to what happened. BTW one of the times I was feared I saw at least one GotK member trying to spy on the battle and a GM out there watching as well and they were damn close to the battle.. my guess is whoever that was watching the battle got hit with the AE and either didnt realize it our wasn't smart enough to camp out to clear agro and came back to your camp with a pissed off sev with one person still on his hate list. Or a remote possibility is you pre fight camp was in his path back to his resting place. Cuz if in fact Sev trained on your pre fight camp it wasn't an NC members evil plot to train you when all was lost... that is just absurd. <br>
<br>
OK the point of this lengthy reply is no I have no issue with GotK like every other guild you have few bad apples and a bunch of really nice ppl. I agree lists are ridiculous. I was mistaken in thinking RF should be awarded to a cleric that spent 72 straight hours camping the spawn (hell what do I care I have mine). And last but not least you tore up and down a guild that was in your shoes and you responded the same way when you lost a spawn to slow mobilization a little courtesy and helping that BC cleric get his epic rather than roll on them might save you future strife over losing a spawn to BC or maybe not oh well it was stupid post.. flames boards are pretty boring its like talking to a brick wall.. this is likely the last time I am posting here as this really has nothing to do with what I enjoy about EQ. <br>

I doubt it the train was intentional but the only alternative would be an intentional KS but either way very classy...<br>
<br>
I'll give ya this much we had no idea what the name du jour was of the camp and maybe a remote possibility was we didn't announce it as unsure of the name and yas felt compelled to go in even though 24 NC are in the yard in front of it clearing a way in, it was obvious our intent. <br>
<br>
Almost forgot the repeated training of freshly rez'd people at zone in I am sure was unintentional too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I sure hope you aren't setting the precedent with this training thing da db gate is a wonderful tool to return the favor. I sure hope this crap stops. GET OVER IT. I have not said a single damn thing outside of this dumb ass flame board (and done here as well) about you guys yet I get untold number of harassing tells from you guys. Hmm harassing tells... Training... Rolling on camps... /ooc insults... real mature. Class act! What is the average age of your guild, like 12 years old?<br>

<br>
Ragefire wasn't up at the time all of this went on.<br>
<br>
GotK was protesting the non-existant list some members of BC were using to justify /petition`ing to get our cleric to leave the zone, saying that they had it camped and noone could take him when he spawned but them, and training an AE mob on top of our cleric's FD necro.<br>
<br>
All things which BC's leadership has said were inappropriate actions on the part of some of their members who got caught up in the moment. <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>
