I, like you, like some traits I see in others here, am a pretty smart person but I haven't always dealt well with others who aren't. Well there are other flaws but we won't go in to them here. <br><br>One thing I discovered this year was a book titled &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;.  I had heard of it before and really dismissed it in my mind, but this time I picked up the audio tapes and forced myself to listen to it on the way to work. <br><br>Another book I have read 3 times now is called the &quot;Fifth Discipline' - by Dr. Senge (also available on audio) which has a really good section supplied by a Dr. Bohm around the art of effective communication.<br><br>These are both very reinforcing books, and if practiced well it takes you to a level of being able to &quot;control&quot; your real life conversations even with the most difficult people (and if you have any aspirtions of being in IT, which is where I work,  you may wind up leading a lot of difficult people).<br><br>I fall off the proverbial bike now and then but for the most part my effectiveness on the job has increased 100 fold. <br><br>It will never increase here, and you will see why once you read the book. The postings in this message board do everything that is contrary to good and productive dialog and there is no way to join someone in a room to have a 1 on 1 about the 'real' issues at hand.<br><br>I suggest you read these books not only for your personal growth as well  but because after you do the work you come back to these forums and it makes them very clear. <br><br>Most of the people in this forum have not matured to that level of dialogue and communication and many will never &quot;get it&quot; because they choose not to or their career paths /family life dont' require it. It makes these discussions much more simplified because you have a clearer perspective of why/how these individuals are saying bad/wrong things (detracting from everyone elses emotional bank accounts), and responding back is just a game.<br><br>Just an FYI you may have already done this stuff, but a lot of people in my workplace (fortune 500 company) are bonded together as a result of this work, it can be a real career enhancer. It was for me.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udidrika2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Didrika2001</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.free-graphics.com/gallery2/3danimations/flags/tn_16.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><br><font color=#0000FF>!!!BEWARE!!!</font></br><br><u><b>I have multiple personalities</b></u></br></span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 8:03:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes this is a Didrika post</span><hr size=1> Thanx for the info Tat...will look in to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>"People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said ~BUT~ they will always remember how you made them feel."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 1019<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 9:26:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/dancfrog.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes this is a Didrika post</span><hr size=1> Grats, Tat, that's one of the most lovely troll posts I think I've seen in a long time.<br><br>/hat off <p><center><img src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/dirrawood.jpg" border=0 align=center></a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usulinecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suli necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Love God</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 10:25:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes this is a Didrika post</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Most of the people in this forum have not matured to that level of dialogue and communication and many will never &quot;get it&quot; because they choose not to or their career paths /family life dont' require it.

But we must remember we are on a flames forum.  This forum is more or less a waste disposal system for the brain.  People have stress in their lives, there needs to be a healthy outlet someplace for anything negative that builds up to be released, how well it gets typed out onto the board and shown to the world is not a good measure of someone.  <br><br>The flames forum is a dirty place, if you enter it, you're bound to get shit thrown at you sometime or another.  Whats sad is once you enter it and make yourself known, you will almost never be forgotten.<br><br>Didrika, if you really are serious about moving to a new server I would do a few things first.  <br><br>1. Do not reply to anything here on this board or Drinals board.  The more you reply, the more you leave yourself open to being gawked at for entertainment.<br>2. Make a new character on another server, with a fresh name.  Don't use anything remotely close to your current name(s)<br>3. Make a new ezboard account with a fresh name.<br>4. Don't tell anyone about your new character, where you are, or who you were.  Names and Reptuations get around to other servers quite easily.  <br><br><br>If ya need a hunting partner or want someone to talk to, look up Sulidan or Keebie or Venia here on Drinal.  Or heck just email stp427@hotmail.com.  I am usually on late night or mid afternoon.  You're a good person, you're a sweetheart.  I think it was Elaylie that said don't change for anyone, or you will be miserable.  Have fun, enjoy life.<br> <p><a href="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/ppgquiz.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/blossom.gif" border=0 alt="Which PPG are you?"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 906<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 10:45:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> I totally disagree with the reputation line. I see that line pulled by the most apathetic introverted people on the server, and we know if the world were full of introverts no one would make a decision you have to have *all* types. The problem is the internet becomes some &quot;safe haven&quot; where extrovert need to &quot;model&quot; introverts to maintain &quot;acceptance'. That is rubbish. <br><br>When I say apathetic I don't mean they are people who do &quot;nothing&quot;, I mean all they do is complain about others rather then trying to influence changes and differences in a positive way while respecting *all * diversity. <br><br>There is no reason she needs to hide. She should hold her head up high and know that mistakes are made, and quite frankly she did and said many things many of us would have felt like doing if put in the same position by the vulgar people who exist on this board.<br><br>This board is not healthy, this board is a haven for the dysfunctional, not a place for the 'functional' to vent. The functional and the exceptional would find a different way towards solving their problems. There are people who post comments in here not having a clue what they are talking about they just know they 'heard' such and such person did this or that. While some of it may be true, not all of it is but they hop on the bandwagon and that isn't &quot;healthy&quot; that is damaging. It is damaging to whoever falls in the path of it, particularly if they have a reasonably decent but &quot;different' perspective on how a game should be played.<br><br>For a long time, but much less now, you were measured by play time and dedication, but now we see that there are people who committed suicide over a game and recognize that dedication may be a bit unhealthy unto it's own. But for a long time people where hammered for their lack of &quot;dedication&quot;, having to leave, or opting to leave at will when this game became less healthy then real life. <br><br>The more people push the fictitious &quot;values&quot; the more you are pushing an unhealthiness on others. Just respect that others have different values and move on. Granted, thieves, liars whatever they are bad..but some of the people who fall in the firing line here aren't all that. They wind up in the forum because someone made them a topic here and often times they dont' win.  <br><br>I vote she keeps her current name and the people who earn the reputation are the ones who badger others to &quot;react&quot;. I am sure you can list a healthy list of names of people who post in here only for that....<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubargeroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bargeroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>damn it</span><br>  Posts: 466<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 10:48:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yes this is a Didrika post</span><hr size=1> Tat did you really like that book?

For example: find someone to discuss a topic you have no interest in (for you it may be ballet or whatever). Their role is to discuss this topic and advocate all of the reasons why it is great. Your only role is to act &quot;genuinely&quot; interested and inquire from them. (advocacy /inquiry). I did this exercise and the first time I thought it was bs. the second time I was like wow that's kinda neat but the 3rd time a lady was advocating on the topic of &quot;marriage&quot; and I really realized how the tension in my body had built up (like when I am stressed) when having to be &quot;genuinely&quot; interested in a topic I have been mostly opposed to. <br><br>What this meant was that I never challenged my beliefs. I thought what was right was right and I didn't even 'know&quot; how to challenge my beliefs enough to let them go to listen to others.<br><br>Once you get past this plateau then you do the seven habits they make so much more sense. They are indeed 100% common sense but once you reach this transformational stage they take it a step further.<br><br> Doing this effort earned me a promotion when I thought for sure I was going to be laid off. It enables me to work and get through very difficult situations with difficult people at work (who have not transformed) because I am able to remain calm, challenge my beleifs, and take that communication a step further, as well as be aware of how some actions may be perceived.<br><br>Unless you are willing to let go of all your assumptions and be genuine about it - you will indeed think it is a bunch of BS. I am a pretty non-conformist but it works and if it didn't work I wouldnt' be using it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usulinecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suli necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Love God</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/02 11:30:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=989.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> I agree this board is not healthy.

But when it comes down to it, Didrika is the one who has to make the decisions for herself.  No matter how much anyone preaches to another person about life about what is right or wrong, the choices come down to you.  I don't tell anyone how they should live their life.  I am trying to offer advice, that's it.  If she wants to keep her name, more power to her.  If she wants to stay on Drinal, or heck even move to another server I'll be a friend.
