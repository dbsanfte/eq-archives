I could be a talking parrott for all you know on the other side of the wire, he wanted me to post that is obvious. So let's flame:) I consider posting &quot;tat is a man&quot; a warm welcome - so if you don't want to hear from me don't post about me morons.<br>
<br>
C'mon Julian write a few chapters I'm ready for ya. Let's start from the day I met you in Cazic when your maw maw died (IRL) and you told me what a great enchanter I was, asked me to marry you daily and invited me in to Rue Tang. Then I stumble across a wood elf bard who was supposed to marry you so I hit guild remove and told you, privately and politely to basically kiss my ass. But since we are now having a public debacle I can just say it firmly. <br>
<br>
Umm I think after that I had you on ignore for about a year could have been a little less since I quit playing for a long time.  Imagine it is hard to know my skills as a char when you are on my ignore list huh?<br>
<br>
When I came back from six months not playing on the server to find you were fairly civil again - although you annoyed the crap out of me giving me tells hugging me like every 5 min. Now that doesn't make me a man - it means a little dwarven fictional character on a screen who has limited dialogue capacity just doesn't stir my hormones the right way sorry.<br>
<br>
So one day I go on a hate raid and bmac (julians warrior) asks me if he can go on the raid. I ask several times, they say no. I honestly tried to persuade them. Then you give me some sob story about how I am penalizing you because you are cats in hats. It wasn't my raid genius. If you still have issues with it talk to Rezfor (leader) and Dogguk (officer) abouit it. It was their raid - they didn't invite you. I asked several times for you. After that you made it back to ignore.<br>
<br>
So apparently at one time you thought I was a skilled enchanter but it hurt your little ego that I didn't care to play your little fantasy games so you come in here to finally stir it up. Well let's have it ;-) <br>
<br>
Should be a creative story you can produce from there...it's a good start for a public hearing. Enquiring minds want to know what is the rest of the story. Write your two chapters I need a good fairy tale to read:) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/17/01 3:02:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/01 3:03:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> /hug tat im glad ur back!<br>

I was gone. I posted in here because as I was gone some little (easy going) CiH shit head comes in here and posts that I am a man instead of a woman. If you don't like a response don't post about me- if you want to post about me because you find phenomenal entertainment out of my follow ups keep posting. You were the one who once said it was up to the accusee to defend themselves (I think.) If my name is up here I will post whatever I want in reply. If you don't like it too bad, you (the forum community) were the one who posted about me when I hadn't even been here for 2 weeks nor in game for six months about something not even marginally true. <br>
<br>
Simple, stop posting things with &quot;Tat&quot; in them or deal with the response. <br>
<br>
They post Windalyia because they like the response. That doesn't mean &quot;you&quot; need to click on the link.<br>
<br>
Ok so it is simple for you people who just don't get it. Summary..<br>
<br>
1. Tat was gone. Not posting<br>
<br>
2. Someone posts &quot;Tat's a man&quot;. It was an untrue statement made out of sheer boredome by someone else who has quit the game and apparently hasn't found anything better to do yet than try to start a flame war.<br>
<br>
3. Tat will respond. The response might come out sounding like a flame. I might even retailiate and build a new flame thread.<br>
<br>
4. Click links to read flaming responses to original accusations or Click the Back Button.<br>
<br>

If you are thin skinned please don't read posts made by Tatianae Fatecaster.

Or do you mean I actually bailed....please explain the scenario with some facts.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking really really hard here and I don't remember a Dragooner please help me out. Or maybe you are just another 14 year old goon hopping on the flame train, with no real knowledge of me in game, because one of your buddies is involved in this or some other thread? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/18/01 10:00:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 481<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/19/01 5:37:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> I'm waiting Dragooner, although I fully expected you wouldn't have an answer to any of these questions. <br>
<br>
So let's assume bail time means that a) you invited me to a group and I said no or b) I grouped until 10 or 11pm on a weekday and had to log or c) nothing you just stirring up shit. <br>
<br>
Does this mean that you need to come in here and as a normal practice flame everyone who logs off for work at 10pm, doesn't do anything or doesn' group wih you four months after quitting the game? <br>
<br>
Who has problems here? You don't have an issue and you are in here making a statement &quot;you've got problems?&quot; You don't even KNOW me~! Ohh your little guildmates ego got hurt when he came in here and &quot;intentionally&quot; stirred the pot. Oh well that is your own damned fault. I didn't make anyone post in here about me.<br>
<br>
Well jesus christ let me make a list of all the people who grouped with me and had to camp at 10 or 11, people who didn't group with me or I didn't have an issue with and list them in here in this forum accusing them all of being the opposite gender of their char.<br>
<br>
Now that is logic for you.<br>
<br>
Again, this shit all started one day when Dogguk made a posting which was 85% non-factual because he is a fucking spoiled brat and couldn't figure out how to rationalize that this enchanter didn't give a shit about him or his moronic groups. <br>
<br>
That is right I am not obligated to have compassion for everyone I come across - it is the fucking internet and a god damned game and NO I don't like you enough to jeapordize my real life for it. Read my lips - &quot;I hold no social commitment to sacrifice my time and my life for you if you are a disrespectful asshole in a cartoon game&quot; and I think more people should follow that lead! You can come whine in a forum about it - you can call me a bitch - you can not invite me in to your guilds. I have no reason to sacrifice any second, minute, hour of my time to play with people when they are and &quot;know&quot; they are being shitty. It is my dime and my time.  Get over yourselves you pathetic little shits.<br>
<br>
It is &quot;you&quot; who chose to bring my name in to this forum in a negative light and it is &quot;you&quot; who keep bringing it up. If you post to me or about me expect a damned response or shut the hell up! And you people wonder why I am not happy and chipper in these forums any more? WTF did I ever &quot;really&quot; and &quot;factually&quot; do to any one of you other than generate responses based false/ incorrect statements about me in here? Yeah I dogged CiH because I can't stand watching the same snivveling little shits come in here (and other forums) and whine about loot, kill stealing, and me! If you can dish it be prepared to take it fuckheads.<br>
<br>
Bottom line I don't like any of you who are in here, or read or contribute to this forum at this point. Go fuck yourselves.<br>
<br>
NO I am not happy with you guys, NO I am not the Tat I used to be what would I gain from being nice? NO I won't be happy with you guys and NO you won't see me ignore it when you post about me.<br>
<br>
It's the god damned internet not one of you knows my gender, my personality, my lifestyle and you will **never** know it factually. I could put both my resume and my photo in here and you would say it is false. Welcome to a world of anonymity - you don't know and you will never know who are you are dealing with unless I directly invite you to come for a visit which ISN&quot;T going to happen! Get over it and go play with your little cartoons with the rest of your little 14 year old friends.<br>
