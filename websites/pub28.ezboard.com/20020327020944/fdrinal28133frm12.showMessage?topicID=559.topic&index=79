Call us evil, monopolizing, selfish bastards all you want, but believe it or not, we DIDNT wake him to ruin the lives of people who will never even see ST.  Except for 1 post, the 1 guild that was close to killing the 4th warder (CT) has been doing nothing but defending CiH's actions, and I thank them for that.  If anybody should be upset, it's them, and they're not because they understand why we did it.<br>
<br>
The main reason for doing it is after you have been farming sleepers for so long, it becomes a bottleneck for your guild.  I said a long time ago that CiH would never, ever wake the sleeper.  I also had no idea why ANY server would, and thought those that did were both evil and selfish.  To understand why you wake the sleeper, you really have to be in a guild that's been farming warders for a long, long time.  <br>
<br>
With the passing of every day, sleepers was becoming a bottleneck for the guild.  It was wasting valuable time that could be spent on SoL mobs instead of farming either keys or warders.  You might say &quot;why not just not go to sleepers?&quot;  The reason is simple.  As more and more members join, they all want a key, SoD, primal, etc.  Existing members also want everything they can use from the zone, despite the fact that most of it is sub-par to loot dropped by other mobs we could kill if we put in the effort.  The members of a guild essentially control where the guild goes, and what it does.  If you refuse to go to ST when everybody wants something, no matter how insignificant, members get pissed and problems occur.  Waking the sleeper gets rid of the reason for the guild to farm keys and sub-par loot.  Now all the time spent on that can be put full force into luclin mobs, quests, and events.  Luclin has a lot to offer, drinal just has yet to discover it.<br>
<br>
Simply put, waking the sleeper is a full force kick on the ass into luclin for the guild.  Nothing else can get you past the bottleneck that is sleepers.  Always remember, angry members = failing guild.<br>
<br>
You all wanted a reason to wake the sleeper that wasn't cutting off the primal to the rest of the server.  Here it is. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushinro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shinro</A> at: 2/25/02 4:31:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usophiempryean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sophi Empryean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/25/02 4:11:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grats CiH!</span><hr size=1> Nidabu where is my table dance damnit?<br>

You really should consider what you are doing to the server community. <br>
<br>
Of the 10 or so 60 warriors that CT has all have their sod, cept for 3 of us, im sure with time one of them will be handed down to me and the other two so we will have sod or maybe better. So no CT was not heavily hit by this on the SoD aspect, however the true victims of this event are all the other guilds that where just about to break the ST raids. TK, CS, and WL are the guilds that come to mind and these are the people that I feel bad for b/c they wont have a chance to own a sod or twinker mask or whatever else item from the warders. <br>

CiH mabye destroyed something but they also maked something possible for all, i talking about the quests what have been put in game now after sleeper is free<br>
<br>
mabye nobody else would be able to kill 4th warder, in 1 year ya would whine coz ya cant wake him and ya want so badly do the quests(i dont mean CT would be never able to kill 4th warder but ya never know what happen)<br>
<br>
<br>
btw why should CiH care what ya little losers think after ya called them selfish, bastards, why should they care about ya?<br>

<br>
I never thought of that aspect Shinro.  Good point.  And not only applicable to CiH...appliciable to the entire SERVER.<br>
<br>
Those who were ST capable had most of what they wanted from ST.  Those who weren't ST capable strove to join those who were so they could get ST loot.  Those who weren't qualified or unable to join the ST capable guilds will now bitch and moan like I am sure a couple ST capable guild members did when Kera was awakened.  But like mature, veteran guild members, I'm sure that THEY got over it, knowing that no amount of complaint could bring back the warders.  Why is that so hard for so many people who never had a chance or were far from it to understand?<br>
<br>
You're part of one of 3 groups of people.<br>
<br>
The people who had access, and got what they needed from it.  Now they can move ahead as a guild and focus on the newer source of loot/experience - Luclin.<br>
<br>
The people who were close to access, but would have failed miserably had they rushed it.  They have a new place to focus now - Luclin.<br>
<br>
The people who never stood a chance of having access.  What the hell are you moaning about?  Because you have a one in a million chance of getting Primal now?  Because you don't get a shot at all that &quot;phay loot.&quot;  Tough beans - there's plenty of &quot;phat loot&quot; on Luclin - focus there.<br>
<br>
What does it all come down to?  GET OVER IT - MOVE ON. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97846">Azael Azureberry</a><BR>

<br>
You do make a very good point that by waking the sleeper you are able to change the focus of your guild in one action and take away a devisive option. it does sound like a very good move for your guild. <br>
<br>
TK could kill aary today no doubt about it and prolly every other Ntov mob. They just havent ever been given the opportunity or chose to race to the zone to get it yet. When they feel they are ready we will do what we can to see they get a shot at it as we will with any other guild. <br>
<br>
Fe/maxwells if they cant yet will very soon clear Ntov. <br>

<br>
Anyway thats not why I replied to this thread, the thing that makes me angry are the people who think THEY know WHO will ever get into ST; guilds rise and fall, members come and go, could be the person who buys everquest tommorow, is a good player and in a while is 60 and either works his way into a ST capable guild *WHOEVER* they may be at that time, or could be a new guild formed from members of old, could be a current guild who slowly builds their way into ST, their chances *WHOEVER* they may be of getting primal is signficantly reduceded (not a flame, just a fact,) or takes a lot longer to get, and their chances of getting warder loot now is near zero, once again just a fact, (unless they buy the tradable items, or VI resets the sleeper, who knows, only time will tell)<br>
<br>
Another response to this thread, I was in Skyshrine when Kerafyrm (sp) and their is NO way unless the person is AFK or blind that they could not know that they were gunna die, Pyrox, (NPC)  and the other guardians  gave a good 3 minutes warning, shouting spam of the sleeper entering the zone, and even then it took many minutes to reach us. The reason I was there is pretty much the same reason many CiH members have said for wakening the sleeper (though my actions had far less consquences then theirs, just a fact,) was to partipate, in a small way in a (supposed) once in a servertime event, get a nifty screenshot of me tanking (well, getting slaughter by <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) the sleeper, and him uttering my name, and me being insta killed (as a pally I feel it is my duty to get DTed by every mob possible :P)<br>

2) People who have never visited them yet HAD the chance but you didn't take the opportunity so the hell with you. Or.... you don't have the money to fly to Egypt and most likely never will so we may as well destroy them.<br>
<br>
3) By bulldozing them we would acomplish ...... hmmmmm I guess not a God Damn thing really but WOW how cool it would be to see them fall !<br>
<br>
4) People will not waste their time, effort and money to partake in such an opportunity to see them in real life. People would be thankfull because they can spend their vacation somewhere else.<br>
<br>
5) Every year my family wanted to fly to Egypt to see them. And anytime my family would have an addition we would have to go again so the best solution was to destroy them so that we would not be bothered with this problem.<br>
<br>
6) The people who destroyed them could be the ones to say &quot;I destroyed the pyramids and sphnix in Egypt and you didn't !&quot;<br>
<br>
7) Well, they were gonna eventually erode away to dust anyway or someone else might have come along and destroyed them so we may as well do it now.<br>
<br>
Now, granted EQ is just a Video Game and the Great Pyramid and Sphynx are both Wonders of the World. I am only trying to help CiH and their supporters try and understand that their lame excuses for why they did this does NOTHING to deter people's thoughts that it was a SELFISH and SELF-SERVING act !  Maybe by taking their thought process and relating it to something real and tangable a few people will better understand why so many people ( even the one's who may NEVER EVER go to ST ) view this as selfish and are upset.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad that CiH can now &quot;move on&quot; and that their personal &quot;bottleneck&quot; with the game was solved even at EVERY OTHER Drinal players expense. Congradulations at being the what ..... 10th, 12th guild to acomplish what has already been done on other servers. So glad you ignored other Guild's warnings that awaking the Sleeper has absolutely no reward and that it is a MOB better left to sleep. /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
No matter how you try to rationalize it, this was a SELFISH act ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Bottleneck on Luclin? ROFL.  That's the dumbest thing I have heard all night.  How many &quot;ubermob&quot; zones are there off the moon.  A couple that are accessable without keys.  How many &quot;ubermob&quot; zones are accessable on Luclin without keys.  All but one from what I understand.  Go raid Katta, or Seru, Ssra Temple, Deep, Umbral, Ahkeva, Acrylia...the list goes on and on.  Undiscovered items, undiscovered quests.  I think there's plenty of moon territory to go around.  I don't see a bottleneck.  Someone in Ssra?  Go to Ahkeva or the Deep.  They can't all be full - there will always be something large, mean, and annoying to kill. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97846">Azael Azureberry</a><BR>
