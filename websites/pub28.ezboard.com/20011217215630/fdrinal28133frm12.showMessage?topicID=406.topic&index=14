<br>
Marias: nobody can read your posts because you type like a 3 year OD'd on crack getting shocked every 3 seconds with a taser.<br>
<br>
I have deleted 1 thread (other than when people requested I delete a thread cause they posted twice accidentally or something) in the last 7 or 8 months since I have been in charge of UGoD.  <br>
<br>
You know why it took you a while to get that raid started?  You showed up late, you were unprepared, and you wouldn't compromise your desire to have all 55+ for over an hour while we realized that we couldn't get enough 55+ wizards and monks and stuff.  If you had been willing to take lower pullers/wizards until we cleared the first floor and most of the second, we wouldn't have wasted so much time.  Also, your ego is clearly too big for your own good--I just wanted to help you get the raid going, and of course, you see it as me spamming you for no good reason.  Whatever.  There was a reason I never went on any of your raids before that one, and there's a reason why I won't again.  I figured it was worth a try and I got pretty much what I expected.  You couldn't even get a raid into Hate, let alone come anywhere near Inny.<br>
<br>
Asking me to try and lead a raid with an objective of a bigger guild...isn't that what spawned this whole thread, my leading a PoA raid with a goal of getting to 7th Isle?  Oh, and if you can't tell, I'm actually preparing for that...you know, bothering to do stuff like get people commited ahead of time, making sure I have crucial people agreeing to come, getting portal stones and coffins and such ahead of time, you know, important things that slipped your mind.  Maybe I'll even log on more than 3 minutes before the raid is supposed to start to make sure things are looking good.<br>
<br>
Marias, I offer you this challenge.  You think you can do so great leading UGoD?  It's yours.  I'll step down and appoint you as my successor right now.  Just say the word.  Leading UGoD was never about me being the #1 raid leader of UGoD.  It's an administrative position.  George Bush isn't out in the field in Afghanistan helping our troops take that airstrip, and I'm not always going to be the one out there leading the charge on the big mob of the day.<br>
<br>
You have *NO* vision for actually working toward a goal, at all.  You see the end point, you want it, and you try and get it without doing stuff in between.  Why don't you try and lead a raid on the Avatar of War?  Maybe ask Cats if you can have a crack at Vyemm and Vulak?  I mean, why not, those are big mobs.  It's not like it would help for the tanks to have a set of decent Velious armor first, they'll be fine in their crafted!  Kael arena is boring, that's just about farming armor, right?  Screw that stuff, let's go kill some ubermobs!  Just keep an alt parked in Neriak for easy access to the coffins.  Me, I'll be working on equipping my guildmates and friends with better gear, honing our tactics, and getting levels so we can do the job right when we take a crack at whatever we do. <br>
<br>
Again with the implications (begging?) to be banned...1 person has ever been banned, and that's Greatdark.  I don't care if you want to contradict me and argue with me.  I think it's healthy, at least, when its carried out by two people capable of conveying thoughts without TYPING ......... like cRRRRRRazYYYYYYY ppllllll  ??????  mebbbe u caN unnerstand this beter?!?!?<br>

<br>
This is the best thread I have read in months. I can't stop laughing I'm in tears. <br>
<br>
Seke, this guy is a fewl. We all know what your about, your a good guy, and honest guy and a sharp raid leader who plays the game to have fun and progress. I have seen both you and Marias in action on several occaisions and I can say that all &quot;Skills&quot; totally aside, I couldn't stand to be around Marias long enough to truly decide if he knew what he was doing or if he was just running up the paper budget at mommies house with vanity copies of his own egotistical drival to post on his bathroom mirror. <br>
<br>
Marias, I have been silent about the grudge I bear you for 6 months because I generally treat childish idiots like yourself with such disdain that I won't bother responding. Now, I am so thoroughly agape at your litaney of bullshit this morning that I can't stop laughing and will pipe up. <br>
<br>
STFU man? Your really wreckin yerself here, it makes me feel seriously bad for you. Take a look at what you are posting. not that I didn't know you were a twofaced, petty self centered kid in the first place, but do you really want all of drinal to see how you treat people when you have worked so long and hard to butter them up into thinking that you are a friend? Read your posts man. You blew your cover with me, and alot of other silent Marias haters a while ago, but if you proceed like this, you will leave little of the fruits of your smoozing campaign left for you to eat. <br>
<br>
Trying to compare yourself to Seke is a joke. Seke is a nice guy who treats people decently because he isn't desperately climbing ladders to get his pants of sufficient genital size defaulted to him when he cybers his way into ubarness_00.<br>
<br>
I do bear you a grudge. A serious one. If you only understood the nasty RL impact you had on a very dear friend of mine. she was a young teenage girl playing this game who was severly hurt because she was niave enough to listen to some masterbating idiot on the internet. I remember the day. Others do to. Did you ever think that sometimes the things you say to people can have a pretty harsh affect on them? This is why I haven't even begun to tell you what I think of you for all this time. I will continue to keep it to myself if you are smart enough to stop posting this kind of drivel on public boards. I am just getting really sick of listening to your bullshit. Geez man go back to circlejerking in your room with your two imaginary friends and Fluffynut the teddy bear, they actually want to hear what you have to say because they are inanimate objects and can't be annoyed into a suicidal depression by the droning on of your bottomless pit ego petting. <br>
<br>
btw gotk may have some friends for you. This is not a post that should in anyway be taken as an opinion of the guild. I have too much respect for the individuals in my guild then to attribute my thoughts on your perpetual wank'o'rama then to try and speak for them. Just I and some people from way back who remember when you blew threw our guild, all lies and bullshit on your fast track to (Where the fuck do you think your going anyway?). I remember inviting you myself that day. What a stain on my own integrity. I have since learned better then to trust random ass kissers. Thanks for the lesson. <br>
<br>
Man, just STFU HAHAHAH if i keep falling out of my chair at work laughing at the sheer stupidity you post i am going to get fired LOL. <br>
<br>
This is not about who can do what in some faerie land computer game. This is about a stupid kid hiding in his room behind his computer screen jerking off into his socks. The way you treat people is the problem. I don't give a shit about your raids, and duels and uber this and uber that, you sorry little boy. I am just sick of listening to some punk ass small-man painting pictures of his &quot;manly&quot; form by stepping all over other people. Perhaps after you have gone out into the world and lived a little (Which in your case would likely result in some severe beatings) you will understand the meaning of treating other human beings with an ounce of respect. <br>
<br>
Fuck you very much Marias for the messed up shit that you pulled on a real person who really didn't deserve to benifit from the public service weasels like you provide. I was there and saw how your bullshit stunt affected her after she thought you were her friend. It was seriously wrong, and I don't think you would have any idea who I am talking about anyway, you treat so many random people who you don't see up ahead of you on your candy-cane-lane path to UBAR, You lieing, egotisical sack of shit. <br>

You suck big fat monkey nuts.  I just think It's so funny when you get all pissed off and start trying to get devious sending people tells saying &quot;did you say this, because Marias says you said.&quot; And how about = when all yer lil friends, or just some guy you went down on recently comes and throws in their 2CP.  I am so hoping Happens here.  Just because it makes me laugh how damn pathetic you are. *laughs*<br>
<br>
Garathson , please don't send me anymore tells telling me I'm biting off more then I can chew by flaming &quot;your guild&quot; and trying to disband it.  Destroying GoTK is not woth my time.  You'll do it yourself you ingrate.  But I'm not flaming GoTK I'm flaming you,  you sorry sack of shit.  So, before you go tell anyone else that I'm planning some evil plot, please put it in your head that you fucked up. You will be the end of GoTK one day.  You're giant sized wussy ego will allianate people until they get sick and leave or toss your ass out.  I can't wait to see that day Garathson.<br>
<br>
Oh , Lemme let you in on a little xecret garathson, just because you lead 36 people to pull the temple in fear and barely live, you are not uber.  Because you can run in and linch a mob with way too many people and barely live, you are not good.  Garathson, you have no skill.  You run in with over kill and barely make it out.  The only reason you live Garathson are thanks to your Clerics in which I must congratulate any and every cleric that has raided with Garathson as main assist just for keeping him alive.  (addition: skill has nothing to do with the &quot;damage&quot; you take. There are other things that warriors need skill for, we'll leave that be)<br>
<br>
Garathson, I've hurt your ego now.  Are you gonna flame me? Please do.   I need a good laugh I'm just not in the mood.  The sooner you get it in your tiny head that you are not better than anyone, anyone at all, only then will you be ok in my book. But then I'll have to stop flaming you and I wont have these happy times anymore.<br>
<br>
Garathson, remember when you Duel'd a 56 Shaman when you were lvl 60?   Thinking you could get an easy kill + ego boost and I owned your fuck ass then went on to own Warelorf too who decided he'd try.  You came back crying about I cheated and shit.  That's the main point. You thought because I was lower lvl and you were stronger you could win.  I beat you with my skill.  I hurt your ego, and everyone in that zone heard you cry like a little girl. Now If you want to see a warrior with some skill, take a look at Mantik.   Mantik killed  me.  If it hadn't been for his skill and knowledge of his class I might have won.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Garathson , You suck.  Please quit thinking you're uber and better than someone.  And now that I gave Mantik props on a thread that I flamed you on are you gonna get mad and talk shit and get all pissy?  When I told Molgar that in my opinion Craigorr was better than you, you started talking shit to him.  If i said this, etc etc.  Horse shit, I don't give a flying fuck. Lick monkey cock, you froglok raping necropheliac.<br>

P.S. I apologize Mantik if he gets all pissy and starts shit cause I said you could beat him with your eyes closed ...  (Edit: Mantik has kicked my ass several times in duels -- Garathson)<br>
<br>
P.P.S. DOH!!! I forget .. GoK is all supossed to hate me.  Wow , Funny the things a few people think  they know or want to make things appear to be.  I know GoK doesn't all stand by everything a few people say.  This is what i have been trying to tell you Garathson.  You tell me I don't know shit about GoK.  When I try to tell you that I do, it is because all my friends keep telling me shit or people venting on me, then you tell me that I'm lying because they all hate me and I have no place there.  You're talking in fucking circles.  When you tell me not to flame cause I don't know what I'm talking about, I tell you i do know what the fuck is going on.  You give me perfect reason to flame by saying shit like they all hate me and I'm not welcomed .. but <br>
I know your full of shit <br>

<br>
Seke , Finally read through your whole post LOL  Was too busy laughing and reading Slokt's post ... that WAS some good shit  HAHHAHA  ... <br>
<br>
 Now that everyone attached to this topic is good and well pissed off .....<br>
<br>
  Seke, If you actually expected people to wait around and do nothing while we went in a cleared the way to Inny , you're mistaken .... By time we made it to Inny either way people would have logg'd ....   I waited because I knew the only way  we even had a chance  to do it was if we got everyone we'd need there  at the time ....  And excuse me if I had a little compassion to not take up a buncha people to do our dirty work then kick them out right before the actual fun part ... You weren't the person dealing with the flames or the spam .. as Allways I was , I'm the person that gets in arguements with people from guilds such as AA who complain about UGoD ... I'm the person  who stands up and goes off on people and gets flamed  because someone in UGoD  felt  like they were misstreated ... you  deal with the shit Seke , I'm frankly tired of wasting my time with it ....<br>
<br>
 PoA ???  Yes , For ONCE you're doing something new , but not for UGoD , you're doing it for your certain friends  and useing UGoD to do it ... And If I could commit to  3 days of 16 hour play   I would Have done PoA a long time ago ..<br>
<br>
 Seke, you talk a lotta shit now ... but this comming from the guy /t'ing me about the Honor of comming to PoH with me and taking a crack at Inny ...  Hell , you wannted to do it and you know it , you just didn't wanna catch shit  if it didn't go right ... <br>
<br>
 As we all know .. the average starting time of ANY raid lead by UGoD  is allways atleast 1.5 Hours behind Schedule , So the fact that it only took 2 hours  to gather a full raid of 55+ people   ( wich most didn't even know of the post on UGoD  ) is better then UGoD has done in a LONG time .... the fact that  a whole raid of people lvl 55+ even associated with UGoD  was a HUGE improvement ,  but All you can think of is the loot you coulda got  eh ... don't think of the good it did . Raid wasn't a failure Seke , It  did exactly what needed to be done , Raise the lvl and capability and integrety of UGoD affiliates   .. TY VRY FUCKING MUCH  !! <br>
<br>
<br>
 ALSO , Seke , I don't think I'm better then you ...  I know you can lead some raids ... I know you've had some Hard times in doing it  as we all have ...  It just Bafels me where you come off thinking you can flame me for doing exactly what you wanted done ... I seriouslly think if you stop all the complaining and start getting to it ,do your Kael raids and shyt , then you might just turn UGoD into something ... I'm just sick of the whiny shit that comes with it ... wich Is why I never started a guild LOOONG LOOONG ago  when I wanted to ... I can't deal with ppl complaining about  I want this??  or How come he got that and not me ??  or  I wanna go do this mob but we can't because I need UBER_GEAR_01  !!    I'd end up telling everyone to STFU and go do it ......  You gotta be able to TRY something yourself before complaining about other people not doing it for you ... I learned that from  people such as Amadagu  from reading his posts  wich is WHY i started Leading Raids ,  It's WHY I lead Fear without haveing EVER  stepped foot in the Zone before  , It's WHY I did Hate  with only the Knowledge of 1 failed raid that never left the Gate House .... <br>
<br>
  The Raid isn't all about the Leader . I can tell you a Million times , it's up to the people on the raid  to come together and get the job done .. I've allways  said that and allways will,  /point Seke  YOU know it ....<br>

P.S. Please Remove your cock from that goats ass next time you post please<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you Slokt<br>
(lil add here:  i think this was the post where he flamed the young girl for trying to meet  him irl, after he violated her /shrug)<br>
<br>
<br>
Gwarok, when you actually have the integrety to show up for a raid that you sign up for, then you have the right to an opinion.  (EDIT: it's a EQ sin to have real life interfere with your raids.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you Wind, half these people don't know me.  I'm not mean I just tell it how it is,  using no remorse.  It is funny how many of these people were at the raids I lead when they were getting something in return.  When I met Wind she only needed one thing and still after she got it she came out to more raids, helped with other planes and such, and I'm sure she coulda had other things to do.  Thank you Wind for your help.  Always fun killin shit with ya =)  (EDIT: /em looks at the last page of the TK vs CIH/CT thingy)<br>

<br>
lol, It's obvious from your response that you Don't know who I am talking about or when. lol, I think it's funny that you have brought up some other drama entirely lol. You must have a few of those in your past. My points really have less to do with some particular high school drama you are embroiled in, and more generally with your attitude in general. <br>
<br>
That's okay, it's not the point. The point was simply this. <br>
<br>
Your a loudmouth braggert. I'm sure you have friends on the server that like to play with you. &gt;;D If you would just play the game, and end the ceaseless posturing and bullshit, then you wouldn't have people around who dislike you around anyway. <br>
<br>
This whole thing is about Marias trolling for attention. If you spend less time flaming people, they will spend less time flaming you, and might actually have enough respect to care about what you may or may not do in the game. <br>
<br>
Well, I think I said what I wanted to say. I'm not so aggravated as I was this morning, especially after feeding you so much rope you are gladly taking. Read you rown posts man, you sound like a whining, insecure idiot who has something to prove. It's old, innane and useless. some people who are your friends know what their relationship is to you. Like I think you mentioned briefly in one of the former posts, you don't need anyone else, so go on ahead and hang with your friends and leave other people alone. I am pretty sure you will be alot happier and will be able to have your own fun and success in EQ. But, seriously man. You need to learn to relax. You don't have to prove to the world that you are okay by throwing all of this bullshit around like so much slop. <br>
<br>
Oh well, I am going to stop feeding the trolls.. <br>
<br>
I know what I know about you from personal experience. I watched it first hand, and I know you didn't know it was me at the time. I think you would be surprised if you knew how many people on this server are my RL friends and when I am looking over their shoulders, or on their characters. LOL I have seen you in action on many occaisions. LOL groups of friends of mine come over here to my house and laugh about what the latest Marias stunt has been. Your a household name around here lol, which is I'm sure what your goal is with all of this. Talking shit about me? Still talking about me right? <br>
<br>
I have had WAY too many experiences with you, and made my own conclusions about your bullshit. I was content to keep them to myself, so I wouldn't be drug into your pit of foolishness with you, until you start up again starting shit. If you would just shut up, play the game, and stop trying to impress everyone with how cool you are, you would probably be alot cooler of a player anyway. But each to his own, you have all the rope you need and are content to use it. So I'll leave you alone now. lol I am actually embarassed like I said that I took you seriously for a second and let you get me  to feed the egobeast. <br>
<br>
You tell me that I know nothing about you. I see that you know little or nothing about what I am trying to explain to you. At this point I understand that you feel like you need to save face to defend that precious ego. My advice for you would be to end the bullshit and go back to playing the game. People really don't take this kind of blathering idiocy seriously and don't really care what you have to say. Do yourself a favor. Read your post man. <br>
<br>
Have fun in game =)<br>

<br>
<br>
Seke, I finally read through your whole post.  Was too busy reading Slokt's post.  That was some good shit. (did all i could =\)<br>
<br>
Now that everyone attached to this topic is pissed off,<br>
<br>
Seke, If you actually expected people to wait around and do nothing while we went in a cleared the way to Inny, you're mistaken.  By the time we made it to Inny people would have logged.  I waited because I knew the only way we even had a chance to do it was if we got everyone we'd need there at the time.  Excuse me if I had a little compassion to not take up a buncha people to do our dirty work then kick them out right before the actual fun part.  You weren't the person dealing with the flames or the spam.    I was, I'm the person that gets in arguements with people from guilds such as AA who complain about UGoD.  I'm the person who stands up and goes off on people and gets flamed because someone in UGoD felt like they were misstreated  you deal with the shit Seke , I'm frankly tired of wasting my time with it.  (You've been a raid leader, or above level 50 for how long Marias?  Seke and Amadagu have dealt with 5 times the shit you've ever seen.)<br>
<br>
In regards to the Plane of Air. Yes, for once you're doing something new.  (EDIT: Uh... we did PoA right before Chardok. UGoD that is.)  Not for UGoD, you're doing it for your certain friends and using UGoD to do it.  (EDIT: No he's using his friends to do it, and posting it on UGoD.  Everything Seke does is watched by the members of UGoD.  God forbid he did something himself.)  If I could commit to 3 days of 16 hour play I would Have done PoA a long time ago.  <br>
<br>
Seke, you talk a lot of shit now.  This coming from the guy sending me about the Honor of coming to Plane of Hate with me, and taking a crack at Inny.  (EDIT: The honor must have been before he went on the raid.  Same reason I left your fear raid after 5 minutes)  Hell, you wanted to do it and you know it.  What you didn't want is part of the blame if it didn't go as planned.  (EDIT: By the way, wasn't marias the person talking about having SK's harmtouch, get deathtouched, get rezzed, then redeathtouch?)<br>
<br>
As we all know, the average starting time of any raid lead by UGoD is allways at least 1.5 hours behind schedule.  So the fact that it only took 2 hours to gather a full raid of 55+ people (in which most didn't even know of the post on UGoD) is better then UGoD has done in a long time. The fact that a whole raid of people lvl 55+ even associated with UGoD was a huge improvement, unfortunately all you can think of is the loot you coulda got.  (EDIT: Jack Shit drops off of Innoruuk, why do you think he hasn't been farmed since the IM days.  No offense to IM in that.)  Don't think of the good it did. Raid wasn't a failure Seke, It did exactly what needed to be done, Raise the lvl and capability and integrety of UGoD affiliates.  Thank you very fucking much. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also Seke, I don't think I'm better then you.  I know you can lead some raids.  (EDIT: Were you even allowed on any of Seke's raids?)  I know you've had some hard times in doing it as we all have.  It just baffles me where you come off thinking you can flame me for doing exactly what you wanted done.  I seriously think if you stop all the complaining and start getting to it, do your Kael raids and shit, then you might just turn UGoD into something.  I'm just sick of the whiny shit that comes with it.  This is why I never started a guild long ago when I wanted to.  (EDIT: Theres a reason most of the people in UGoD are there.  They enjoy doing higher level things without a higher level guild)  I can't deal with people complaining about wanting a piece of loot, or how come he got that and not me, and I wanna go do this mob but we can't because I need UBER_GEAR_01 !! (EDIT: I tried.  That sentence is beyond repair.)  I'd end up telling everyone to Shut the fuck up and go do it.  You gotta be able to try something yourself before complaining about other people not doing it for you.  I learned that from people such as Amadagu from reading his posts wich is why i started leading raids.  It's why I lead Fear without having ever stepped foot in the zone before.  It's why I did Hate with only the knowledge of one failed raid that never left the gate house.  (EDIT: we're ya even sufficient level before you started leading raids?  I believe ya didn't even hit 50+ until the VL invasion.  VL = easy experience in which you need zero skill)<br>
<br>
Raids aren't all about the leader . I can tell you a million times , it's up to the people on the raid to come together and get the job done.  I've allways said that and always will, /point Seke you know it.<br>
