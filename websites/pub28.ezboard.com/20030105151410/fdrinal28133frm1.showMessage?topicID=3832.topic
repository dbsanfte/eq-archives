Dear Journal,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There isn't much to say since today was that of a nocturnal one, Meaning I slept all day and have been up all night.<br>
My life has been reduced to Everquest , School work, and internet chat. Outside of the house I have no life , I don't even <br>
exist in the world today. I am only a ghost and because of that I can't expect much to happen everday.. reoccuring events<br>
leaving me with the feeling of Deja vu when in fact the same damn thing happened yesterday.I keep haveing thoughts , thoughts <br>
about what will happen to me as I grow older , Thoughts about Jonnie , thoughts about my internet friends , thoughts about sav....<br>
All these thoughts are building up into an imense pressure on me , like weights tied tighly around my feet as I am sinking further<br>
underwater , I feel the need to breathe but I can't break free and fight to the surface for air , I can only drift underwater<br>
and drown slowly stareing at sky from underwater.When I think about what I'm doing everyday , playing Everquest , it raises the <br>
question why? what good is everquest to me in real life? am I ever going to stumble across a job where playing Everquest is required?<br>
Fuck no I won't.. but it's hopelessly addictive and I've got nothing better to do with my life , or what life I have left.People I know<br>
often say , &quot; Get a life&quot;. As easy as that sounds , because you are born with a social status and modify it throughout your life, the <br>
fact that I am shy comes into play. I've pissed my life away and it's hard to rebuild one , the only real social interactment I have besides<br>
my parents and internet is when I go to the store , or when I have band practice. I often find myself drawing these pictures, it's the same <br>
picture always slightly modified , I start with the hair .. always greasy dark and long , I move down to the eyes clinched in pain with a nose<br>
crinkled up and a wide open jaw with teeth showing , screaming for life. I make my way down the  body and get to the ribs.. always the rib <br>
bones are exposed and drenched with blood with organs falling out and a severed spinal cord. What is this supposed to mean? am I that lonely<br>
that I look to violence to actually quench a thirst for human contact , or do I just have a knack for violent pictures and wish to satisfy<br>
myself with my own personlized violent depictions.I guess I really can't answer the question myself , I always feel different inside different<br>
From everyone else, when they see me .. what do they see? ... when I look into the mirror, do I see the same thing?It's all a matter of self<br>
confidence which I really don't have anymore after 10 years of public schooling.Another thing which bothers me emotionally is that people<br>
I meet claim to love me. &quot;I love you&quot; &quot;you know I love you , don't you&quot; Do they say this because they actually love me and care that much<br>
about me? , or , do they say it because they feel obligated to love me ? do they think if they say , &quot;I don't love you&quot;, that I will run off<br>
and commit suicide , or hate them for being insensitive for their rest of their long drawn out lives? If someone were to say &quot;I hate you&quot; would <br>
be completely different then saying &quot;I don't love you&quot; , the word &quot;love&quot; is thrown around to much in the world today and along comes with it<br>
and ugly mass of hate. As a child I was brought up a catholic , christians are not the most open people in the world , they will claim they<br>
have no problem with any other religions , but you know what they say behind closed doors . That their religion is the right religion that<br>
all the other religions are false worships.Even as I sit here at the ripe age of 18 I can say that I lost my faith , I lost my faith long <br>
ago...Especially after all the shit that I've gone through emotionally. I've witnessed a world event on television that will talk'd about in<br>
history books forever , the world trade center, the pentagon , and the pennsylvania incidents. Those people were killed in the name of god<br>
itself which leads to interesting view on things. More people have been killed in the name of god then anything else , in a bible jesus is<br>
depicted as a white man with long brown hair and a vandyke-esque facial hair thing going on. When in fact jesus was a jew and from the middle east<br>
meaning he was of olive skin , his hair was probably black , and he probably wasn't the son of god. And thats why he was killed.. with people<br>
doubting it like I am now , David Karesh claimed to be the lamb of god reincarnated , and Janet Reno had him killed .. this hasn't been<br>
proven really , you just know they set fire to that building of people who refused to come out in a petty attempt to get them to get scared and flee<br>
their compound. He was much like jesus in a way that no one believed him , so I ask you , whoever reads this , do you think it's possible.. 100's of <br>
years from now someone will believe David Karesh was actually the lamb of god and that he never died in that fire but rose to heaven to sit at god's <br>
side? I think it's highly possible , I would not be suprised if their was a religious cult &quot;ring&quot; right now he didn't already believe this.<br>
Alot of people tell me I need to see a &quot;shrink&quot; that I need emotional therapy and that I've definately got issues , everyone I know has issues ...<br>
even the most honor'd human being on the planet has an issue or two , it's human nature to have your problems , it's life. I refuse to pay someone<br>
70 dollars an hour to listen to me talk about shitty life for 2 hours everyday we meet , it's retarded to do when you can pick some other way to vent<br>
everything thats bothering you in life. Like how I am chooseing to write this journal right now , i'm venting frustration.But I'm not telling you what<br>
you should and shouldn't do , your problems are your problems and I choose to not get involved in with whatever your dealing with I've got enough<br>
dents to hammer out myself. This is really all I have to write for today , and all I will ever really discuss is how shitty my life is and how pointless<br>
some of things are that I do to entertain myself. <br>

<br>
It's interesting that your writing has such striking similarities to what was in mine.  Not the details, like the &quot;world trade center will be talked about in history class forever&quot; (although in the middle of my journal the Gulf War was going on...which will certainly be in the same paragraph as the WTC attack), Koresh or being raised Catholic, or even EQ.  However, all the angst, the questions about where my life was going, the disintegration of childhood beliefs...it's all in there.  I can say though, that I never once considered seeing a shrink, nor did anyone suggest that I see a shrink.  That has more to do with where I was raised than anything.  Shrink's don't make a lot of money where I come from, heh.  At the end of high school, there were two options that I considered at the time:  1) Join the military and/or travel and see the world, or 2) go to college and continue my education so that I could eventually get a good job and live comfortably.  In the end, my choice was a combination of both.  I got an AFROTC scholarship and was in that until my eyesight became too poor to ever have a chance of flying in the military (tooling around in an A-10 would have been awesome).  Dropped out of rotc, but stayed in college and eventually got a master's in elec. eng.  Thinking of that, it's kind of ironic where I work at now, heh.<br>
<br>
In the end, I never got over the troubles that I saw in that Journal.  I realized the future is never certain, and my beliefs in the world are different (but in some ways similar) to those of childhood.  Most importantly the angst is still there, perhaps more than it ever was.  However, what I did learn is how to control that angst, and make it work for me.  It became the core of my system of ethics, ensuring that I don't repeat the bullshit that I see go on around me, or turn into &quot;that guy&quot;.  Seems to work pretty good, imo.  Eventually you'll figure that out on your own.<br>
<br>
<br>
There's a saying that I like, it goes something like <br>
<br>
It's not the troubles you have in life that count, it's how you deal with them that matters. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143036">Nodda Duma</a> <br>

<br>
Sounds like you gotta lotta angst beeyotch.<br>
<br>
You should see a shrink.<br>
<br>
You can talk to the school nurse and they will put you in touch with someone who can give you some counciling.  You won't need to pay $70 for someone to listen to your issues.<br>
<br>
And a councilor would do more for you than just listen to your crybaby boo-hoo BS.<br>
<br>
They also provide you with some insight as to WHY you feel that way, and how to deal with those feelings when they come up again in your life.  And they may even provide you with some self esteem to realize that you are more than just the sum of your parents.<br>
<br>
If you don't find a way to resolve your anger my friend, you will be doomed by it for your entire life.  It's not pretty, and you may even act just like your parents when you have children, perpetuating the cycle of crap that you are in.<br>
<br>
It's human nature to have problems, yup.  It's not human nature to keep it battled up inside, or to think that they are not worth talking to someone about.<br>
<br>
But the most difficult step is the first one, and admitting that you need help is the first step, and not a sign of weakness, but the indication of intelligence, and the direction for the path of wisdom.<br>
<br>
Did I call you a beeyotch yet?  Beeyotch?<br>

It was over the stupidest shit, too.  I don't believe all that talk about dysfunctional families.  I doubt there's a family out there that's &quot;typical&quot;.  What's called dysfunctional is probably closer to the norm than most realize.  Anyhow, not sure if you'd call it a stage, per se.  More like a wanderlust and the first signs of a need to strike out on your own.  As for joining the military, that's a chance to get out and see the world (wanderlust).  You know you don't have to join the Army.  In fact I'd recommend against it.  Navy would be a good one, tho.  Lot of beautiful ports-of-call out there, esp. in the Mediterranean $$.  College is probably your best bet in the long run if you can hack it.  Sets you up to (eventually) do the things that you want to do.  Whatever the case may be, the most important thing I think is getting into a totally different environment and seeing what it's like.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks for the memories =) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143036">Nodda Duma</a> <br>

<br>
Get off your ass, turn off the computer, get a job at Taco Bell, run a mile or two, DO something. Join a club. Find NEW friends who aren't angst ridden and don't have any patience with it. Pretend you aren't depressed.<br>
<br>
Anything else is just self-indulgence. And it feels good sometimes to just wallow in it; but that's the easy way out. <br>
<br>
Oh, and as an aside, never ever ever tell hang your underwear out for people to see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usorbital.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorbital</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><br>Darwin's Motherfucking Advocate</br><font size=1>lil birdie says he still wets the bed =/ </font></br></span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 11:21:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3832.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/Weekly%20Grind/stealie_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Journal</span><hr size=1> I stole Teauvian's diary, here is a brief snipit:<br>
<br>
&quot;I secretly lust for Briyan's man root.  I don't know what these feelings are, but they are strong.  I can't explain it, but I ache to feel his pulsing man hood deep in the inner regions of my anal cavity, and then to reach between my legs and spank my pud whilst he doth rammeth me, makes me want to swallow him whole!  I can never tell him how I feel, i would be laughed at and ridiculed, I know I am not man enough for that, but Briyan is man enough for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
...there was more in Tea-bag's diary, but since it involved sex with farm animals, I figured I would respect the goat and not tell. <p><img src = "http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/newtag.gif""http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/New5.gif'></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujorlenrizzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jorlen Rizzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>no title</span><br>  Posts: 496<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/02 11:36:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3832.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> If we have too much spare time, or spend too much time doing nothing constructive (a la EQ) , I beleive we all start to &quot;think&quot; too much, and most of the time those thoughs are negative.

<br>
The only way I can keep myself &quot;sane&quot; is to keep myself occupied.  Get a job, join a gym, hang out with some friends, anything at all as long as you're not by yourself.  That's the key, for me at least.<br>
