<br>
I go AC first and foremost, followed by hp, then Str/Resists.<br>
<br>
Of course, some decisions are obvious, and I make them on a piece by piece basis.<br>
<br>
For example, a recent gear change I made:<br>
<br>
Blood Ember Gloves 16 AC (click-snare)<br>
Frosted Velium Gloves 15 AC 5 Stam 25 hp.<br>
<br>
That's about 47 hp for a level 55 hybrid for the cost of 1 ac.  If I could do that trade as much as I wanted, I'd just trash all my ac gear =)<br>
<br>
Especially with these big uber mobs, even hybrids need to look real hard at their hp.  A recent search I did showed that with the right gear I could add over 1k hp to my base.<br>
<br>
If I'm remembering correctly, I wear about 500 hp worth of gear atm, and can hit 4200 hp buffed, while keeping close to 1100 AC.  My ATK sucks though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udharh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dharh</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.aliendance.com/disco.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#993300>(2/5/01 9:14:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ;) </span><hr size=1> I have always been a proponent of AC. AC is God. However, there do come pieces of armor where you can say that a loss of 1 or 2 AC is definately worth the extra HP or stats. While I will always strive for ever higher AC, HP and STR are important secondary stats. Look at it this way, will 12 AC save you 112 HP, although I guess you could turn the table and say is 112 HP going to make you last longer in a fight then 12 AC? Maybe in the long run AC will be better, but with the talks of the 1100 AC soft cap maybe that 112 HP is much better. It all goes down to those epic fights, when the mob is smacking you for 600 a pop. If you've reached the 1100 then there seems to be a little leg room in what you can do with extra slots. Whatever makes you happy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukurk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(2/8/01 8:00:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Interesting...</span><hr size=1> Maybe Indocolite isn't so bad after all...decent resists and stats and I have ~1060 ac with no cobalt on.  I could probably get this very close to 1100 by shuffling around some gear like masks, cloaks and rings...and an epic weapon. :)<br>
<br>
As far as uber mobs go, I doubt your stats make much of a difference.  Its a crap shoot whether you die in 2 seconds or 20 seconds when mobs quad hit for 700 then go enraged.<br>
<br>
One rule of thumb has been use your HP gear for duels and AC gear for mobs.  While I did notice an improvement when my ac past 950 when hunting in Karnors when Kunark came out, I can't say I've noticed much of a difference at all from having ~1040 AC versus a buffed AC of 1140 with level 50 mobs.<br>

Make 4 level 1 warriors.  Warrior Abe is naked, Warrior Bob is in full banded, Warrior Chris is in full crafted, and Warrior Doug is in full Cobalt.  If you fight a Gnoll pup, Abe has a tough fight and the other three have equally easy fights.  Anything above banded is total gravy.  Probably anything above full leather is totally unessesary.  Now you go and fight a lvl 3 Wolf and Abe gets mauled, Bob has a tough fight and Chris and Doug are still fine.  Go fight a lvl 4 Wolf and this time only Doug wins the fight.  Go fight a lvl 7 Gnoll and all four of them die horribly.  It doesn't matter at a certain point because your level difference and the mobs attack is so much higher than your defense that you are all going to die.<br>
<br>
This scales up to lvl 60.   If you are fighting in Sebilis vs. lvl 46 to 50 mobs then anything above 1100 or so AC isn't really all that important.  You might as well go for AC gear.  When I fight lvl 57 Juggs there is a big difference between 1100 and 1250.  So, if you are grinding exp in sebilis then go for more HP, and if you are deeper in one of the higher dungeons like sirens grotto, then go for AC.  I have all sorts of resist, hp, and ac gear on me and I tailor my equipment for the encounter I am facing.<br>

The only times I've gone for more health are on raids where numerous people are there to take the hits.  Take for instance the Queen in Chardok.  If getting pummeled by her melee, it's few and far between the majority of the time, but well within a cleric's healing range.  It's that nasty AoE that takes ya down, so I go for more health.  When it comes time for the king, it's back to AC gear.  Of course, without a Shammie there to add about 500 health it would have been a different story, hehe.<br>

If you have a higher AC, then the amount of damage will be less than with a lower AC.  Hence, ya wont need as many HP's.  So in my opinion and my experience, AC is the ultimate measure.  HP is nice of course, but the higher AC the less need ya have for HP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uthoggdlogg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThoggDlogg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg!</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#993300>(2/11/01 11:47:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /grin</span><hr size=1> kurk indocilite gloves = from god.<br>
<br>
no way i give up the hit points for the ac from even beserkers wich is only  40 hp less <br>
<br>
you have to look at the big picture u may loose decent ac but you have to look at where can i add the most hp .<br>
<br>
ok say you lost 14 ac with the indico gloves  but you gain 90 hp man. add to that the fact that OK fine u could wear say a 20 19 ac bracer with no hp or a 15 ac won with 2o wear the two 19 ac bracers and u made up for what you lost on the gloves and u still ended up with more hp its a juggling act.<br>
<br>
i hae about 3 full suites worth of armor on me<br>
<br>
1 hp gear 3489 hp no bufs<br>
<br>
2 resist geear 130 + in every resist with no bufs. <br>
<br>
3. ac i have 1200 + ac i can hit when i duel wield a pair of sword breakers and put all my gear on but i drop to 2959 hp.<br>
<br>
ROFL to fumin you just put it in some what perspective to what it realy is.<br>
<br>
FUnny thing is your one of the morons who said i was stupid for the gear choices i made and screamed ac is king for the last year.<br>
<br>
at levlel 60 war with all my skills there are NO exp type or normal raid type mobs &lt; juggs included &gt; that the diference from 1100 ac to 1300 makes more then a 2 % damage taken diference.<br>
<br>
You fight a mob that is level 65+ 1100 or 1400 ac is gona be under a 1 % less diferance in damage taken i know ive checked. While u can gaine as much as 10 % more hp its simple math as to wich is a better imrpovement.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW ignore fumin hes a ranger who quit his ranger and bought a ebay warrior after i whoped him silly in duels after a two week dick waveing contest where he swore no war could beat a ranger in a duel.<br>
<br>
this is end game where the stats of the mob are so far above what you ever saw before and the returns of ac are diminisheing to the point that hit points provide a much better return for your investment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
END game it has come down to finite resources and how much to you gian as a bonus.<br>
<br>
OK well i gain 400 hp i jsut gained a 9 % increas in my total hp allowing me to take 9% more damage. as a efect of this i also live longer.<br>
<br>
at my level to take 9 % less damage i would need 1600 ac IF the increases remain linear from 1100 to 1300 then to 1600 from 1300  it woudl require 1600 ac to give me that same 9 % better tanking ability.<br>
<br>
Of course i dont put it into these terms and to a calculation every time i see a item i just look at it and make a judgement call as to if its worth it. <br>
<br>
I think my stats and ability to tank as well as my toe to toe dueling prove that i make good calls.<br>
