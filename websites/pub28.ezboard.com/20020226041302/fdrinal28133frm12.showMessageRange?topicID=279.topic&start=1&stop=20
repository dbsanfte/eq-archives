<br>
<br>
I was reading Spin magazine, when I came across this article about laws that are being passed for sex offenders.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now...this stems from like pedophiles, to rapists, and others that involve sexual acts.<br>
<br>
What they are doing, is if you are convicted of a sex crime...no matter what it is, they take, and put your name and picture up on the internet with what sex crime you were charged with FOR LIFE.<br>
<br>
i mean damn! A sex crime can be anything....lets say you get the wrong signals from a girl/guy, and you make a mistake...I mean shit...slap him/her, cuss at em or somthing...but this is a little harsh.<br>
<br>
As for the pedophiles, and intentional rapists and stuff....they can do that to em...people need to be warned about scum like them.<br>
<br>
by intentional rapists....someone who goes out looking to rape someone...not some 18 yearold that gets drunk, and sleeps with a girl under 16 because 1) he's drunk, and 2) he doesn't know she's 15.<br>
<br>
NOT only that...but <br>
<br>
If it's a serious enough crime, they could be forced to place a sign on their car, and infront of their yard, that says &quot;DANGER, Registered sex offender lives here&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now...I dunno about you...but if I was forced to have that infront of my yard, and on my car....I'd shoot myself probably within a month, if not that...within a year for sure.<br>
<br>
The biggest shock I think was when this 12 year old got placed on the list, because a neighbor spotted him &quot;rubbing&quot; his fully clothed body against his younger sister....there wasn't any cleaner way to say that....now exactly what that picture looks like, I dunno.<br>
<br>
Now...it's possible that the kid was a freak, and had the hots for his sister....but the kids 12. Anyways....it said that he got put on that internet list, along with 68 other kids under the age of 18. and undreds more from other states...<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that people shouldn't be warned about that sort of thing...but take this as an example....a 17 year old boy goes to a party...there's drinks there, and him and this girl get drunk, and get freaky....girl finds out she's pregnant, and the guy finds out she's not 16 yet....CONGRATS SON...you've been charged with rape!...And I think rape would be a serious enough crime to put that sign on your car, and infront of your yard.<br>
<br>
<br>
The main thing here, is that I think people should be aware of what he's/she did in the past...but I don't think he/she should have to be labled that every single day for the rest of his life, for one mistake he/she made at a party when they were 17.<br>

<br>
Strange, though, the other day I was EXTREMELY bored out of my mind and ended up watching &quot;Weird Science&quot; from start to finish.  I never noticed it before, but that show has blatant pedophilia in it almost from the beginning.  The babe in the show is well in excess of 18 (sorry drawing a blank on her name now, she played Lisa, the &quot;created&quot; girl) and the two main characters are 15 and 16 years of age.  The movie makes a point of stating their ages twice, just to make sure that we get the point that they are barely out of adolescence.<br>
<br>
Now Lisa takes a shower with them (she was naked, they weren't), engages in some pretty steamy tongue twisting with both of them, and spends a great portion of the rest of the show in sexual innuendo and revealing clothing.  One of the male characters (15 year old) is shown in a couple of scenes wearing women's underwear, and when he gets out of bed at one point, the camera gives a close up of these panties riding up his ass (uggg).<br>
<br>
Anyway, as much as I would have loved to have been in their shoes (sans the female underwear) at the age of 15 or 16.... hell or 18 or 19 for that matter....the fact of the matter is, believe it or not, &quot;Weird Science&quot; has scenes showing pedophilia.  Maybe not &quot;hardcore&quot; stuff, but still. <br>
<br>
Kinda weird how pedophilia with an adult female and male &quot;children&quot; could make it to the screen; but, I wonder if the movie would have been released if the roles were reversed and we had an adult male and female children in it?<br>
<br>
Like I said, I was really bored.<br>

Plain and simple, I can't put that any other way. <br>
<br>
As far as your drinking situation, that's why you should always be aware and have some idea as to whom you're hanging out with and the surroundings. I have had many underage people at some point in time ask me to buy them alcohol, I would simply refuse. If I had a party and someone showed up I didn't know they were not permitted to stay, it's as simple as that. I don't need some spoiled brat coming to a bash I am throwing who is underage and ruining the night for the rest of us if the police would happen to investigate and find out there was a minor there drinking and it was at who's house? *After all we stagehands/roadies/managers like our music LOUD!* That makes you responsible and that's why I enforce these  rules at parties, and my beliefs on underage drinking, I simple don't tollerate it myself. They set an age for a reason, heck I see most adults who are to irresponsible to even be drinking let alone some 15 year old child.<br>
<br>
Yes I know many don't agree with me there, but the fact is it's the law and like it or not, if you break it and you get caught that's your own stupidity. People and alcohol/drugs just don't mix. As far as alcohol, most have no comprehension of their limit and they keep going and going, I often wonder do they realize just how stupid and what asses they make of themselves when their at that state? Obviously they don't or they would learn to control their habbits. The same can be said for drugs, pfft. I don't need artifical things injected into my body to have a good time, it's the surroundings that can create a fun time, nice lighting, mood music and good friends do wonders.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uskarlspeedbump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skarl Speedbump</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/01 10:39:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: yeah!</span><hr size=1> Howdy! I caught this topic and could not resist posting a comment.  I work with the Adolescent and Adult Sex offender population and I have worked with them for approximately 2 years now.  I am by no means an expert and do receive supervision for my work with them, and have co-chaired several sex abuse groups.  I am licensed as a Psychologist and have done probably 30 to 50 sex offender specific evaluations.  <br>
<br>
With regards to the internet laws in the country I am surprised with the fact you found in a magazine that states that adolescents are forced to report to internet registration.  I would like to know which state they force adolescents to register.  This is an interesting statement.<br>
<br>
With the statement about children that &quot;rub up against other children&quot; story I would also like to comment.  I would caution that there is a double standard in society about what parents and care givers of adolescent sex offenders tell the media and what the therapists that treat the sex offender can tell the media.  For example, I once worked with an adolescent that raped his younger sister and his parents did not own or hold the child responsible for his abusive behavior.  I could see these parents going to any newspaper and saying what a complete bastard I am for harassing their child in treatment for treating their child for &quot;touching&quot; their daughter.  Is this an accurate reflection of what happened? NO.  Can a therapist tell what the investigative materials revealed or what truly happened? NO.  Clients are protected by laws of confidentiality. In other words, anyone can go and tell the media anything, but therapists, probation officers are bound by confidentiality, This is a good law, IMO but has some slight pifalls as I am mentioning now.  In summary, if a parent or person gives their side to the news...be wary and wonder what the mental health professional may say IF the client gave consent to speak to the media.  Ever wonder why the local School/mental health agency/public health agency/Department of Social Services doesn't comment?  Because they can't with the person's consent.  Would you give consent to someone who has embarrassing info on you? hehe bet not. <br>
<br>
Thorsen, your input is right on and you are very insightful.  You could not believe how damaging the effect so abuse are upon young male children and adolescents and in my opinion, female offenders get off scott free, which is a complete double standard.  Believe me, an adolescent male that is sexually abused by a adult can have pervasive problems due to the abuse.  Examples are distorted views of women in general, sexual dysfunction etc.  <br>
<br>
Good topic guys...dunno why its in the flames...and I hope I don't get flamed too bad by responding...I just enjoy a good topic.<br>

While it has been a while, I can still remember being 18 years old.  I can also remember dating a 16 year old girl when I was 18.  I can also remember her being FAR more sexually aggressive than me (thank God).  Anyway, the law can construe any sex between an 18 and a 16 year old as rape, whether it is &quot;consensual&quot; or not.  Should I, at 18, have been an &quot;adult&quot; and stayed away from any sexual relationship with a 16 year old &quot;child&quot;?  The law says so.  I can guarantee you though that at 18 I wasn't near as &quot;mature&quot; or &quot;emotionally developed&quot; or whatever word you want to use, as that 16 year old &quot;girl&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think that we as a society have, out of our justifiable fear, taken the laws to an extreme.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think that rapists and pediophiles should most definately have their actions published.  I think that the citizenry of the area where they live should be informed.  I think that we can not go too far in protecting others from people who sexually prey on others because case study after case study has shown that sexual depravity is almost &quot;incurrable&quot;.  Pediophiles remain pediophiles, in most cases.  Rapists tend to commit other rapes.  With this kind of history, put their picture at the front of their house with a listing of every act they have committed.  Make them report to counseling.  Put the information on the internet. Do whatever needs to be done to keep other people safe.<br>
<br>
But, I think we need to take a look at the &quot;fringe&quot; of these laws.  Do we sentence the 18 year old in the above paragraph to jail?  Should the 12 year old child in Doofy's post be sentenced as an adult and face the same castigating effects that an adult would face for the rest of his life?<br>
<br>
I'm am by far no &quot;bleeding heart liberal&quot; folks.  If I had to categorize myself I would consider myself a died in the wool social and political conservative.  I do think that their are consequences to one's actions and that you must pay the piper.<br>
<br>
I also think that at times allowances must be made in the name of justice.<br>
<br>
Not to change the subject, but to show where I agree with Boofy's post as well as to show where our laws do not always agree with logic; take a look at our national stance on drug use.<br>
<br>
Alcohol and tobacco, two of the top reasons for unnatural death in our society, are legal and, in some ways, protected.  Marijuana, a safer drug than both of the above, is illegal.  I can tell you this folks, I would much rather someone smoke a &quot;big fat one&quot; and then get behind the wheel of a car, than for someone to have a few drinks and do the same.  I'm not advocating drug use and driving here, by the way, just making a statement to prove a point.  Our society has accepted two terrible killers as allowable drug use, but has made illegal the use of another drug that has less harmful effects (and some would argue beneficial effects in moderation).<br>
<br>
The arguement against marijuana is that it is a &quot;gateway&quot; drug.  My God, what do you call alcohol?  Or tobacco?  Or those painkillers prescribed by your doctor?  Any drug is,or can be, a gateway drug.  What matters isn't the drug, but the individual taking the drug.  Things such as social standing, parental influence, environment, moral judgements, peer pressure, personality and also genetics, play a part in determining whether or not someone is going to do a drug, or become addicted to a drug.<br>
<br>
The government should immediately legalize marijuana.  Allow the tobacco companies to grow and process it.  Tax the shit out of it.  And reduce the tax burden on those of us who carry too much of it, the middle-class.<br>
<br>
That won't be done though, simply because of our fear as a society.  The same fear that pushed us to have our lawmakers make laws that put children in danger of being listed as rapists or sexual deviants.  One day, we are simply going to legislate ourselves into slavery.<br>
<br>
Hell, maybe we already have.<br>

Let me fill you in on some of the laws that most states favor.  If you are 18 and dating a girl that is 16, you aren't breaking the law.  Most laws carry a statue that cover the &quot;under 18&quot; element dating the &quot;over 18 element&quot;.  For example a 16 year old could date someone 3 years older for example and it is not a prosecutable offense...not illegal in other words.  <br>
Furthermore, adolescents that offend against other children, typically have to be 3 or more years older than the victim to be construed as abusive, and several factors must be weighted (intelligence level, developmental level, onset of puberty) its a process believe me.  These are common statutory rape and indecent liberties between children statutes.  <br>
<br>
I hope that clears up some misunderstandings<br>
<br>
Again, I don't know of any states that require adolescents to register for any kind of manditory disclosure about sexual offending.  I would like to know of the states that do, as I would be shocked.  This goes against the whole idea that adolescents are malliable and can be rehabilitated much more easily than adults.  In other words, Adult sex offender = hard as hell to treat, adolescent sex offender = Positive treatment outcomes and best, most hopefull population to treat IMO.<br>
<br>
No comment on the marijuana argument, I wanna keep my job :)<br>
<br>
In summary, you didn't break the law when you was 18 bro, now smokin the sticky bud, however IS against the law.<br>

<br>
I did date a 17 year old when I was 21.  It didn't last too long, fortunately.  Yes, I said fortunately.  Although physically she had to be the most beautiful creature I have ever dated, she was evil to the core.  I mean this woman gives original sin a bad name.  Not only did her parents know that I was dating her, but her father was happy as a clam, because this time she was dating someone who was &quot;decent&quot;.  I don't know how the law works in that situation, but I do know that if it is illegal, then it shouldn't be.<br>
<br>
Once again, I just want to show my agreement with part of Doofy's post, in that our laws tend to put &quot;children&quot; into a situation that a law can be &quot;technically&quot; violated by a person who is in a consensual relationship.<br>

As strange as it may seem to some of you (and to me as well), I know of a gentleman (now in his late 70's) who married his wife when she was 15 and he was 26.  They are still married to this day, and I have seen very few married couples as devoted to each other as they are. <br>
<br>
Laws are strange things.<br>
<br>
If they were &quot;dating&quot; today society and our laws would castigate them (hell, I would as well).  Just goes to show that there isn't a &quot;magic&quot; age at which we can say, &quot;there goes an adult.  That person can now engage in sexual activities with other adults.&quot;<br>
<br>
But we do assign a magic age, and I am sure that Skarl is right; there are some rules and formula that is used to see if there is a violation of the law.  I'm just glad the morality police didn't pick me up when I was dating that 17 year old, and I'm glad that I met that 16 year old when I was 18, instead of a couple of years later.<br>

Which, imo, is a bit odd.  There is no difference between a 17 and an 18 year old, yet at 18 you magically transform to a legal adult.  Which makes me think of something else extremely fucked up.  At 18 a person is old enough to go to prison or be drafted into the service where they're able to kill other people YET they are not responsible enough to drink? WTF is that?  I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.  I am an 18 year old myself, and I don't drink much at all, but I find it incredibly stupid that I can be charged as an adult, I can go to war and kill another human being, I can buy porn, I can vote yet I have to wait another 3 years before I can legaly consume an alcoholic beverage.  All these restrictions end up backfiring and create more kids that drink heavily at earlier ages than would if it weren't something &quot;forbidden&quot; <br>
There is no reason drugs like marijuana should be illegal.  All our country's harsh drug laws do is overcrowd the prisons, make the mob rich, and promote crime.  But I don't see it being legalized because people are so uptight.  They don't mind their kids getting hooked on cigarettes but, man, pot is fucking evil.<br>

He was 13 years old when the &quot;rape&quot; happened.   Assault charges were not listed as his crimes so I think it is more than likely it was more a case of sexual experimentation than forced rape.  While I certainly wouldnt want my daughter having sex at that age, sexual urges do start around then if not before.   Human nature conflicts with the law sometimes but another child should not be labeled for his entire life based any act short of murder or something exceptionally brutal.<br>

We cannot pass judgements on whether or not these crimes are really as minor as some would make them seem.  The fact is, the crimes were committed and the person was found guilty, so they should be forced to live with the shame of their act.  <br>
<br>
I myself do not have any children, but I do not want a convicted child molester or sex offender living anywhere near me, children or no children.  That is just not the type of person I want in my neighborhood. <br>
<br>
That being said, the case can and should be made for having an age cap on these penalties.  I do not think most kids 14 and under really have any idea of what they are doing.  If it is a case of a forced assault or rape and it is proven as such, then they should be forced to live with this over their head.  If it is a consensual, yet age induced rape or assault then that is a major difference, and believe me, they do know the difference in our court system and can dole out fitting punishments.<br>
<br>
The fact is many parents will back their children and downplay the event.  In their eyes they do not believe their child could have committed such a crime, and they always believe it will never happen again.  Unfortunately, the public needs to be protected from these ignorant cases.<br>
<br>
As for the Marijuana argument.  Lets see, since it is not quite so bad as alcohol or smoking in number of deaths caused, lets just unleash it on the public.  Nice idea.  Brilliant.  I am an anti-government liberal and I still see nothing positive in making this legal.<br>
<br>
Have you ever thought people don't die as often due to marijuana induced accidents because fewer people smoke it since it is illegal.  Can't wait until one of you that backs making it legal has a kid, girlfriend, wife or whatever killed by some hallucinating fool on the road that thinks the victim was a target they had to run over to get an extra bonus to their car or something.  <br>
<br>
No, marijuana is not a heavy duty hallucinogen, but most people smoking marijauna are also consuming alcohol at the same time.  If you think wither one is bad by itself, imagine when the effects are layered on top of one another. <br>
<br>
As for it being helpful, and relieving anxienty and depression.  There are many other ways to do this without endangering the non-losers of society who have to rely on drugs to cope with their problems.  I say ... GET A DOG!!!  FIND YOUR FAITH!!!  GO SKYDIVING!!!  <br>
<br>
Do any of those and you generally aren't risking hurting anyone else.  Any kind of argument you can put up for marijuana is good other than the use of hemp in clothing and fabrics is total BS.  It's like the stupid tobacco companies saying that cigarettes are actually helping the public because cancer kills off so many people it keeps medicaid and social security costs down.

<br>
Hey there!  You prolly dont remember me but you helped me and a friend get our Seb Keys one night.   Your a hell of a Ranger. <br>
<br>
That outta the way I would agree that in the case of minors committing brutal crimes they should be dealt with severely.  However it is really hard to apply adult morality to someone only 13 years old.  It scares me to think that they can be branded for life for anything short of murder.  Although our justice system only pays lip service to rehabilitation there is such a thing, and the young have the best shot at it.<br>
<br>
Secondly, sex with a minor itself is a crime.  Consenting or not.  I would hate to think that this guy had consentual sex at 13 and got pegged with Megan's Law for the rest of his life.  I understand &quot;consentual sex&quot; is a possible oxymoron when applied to 13 year olds, but the fact is at that age its possible that both were willing partners.   The lack of any assault charges leads me to think that in any case it wasn't forced sex. Although those charges are often excluded from rape trials since they sometimes happen way after the fact and there is no evidence.  It was also my understanding that crimes committed before you were 18 were kept in a sealed file, with access to those files only under specific circumstances and for purposes of trial. <br>
<br>
And as for pot.  Man Talas, it is so common it boggles my mind.  I hold myself to the legal drugs of beer and cigarettes but when I think of how many people I know who smoke pot it makes me laugh at all the anti-marjijauna education they put us thru in school.   With very few exceptions everyone I know has tried it more than once.   Most will still smoke it on social occasions if its offered, even though they are not regular users.   It is not as commonly used as beer and tobacco but it is FAR closer to it than any other drug out there.   I have never even heard of a fight or accident cause by pot consumption.   I honestly believe it to be a pretty harmless drug if usage occurs after 21.   And 20% of my states crowded prisons are housing folks that are there for pot related charges.  Waste of prison space if you ask me.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt mind it if they legalized it.  But honestly from what I have seen of pot, I don't understand why people seem to think its this awful drug.   If most of the people supporting its legalization weren't heavy users and presented a more dignified front to the media, that probably wouldnt hurt either.  <br>

<br>
Have to admit I used to think everyone I knew used it.  But maybe that was just the people I was around at the time.  Due to job changes and moving and such I was forced to get out and meet new people, and suffice it to say, as I moved up in job importance my choices of friends must have also changed.  None of my current close friends smokes it, and quite honestly I now only know one or two people that do.<br>
<br>
Sadly, the friends I used to hang out with back in college still smoke it, and most of them are still in college, or pretending to be.  Marijuana isn't causing them to fail, I realize that, but I do vividly remember many weeks when some of my roomies wouldn't leave the house for school and would call in sick to work just so they could sit around and get high.  For some people that may sound like fun, but it grew old on me in a hurry. <br>
<br>
The most fortunate thing I have found about Marijuana, is due to its illegal status, most people only smoke pot at home or something they can sleep without having to try and get home.  I think that is one thing keeping accidents down.  How many of your friends smoke pot and then go driving home right after.  If it became legal, I could imagine seeing people smoking it at bars or having a quick one after work to deal with the stress of traffic and then driving home.  My humble, seemingly worthless opinion on this is, that folks smoking pot freely scares the crap out of me because their are just one too many idiots out there who can't control themselves.  Unfortunately, this means those who use marijuana in tehir own home are subject to the same law.<br>
<br>
The way the law stands now, marijuana IS basically legal in your own home, providing you are doing anything suspicious.  In all my years I have known at least a few dozen people who smoke it and none of them has ever been arrested for it.  Lets face it, unless you are doing something really stupid, the police generally don't bother you anyhow.  Heck, we used to throw parties all the time back in school and had music blaring and everything and never once did we see a cop.  I mean, you have to really go out of your way most of the time.  <br>
<br>
So basically, we have a law that is not heavily enforced on the majority of the population.  If it were it would be different.  My original point was to show how silly it was to say since one or two things that kill people are legal, then we should allow another, even if it isn't quite as bad.  Hmmm.  Something is just wrong with that logic.  <br>
<br>
Let me think (SARCASM ALERT), handguns are still legal (as they should be in my opinion), so lets make other killing items legal.  Heck, very few people die from hand grenades each year, why not legal them.  That would probably help to enforce the &quot;Stay right except to pass&quot; laws that most Interstates have that so many left lane hogs ignore.  So, in a way, all those folks dying from shrapnel would benefit society!!!  Yeah, I like it.  Actually the sad thing is I actually like this idea to a certain extent.<br>

Taxing the shit out of it.  And lowering my taxes.<br>
<br>
I am familiar enough with the &quot;drug&quot; to know that it is relatively harmless, is not a main cause of death in the U.S. (although recent government estimates state that nearly 70% of adults reported smoking it at least once, and almost 20% are considered &quot;regular&quot; users).  Why do I state that it is &quot;relatively harmless&quot;.  Well simply put, one of the few serious studies done on marijuana was performed by the British Medical Association (BMA) and two books written on the subject.  To sum it all up for you, the study came to the conclusion that there were no discernable negative affects to marijuana users, even those who were considered heavy users and have been smoking it for years.<br>
<br>
The only way you will ever get me to change my mind on legalizing marijuana is to show me unbiased evidence that the use of it is detrimental to society and to the users.  Don't tell me it is a gateway drug.  Don't give me personal anticdotes and urban legend wrapped around government slogans.<br>
<br>
Show me the proof.<br>
<br>
Until then, I will continue to believe what I see as an exhaustive study performed by the BMA; and, I, a non-user, will continue to state that we should legalize this highly used blackmarket drug, and stop putting 700,000 people a year into our prisons on marijuana related charges.<br>
<br>
Please look up all these numbers folks.  By doing so, you will find that I am right on the money on the number of &quot;regular&quot; users in the U.S., the BMA's findings, and the number of people that we pay to have locked up each and every year on marijuana charges.  In the process of looking up all my numbers, you might even throw out some of the mindless hogwash that we as a society are brainwashed into believing by our government.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as a final comment, if someone is smoking marijuana and driving....throw the book at them.  That is the same as drinking and driving and I don't have any pity for anyone caught in a DUI/DWI state.  Personally, I think the laws we have on the books for DUI/DWI are way to lenient, but that is a topic for another discussion.<br>

Several of my friends have done that very thing.  They smoke it at a party and drive home.  Driving under the influence of marijuana is actually less dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol (note I am not saying either should be done).  Both are INCREDIBLY stupid, yes, and just because I believe it should be a legal drug doesn't mean I think people should go driving under it's influence.  Alcohol is legal, drunk driving isn't, so do the same thing with pot and that solves the whole problem you seemed to have with it being legal.<br>
I do not smoke pot, but I think the drug laws are a bit harsh.  We're talking about a substance that's slightly worse than tobacco.  You can get stuff 2x worse than pot from your neighborhood pharmacy.<br>
Why do I think it should be legal?<br>
Well, as Thorsen said, they could tax the crap out of it and maybe put it to good use.  Even with high taxes, legal pot would be much cheaper than it is now. <br>
Also the real criminals (the mob, big time dealers, whoever else) won't be making as much money if one of the more commonly used drugs was made readily available.  <br>
<br>
And I wouldn't just stop with marijuana, but that's another argument.<br>

<br>
Hell yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think there should be an age restriction on when you can purchase it....but I don't think it should be illegal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why is it illegal?<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The police agencies make shit loads of money off of busting:<br>
<br>
a) people selling it<br>
b) people buying it<br>
c) people smoking it<br>
d) people growing it<br>
<br>
<br>
But shit...what do we hear in the music today? Every other rap song has a refrence to weed, or coke in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's about as fucked up as Denver is....Listen to this.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's illegal to shoot of fire works in Denver, but not illegal to sell any.<br>
<br>
<br>
on the 4th of july, DPD grossed like $250,000 off of fire works tickets. It just shows you how fucked up the city is. I bet you the government was even selling the fireworks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like was said earlier....Weed is so common it's not even funny. You can go to any state, any city, and chances are if you walk down the street, you'll run into someone who can hook you up with some weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and that comment about hitting cars for extra points cause your stoned off your ass....<br>
<br>
<br>
well, i dunno what kinda weed your smokin, but marajuana doesn't do that.<br>
<br>
At least not unless you smoke a blunt the size of a redwood tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Marajuana is like 200 times more dangerous than cigaretts.&quot;<br>
<br>
yeah....but how many cigaretts does a person smoke each day? <br>
<br>
I've seen people go through packs in a single day. and the average weed smoker will smoke 1 joint a day...many times sharing with another person, or a group of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Weed being addictive....<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, here's something I agree on. I think weed is very addictive....about as addictive as cigarettes. My brother once walked a mile in like 2ft snow just to get some....the roads were closed, and everyone was off from school...him and his friend wanted some, and they tried for 2 hours to find someone who had some...then spent another 2 hours walking to get it, and walking back.<br>
<br>
Weed messing with metality.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree here....Weed is bad for the the personality....A person who smokes weed will be fine, when they aren't smoking weed, nothing really seems to matter to them. They have mood swings, and if things aren't going well, they get pissed off easier than they would if they werent on weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My overall view of weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) weed is good for social situations much like alcohol is....It can make tense situations more relaxing....alot of this is due to people passing the blunt/pipe =)....*its easier to say you wanna take a hit, rather than hi...my name is* Plus, you don't look stupid if they reject your offer ;)*<br>
<br>
2) smoking weed should be used on an occasional basis, and not for every day life.<br>
<br>
3) weed makes funny movies VERY FUNNY.<br>
<br>
4) doing weed all the time can fuck up your life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm no expert on weed, but I have been in contact with it for probably a good 3rd of my life. It isn't by any means this wonderful thing that should be done during church. But it's not as bad as TV comercials, and school programs make it up to be.<br>
<br>
Weed is the gateway drug....this is true, it can lead into different things if someone isn't careful, and knowleged about it....that's why it should have an age restriction.<br>
<br>
My brother started doing weed his Sophmore year...He then tried shrooms...which i guess he never really liked, because I never saw him do it....unlike weed, which I saw him do all the time. He told me he even did Acid once.....which freaked me out, cause that's one of the &quot;bad&quot; drugs. But he said he did it once, and never wanted to try it again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm gonna say just a little more because I've already forgot what I wrote at the beginning hehe...and chances are no one will read this far anyways. So...to end this off, Lemmie sumarize what I wanted the main things to be said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sumary:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Most drugs are bad. coke...acid....heroin*sp?*<br>
<br>
2) Weed isn't any worse and Cigarettes/beer.<br>
<br>
3) no one has ever died from a direct result of Weed. IE...lung cancer/overdose.<br>
<br>
4) Weed doesn't make you see shit....it makes you relax, and makes you laugh.<br>
<br>
5) weed is good for social gatherings, but not everyday life.<br>
<br>
6) the only reason weed gets you into trouble, is because the law prohibits it. <br>
<br>
7) the law only prohibits it, because they make money busting you with it.<br>
<br>
8) weed can mess with your mentality through withdrawl....which is pretty much the same as cigarettes/beer.....if your an addict on beer or cigarettes, and you try to quit after being addicted...you'll act the same way.<br>
<br>
<br>

I've never seen any of these reports or statistics.  All I have to go on is what I've seen with my own two eyes.  Out of all the friends I can think of that smoked or still smoke pot, some never went on to college, the rest dropped out or are still in after ~9 years.  Only one; my brother, who went from heavy usage to none at all about 3 years ago, has anything resembling a decent job which thankfully pays him good money and provides him the means to support himself and his family.  Among the same group of people that the above are a part of, all of my friends, myself included, who didn't smoke pot graduated college and went on to live comfortably in good-paying careers.<br>
<br>
With this past experience, I'm of the opinion that they should legalize the stuff.  The more people who do it means less job competition and greater job security for people like me.<br>

With anything in the world, people can find ways to abuse it, or become addicted to it.  Look at on-line games as an example; who would have thought that some people would lose control of themself by playing an internet game?  We can't manage or legislate to the lowest common denominator.  We have to look at what is best for the majority, while ensuring that we are not placing the minority in an untenable position.<br>
<br>
As an example, look at the countries that have legalized marijuana.  There are no discernable negatives to their society, even though you could point out isolated cases where it was harmful.<br>
<br>
I still stand by my original position.  Until someone does a more exhaustive, impartial review of the affects of marijauna on people in general and society as a whole, I will continue to state that it should be legalized and taxed to hell and back.<br>
