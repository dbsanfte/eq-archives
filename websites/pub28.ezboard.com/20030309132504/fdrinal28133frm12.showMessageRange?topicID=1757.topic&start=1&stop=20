Well, then it's petitionable.  Harrassment is against Verant's policy.  You got what you deserved.<br>
<br>
Remember when CiH kill-stole Ragefire from Reeko?  He sent you some tells.  You &quot;little babies&quot; decided to &quot;hide behind a GM's skirt&quot; and got the &quot;GM involved in something so trivial&quot; and petitioned him for those tells.  He got suspended for one week.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying he didn't deserve it - Reeko told us what he said, and I agree it was way out of line.  But y'all seem just as eager to use the /petition feature as Accursed was.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think EQ should be a pleasant experience, not a place where people send me tells &quot;with the sole intent of irritation&quot;.  I'm glad the GM's support a policy of non-harrassment.  It makes for a much better environment to play the game in.<br>

u accuse me of wrecklessly training people in the grey when i havent ever hit one person with a train.  only a few times has someone been near entrance to ssra that ive had to FD in which no one was ever hit by a train.  u start this by attacking me on that thread saying i have no concern for anyone else when in fact if u knew me ud know that to not be the case.  go back and check out the thread again there were 100 other people including some of your own guildmembers whose posts about training ssra were far worse than mine but u chose to pick out mine cuz of ur need to feed ur ego that ur mr. uber monk.  was kinda funny when the gm in emp room was saying casban for president but since a monk was mentioned and it wasnt u, sslithisik says in /ooc some shit about &quot;ya casban is soo uber, and umm juukak who is casban anyways?&quot; or something to that effect. bet that just killed you seeing a gm not recognizing ur uberness.<br>
harassing people in tells is wrong and annoying and you should have known to stop when i ignored u the previous 3 tells.  sorry but im not gonna have a shouting match in tells with u on who can call each other the worst name.  u belong in cih as they are a bunch of immature assholes for the mostpart with the exception of a few.  you claim the ogre wall to be just a joke well i seriously doubt the people that died from falling thru the wall for 10k thought it was too funny one of which was a cleric.  it was a stall tactic and it worked well. it took about another 5-10 minutes to get everyone thru the wall which gave you more time to coh more people up and made us minus a cleric and another person.  it was childish and dumb and whoever called in the GM was right in doing so.<br>
<br>
your website updates are pathetic and its sad ur guild flames people on the front of a webpage where they have no chance to defend themselves.  all the bullshit u post about not understanding how we could leap frog u into the emperors room is laughable as well as yall calling us babies for getting a GM involved.  theres been several posts such as monuals where yall have called in GMs as well.  leap frogging? uve been around longer than i have and plenty long enough to know that sufficient force and engaging is what is required to get a mob not camping 12 afk people in ogre form in the mobs room.  we for the most part dont race people and have very few confrontations with other guilds, but i think in this case it was necessary to move on thru since u had like 20 when we had in the 50s.  so feel free to post away but i dont suppose ill be getting anymore tells from you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~kameron.alexander/Copy_of_tonguething.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373838">Brother Accursed</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> 63 Iksar Grandmaster <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.winters-light.com">Winter's Light</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ismaeldf>IsmaelDF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/02 9:36:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1757.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Accursed sicks GM on cooler lizard :)</span><hr size=1> /cheer Accursed <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82416"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jaddesign.com/unconquered/Ismael.jpg" style="border:0;"alt="Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?/"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sslithissik>Sslithissik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 628<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/10/02 9:38:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1757.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/thal/images/snakeskin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Accursed sicks GM on cooler lizard :)</span><hr size=1> &amp;#61656; It was sent with sole intent of irritation. <br>
<br>
Well, then it's petitionable. Harrassment is against Verant's policy. You got what you deserved.<br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; Sure its petitionable. So is everytime someone says anything controversial to you. I have been called all the names in the book and I can`t recall having gone through with any “official” verant action. Emotions run high in the game and the tell I sent  was “You are the tool of the day!” was the only thing I said to him so calling that harassment is somewhat laughable since I had no intention of sending another tell. In fact the GM thought it was funny  &amp;#61514;  Its humorous to me that so many people can`t fend for themselves since the reason he got that tell was cuz he posted something personal against me on here, and of course when confronted with someone who wouldn`t just sit back and take it his first initial response was to “tattle” haha &amp;#61514;<br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; <br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; <br>

&amp;#61656; <br>
&amp;#61656; <br>
&amp;#61656; From what I was told he got suspended for a week for threatening to kill people in real life and the GM was already in the zone cuz of the dispute.<br>
&amp;#61656; <br>
&amp;#61656; I'm not saying he didn't deserve it - Reeko told us what he said, and I agree it was way out of line. But y'all seem just as eager to use the /petition feature as Accursed was.<br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; I didn’t threaten anyone. I just sent a silly message to someone who had said something about me on here for no real legitimate reason &amp;#61514; Big difference &amp;#61514;<br>
&amp;#61656; <br>
&amp;#61656; Personally, I think EQ should be a pleasant experience, not a place where people send me tells &quot;with the sole intent of irritation&quot;. I'm glad the GM's support a policy of non-harrassment. It makes for a much better environment to play the game in.<br>
<br>
Well Richard, I didn`t harass him, I sent him one tell. I just thought it was hilarious that he`d feel free to flame on here but have no spine to stick up for himself in game.<br>
<br>
Oh well &amp;#61514; <br>

Deal with the person yourself.  Ignore them or go train them or fuck them up however you want.  Don't play the &quot;Imma tell mommy on you&quot; card.  A gm petition is a simple solution to a problem.. It's the fucking weakest way to go.  And to petition him for calling you a tool?<br>
