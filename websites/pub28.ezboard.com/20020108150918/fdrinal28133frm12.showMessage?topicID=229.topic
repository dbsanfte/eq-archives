The names on top should let youknow whom he may be playing in game. 2 i believe are in one guild LD and the other (the cleric) is in Seventh Ward.<br>
<br>
This man (for lack of a better word) likes to send pictures to ladies and tell them he's a male modle.  If you've seen any of the pictures you may be interested in checking out the Young and the Restless or the new Soul Train because the pictures he sends are of an actor named Shemar Moore.  If you'd like to take a look go to www.shemar.com and you will see a stricking resemblence to the pictures he has been sending out saying that, that is him.<br>
<br>
Also be warned, he loves to lie, manipulate and decieve. In his opinion everyone is out to get him and no one ever understands his side of things. To him it's always someone elses fault. I have never in game run across someone as trashy as this. /em ponders why Truehart split from the last server he was on, could it be that everyone knew of him and his reputation was so bad he didnt' have any friends?  <br>
<br>
Ladies, beware of this man! He is a creep. You have been warned........<br>

I have seen the pictures he sends to people and it made me laugh that someone could be so pathitic.  Just remember there are people with feelings behind most of these images we all play, if you find it amusing that people have been hurt by him i am sorry for you, many people get many different things from this game, and yes some people have feelings believe it or not.<br>

I dont know where you got your information, but seeing as its obviously second hand (by your own admission), I have serious doubts about the validity of your statements. Let me give you some first hand knowledge of the guy. Eld is an extremely nice guy, he busts his ass for his guildmates and tries very hard to do things for other people in the game (regardless of sex). He is extremely polite, Ive never seen him otherwise.<br>
<br>
FYI Eldarious is married in RL, why would he send pictures to females?<br>
<br>
There is a person on Drinal named Eldarion, and its not the same person who plays Eldarious. Why should anyone believe what you are saying when you arent even sure what the persons name is? <br>
<br>
You really shouldnt make posts like this when its all second hand knowledge to you. You obviously dont have all the facts, since you cant even get the name right. Posts like these can damage a good persons rep in the game, and thats wrong. <br>
<br>
You speculations as to the reason he left his old server and meaningless as well, since once again, you have no facts to back any of it up. It is all purely speculation on your part, speculation that is NOT backed up by any facts, just rumor and innuendo. <br>
<br>
If you want to play the speculation game, it sounds to me like you have some beef with him and you are trying to slander his name publicly in order to hurt his reputation. You are making things up in order to make him look bad because of some personal vendetta that you have against him. Heck, if we are going to speculate, thats what sounds good to me. Probably a lot closer to the truth than the drivel that you have spewed forth. <br>
<br>
In other words.. go home troll.. <br>

<br>
Perhaps we should talk online and spare others from having to hear your sour grapes.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the character Truehart is retired from EQ now. And I would like to say that he learned very well that getting involved in make-believe EQ relationships can be very hazardous. They do have a way of creeping into RL, and then when one of the persons involved realizes that they don't want the relationship to be RL... the other person involved can suffer some RL hurt.<br>
<br>
As for the pic... I did send that to a couple of ladies, but the lady YOU are reffering to was sent my RL pic very shortly after. So I wonder why you even bring that up in a flame now. Wasn't that over a year ago? And yes, I like to keep my RL info secret until I get to know a person very well. Did the lady you speak of tell you that I sent that pic only after her constantly demanding one for over 2 weeks? <br>
<br>
I am certain that warning the ladies of Drinal that they should watch out for me, because of a pic I sent to somebody over a year ago... is going to save them all from my evil clutches. :lol<br>
<br>
Drinal is not like Mith Marr. People here are more goal-oriented, and the ladies here do not get into the role-play romance nearly as much as on Mith Marr.  And that suits me fine. <br>
<br>
This is a GAME. We come here to play a fantasy char and do things that we would not dream of in RL. It is a shame that many have trouble making the seperation. <br>

Me calling you a psycho was a direct result of the things that you posted here for all to see. They arent some factless event that I just said happened. Anyone who wishes to see the facts can simply read the posts. This persons &quot;flame&quot; wasnt like that. It was some event that they said happened, and they offered no proof, no evidence, just heresay.<br>

It is evident you weren't aware of the history and how the postings got to the elevated state they were at. The postings did not start with &quot;my inflammatory&quot; postings. They started long ago with a posting which was essentially designed to ostracise me from the game and my responding to it. <br>
<br>
I responded as I deemed fit which was to express an opinion on the overall activity in this forum and who the majority of conflict causing postings were coming from. Opinions aren't illegal - but some people just don't have the capacity to respond with an alternate opininion and instead just come in here to yank peoples chains. <br>
<br>
Expressing my opinion yeilded the result of 10 little kids reacting by trying to get a rise out of me rather than addressing the issue of how counter-productive this forum really is when the bring issues in here...so I just played along with their stupidty. They flamed tat - I responded with a counter flame (having tried the reasonable approach with them several times before that and failed). It wasn't the act of one sole individual which lead to my forum postings - it was a collaborative effort. Menedil posts somehthing about Tat - tat responds. Julain posts something about Tat, tat responds and so on and so on. Who the hell cares? It had degenerated from potential constructive dialogue (that would never occur due to age &amp; communication limitations of some individuals) months ago in to petty antics. Tis all it is...petty antics (except for Ceneedra who has bigger issues).<br>
<br>
If you didn't catch that you came in way too late in the process. Seems to me that you Elessar, up until today (I commend your posting today), have merely participated in the bumping of flames with inflammatory personal attacks on topics which you have no history upon. I don't really care I just laugh at the irony that you suddenly care now that one of your friends is on the recieving end of such attacks.<br>
<br>
As for the topic I met Trueheart in game and never found him offensive or intrusive in any manner. If someone involves themselves emotionally in eq then they really might consider the personal consequences but it doesn't have to be the entire public forums consequences to endure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/01 12:11:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarion aka Prophici </span><hr size=1> The best thing about these EQ boards is:  The flames are so god damn fun/funny.<br>

As to answer some questions, this person was not BEGGING for pictures they were offered.  Flame all you want about this, if you think it's funny. I know for fact,  having been in rooms and seen their conversations and seen emails that promises were made.  I don't think a man begging someone to marry him and promising to leave his wife if you will just say yes is amusing.  Yes this IS A GAME. People get online and play games for a number of different reasons.  <br>
<br>
This was not the first time he's done this and it won't be the last. Look at the remark about the ladies on MM, nice sterotyping. As for your comment about being Goal-Oriented, is your goal to go through the ladies on Drinal like you did on MM?<br>
<br>
Oh well, I tried. Believe what you will. Laugh if you want. What I think will be amusing is when this happens to someone you know or like and to have it thrown back in your face.

The person SAID it was third person, the person came here to put people on the lookout.  She is NOT asking for this person to be banned, etc, she is just warning ladies.  (Well, those of us that are real ladies, not like the 80pct that are fake in game).<br>
<br>
Let it go, relax.  I for one, as a real lady appreciate the warning.  I dont cyber anyways, (sorry lads, am married in real life) but for some who thats their thing, this is a very good &quot;heads up&quot;.<br>
<br>
Thats all it was...take it easy.  Now if this person who is being warned about would come here themselves, maybe we would get both sides of the picture. <br>
<br>
Anyways...wonder how THIS will get challenged by the boards nazi's.  <br>
<br>
Hugs all!<br>

Seemingly complex problem of a jealous ex taking vengeance for some reason a year later (gee where have we seen that before?)<br>
<br>
So who's statement is true. The one where it is stated: this is a women giving other women warning - good info or Trueharts original explaination that this came from a jealous ex who is a man?<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter anyway people who want to cyber do so at their own risk. If they think you can relate over pixels in space - then I guess it doesn't matter what the dude looks like. Hopefully they (the pro-cyberers who you say this info is useful for) aren't so moronic that they think 8 year old and 80 year old pasty faced trolls aren't hanging out in cyberspace pretending like they are hot babes.<br>

So after that situation, I saw the solution. I used a verant loop-hole and got a name change for my Cleric, twinked the @#%$ out him to make him look uber... and got noticed by a pure Raid Guild. <br>
<br>
This was after Coldhart joined Legio, which I consider a &quot;Family Guild&quot;. We got much love here. You need a ride? 3-4 people will offer. You need a Rez? Guildmates will travel zones to help you. And I make my contributions to help others also. I won't name names, but those that I have helped to level and camp items... while I gained nothing from it but the good feeling from helping another (priceless) they know who they are. <br>
<br>
Seventh Ward is a balls-to-the-walls, hard-core Raid guild. Nobody is saying hello when they log on. You need a ride? You either have a Druid on another account, or you are expected to be rich enough to pay 50-100pp for one over OOC. You WILL attend manditory raids or your ass is OUT. You will get phat lewt, because members are expected to look prosperous. Nobody gives a @#%$ if you're sick, your dog died, or anything else. All that matters is that you know how to play your character, and you don't *F* up on raids....&quot;<br>

Anyway...this topic is kinda silly really, seriously if someone doesnt want to send out their real pic over the net, thats not really a reason to flame them, i'd have to agree with sslith but i think i would of put it in a kinder gentler way =)<br>
<br>
making RL promises etc. well to each their own...You have to always keep in mind that this IS just a video game and you dont REALLY know whats going on behind that other person's screen. But if anyone is happily married IRL and told me that he'd dump his RL chick for me (a girl he has only talked to over the computer in EQ) i'd just laugh and tell him to snap outta it or get laid<br>
<br>
And seriously, how do you KNOW he's not some soap opera star, maybe he's Brett Farve, famous people can play games too ya know :)<br>
