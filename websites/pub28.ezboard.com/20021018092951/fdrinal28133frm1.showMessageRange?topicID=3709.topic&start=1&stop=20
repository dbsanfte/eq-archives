Since it was the beginning of the year, we were learning about antomical positions and the correct names for various positions. We were doing the lamest lab of the year, disecting a pickle. About 15 min in, the teacher went out of the class to get something. 5 min later she comes running in, frantic, yelling, &quot;The white house has been bombed!!!&quot; We flipped on the TV and watched it for the rest of the class. Like two people in the class had fathers in the pentagon but they were alright. We really didnt do any work that day, just watched. Some people were really scared. And hour and a half later class ended and people were in the halls being happy b/c they got to go home early. That really pissed me off.

It was very pretty and I couldn't help but look at it as I rode to school.<br><br>When the planes hit I was in school. I had heard something in the halls about the US going to war, etc...but didn't think much of it. I got to 3rd period and my Spanish teacher explained very calmly what happened.  Another teacher kept coming in to update us since we had no TV or anything.  Everyone in the class was so quiet.  Nobody knew what to say.  During that class was when the 2 towers collapsed.  When I heard the towers collapsed with thousands of people inside I couldn't help but cry for all the innocent lives lost.  I later heard reports of kids making comments like &quot;just think of all the wallets laying around!&quot;.  Some people really know how to be assholes..Anyway, I had heard all about it by the time I got to 4th period but hadn't seen any footage.  My 4th period English teacher took us into the teacher's lounge where about 200 other students were jam packed in watching a tiny TV.  That's the only time I saw the footage of the plane hitting the tower, and I will never forget seeing it.   After that a lot of kids whined and complained about wanting to go home early saying they felt the school wasn't safe, blah blah... They evacuated the malls, many large buildings in Chicago were emptied, and people everywhere left their jobs to go home.  I remember also they halted all flights from the Chicago O'Hare airport which I live very close to.  The silence was extremely eerie.  There's usually a plane roaring overhead every 5 minutes but the afternoon of September 11th 2001 was just dead.. silent.   <br><br>Edit: edited for clarity and structure.  <p><a><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/trentazra/TrentazraGif.gif" border="0"><center></a> <Center> <b>Trentazra Vim </b></Center><BR><center> 60 High Priestess </center><center> Guardians of the Keep </center><BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrentazra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trentazra</A> at: 9/15/02 12:43:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uladykaleigh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lady Kaleigh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Seduction</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/15/02 12:40:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3709.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> I was asleep in the bed and my father came running through the house yelling &quot;KYM, OMFG, WAKE UP, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS&quot; i was like WTF?! i got up in and went into the living room and could do nothing but just stand there in awe as i watched.

It was one of those, &quot;Wtf?&quot; type moments.  I didn't realize what it was until the phone rang a second later and we went into a higher threat level.<br><br>After the plane hit the Pentagon, we were in the highest threat level.  We woke up the night shift guys and set up sky watchers.  Armored vehicles were placed in front of the gates and weapons charged.  It was an unreal feeling as the 6 of us sat in body armor for most of the day.<br><br>The worst part was having a guy on my team who's mother worked in the first building.  She ended up getting out, but he didn't find out until around 5pm that day due to the phone lines being swamped.<br><br>I've never really reflected on that moment...

The towers collapsed and noone hear was in any mood to do anything.  I work for Ford Motor and a lot of us have friends in the US and we had a few americans over as always.  they were in shock and the uber boss here sent them to their hotel with a few friends.<br><br>It was the worst day of my life and I was 3000 mile away.  I would just like to say that those who charged the terrorists in PA deserve medals.  Their courage potentially saved thousands of lives.  Over here they seem to be back page news as it was a &quot;normal&quot; plane crash.<br><br>There hasnt been a day i havent thought of 9/11, everytime i was past a building with more than a few floors.  My heart goes out to those who suffered and I pale into insignificance as a human compared to those heros that day.
