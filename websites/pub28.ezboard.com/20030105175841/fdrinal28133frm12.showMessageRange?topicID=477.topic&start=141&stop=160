<br>
After reading it, my opinions of people haven't changed. There are some people I didn't have an opinion about, that I now have one. Some good, some bad.<br>
<br>
Thats for those of you who I know personally.<br>
<br>
<br>
For those of you who I don't:<br>
<br>
Why wake the Sleeper? Just to say you did? <br>
<br>
Several people have suggested this:<br>
<br>
CiH kills 4th warder every single time it's up.<br>
<br>
Anyone else capable can kill any of the other warders they chose. Now, if you want to avoid waking the Sleeper, obviously it'd be a good idea to pick 2 of the other 3. Does it really matter which 2? <br>
<br>
This seems like a fair compromise to me. Hell, it's not even a compromise, it's more like a gift from CiH to any other guild capable of doing ST. I'm not sure about the status of other guilds, but right now that seems to be CT.<br>
<br>
There is one problem though. CiH has stated (as a FACT) that they would like 2 more robes from Ventani.<br>
<br>
What then? Some of you have stateds as a FACT that you would like to wake the Sleeper. Some of you don't care. Some of you don't. <br>
<br>
You know that not only CT, but practically every other person on the server would LIKE to get some ST loot. For the vast majority, this is not going to be a reality any time soon, and more than likely EVER. (Especially with an awakened dragon.)<br>
<br>
However, you do know that CT is capable of doing wardes 1-3. You do know that other guilds are very close if not capable of doing ST. You do know that other people will eventually get to that point.<br>
<br>
Right now, you alone have the power to end any hopes of that for everyone. Inlcuding future CiH members. <br>
<br>
No big deal right? NToV drops are more than comparable right? So what about your stated intentions to camp NToV making it impossible for anyone else to do so? How willing would you be to share? <br>
<br>
NToV wouldn't be the only target of people wanting to get better items, but how many other possibilities are there? By eliminating the first brood and ST, you eliminated distractions from other goals such as NToV or SOL mobs.<br>
<br>
Can Drinal be one of the few servers not to awaken the Sleeper? To me that's more of a distinction than someone who does awaken him. It's more of a relfection of character. Not just for CiH, but for everyone.<br>
<br>
CiH has the power to do something, but can refrain from using that power. They have the control. Everyone can prove that they don't have to push CiH to do such things.<br>
<br>
However, using that power as a bribe for everyone to give you exactly what you want. (Exclusive rights to NTOV)<br>
<br>
You have said you can take that any time you want, why ask?<br>
<br>
If you say, give us NToV or we wake the Sleeper, what do you think everyone is going to say? WAKE HIM!<br>
<br>
However if you want to negotiate a rotation or something like that, it seems pretty reasonable to me.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why everyone gets bent out of shape over this. This is happening on ALL sides of the arguement.<br>
<br>
You have done good things in the past and gotten shit on for it? Such is life, I'd invite you to take over my fucking RL job. Do you think that just because people treat you like absolute shit, that entitles you to something? In that case, where the fuck is my million dollars and harem? Why do you even care what someone playing a game says about you while playing a game? If I think your mom is an ugly fucking whore, why do you care? I don't know you, your mom, or anyone who does.<br>
<br>
How many times have you seen an item go to someone who doesn't deserve it? I don't know about you, but I've seen it COUNTLESS fucking times. It's part of the game. You can do what you want to avoid but NOTHING will keep SOMEONE from feeling like they've just been shit on. When that happens does EQ become less fun for you? You don't have anything less than you did before except for maybe a few pixels of exp and some time. But if that's the case, why did you commit the time in the first place? Everything in the game is a gamble, which is pretty fucking stupid to consider when you think about it. Playing a game is a gamble?? Maybe that's why it so addictive. The pay-off can be really really good in terms of the rush you feel. However, the sacrifice may make the game less enjoyable for you. If that's the case, and you don't want to have to deal with that anymore, play it safe and don't attempt the high end encounters. If you consistantly get shit on, stop. Some people just have all the luck. People that believe in Karma are full of shit.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, how does that pertain to this?<br>
<br>
Wake the Sleeper, don't wake the sleeper? Does it even fucking matter?<br>
<br>
I personally would enjoy the game more with the sleeper still asleep, and you know the funny part? I personally don't really have much to benefit from ST. <br>
<br>
My opinions: Leave the Sleeper asleep, up, work out a rotation on NTOV, make Ullik wear a bag over his head because he's FUCKING ugly, and try to iron out all the wrinkles in the friendship between these 2 guilds.<br>
<br>
If all or none of that happens, it doesn't really matter to me much at all. <br>
<br>
I'm only a trial member of CT, but this is the first time I've been part of a large guild that I didn't have any issues with any of it's members. So far I respect and like you all.<br>
<br>
I respect and like a lot of CiH members too, but some of you I despise more than anything in EQ. I'm just really glad that those specific members decided not to sicken me with their presence on this thread.<br>
<br>
<br>
God damn Ullik, you REALLY ARE UGLY.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Hmmm, I just wanted to add that below my sig it says: Also I believe in sharing. That has nothing to do with this post. That actually refers to my little personal icon that USED to be Me doing Faylaen from behind while she was bent over taking Karv from the other side.

<br>
sometimes i wish i went to AB too as i got the chance. The ppl there dont cry so much about this dump shit loot crap there.<br>
<br>
Its sad to see that the most guys still playing this game just for loot. What is so hard to let the 1. warder up? why you just dont give cats the 4th warder, when you wanna kill warder`s you still have the 2. and 3.<br>
well when CiH killed the 4. warder and you want to try a shot on him (think that should required that you can already kill 2. and 3. warder without probs) you still can try to talk with them. i think since when one other Guild then CiH has the skills to kill 4. warder CiH died for boredness with him and will killing NToV (better loot then primals anyway, maybe you wanna cry about them soon too?), Tunare *boogle* etc anyway<br>
<br>
personally CT should think about to kick Gell...such postings are just useless and shows how greedy ppl can be<br>

Before u even think about suggesting what CT should do with one of our most dedicated and hard working members, you should get a fucking clue and not make dumb ass assumptions.<br>
That for everyone who gets on Gell for this bull shit. Gell is one of the most loyal players on this server, Gell has always thought about other people before himself, We all fuck up once im sure every single person including me, posting on this board has fucked up at least once. <br>

  Saying that about Gell that basically restricted CT from leveling past 52 until Garbink (Glumner), Arasi, and him got both books from vox/nag?  Really sounds like he looked for the good of the guild over his own intentions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 9:47:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=158>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I told you so.</span><hr size=1> That's bullshit Seeth.  I was in CT before Gell took over, after Gell took over, and now after Gell stepped down.  We spent considerable time doing vox/nag and we AS A GUILD decided not to level past 52 in order to continue doing these mobs. <br>
<br>
We didn't kill vox and nag back on MM simply to get Gell and our paladin's FAs, at the time they dropped the best loot in the game in many slots and we felt it would enhance the guild dramatically to farm them at a time no one else was.  <br>
<br>
I don't see why you needed to make an unfounded statement like that in the middle of this thread.<br>
<br>
As for Gell, he may not write the most convincing or appropriate posts and he may not say the most advantageous things -- but I think it would be unfair to doubt his motives.  He has always looked out for CT as a guild, and I think every one of you would expect the same thing from your officers/leaders.  Hell, I'm sure he ruined a lot of friendships when he started this thread even though he personally had nothing to gain from it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukalledar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalledar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 9:51:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=159>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I told you so.</span><hr size=1> Way to make stuff up Seethur.
