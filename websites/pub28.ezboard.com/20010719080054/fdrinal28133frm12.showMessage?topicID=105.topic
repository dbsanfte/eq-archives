So we decide to move, and play without doing the things that we didnt like on our old servers.<br>
<br>
Now , before I get started, I fully agree no one &quot;owns&quot; a camp or spawn or zone. And that if something is up, go do it. EXCEPT if someone else is going to.<br>
<br>
If someone is planning on doing something, I do not care if it is blackburrow to plane of growth, we should respect that. If you zone into sebilis, and camp check, and someone says we are planning on doing disco, you dont start getting people anyway in the mindset you can get there first and say, &quot; we didnt see anyone here and it was open.&quot;<br>
<br>
What nonsense is this? If you decide to do hateplane, cuz no one is up there, and you start getting people, and find out someone else is planning on doing it in 3 hours, you dont go up anyway because you CAN.<br>
<br>
And act ignorant about it, saying &quot;No one is here now but us, so obviously you werent planning on it.&quot; <br>
<br>
It has happened too many times now and I just cant believe how you can justify it.<br>
<br>
If I gather 40people to do hate, and someone tells me, &quot;Hey man, I had a raid planned in 5 hours.&quot; I say, &quot;Ok cool, np, need help?&quot; and we DONT GO. <br>
<br>
Someone is planning a hate raid, and buffing in sro, and you gate up FIFTEEN minutes before them, because you decided to go, and got people together faster. WHY? Because Inny is up.<br>
<br>
Someone decides to do king room in guk, and you race down there, and as they pulling noble area, go running by them invis and sit in hall before king room and say&quot; we got here first.&quot;<br>
<br>
You decide to do fire giants, and someone tells you, &quot;Hey, I had a raid planned, and had people coming.&quot; You say, &quot;Sorry, no one is there now, and we got some people to do em.&quot;<br>
<br>
What the hell is it that you fools find out someone is planning something, or gathering people for it, that you have to hurry and race there to beat them. Why the fuck cant you just say &quot;Oh, you were? cool, need help?&quot; and let them?<br>
<br>
So I am asked yesterday afternoon, &quot;hey shaere, this is aalinia. I still wanna do ragefire, aximander is here and we gonna do fg and stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
/gu hey guys, I am gona go help clear fg and do rage if up to finish cler epic.<br>
<br>
Guild tells you, I hear cs is doing them.<br>
<br>
/gu no way, Auram and I talked earlier,. argued rather, cs is doing hate I am positive.<br>
<br>
So I check, and I see akin(bole) in ls, a few others in lava and solb.<br>
/t aalinia hey, cs gonna do em now?<br>
Aalinia tells you, No I am. I even talked with maar and a lot of other people last night. I told (saidin or nodentt I think) that I was doing fg, but they went ahead anyway.<br>
<br>
/t aalinia, ok I com,e help you.<br>
<br>
I get there, run to fg area, and aalinia crew is clearing ldcs. I run up, and LOokie 2 cs/mwh group pulling fg.<br>
<br>
Well actually, they were doing cr because they got wiped out. Funny, aximander ressed em.<br>
<br>
So I ask, and am told, &quot;No one else is here, I only see us. Therefore its ours.&quot;<br>
<br>
ThAT isnt the freaking point. The point is, you found out someone was planning on doing it, and you said, screew them, and you went anyway. JUst hurried up and raced there so you could say &quot;we got here first&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, tranix is pulled and killed. IM standing there facing aalinia crew, while they discuss torque.<br>
<br>
Nodennt tells you, back away from corpse pls.<br>
<br>
Those bastards were saying I was going to ninja loot? A freaking mithril torque? Rofl. I have had one a LOOONNGG time you cretins. Back away from the corpse? Wtf is this crap. Accusing me of intent to ninja? Because &quot;I dont know you from adam.&quot; <br>
<br>
Funny that, Nodennt , I remember them chardok raids where your guild didnt do jack to help you, and I did. Goto hell.<br>
<br>
So they move up to throne room, and rest of our ppl arrive.<br>
<br>
We move past them, to top of stairs before bridge. Akin runs up, to fd split the 2. I grab both, off bridge, and pull. WEe fighting now for a good minute, Kill one fg, and almost other dead. When lo and behold Akin runs up, and fd right in front of me.<br>
<br>
And the 4 fg from area past bind corner ,magically appear amongst us, to which the 2 cs/mwh group evac.<br>
<br>
You guys rock.<br>
<br>
Then get mad because you say &quot;we got there first, and u stole our raid.&quot; <br>
<br>
Freaking morons.<br>
<br>
Or, how bout me doing a king group for guk. We sitting at guktop, and 2 cs people run by us. gambler, nadin and someone.<br>
<br>
So we finally get to gukbottom, and camp check. We say king, cuz we planning on going there. Gambler says king. <br>
<br>
So we pull noble area, and outer king rooms, to see nadin in king hall. With 2 invis people.<br>
<br>
&quot;we got here first.&quot;<br>
<br>
U got problems.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
No drop items on spawns for something like epic maybe worth getting a little miffed over (with the parties involved not the whole server) .. but, anything, droppable, purchaseable etc. not worth the anger and frustration - walk away and go somewhere else even if you think they are rude. <br>
<br>
You would think this server would have many more people in new territory - sleepers/veeshans/western wastes/cobalt scars/ sirens / icewell  - instead everyone just fighting over the same ole same ole. <br>
<br>
Go somehwere new - have an adventure - get drops - trade them for the stuff on the old spawns people are bickering over. (although people don't have the ability to do this in your guild by policy)  <br>
<br>
Maybe that FG had something no drop that is cool - but the logic in taking it here as a server wide issue is just blowing off steam. Why not ask maar if maybe he logged off and didn't notify his &quot;whole&quot; guild of this persons planned FG event. Or maybe they logged in after his announcement. <br>

The point about racing to do stuff isnt that you cant physically do two, ist that it is greedy. Just because you CAN do hate and fear at the same time, should you? <br>
<br>
Just because you have the power, does that make whatever you do with it ok?<br>

You had hate. <br>

But we want fg too.<br>

Christ I dont need anything from fg, Im arguing the fact people would hurry up and race to a freaking spawn once they hear someone is doing it. <br>

<br>
I guess the reason why this burns me up so much is i'm only missing ONE piece to complete my armor, heh, a freakin bracer :P i havent been extremely worried about hate since theres better stuff out there, but i'm still sporting that crafted bracer and definately wouldnt mind getting the bracer, my last piece...I have not been to plane of hate once since moving to drinal, however i was part of 3 planned out raids, all three of them were taken for the same reason, another guild heard of some of us coming up so figured they'd beat us up to it, i wont name names or start flaming the guild, thats not what i'm about, and i'm hopeing it was just an honest misunderstanding due to lack of communication...no one is asking anyone to just lie on their backs and get trampled all over, but it never hurts to kneel down a bit and let someone else have a shot at those types of things, theres always fear, right?<br>

<br>
Do you assume that because they are Clan Skalligram they are donned with more armor passed down by guild? Or more capable therefore each &quot;individual&quot; has more? <br>
<br>
I would inquire if that is really the case. I would think like every other guild there are some &quot;individuals&quot; who have had more successes &amp; more motivation for items than others. <br>
<br>
Example: a person joins your guild and spends a lot of time rounding up folks in your guild to help them with epics - vs. a person joins your guild and is quite comfortable not going after epic so they don't spend the time gathering people up for help. Each scenario is individually based not guild based.<br>
<br>
I will add - there are people in your guild who have way more than I have (or even care to have) - scrambling for epics. And as one party told me when I asked him why he joined your guild: &quot;I just use him for raids&quot;. Time to clean up your own house. You know why they do that? Because they want items. It doesn't appear to be the core values you desire for your guild - but it's part of the game. <br>
<br>
Need to put some meat behind these accusations. <br>

I want my Epic since day 1 of Epic release. Why? Because it is an Epic. I didn't know the stats but just thought: When they are close to the FA, they cannot be bad, especially when they are made for warriors. So I tried to get my pieces together. Guess what. I still don't have it. I am tired of camping Maestro to drop a hand. I cannot see Hate anymore. I really hate this zone. But Verant wants us to see that zone too damn often. Then I need a green scale. Last 5 Severilous's didn't drop a scale. (last 5 that CS did). Of course that freak ALWAYS drops a scale when others are trying him (TK, CiH). So I am still running around with my funny Jade Mace and the CSS. I am tired of botth of them, I want to have my freaking epic. As far as I remember you have your gloves. Grats to you. But now:<br>
Are you greddy because you got them that early? Or is it just that monks have it damn easy with their quest? I mean, the pipes are a pain in the butt, but the mobs who drop them, aren't on a 24 hour spawn in a zone which is expensive to enter. Yes, I am not blessed with hundreds of thousands pp, so I consider 200pp as much. Gorno's cleric is very helpful. He never asked for anything for his cleric. The pieces (EM) he has, are leftovers mostly. Let a secondary loot them or let them rot? Up to you. I prefer to havee them on a secondary and I think you also prefer that. I think the biggest problem you have, is still the Chardok raid which we *sniped* in your eyes. Since then you look for reasons to bash CS. You are making a fool out of yourself. I don't want to race anyone to a certain spawn. No Ragefire, no Trakanon, no VS, no Maestro, no whatever. I play the game for fun ( that is why I am NOT going every day to Hate cause that is no fun). You blame people to be loot whores. Sorry, Shaere, but the game is based on loot. Either you are mentally still in West Freeport kicking rats and orc pawns or you have the best equipment available. Both things are not given. You have good equipment (but that is not diffcult for a monk) but not the best. Maybe you for yourself have realized that the better equipment is out of reach for you. Why? Because with the Velious expansion, Verant focused on large group encounters. LArger groups than Drinal is willing to give to you. That also has several reasons. From day 1 on you hadn't anything better to do than to bash the larger guilds. Why? I am still clueless. You ruined your own chances. You are living in the past Shaere. Wake up man. Hate isn't that great anymore. There are other monks who can pull Hate every day. It is not just you alone. And to say that all people in one guild are the same is damn stupid. Maybe you have some major problems with certain individuals in the same guild but that doesn't make 120 other people to assholes. I have 2 charss. One is Nadeniel and the other one is Lambretta, my mage. Lambretta is level 29 and yes, she is twinked. I got her an advisor robe. WOW! I see other twinks with BC robes. Sure, I wish I had one for her but as long as I have a caster in my group who still needs one, I won't enter the lotto for it. You need a certain amount of greed to reach something in Everquest. You can blame 300,000 subscribers for that. But to say that everyone in CS is sooo greedy that we have the biggest fun to screw others is plain and simple bullshit. All we want is our fair share and I think that is a right everyone wants to have. Maybe we soon find a posting about CiH and their greed. let me say this:<br>
The persons I grouped with from CiH were all nice, in no way greedy or something like that. I never saw a member of CS and CiH screwing people. But that is just me. You may ssee things differently. Icarus once sent me a tell, wondering why I was saying that Maestro's hand is a rare drop, cause everytime he went up it dropped. So he thought it was a regurlar drop. What I want to say is: Some people are just lucky with the drops. Others aren't. So they have to spend more time at certain places than others. I wish I would never have to enter Hate but Verant made it impossible. EQ has reached its end. More and more people are quitting every day. They can't stand that camping shit anymore, are burnt out of the game in general or just rediscovered that there are other things in life which also seem to be fun (like a GF for example).<br>
God, I was bored and just wanted to state my opinion.<br>

Deal with it Shaere.  Some level 1 char has the same right to kill anything as you do.

rot or go to a secondary? how bout invite someone from outside the guild who needs stuff? /gasp<br>
<br>
new concept for mith marr folks? sharing?<br>
<br>
i can understand not wantin to deal with newbie mistakes, maybe thats your only reason for keepin it guild only... but its more likely that you do it just so you won't have many to random against. since the majority of mith marr people don't believe in seniority, or last two pieces..<br>
<br>
it is really quite ridiculous. i remember when we started on this server, us tunarians were surprised to hear the stories from cih, about how afterlife Coh'd past em for trak...and how they were not gonna do that to people. Guess what, CiH for the most part honored their word. now CS pops up, and all of the sudden we got people who wanna race to spawns? what the fuck is that? seriously.....You leave mith marr to get away from something, then when you get the chance you start doin it to other people. <br>
<br>
maybe you just don't realize what you're doing...CS came into power rather abruptly.. Well, let me clue you in on a few things: a lot of people think CS is tryin to take shit over, and is doin a lot of stupid shit, racing people to mobs, etc. many of the non-cs players on the server are sick of it.<br>
<br>
Hell, I don't even play much and I'm sick of hearing about it. Go ahead, call shaere an asshole all you want....he's used to it. But every once in a while take a fucking step back and look at yourselves - foaming at the mouth with greed over pixels, ready to squish anyone who stands in your way, ready to do the VERY THING YOU LEFT MITH MARR TO GET AWAY FROM.<br>
<br>
the term sell out rings a bell? hypocrite? Asshole? <br>
<br>
are those things familiar to you? maybe you should look them up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=105.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=105.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=106.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=103.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
