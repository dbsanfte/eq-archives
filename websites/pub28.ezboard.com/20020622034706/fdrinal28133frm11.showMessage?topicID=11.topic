<br>
&quot;My dear, I have a task for you.&quot;  Tnayr said out loud.<br>
Liz droped her invisibility spell and apeared in front of her dark lord.  &quot;What is it you wish of me my lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to know what the council is saying about my request.  I do not wish to be surprised when the time comes and perhaps get a head start on the 'quests' to get this Rite over with.&quot; Tnayr stared off into the distance &quot;Yes...the sooner the better&quot;<br>
<br>
Elizbeth bowed and vanished as quickly as she had arrived.  It was still a mystery to her why such mundane rites would trouble her Lord Tnayr so much.  And still a mystery why he would think finding a Mrimmd’ssinss was such a bad idea.  Maybe it was because of her beliefs; after all, she did worship Erollisi Marr.  Behind all that dark and gloom he was quite charming.<br>
<br>
She cleared her head of such trivial thoughts, for her destination loomed before her...the church, where the council was still convening about Tnayr's request.<br>
<br>
Listening in on the council was easier then she thought it'd be.  There were some discussion of the quests, but every one Vfelia had put in a say/suggestion into what was apropriate.  It was plane to see that Vfelia wasn't pleased with her fellow council members and there lieniancy of quest choices.<br>
<br>
The meeting ajourned and people were leaving, Liz stayed behind hidden a while longer as to make sure she wasn't noticed.  Being Careless got you killed when dealing with the Tier'dal, and practiceing extra caution was the rule.<br>
<br>
Before Liz left, Vfelia returned to the church.  &quot;hmm...what are you up to now I wonder...&quot; Elizbeth pondered for a while and decided to stay and listen. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Elizbeth couldn't hear a single word traded between Venia and Vfelia.  Her chamber was inside the church where walls couldn't grow ears without taking extreme risks, and that was a risk Elizbeth dared not take.<br>
<br>
She didn't have wait long, because Vfelia and Venia were both on the move.  If it weren't for there haste and preocupation, Vfelia and Venia might of detected a silent follower behind them.  It was a mistake made rarely from tier'dal, especially of there rank.  Elizbeth pressed on, teeth clenched, detection meant certain death...or even worse.  But there was something going on, and Vfelia was the key, she had to find out.  Not because she wanted to know, but she knew it was what Tnayr had sent her out for.  She hated these types of tasks, and she'll mention that fact when she returns with her report.<br>
<br>
Vfelia and Venia were escorted into Aleal's tower.  Elizbeth hid and started chanting the mundane words for the levitate spell to raise her up to the window.  Once her feat left the ground she once again cast Invisibility so the unaware may not detect her intrusion.<br>
<br>
She floated up to see inside the tower window, and she saw Aleal concentrating on what looked like a giant pentagram...or rather a bowl inside the pentagram.<br>
<br>
Elizbeth was enthralled by the power being drawn forth from the pentagram that she didn't notice a black fog was creaping up on her until it was too late.  She was surrounded in darkness and the last thing she heard before she blacked out was a male voice shouting Aleal's name...<br>
