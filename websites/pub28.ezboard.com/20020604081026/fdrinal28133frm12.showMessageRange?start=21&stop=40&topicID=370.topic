I never said or doubted that either Craigorr or Philo never helped anyone, I'm talking about giving up on relationships.  It also surprises me that a Large number of people in and out of the guild really respect what I say, but feel this is a trashy place to talk about it.  I definately can see their point. Its obvious that for many posts no one really didn't know who I was talking about, until Craigorr posted specifics.  He did that to react against the guilt he has... Its over folks, go home.  Nothing more to see here.<br>
<br>
P.S. I have never said anything about CS anywhere that I can see.  I will not hold a guild accountable for a single member.  They seem like pretty good chaps as a whole.  So please don't try to make this some guild bashing post. That is a twist of my words. <p>Skarl Speedbump <BR>56 mage of Drinal<br>Guardians of the Keep<br>skarlspeedbump@hotmail.com<BR> "Why do people like me?

Just a lil history, Marias was in gotk a few months ago, we wouldn't let her on a fear raid when she was 46? and it was our first fear raid.  where ya said something about why help you when we can do it our selves? those were MY words not my guilds.  don't blame my guild for something I've done.  <br>
<br>
About Craig and philo.  They felt CS was a better place for them, and they left.  It's a fucking game people, they are entitled.  I have no problem with either, marias on the other hand is really pissing me off.   Guys, my guildies included stop the flaming, it's a waste of time.  All your doing is making yoursleves look bad.  Craigorr Philo i wish you both luck in the future, am i hurt, yes., pissed off? no.  Are we all still friends, i'd like to think so.  <br>
<br>
All anyone is doing here, is giving people, like marias a chance to flame us, flame you,  If anybody who reads this wants to send me a tell of what the truths are in any of these posts feel free too.   Don't blame my guild for shit i say, because they are my words.<br>

Craig and Philo I have nothing but the highest respect for you if you ever need me in anyway pls feel free to give me a tell. Now to Marias why even post that? That was uncalled for in the biggest way. There are many members in GotK that would drop what there doing and help out anyone. I myself have dropped what I am doing to run to many CRs for no payment what so ever and these were for non-guild members. If you have a problem with anyone take into tells people (/points at Marias). <br>

But, damnit, I *will* post to clear up a few things Marias said.<br>
<br>
1) Skarl was in VL *hiding* while we were taking down Ixi. Nope. Uh-uh. No way. He spent about 6 hours there trying to get a group, waiting on lists and being passed over because a *more desireable* class came along and finally managed to get one just before Ixi started. He was deep into 54 and about to ding 55, the point at which he would be the first mage in GotK to scribe Call of the Hero. A spell that any guild will tell you is invaluable. He asked in /gu if anyone would be upset if he stayed to ding (which he did about half-way though the wait between 2nd and 3rd spawns). Not a single person said he was greedy or selfish for doing so-in fact he got ALOT of encouragement to do exactly that, from both the clerics and the officers, as well as others in the guild. And since dinging 55 he has been an invaluable asset on raids when we have late comers-I'm glad he skipped Ixi and would encourage the same thing just as strongly today as I did that night.<br>
<br>
2) About the first drop being defered to a LOWER LEVEL (emphasis Marias'). This was all pre-arranged WEEKS in advance. Everyone knew who was getting what drops and in which order. It was a matter of how long people had been Ixi ready and people having to go to work. Everyone knew we were there for the long haul and noone was leaving unless they *HAD* to until we had three Ixi drops that night. It's not like we got together and /randomed the drops 5 minuted before we started. Three clerics were Ixi ready, three clerics got their Scepter of Ixiblat Fer. And ya know what? the Singed Notes from the Overking are already pre-awarded, based first on amount of time the cleric has been ready for that stage, second upon length of time the person has been in the guild. Not that it really matters because we are planning on being there at least long enough to get the four notes for the clerics who are at this stage-maybe even longer to prepare others who are close. See, when it's a guild raid, you can count on people not leaving ten minutes after they get their drop, or not bitching or bothering to show because nothing they need drops there-because you know that the people you help today are going to be the same people who help you tomorrow when its your turn to hit a zone where nothing drops for them and that the epic you help get today (be it anything from rogue to SK) is going to be there tomorrow, quite possibly saving your ass. I saw 36 or so people spend four hours in CoM last night. THREE of them got drops-two were epics (one shammy, grats Boogerr, and one druid, grats Emerald) and the third was an SK only shield (grats Molgar). And you know how many complained about lost exp (I *think* I may have broken even), lack of loot, length of time we were there? Zero. None. Not a peep.<br>
<br>
3) On GotK &quot;turning out back&quot; on UGoD. Umm...I've seen posts from people thanking UGoD for help on CRs (including a couple UGoD raids I was on before I joined GotK). I've seen plenty of open raids run by GotK in recent history. As for the instance you are talking about (where we were &quot;asked for your help for once&quot; (funny how all those other times GotK members willingly helped out and will again), after the suggestion from Seke that you look for a strong showing from GotK for your Inny raid, you scoffed and told him how wrong he was for bringing it up. Why the hell would a guild want to help out someone who obviously has an attitude about them? And as for doing closed raids...don't even go there. Plenty of UGoD guilds do closed raids-as well they should when they are able. If quest armor, high-end weapons/loot, epic pieces and planar loot can be kept within a guild because they can handle the raid by themselves, bravo for them-they just made their guild stronger (and, by extension, UGoD). Most people would rather see nice equipment go to a person who is a guildie and friend than to someone who they barely know-it's just common sense. It's funny to me how you like to slam GotK for doing alot of closed raids, but never mention other UGoD members like LoTT, SB or AA (just examples I can think of off the top of my head-like I said, I agree with the practice when it's fesible) who do the same thing. Don't know what your beef with GotK is Marias, but maybe ya need to sit down and figure it out and get it resolved-your alienating 117 people (number in GotK at last count), most of whom are 50+ or damn close to that range, because you're upset with a few. Think about that next time you decide to tell somone to &quot;shut your damn mouth&quot;. <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

Higar, everyone in GotK knew that Skarl offered to leave US to come help and Skarl is more than capable of defending himself when attacked =).  My point was, this isn't the place to discuss this, and Marias's post illustrates that, not everyone has the full details on all the happenings and its gonna just keep generating more and more problems.  Everything has now been cleared up, everyone now knows more than they really needed or even gave a dang about.  Now knock it off ya boneheads!!!!  Just because someone posts here doesn't mean ya gotta jump up and get defensive! <br>

<br>
Couple of questions pls<br>
<br>
Is Marias (ik shammy) = Bonecruncher (troll war)?  Or do they just share a PC?  <br>
<br>
Is Marias a man (twig & berries) like 99.99% of the EQ population?  Remember a big arguement popping up in VL over guys who play women toons where he/she/it was involved. <p>Rashnar
