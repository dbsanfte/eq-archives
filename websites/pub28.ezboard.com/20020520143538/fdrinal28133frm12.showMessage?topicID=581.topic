Aleal was leading it I believe, and I cannot remember exactly when, probably earlier drinal days? A BCG dropped, jakjak won it. Or so I thought. He would NEVER loot anything unless I made him sheesh, I remember that raid, and everyone I was on, when a cof dropped, or bcg, or whatever, watched the greed just ooze from people.<br>
<br>
And every newbie and his brother wanting it. I am not saying it is bad to want loot, but the way you handle yourselfor go about it can be bad. I remember all the  newbie caster screaming bloody murder and jakjak gated because of the hate tells/spam I told him to report them. I know you are no newbie caster aleal and you busted your ass back when raids were no joke.<br>
<br>
But I have seen my share of ninjalooting episodes be it galiel, or that HK SK&lt; what was his name?, and malru, to mistaken ninjaflames like germon and so on. MORE often than not when someone mistakenly loots, or mistakenly in the eyes of some on that raid, it is due to a misunderstanding, be it people saying grats before they should, or the leader or loot handler screwing up.<br>
<br>
I couldn't believe you fools would say Jakjak would ninja, the guy only did raids when I brought him, and if you were doing that raid Aleal, that meant I was there and I was probably putting my 2 cents in. And troe or I was probably pulling. There is NO way I would allow a ninjaloot, or forget it. You should all know I have never been about loot, or show me the money, and I go to great lengths to try and help others get stuff and have fun.<br>
<br>
I remember the frenzy when the bcg dropped, like piranhas to meat, and I remember jakjak getting it. Know what, guess who handed it to him? wasn't me, I wasn't doing loot officially. he hasn't looted but a few things ever where I haven't told him to also. <br>
<br>
So for you loot whoring bastards who wanted a bcg and didn't get it, my heart bleeds for you. It was probably your spamming of tells that caused what you perceive to be a mistake. And if in fact he did NOT win, then I for one wouldve gotten it back from him. He is one of the few people who is less worried about the loot than I am.<br>
<br>
If you know me and know what I stand for, and you know I talked that talk as well as walked it.  He did not ninjaloot anything. Just a bunch of weak minded greedy fools who think they deseved it more because why? You got me, most the ones there hadn't ever done shit to rate any dragon god loot.<br>

<br>
XXX tells you "Hi Aleal, did Jakjak ninjaloot something on one of your raids a long time ago?"<br>
<br>
You tell XXX "I can't remember exactly, but it was something that wasn't kosher"<br>
<br>
You tell XXX "Ahhh yes, I remember now and went into this story.<br>
<br>
Basically, we killed draco on an open raid that was comprised of mostly cs people.  We had a few non-guild people on the raid, including morbeas, the eventual winner of this item.  So Draco is killed and someone looted the BCG.  The BCG is given to me, we decide how to do loot.  While random sucks, everyone there agreed that was how they wanted to do it.  So we randomed to every caster who wanted in on and would wear it.  I think 2 people ended up rolling or something simliar(been over a year now) and one of the winners in the wrong roll, ended up being jakjak.  However, no fault in jakjak at this point.  The real roll was done and the winner was morbeas. He was congratulated by everyone at the raid such and so forth. So I go to give morbeas the BCG and I truly thought I had.  /rude eq targetting.  Up to this point, my memory is a bit hazy so someone feel free to post how the random got messed up or whatever.<br>
<br>
Well, we start to go on about the raid and I get a tell from morbeas "wheres my bcg".  I told him I gave it to him and he accepted it.  A lot of hollering and yelling starts at this point and I sent in a petition.  People are screaming "who has the bcg and yadda yadda for 30 minutes in which Jakjak was present for and said nothing about having the bcg.  I don't remember exactly when Jakjak gated out, but he did.  Eventually Valindor showed up and determined that Jakjak did indeed have the BCG.  So it gets around and lots of people call him a ninjalooter etc, including myself.  Sometime during the next week Valindor talks to him and he gives back the BCG and it is turned over to morbeas.<br>
<br>
This problem could have been easily avoided if I would have looked at my trade window.  It is very possible that he indeed thought he was the winner of the item or something due to that messed up/fake roll.  My only gripe was that he didn't speak up during the 30 minutes we were trying to find out who I had traded the BCG too.  I told the person in the conversation that he could have indeed not intended to ninja.  I am actually inclinded to believe that if he went through as much trouble to talk to Shaere, then it was all largely a misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps clear some of it, sorry I can't remember every exact detail, just please dont flame for me not being able to remember everything! <p>Aleal the Tactician - High Sorceress of Neriak</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarathaen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arathaen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Savior of Drinal</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/24/02 7:46:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=581.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What is life?</span><hr size=1> Aleal, I was there that night and that's pretty much my recollection of it, too.  <p><FONT SIZE=2><i>Arathaen Bloodstone, Lvl 60 Unkempt Preserver </FONT>

thus, you cant ninja LOOT something, if its given to you<br>
<br>
you all know how the spam can get especially with people arguing over loot, and jakjak from my memory was always a fairly quiet player, it doesnt suprise me that if you had a fake or mistaken roll where he thought he won something, gets handed the item, and than has to deal with a zone full of spam and a screen full of /tells that he would just leave and sort it out later<br>
<br>
jakjak doesnt deserve a bad rep over something like this, especially when its obvious he didnt just walk over, loot the item and leave &gt; thats ninja looting<br>
<br>
this is just a simple misunderstanding<br>

What purpose do you think posting this serves?  Your friend JakJak admitted what he did, and said his apologies and all moved on.  I speak of what I KNOW, not what I ASSUME like you.  The only thing your post has served is to drudge up things that would be better left buried for all parties involved, especially your friend's reputation.  You only embarass yourself and him more by posting.<br>

How can someone ninjaloot something that is handed to them by the goddamn raid leader. <br>
<br>
You freaks all spaz about a bcg, confusion ensues. jakjak never was very outgoing, he rolls, wins, so you rolled again or some shit? Raid leader hands him the item? And HE is at fault? <br>
<br>
So then you see alot of spam and hate tells gimme back my bcg you ninjalooter, so maybe he gates to sort thoughts out or escape the shit. Maybe it had been 7 hours, and its bedtime.<br>
<br>
Bottom line he rolls, wins? Even mistakenly, now the item is handed to him  by the raid leader. Then he gates out sooner or later, as everyone probably did be it bedtime or raid over. Then you start saying nasty things without telling people the full story? And branding people a ninjalooter? Then valindor checks logs, talks with him, and he returns the item? ? <br>
<br>
That he joins a guild and you say something to get him removed, something along the lines of you dont like him because he ninjalooted your bcg a long time ago in fear.<br>

I dont see your logic at all.<br>

You are a monk, you know what spam is like and I am pretty sure that you can still read every line written in every channel, even when you are fighting. So I wonder why he did not speak up. He could have told Aleal: You handed the BCG to me and I honestly thought I won the roll on it. Anything wrong with that?<br>
Now that would have put your friend in a better light than saying nothing and gating out. I understand that you want to defend your friend but you should maybe also have a look onto the other side of the problem cause then you would realize that it looked kinda fishy...<br>

Call it ninja, call it keeping something that you KNOW doesn't belong to you while everyone is screaming for 30 minutes asking who has the item, then  gating and logging while a GM is trying to sort out matters. Call it whatever you like, but the fact is he was dishonest and got his account suspended for it. He KNOWS what he did was wrong and in fact being a bigger man than you, made his apologizes.  You on the other hand, look like the jackass trying to make shit taste like ice cream.   <p><img src="http://www.raven.org/images/zandalay-sig.jpg">

<br>
And not everyone is like me, or you, and can read every line in spam. The bottom line was he mistakenly or not rolled and won, in his eyes, maybe others. Hell then the goddamn raid leader hands him the item. <br>
<br>
Know what most people would do when handed an item by a raid leader?<br>
<br>
You guessed it they would keep it. And you say he was wrong for gating out? heck it couldvebeen 3 hours later he gated, or 15 minutes. Someone that plays eq for fun, does his own thing, minds his own business, doesnt do much, is soft spoken, and not as fast as you or me, not wired on coke or speed or whatever. He is handed the damn item, and you say he ninjalooted it? Or stole? He was handed it lol.  The person handing to him hit accept!<br>
<br>
Then he gates to avoid the hate spam tells and stuff, and you say thats wrong? LOL. <br>
<br>
Then after the gm talks to him he , according to you, apologizes and hands it back. <br>
<br>
And he is a thief? <br>
<br>
If anyone should take any blame, aleal should. And you freaks should shut up about giving him a bad name because it wasnt his fault and he got stuck in a bad way. And he has a bigger heart than all of you combined.<br>
<br>
Some of us know what it is to be friends. The rest of you just use others to further your own ends.<br>

Honor? Loyalty? <br>

Sell outs.<br>

And as far as Jakjak getting into Vice...it's not happening.  Let this die, you have already further ruined Jakjak's reputation by rehashing this crap after all this time.<br>

Second of all, Aleal already said that she made the mistake and apparently handed the item to the wrong person, and that there were a few rolls that happened close to each other, so in theory it would be VERy possible that Jakjak was confused and thought that he actually HAD won this item. Those events are completely plausible. <br>
<br>
However, once the people at the raid realized that there had been a mistake and spent a half an hour trying to find out who had the BCG, the question then becomes &quot;Why did he not speak up?&quot; He obviously knew that he had the item. It was impossible for him not to know that everyone was trying to find out where the item was when even the person that handed out the items was trying to find out. Why did he not speak up at that time? Thats the real question. <br>
<br>
Sure, it was very plausibly a complete misunderstanding in the first part, and Aleal made the first mistake by handing the item to the wrong person, but what came after that rests on Jakjaks shoulders. I am certain that pretty much nobody would relish the idea of giving up a nice item that was in their posession, but if you can see that there might be a problem, the only right thing to do is to mention it when people are looking for it so that the issue can get straightened out. <br>
<br>
I am not saying that the guy DID ninja loot anything, but I can say that I can certainly understand that if he did not respond about having the item in his possession when everyone was trying to find it since he had not won the roll that people would have some grounds to think that there was maybe something not quite right going on. When he just gated out and camped after that (yes maybe he was getting spammed with bad things, and that is wrong too, but it isnt the issue we are talking about) that it made the situation look all the more terrible.<br>
<br>
I am not asking you to abandon your friend or anything Shaere. In fact, like I said, everything i knew about Jakjak last time I saw him was that he was a good guy. But if you put yourself in the shoes of everyone else at the raid and you see that 1. a person was handed something that they did not win, although it was understandable that he may have been confused and thought he had won. 2. The loot awarding person realized their mistake and everyone spend time trying to find out where the loot had gone, and the person did not speak up that they had it. 3. When it is figured out that that person has it, they gate out and camp.  What would be your reaction then? Think about it from the point of view of yourself a friend, but those that didn't know him, and what they saw, and see if you can at least understand what they felt and maybe why they felt it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=581.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=581.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=581.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=581.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=581.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=581.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=581.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=581.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
