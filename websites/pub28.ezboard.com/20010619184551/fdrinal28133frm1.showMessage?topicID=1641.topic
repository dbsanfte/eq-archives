It sounds like its going to require the coordination of all the high level guilds across all the server.  UGoD has been working on this under the guidance of Cymbrogii, who have done a lot of research.  Not sure what the source is on these notes--it wasn't us--might have been 1st Fist of Light on Druzzil Ro, who have really been the leading research team on this whole ordeal.  <br>
<br>
<br>
                               General Notes:<br>
<br>
<br>
                               1. Dwarch is serving as War Leader; Zathrax is serving as Scout Master<br>
                               2. The first battle will be faught during &quot;The Festival&quot; (8 days after Bertoxx is summoned to NK)<br>
                               3. The war will be faught over a long period of time (weeks perhaps), and will involve several fronts.<br>
                               4. All &quot;good&quot; cities on Antonica will be involved (Qeynos, Halas, Rivervale, Freeport, Kaladim, Felwithe/Kelethin, Ak'anon)<br>
                               5. Many Gods will be involved, including Rallos Zek, Tunare, Bertox, Innoruuk, and others.<br>
                               6. Zones will behave differently. Be VERY cautious what spells you may rely upon.<br>
                               7. Mobs that are normally level-restricted (Vox, Naggy) will not be for this event.<br>
                               8. There is a strong chance that both bridges and boats will be down for portions of the war.<br>
                               9. The safety zones will be Surefall Glade, Arena, Lower Kaladim, and Velious.<br>
                               10. Bertox will have an army of &quot;planar beings.&quot;<br>
<br>
                               The Planes of Karana<br>
<br>
                               1. Bertox will be summoned to NK<br>
                               2. Gate and teleportation spells will either (a) not work or (b) have a HIGH failure/fizzle rate. I'd be willing to bet this is spells<br>
                               cast IN The<br>
                               zones, not spells teleporting you TO the zones.<br>
                               3. Ressurection will only be possible within these zones via res stick<br>
<br>
                               Qeynos<br>

                               3. Bertox will assault the city after the &quot;Festival&quot; mentioned above.<br>
                               4. Antonious Bayle will lead an army to confront Bertox in WK.<br>
                               5. Kane Bayle will show up with half the bloodsabre army in an effort to kill Antonious.<br>
                               6. If Kane and his army are killed, it will be discovered he in a imposter and the real Kane will appear in Qeynos along with<br>
                               enough Bloodsabres to take the city over.<br>
                               7. Blackburrow Gnolls will aid Bertox.<br>

The Wind Caller [5/30/2001-11:08:13 AM]  Comments[14] <br>
<br>
I had read constantly of the big event that happens in Lesser Faydark on other servers (actually, it's a Dynamic event)... I'd never thought I'd see it on Luclin, much less be a part of it!<br>
<br>
As we finished our whomping in Mistmoore (I won on the Sacrificial Dagger, but lost on the Advisor Robe), one of our party members zoned to Lfay to sell and told us what was going on. I immediately urged everyone to go.<br>
<br>
As I arrived, Firiona had begun asking people to assist her in a ritual by representing the four elements of nature. As I kneeled in respect, I was shocked to be chosen to represent the element of Wind (might have been my surname, Windseeker).<br>
<br>
She each handed us a stone that had strange powers. The stones changed our names. As she pointing to each of us after some chanting, we activated our stones. The effects could be felt throughout the forest.<br>
<br>
Slowly, life itself emanated through the air, and took form of my God, the Great Mother Tunare. As the Mother of All stood before us, Firiona asked if she could divulge the source of life's corruption. Tunare could not.<br>
<br>
Tunare then suggested that Firiona once again make her way to Kunark, and once again seek the Ring of Scale. Tunare was given word that the Ring of Scale would not seal away Firiona's memories again, but she must prove herself trustworthy of being an ally of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Firiona was apprehensive, to say the least... but accepted the mission anyway. Just then, a wave of frightening emotion swept the animals of the forest.<br>
<br>
At first all the animals fled to safety... then, screams of terror were heard from both the Wood Elf and Dark Elf camps, only to be silenced. Thunderous steps could be heard... then &quot;he&quot; appeared. The Faceless himself.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule taunted Tunare, who urged Firiona to escape with her life. Firiona would not. I immediately stood between her and Cazzy, taunting him (gutsy for only 33, no?).<br>
<br>
Cazic hinted that he was not really the source of corruption, but as angered for some reason by Tunare and Firiona (perhaps he didn't want her on Kunark? Hmm..). He also mentioned some transgression on their part, and banished Tunare from Norrath back to her realm.<br>
<br>
Tunare would not be denied, life itself still flowed with amazing power. With Tunare gone, however... Cazzy slowly began to grow. He went from about 20 feet tall to 50 in a matter of minutes!<br>
<br>
He then taunted Firiona relentlessly, and soon Equestrielle the unicorn came to her aid. It was Thule's plan all along to lure the mythical beast out of hiding. He summoned the unicorn, then grabbed her horn. When he first appeared and during this attack, he was protected from al aggression by some unseen force. People tried to attack, but nothing could touch him.<br>
<br>
Equestrielle began to stiffen like stone. Cazzy used whatever power that protected him to curse her! Vulnerable now, Firiona drew her blade, and led the charge against the faceless. He was no match for the sheer numbers that opposed him. Not one casualty!<br>
<br>
Cazic fled, but Firiona's blade sealed his escape and banished HIM from Norrath. She then tearfully turned her attention to Equestrielle. The Unicorn said that she had been tainted, and the corruption was spreading through her body. She begged Firiona to use her blade and remove Equestrielle's horn.<br>
<br>
Firiona could not, knowing that a unicorn with no horn would die. Equestrielle assured Firiona that she could be saved by removing the horn. In two swings, the horn fell off... and a bloodied Equestrielle ran away.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule began to laugh! Firiona Vie was now cursed! Apparently, it was his plan all along to sway her to his favor! Everyone was in total shock. Firiona must now stick with her beliefs with unsurpassed conviction, or suffer eternally as a servant of the Lord of Fear.<br>
<br>
The event ended, but prizes were then handed out to the lucky one who were chosen to represent the elements. I received the coin of Gallantry, and turned it in for some nice exp and a 10ac 7 str 5 cha collar (no drop, of course) for woodies like me only. Even more so, I shall be known as Tanares the Wind Caller!<br>
<br>
The event was the most awesome thing I had ever witnessed. It blew me away. I tell you now, be sure to be in the Karanas next... the great war is about to begin. I won't miss it! <br>

Interesting, but stupid.  I know for a fact I've been in Lfay for the last 2 weeks almost 24/7 and nothing at all is happening there.  Nothing.  That plus the faction issues Qalar brought up (and why would RoS ally to the elves? makes no sense and why would CoV be kos to everyone?  Not.)<br>

<br>
1) Event has already happened in LFay last week-Tuesday or Wednesday, I believe-I stayed out of it cause I find avoiding god wars helps you live longer, but some guild members and friends were there and enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
2) The stuff listed above sounds like either hearsay and rumor, or is going to piss alot of people off. From the looks of it, unless you are at least level 50, your only involvement in this thing is going to be dying alot-oh yeah-and making muffins to support the war effort (zzzzzz). Hmmm-maybe the muffin quest will fix some faction issues I have. A one zone fix would be nice, but I digress-basically, since its gonna be a safe zone and I prefer it anyway, look for me in Velious-I'll be the level 30 guy running around trying to achieve things beyond his level (which reminds me-if anyone is hunting griffs for exp, I'd kill, or at least pay a little coin, to loot them no drop eggs-need at least 4, 8 would be better-for the prayer shawl quest. I'd prefer free or to pay with 10-slot bags, Wu's Fighting Armor or some other tradeskill goodie (need a wedding cake anyone?) -I have master in all skills but JC, and that will be coming soon, as it turns out I need it further down the line for the shawl. Ditto on the pearl necklace-looking crystalline silks that drop off spiders in Velk's-they are no longer no drop and the vendors pay all of 7 cp for them, so if you have some, or can collect, I need at least 61 more of the damn things /rude Verant. I'm gonna start another post in the Market section with a list of all the stuff I need for this quest on the Trading board, so I'll stop beggin here :) I'll still show up in NFP every so often to auction, but I'll have my finger hovering over my alt-6 for Gate and my cursor resting on my Thurgadin Gate Potion-I have no desire to die for Verant's &quot;vision&quot;...<br>
<br>
My original post was alot more degrogatory towards the whole thing, but I honestly don't have the desire to re-write the thing...<br>
