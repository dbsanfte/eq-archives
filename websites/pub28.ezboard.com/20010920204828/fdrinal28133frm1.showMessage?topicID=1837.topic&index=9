But now I am starting to realize that unless that warrior is deadset on being the only MTA guy then that hafling might be a great asset.  How many rogues can take the beating that a high level warrior can take?  <br>
<br>
I'm thinking a warrior scout (hide and sneak) would be great to have.  It would be a rare asset.  Sure you might not have unbashable or inate bash (and therefore not always get to be the main tank in the MTA setup), but hey, you have an abilities that ogres DONT have.<br>
<br>
I think that a high level halfling warrior would be a unique asset.  Besides think of how fun it would be to hide and sneak your way around when necessary!  I kinda like that, maybe I will make a halfling warrior <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

be a halfing so people don't yell at you to get shrunk.  That's the only real big deal about a 60 warrior.

but in this game its all about the hps<br>
if i could do it over i'd make my ench all sta<br>
yes i said enchanter<br>
seriously think about it, the more hps you have the less mana you'll suck from your clerics/healers<br>
and the longer you'll be able to survive in any situation<br>
aka those fights that last 10+mins where your clerics have no time to med and dont need to be ch'ing you as much as they are<br>
let the rouges and wizards do the damage, you're just there to keep the mob mad at ya and take the hits<br>

(uber essay I was bored)</span><hr size=1> Disclaimer: All of this advice is given with focus on the end game, if this isn't your bag, or you never anticipate getting there take this advice with that in mind.<br>
<br>
The thing about ogres is that you have more flexibility in your selection of gear to max those stats.  For instance with a starting stamina of 150, an ogre only needs 55 stamina from gear before they will be able to hit max stam with a shaman buff.  That means they can concentrate their stamina gear on a few items allowing them to wear more +hp, higher AC, or better resist gear than other races.  I used to play a warrior and I don't have my base stats available here but let me use my rogue as an example.  I have a base stam of 100, and I need 105 points of stam from gear to get to 255 with shaman buffs.  That means I have to wear more gear that possibly has lower AC or fewer HP's than another rogue that started with more stamina.  Basically what I am saying is that an Ogre doesn't have to worry about gear selection as carefully as say a Gnome warrior with low starting stats.  Ogres have two other advantages, one that's not particularly great, and one that is.  First off Ogres and all large races get the Slam ability.  It uses your bash skill to calculate if you hit or not, and Bash caps much higher than Kick, Bash 240 and Kick 210.  Now against end game mobs who really cares right, you can't stun them or interrupt spells so its not a big deal.  It isn't really, but it means you will connect with Slam a lot more than another level 60 warrior using kick. (damn it Sallace stop kicking and slam you woosie) The one MAJOR advantage that ogres have is that they can't be stunned from the front.  This is hands down their biggest asset.  When tanking something big Ogres just take everything that can be dished out and keep right on trucking.  No loss in damage output = no loss of aggro = better control of the mob you are fighting.<br>
<br>
As far as stats go Str means very little in the end game.  With Focus and Avatar (from a primal weapon or cast by a shaman) you only need a base str of 88 to get to the max of 255.  So basically ANY race or class can get 255 str with buff and next to no str gear.  Agility is another stat that gives a definite benefit because it boosts your AC, however I believe that there are diminishing returns the higher you go, and again with top level shaman Agi buff, and Avatar you only need 103 base Agi to get to 255.  Dex is important to the main tank if they have procing weapons, and I believe that just about every warrior in the guild does at this time or will soon.  Again as with the previous stats, you only need a base Dex of 95 to get to max 255 Dex with Focus and Avatar on you.  More procs = more taunt and an easier time controlling aggro.  Any level 60 warrior can easily get 255 in all three of these stats without even trying very hard.  Hell I can get 255 in all three of those stats with just Avatar on my rogue.  I believe that almost every warrior in our guild has primal weapons, or will get them soon so this is a realistic comparison with buffs they can all easily get in nearly any situation, not just with raid buffs.<br>
<br>
Stamina however is a different story.  The only high level buff I know of that boosts Stamina is the level 54 Shaman spell Riotous Health, and it gives you 50 Stamina. (if anyone else knows of another stamina buff that stacks with the shaman one let me know) This means you need to have 205 Stam with gear to get to 255 with the shaman buff.  This requires much more gear than any other stat to max, and out of all the stats mentioned it is probably the single most important stat for a warrior in the high level game.  If I had to make my warrior over from scratch I would dump every single point I possibly could into stamina then possibly balance out the rest with the points left over.  Then after getting to around 200 unbuffed stam I would go all out on AC/Hp/Resist gear. (with resist gear being situational if necessary) An Ogre warrior with base 150 stamina basically needs only three items to get to 255 stam with shaman buffs, Breastplate of Eradication +20 stam, Othmir Prexus Totem +20 stam, and Cloak of the Fearsome +15 stam.  Sure those items are not easy to get, but its shocking how easy it would be to do it in a guild capable of killing those mobs.  That my friends is why Ogres are the best.<br>
<br>
Taking this all into account I am not saying that Barbarians or Tolls or Dorfs or whatever suck, but there is a clear advantage in several areas to being an Ogre.  That is if you can put up with the down side of being FAT.  I have also seen guild mates play their warriors amazingly well despite their race choice.  Binadal, Jorply, and Duemin (the aggro machine) for example are great tanks despite the fact that none of them are Ogres.  So now everyone can make arguments for or against any particular race for any number of reasons and Ogres are no different.  I didn't chose to play one myself because they are, well FAT.  I remember playing with Rannier all the time and that poor SOB would die at least 3 times a day because he got stuck somewhere.  Playing my Barbarian warrior I would get stuck from time to time as well but not nearly as often as Rannier did.  Gnomes NEVER get stuck, and well they get UBER cool helms with Goggles and that to me offsets ANY disadvantage that they may have from stats or abilities.  So it comes down to this, if you want to make the BEST warrior possible on paper start with an Ogre, however NEVER forget that the person behind that little character you see on the screen is the single BIGGEST factor in determining if a warrior is good or bad.  I have seen kick ass Gnome warriors in action, and suck ass Ogre warriors as well, it all boils down to the person behind them.  But never forget it never hurts to pad the score with good stats.<br>

(uber essay I was bored)</span><hr size=1> You forgot Primal Essence which adds another 20 stamina. This is why I have 259 stamina buffed with 189 stamina unbuffed. You may have valid points in your essay Hroth, but look at some other facts:<br>
<br>
The equipment for warriors is made for all races. That means that several items have +stamina on them. For example Warlord gear has 38 stamina total on it with 275 hp. Myrmidon armor has 26 stamina on it with 320 hp. Then you have the weapons. Epics as well as primal weapons have added stamina on them. The Katana of Pain even has PLUS 50 stamina on it. While you said that it is an advantage to have that much stamina as an Ogre I tend to see this as a disadvantage in the endgame. This is because of the lack of good hp gear. Keep in mind that 1 point of stamina equals 6hp for a warrior at level 60. It is way easier to find an item with 10 stamina on it than finding one with 60hp on it. This opinion might change once I have checked all North ToV drops but keeping North ToV out of my assumption I am right. Your opinion was correct without Velious because Kunark equipment only had stats on legs and BP. This was a major disadvantage for other races than ogres. But Velious gave us a huge variety to improve your skills.<br>
What I want to say is: While ogres have the possibility to switch more of their equipment than other races in theory they don't have it in practice because of the lack of good hp enhancing gear. Just as a comparison I give you the stats of two AL members: <br>
Mavik (Warlord woodelf): 4240hp, 1312AC, 1170 attack<br>
Spry (Warlord ogre)      : 4160hp, 1268AC, 1173 attack<br>
<br>
We all know that they both play very often and they are both in the same guild. <br>
<br>
<br>
That only leaves the stun argument as an advantage for ogres. And this has been discussed already so it is not necessary to repeat all the points. <p><center>
