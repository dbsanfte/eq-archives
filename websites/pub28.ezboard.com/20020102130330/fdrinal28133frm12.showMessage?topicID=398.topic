A pick up group is heading to the Disco camp, and the Frenzied Pox Scarab is up.  He drops the IFS.  There is only one monk in the group, who states he needs the IFS, as he has no 2hb.  <br>
<br>
The other group members...Jamol&lt;Dark Phoenix Allience&gt;, Dhkar&lt;Raised by Prophesy&gt;,Kalkhas&lt;Crystaline Forge&gt;,Feelsgood&lt;Dark Family&gt;, and Mackx&lt;Crystalline Forge&gt;...tell the monk that he's obviously uber and has his epic, therefore NBG doesn't apply.  <br>
<br>
Said monk gets a bit fumed but calmly tells the group he has to go because he no longer feels comfortable.  He's apologized to, and asked back...then before he gets there the group gates and the IFS is open rolled..<br>
<br>
Riddle me this, if you were said monk....would you be upset that a class specific weapon that you needed was rolled out from under you to sell for profit, all the while the group proclaiming you were the greedy one for wanting it in the first place? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=786>Master Invenium Faciam</a><Br>

<br>
In any event NBG is kinda lame IMO.  I think Aakla came up with the idea of immediatly used.  Seems to work better in mind.  I played a caster in the beginning of Kunark where NBG was the norm and boy did I ever get the shaft on loot drops.  Hello not much caster loot in Kunark as opposed to melee loot.  I think if it would have been a good upgrade then ya defer it to the monk.  But you can't really tell who would benefit the most.  Maybe one of the casters could sell it and buy some missing spells they have been looking for. <br>
<br>
The only problem I can see is that you all didn't figure out the loot rules before moving in to the camp.  If something you want/need may drop in the camp then ask what the looting procedures are going to be and agree on them before moving in.  That 2 min conversation will solve situations like this since everyone moving in knows what they are getting into.<br>
<br>
In any event for the record I would of deferred to the monk in the group.  Sure I could of sold it if I won but being if *I* was that monk I would of liked the group to take care of me.  <p>Rashnar

<br>
Why should a pickup group default anything that isnt CAWU to anyone?<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I wouldnt have rolled on it because I wouldnt have used it and there was a monk in the group that said he would, but that pickup group doesnt owe you anything.   There's no way for the rest of the group to know you dont have a different 2hb in your tink bag or the bank and that the IFS wont just be sold off.

You wanna be greedy and sell shit someone else can use that doesn't have better then fuck you, and whatever you stand for *shrug*.  Whoever came up with the NBG is correct, why give a monk staff to a fucking druid or cleric?  To sell and buy their twink some gear.  I goto seb all the time, if a war item drops, sure I have a twink war, but if the warrior needs it he gets it.  Always how it works with me.  I don't group with anyone that doesn't believe in NBG.<br>

<br>
NBG is great and all but if you dont know the guy, and he is weilding better (maybe not 2hb, but epic), then you may not believe that he has nothing in his bank that he can use.<br>
<br>
Maybe true, maybe not (not talking this case but in general pick up groups).<br>
<br>
Many people have been burned by being nice, allowing NBG, and then seeing the items up for sale in NFP.<br>
<br>
If it isnt made clear at the beginning, every one should role, unless the guy obviously will be getting an upgrade.<br>
**************************************<br>
<br>
We were in LOIO with twinks (yeah I know LOIO expample here, but it applies)<br>
<br>
I dont loot with my twink, no real need, I play him for fun to keep up with my brothers druid as he levels up some.<br>
<br>
A sword dropped in the fort, I forget which one.  No loot rules before hand, so everyone rolled on it.  The troll shaman won.  The ranger who looted rolled, but lost.  AFTER he lost, he kept asking the troll shaman who buffed us all up &quot;what class are you?&quot; &quot;what class are you?&quot; &quot;what class are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
I was finally like &quot;Dude, he is a shaman, um ya know, buffs and sow and all?&quot;<br>
<br>
He then spouted need before greed, and expected to keep it.  The shaman was nice enough to give it up to him, and I as group leader relinquished it to the ranger with no issues, I didnt need it but I didnt want to take my financial security and possibly &quot;screw&quot; others out of getting something they could sell.<br>
<br>
If we went in saying loot rules, thats fine, but dont assume at any lvl what the loot rules will be, always take that 2 minute conversation as the one person said and make the rules clear from the start.<br>
<br>
I can see both sides, as a tank, of course i want the best gear if it drops and I hope I can get it....but on the ohter hand, many drops are not for casters so should a caster just grin a nd bear it and never get any loot?<br>
<br>

Never known him to lie, why should he?  Why can't you say hey he has epic, and if he says he doesn't have a 2hb, then WTF?  Why don't you congradulate him on the epic and then let him get in on the staff.  If he goes to disco and theres a caster that needs a froggy robe, He's not gonna roll for it, why?  Because that's how it fucking works.  Simple concept.  Greed is the core problem of Drinal, and it will be part of it's downfall.  If a monk has an epic in my group, I'd gladly give him the staff, why?  Because his epic is a pair of gloves for christs sake,  why not give him a staff to put out more damage?  I'm not talking about n00b encounters in LOIO, that loot means shit to me, I don't roll or loot anything with my twinks either, but if a class rolls on it at higher lvl's 50+ here then it should be NBG.  <br>

<br>
The fact is, EVERYONE can use anything.  Sell or trade for something you can use.  <br>
<br>
But who cares what I believe on loot or what you believe.  If I start a group somewhere, and you ask me how we're doing loot, and you don't like it, well then go some other place and whine about it, you don't have to group with me.<br>
<br>
I get so sick of whiny ass people coming to the boards, WAH!  I didn't get loot how I think loot should be given... BUT - I didn't even discuss the matter of loot with anyone, so I just assumed everyone thought like I do, and all the rules I believe would apply.<br>
<br>
GTFU!!  It's a big world, and there are billions of people out there with different ideas from you, so if you don't communicate to your group, don't come whining here when it doesn't turn out your way. <p>_______________________<BR>

I fail to see the NEED in your NBG.   There comes a point where having another situational weapon to compliment your already staggering gear falls behind the druid in same group with 0pp in the bank.   Plat is also a NEED that is poorly addressed by the NBG system. Since you didn't have a pressing need to have that weapon, such as a 50th level War using a wurmy when a defiance drops, it now qualifies as a WANT.   Merely be able to use a giving weapon isn't always the best indicator of NEED.  Apparent gear gives people an idea of you current needs and wants in terms of drops and in light of your gear I am surprised you were expecting sympathy when you cried NBG.  As Kbern pointed out there are too many scammers out there for people to trust strangers.<br>

Have thought long and hard and read some of the absolutely inane comments on this thread before I attempt to put my opinion out.  There are a couple ways to look at this really, and more than one injustice involved here.  First off, as to NBG...  That is a rather ambiguous phrase in the first place since nobody other than your closest friends keeps track of your gear.  Still, presently in most pickup groups/raids you will see that a great majority of people understand and follow this practice.  If I am in KC and a TStaff drops, if I don't have it's equivalent I as a monk will damn sure assume it will default to me.  Let's face it, there are plenty of caster type drops out there where the item would be defaulted in most cases, if it were that important to you, you'd just group in those certain camps.  Defaulting an item to the member in your group who will make best use of it, regardless of their &quot;uberness&quot; makes the most sense, even if you are losing a &quot;chance&quot; at a lot of PP.  To do otherwise is plainly greedy.  Vfelia and Shadowcasta have a valid point in saying that the loot should be discussed beforehand, but as we all know, that doesn't always happen in the heat of the moment and we make assumptions about people that apparently we shouldn't.<br>
<br>
Secondly, and in my opinion the real injustice in this situation, is the fact that they gated without Invenium and rolled on the IFS without him!  It's bad enough that you already are fucking someone over just because your little greedy, lazy asses haven't done your epics yet, but then to turn around and roll on it without him included?  That's simply mind boggling in it's stupidity and spitefulness.  <br>
<br>
The bottom line is this...  Since when did having your epic (which isn't a weapon by definition) disqualify you from having a need for a class specific item?  And even if it does, who gives you the right to determine who is &quot;non-uber&quot; enough to be eligible to roll?   If this was the case always, then every noob level 50 druid coming to seb for the first time whose never done anything more than quad kite all of his sorry life and not learned to play their class in a group would walk away with an item they will stick on their Monk Twink and Plvl him up on a second account anyway.  Sorry, but your logic is fractured and your intentions are clearly tainted by your childishly NOOBISH worship of PP.  <br>
<br>
I sincerely would have PAYED to see someone try this in a group with Shaere, and laughed my ass off watching him tear a new asshole into the idiot who thought they were going to get away with raping him like this.  Watch yourself folks, Kharma has a way of coming back on greedy little dickheads, and I will be there to applaud when I see some noob druid bitch about the very same thing he has done to another.<br>

First thing you should ask the loot policy before you join any group. I bet you the guy who lost this item will from now on. Secondly you should always assume honesty in someone your grouping with. If you trusted them enough or were desparate enough to group with them you have already implied trust. If they say they need an item then you find out later they sold it (its happend to me a thousand times) what did you loose? pp that worthless to me in this game. What you gain by being trusting and in turn trustworthy is priceless. <br>
<br>
NBG is the only way to play for me. If you disagree then please dont ever ask to group with me. If I join a group and it turns out to be something other than NBG be sure to know ill be leaving directly after the lotto (if I win ill be giving the item to the person that deserved it in the first place).<br>
<br>
Someone said you need pp in the game. I never did. Im definitely not uber. In fact im the poorest equiped warrior in my guild and quite posibly the poorest equiped lvl 60 on the server. I only get plat when no one I know wants or needs an item Ive out grown or upgraded from. I always try to sell my items below market value and get the hell out of town asap and back to what this game is all about killing things with my friends! <br>
<br>
Just think its so easy to be noble and trusting/trustworthy and honest in this game. If someone takes advantage of you what have you lost? nothing more than a little time. This is much harder to do in RL. You could loose your job for being honest with your boss. You could loose your money by being trusting. You could loose your life being noble or couragous and trying to help someone in trouble! In EQ you have nothing to loose. so why is it so hard for some people to act as we all should act every day of our lives when there is no consequence for it? <br>
<br>
Its something ill never understand. <br>

A. They just gated?  Were they in trouble?  Did they have to leave?<br>
B. How do you know it's rolled on without you?  maybe they all had to leave because  they got trained, or someone died, or their house blew up.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, you already left the group, so fuck off if you are going to be a little whiny baby and have to run off crying to the message board, instead of discussing something calmly.<br>
<br>
GTFU<br>

Everytime I read what he wrote, it just makes me think he's whiny baby on so many different levels and people are defending something they don't even know about.  <br>

Take a fucking chill pill man.<br>
<br>
Go pet your nearest druid, they are not evil...<br>
<br>
Jeesus Christ.<br>
<br>
People make like there is no one out there who claims NBG and has no NEED whatsoever.<br>
<br>
NEED does not = class/race usable item.  If it was so important, and he knew what camp they were in, and what dropped, why not ask ahead of time what the loot rules are?<br>
<br>
Maybe it because its not a loot whore, that I dont automatically take this guys side.  I personally dont expect every item that drops that I can use as mine.  Especially if it is a nice item that can be sold and let the paerson buy some nice gear..yeah I know, wanting loot is not greedy, but wanting pp to buy loot is../boggle<br>
<br>
And personally, at lvl 20 my iksar war was ina 3 person group camping the IBC..this si when it sold for like 8k easy.<br>
<br>
The shaman in the group had one, me and the sk did not.  I let the sk have it no questions asked since he seemed to want it so much.  So no im not a loot whore, i just look at things logically. <p><HTML><BODY>

In no way can  you tell me that epics take you out of a 2hb NBG. The monk didnt have one, therefore he needed one. Now you say 2hb isnt needed, then apparently you have never been a monk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . 2hb rocks for soloing, and in big raids, when you want to minimized aggro but maximize dmg. His other equip also shouldnt have been put in the equation, and his bank account sure as hell shouldnt. If a Tolans bracer drops, and the ranger has 2 (take your pic of bracers other than tolans) then that ranger if he states it needs the bracer. Weither he has the 20k in the bank to buy one or not. NBG isnt NBG (unless you have worked your ass off for other equip or have a bit of cash in the bank.) But fear not, for what goes around comes around. Talk to me in Game Invenium, I will let you use my damn IFS. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/Everquestakirotag/Feltag.html"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uslinkerdread.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlinkerDread</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FFFF66>(11/21/01 7:13:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Man all these posts are dumb, if the parties cool and a class specfic item drops give it to the guy that would use it.

I've known Invenium a long time and he's one of the most honest people on this server, why should he lie?  You lie it comes back to bite you in the ass later, so why do it?  I will agree there are a lot of greedy fucks out there, read my first post.  Invenium is a very giving person, and he plays NBG.  So it's ok if a caster gets a robe but a monk item drops and he's just fucking ditched?  Fuck that.  Khai is right, the mainstay of greedy people are druids, why?  Because theres about 40% population of druids on the fucking server.  They can farm like mad and when they continue to do that they get greedy, or they learn how to distinguish the two.  Not all druids are bad, but most of these n00bs gaining levels are the greedy cocksuckers that I hate.  I have a lot of respect for most of the druids at 55+ and should have.  If there greedy they can suck my ballz, nuff said!<br>
