We tried with NO nukers, well one wiz who died first from being in ae range.<br>
<br>
I think it was merely a lack of fr gear for most people. PLus most were low 50's in lvl. <br>
<br>
You say he can be done with 12? Maybe, 12 uber groups. I dont try finding 18 lvl 60's for eeach raid. I just do the best with whom is there that I can.<br>
<br>
We had 2 clerics bind at bind corner, who came back to heal, one did I know. The other cleric, and wiz, didnt. So when cler died, tanks screwed. <br>
<br>
Pretty impressive a bunch of lvl 50-52 tanked him to a sliver, wout any nukers, and when clerics were first to go.<br>
<br>
We didnt take  an uber group, if we had one or 2 wiz we win. And yes he won, it was agood fight. And he wins barely. <br>
<br>
We win the rematch , as I make sure they bind, but instead ubergroups from clan skall are asked to come(byw hom shrug) and they drop em.<br>
<br>
Heck any fool could with the right lvls and people.<br>

We helped you out, killed Ragefire, got the kill and did not even touch the corpse. I don't know if Ragefire drops any money but it was on the corpse when Boto looted it (if he has moneytary loot). We did not enter any lotto and came for one simple reason: To help Boto. Some of us had been there some days ago for Boto when Ragefire wasn't up. Boto got what he deserved and that is all what matters. Maybe not for you cause now you can't say that you did it all alone. Xilith said that some of those, who were with you at the failed attempt, mentioned that CS only came to ninja Ragefire. Well, I don't know and I don't care which weakminded moron that was but we showed that we just were there to help a nice player. Believe me when I say that at least 70% of those who were there, wouldn't have come when it would have been for your FA.<br>

What Im more mad at is vert and boto asking you guys to come &quot;save thee day&quot;. A bunch of non lvl 60's lost to a dragon. We do cr, and try again. The answer is NOT simply ask a bunch of higher lvls to come do it for you. This is how they leearn.<br>

And While Im dragging the bodies out losing 2 bubs exp, you guys rush in and kill thee dragon. The bp rots, as we hadsnt even done cr.<br>

You guys killin him for boto? NP. saved us time.<br>

The way it was handled? Bullshit. And where were you the day beefore when he was up? Or how about when boto was doing rage, he wasnt up, the next day you guys decide to do him for some cleric Ive never heard of or seen on any freaking raids. /laugh boto.<br>

But you guys killin him? had np w that. Would be nice if vert kept her mouth shut, it wasnty a kings court raid. It was me helpin boto. <br>

Nice that you do it for others. Nice what you did on the Severilous raid. Nice that you help others with stuff. But don't they also help you to get things done? You can't do shit on your own, you need help from people. People who maybe also need your help.<br>
Just to recall something:<br>
Cussing at other monks what they do wrong at CR's while you are FDing in a corner like a coward doesn't help the raid to do a CR faster.<br>
Leaving a party member naked and unressed is an act <br>
a) I did not expect from you<br>
b) which is pretty lame<br>
c) shows how much you care to help others when there is some pHaT monk lEwT out there which you MUST have.<br>
<br>
For the record:<br>
I helped the person to get his corpse. We found a safe spot for rezzes. We found another safe spot for corpse looting. We did not need your help. But it would have been nice if my help was neither needed. That would have been if you had helped. You did not and preferred to move with your party.<br>

The real kid turns out to be the one who has no guts and no interest to help with a bad CR.<br>

When I yelled at Ficdu and hoodi on the botched cr in chardok. U didnt see me trying to get you to say that crap?<br>
<br>
And on trevizes corpse.<br>
<br>
Im taking this to the cs board too you freaking idiot.<br>
<br>
Trevize was in one of 2 groups that succorred thru sirens grotto. He died. Now being on the other side, we would have to gate to iceclad, run there, and do cr. So before that, I said, Just try. GO in invis, make sure you got some coin, and look for a safe spot. His corpse wasnt eveen at zone., it was stuck in a wall.<br>
<br>
SO I said, golly gee, ok petition, get to  a safe spot, and have gm summon it to you. They will summon your corpse to you, helps if you get to safe spot first.  I said absolutely we will go and help, but first, i want you to at least zone in and LOOK for a safe spot.<br>
<br>
That is what I said.<br>
<br>
Now then you sent me a tell flaming me saying how I left a persons corpse to rot, when in fact the gm was going to have to summon it. Wuden zoned in, found a safe spot, and zone out telling, us yup thres one.<br>
<br>
From your post, There was a safe spot, That is what I asked trevize to go look for. When he doesnt, and immediately upon death asks the guild for help, to me thats weak. He could zone in invis, wout danger, and at least look. And if not, zone out and we will come help.<br>
<br>
He chose not to, and while thee corpse was stuck in a wall, a gm having to come summon, you flame me for leaving him to rot.<br>
<br>

And when the sentence 'Could you explain to me why you leave a groupmember naked and unrezzed although you are the one who talks about honor every time on the boards?' is a flame, then you are either damn thinskinned or you know that you made a mistake and can't tolerate your own behavior.<br>
But to answer with 'Leave me alone child' is pretty immature. That just shows your well trained communication skills, retard.<br>
And yes, I didn't see your efforts cause I was running from FV to Chardok for a corpse summon and that was the end of my Shaere raid experience. I had enough of you and your BS style. Expect to be treated like you treat people. If you think you can kick everyone and their grandpas in the nuts then expect to get a kick back, you dumbass. You don't like it, you weakminded? Then don't fucking reply. Go back into the sandbox and play with your toys. Buy a dog who you can treat like shit. He will still be happy as long as you give him food and water. But never ever try to treat me like a fucking pet. Cause in opposite to you and your freaking dog do I have a brain. All I say about you is that you are not half the size of a man you think you are and your dick is so small that you cannot even see it under your belly. So is your courage, you fucker.<br>
Excuse my language, retard, but usually I speak German. I post in English so that you idiot can unedrstand what I think about you. Cause your knowledge in German won't go further than those 2 words &quot;Du hast&quot; which are a stupid quote from a popular song. But I bet you did not even know that this is German, you Pimpf.

I zoned in there several times looking for that so called safe spot.  <br>
<br>
All I can say is, it &quot;sorta&quot; safe.  But not really.   Sure you can un-unvis in the corner for a little bit and not get an immediate argo.  Try and loot a corpse there is a death wish.  There is a roamer seahorse that sees invis as well.   After many tries it was discovered that you can pull your corpse extremely close to the zone out right next to the wall and loot there.<br>
<br>
Still doesn't get you a res tho.  Thanks for leaving a party member behind to find a safe spot with no prior knowledge of that zone and for taking the clerics with you and leaving me with no res.  After all your bitching and moaning on the msg boards about how selfless you are and how you help other people.  You've shown me what a lying FUCKING SACK A SHIT you truely are.<br>
<br>
When you're leading a raid you DON'T leave people behind to just loot their corpse and walk in a zone they've never been in before.  That plus dealing with both clerics going with you leaving me with no res in level 59.  Show's me that all Mr. Shaere is interested in is the PHAT LOOTS for himself and it doesn't matter who he leaves behind to rot to get to them.<br>
<br>
Only after leaving me to my own for 2 hours did Shaere finally respond to my tells asking him where &quot;his&quot; sacred safe spot was because even though Wuden tried it out they all neglicted to fill me in on it.  I had to run around invis and naked with a copper in my pocket and find it on my own.  It was after these futile attempts that I asked guildmembers for help.  <br>
<br>
So after becoming very fed up with your total focus on uber loots in Western Waste, some guild members came to help me out, which is another story, I truely thank those in my guild for helping CR in this zone.   It is not an easy task.<br>
<br>
Oh an Shaere how many GM's do you think there were to help me out in getting my corpse out of the wall on the Christmas Holiday weekend hmmm?<br>
<br>
Fact is.  You leave people behind dead on raids in your pursuit of loot.  I won't soon be joining any raid that you are involved in again, if ever.<br>

i would also like to thank the cats in the hats members who came to help boto also (specifically galana and cronis-sorry if i missed others). during the raid some folks said bad comments about cih and even though i did not say them, i wish to apologize for their behavior. it was very generous of you guys to come and help boto, thank you.<br>

Nothing agaisnt Nadeniel, but noone can replace Thoggy for entertainment value.<br>
