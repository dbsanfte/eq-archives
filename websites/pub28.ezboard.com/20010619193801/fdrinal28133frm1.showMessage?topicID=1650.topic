Would have had it, if not for the n00b training some of the last wave of giants to the zone.<br>
<br>
Some idiot named Sniffer (35 GAR in silver hawks), trained our line of dwarves guarding Thurg all over the place for a while. And several of the little vermin would stand around the giant corpses, right-clicking in a frenzy, so they could get the phat velium 2H swords (sells for 6pp to vendor - 117cha, ally faction).<br>
<br>
It was a lot of fun though, can't wait to do it again (sans n00bs I hope). Maybe we can talk a GM into porting the little bastards to Qeynos Hills when they zone in. GD needs to have a level limit while the war is going on, like Fear and Hate do. Minimum of 55 or so.<br>
<br>
We ended the night by taking our agression out on Talendor. Killed him in about 15 seconds flat.<br>

I myself wouldn't have named names, but the person in question who trained the last wave had been interfering and getting in our way for some time.  Unless I'm mistaken, we almost lost the war the wave before because the same guy trained other giants to Thurg, which we managed to kill.  Guess he just figured we could handle a second train as easily.<br>

I can understand that. Some of us (myself included) told them it's best to watch the fight from Kunark or Freeport. But TK does have it's share of soft hearts, so the n00bs were told they could watch it from the Thurg zone, just had to stay out of the way.<br>
<br>
But they wouldn't listen. It was like having a dozen kids underfoot. They'd hover around giant corpses for crap loot (and we told them several times it was crap loot). They'd stand right in the middle of the fight, get killed, then bug us for resses. But the worst was when they'd run the mobs around. It's a real bitch to have both giants and dwarves being trained all over the place. I even sent a few of them tells, asking them to just stop and die in place. They were going to get a 56 res.<br>
<br>
But they're n00bs. Probably done 99% of their leveling in outdoor zones and have no clue what to do when you have more than 1 mob to fight, other than just run away.<br>
<br>
We had one wave of giants that was under control (the second). The first wave was a bit of a mess, we didn't know exactly what to expect, but we took care of it. The second was handled so well that I actually made it back to full mana. The waves of giants after that were chaotic, mostly because of n00b interference.<br>
<br>
It was a lot of fun, just wish it would have been successful.<br>

So, just to let those who haven't been following the threads on the Coldain Hero Ring quests, here's a brief rundown.<br>
<br>
1. Turning in the ring and note to a certain NPC iin GD causes the entire zone to depop.  An army of dwarves spawns to fight off the giant invasion, which will come in waves.<br>
<br>
2. There are several waves of giants, with the difficulty increasing over time.  The giants don't have any particularly good loot.  The only way to get the &quot;phat lewt&quot; is for the questor to kill the final giant and turn his head in with the 9th ring to a dwarf NPC (and then a shaved head to several other NPCs).  <br>
<br>
3. If a giant makes it to the Thurgadin zone while not engaged in battle, the war is lost.  The zone and Thurgadin stays depopulated for the next 2 hours, and giants line up outside Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
4. The war itself lasts about 2 hours (the waves are timed).  <br>
<br>
5. Many, if not most, of the giants will summon.  If they get damaged by the dwarf army and you are on their hate list, you will be summoned and flattened in short order.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in GD during a battle of this sort, please stay out of the way of the giants and the main battle, as you will only introduce more lag to a lag-infested event.  <br>
<br>
Most importantly, if you do find that you have giants chasing you, DO NOT RUN TO THURGADIN.  If you want to try to zone, run to EW or Velk's.  Remember that the zone is depopped, so you don't need to worry about running into the normal mobs.  In fact, running to EW or Velk's is likely to be safer, as the Thurgadin area will be congested. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udahnlor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dahnlor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(6/5/01 8:03:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Like flies on the battlefield, so are the n00bs in our z</span><hr size=1> &quot;If you find yourself in GD during a battle of this sort, please stay out of the way of the giants and the main battle, as you will only introduce more lag to a lag-infested event.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speaking of lag, if you are a spectator, please hide or cast invisibility on yourself if possible.  If not, and unable to get someone to cast it on you, Invisibility potions are sold in Thurgadin.<br>

If you dont have invis capability, and cannot get someone next to you to cast, please....leave the zone.<br>
<br>
I felt it was a great battle, I watched from home over the shoulder of my husband who was involved in it.  It would of been won, I believe, if NOT for the person training the mobs to Thurg.  <br>
<br>
Again, as stated above...this battle is over if the mobs make it to Thurg, they dont go there unless trained...so DONT TRAIN THURG.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your attention to this matter.   I am sure there will be many more of these battles, and other guilds doing them.<br>
