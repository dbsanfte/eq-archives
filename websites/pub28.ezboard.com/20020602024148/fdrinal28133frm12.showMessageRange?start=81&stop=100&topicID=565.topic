I doubt you'll believe it, but the more you get out in the real world and interact with people on an adult day-to-day level, the more you'll realize that 99% of what you learned in high school and college beyond pure, raw facts was pure, raw bullshit. Or, at the very least, so excessively tainted by the views of the presenter to as to be rendered all but useless.<br>
<br>
You don't understand what I mean.....you might think you do, I know I used to. But trust me, you don't. Protest that all you wish, but its a simple, harsh reality. The world isn't the black and white your textbooks are printed in, its not the yellow and green of the chalkboard your teacher writes notes on.<br>
<br>
College is like the military or being in prison-its an institution. And people who become institutionalized end up so insulated and isolated from the realities of existance outside that which they know, they begin to believe in a skewed version of reality. Some can't handle the stress when thrust into the 'real world'. You know those guys who end up arrested two days after the get out of jail, or the ones that retire from the Army after 30 years and only leave then because Uncle Sam refused to sign the contract on his side, or the person who is 45 years old and hasn't stopped taking 12 credit hours+ a semester and being a TA since the day they first walked onto campus as a student? We call them career criminals, lifers and professional students. But they're all the same...institutionalized and unable to cope.<br>
<br>
In the real world, people get called ignorant bitch and selfish every day. And usually they get called those things because they're true....and most people see that truth in themselves and will agree with the statement, even if they also have no desire to change it.<br>
<br>
See, god-awful as it sounds, you can be the most selfish, ignorant bitch/prick/bastard on the planet, but if you are successful, you can tell everyone else to fuck off, cause the world is your oyster and they aren't as successful as you are. <br>
<br>
Guess what? CiH is the successful group here-they did something noone else on Drinal ever did before, or will again. So, either congratulate them and move on, or continue whining about something that is impossible to change. There is no second coming of the Sleeper. There are no more warders, SoDs, gnome masks, etc etc etc. Primal is a bitch to get now. Essence items own, but are insane rare.<br>
<br>
But nothing is going to change that back to the way things &quot;used to be&quot;. Its over , accept it and move on. Living in the past and coulda-beens just ends up leaving you behind and looking the fool.<br>
<br>
<br>
For my part, congrats CiH-was a hell of a ride and a fuck of a show. Hope this gives you guys the boost you need to hit the moon harder, cause there's some crazy shit going on up there and I want to hear about it, cause I sure as hell can't do it myself... <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

<br>
<br>
Definatly FAR from fact.  I'm in my 3rd year of college and have already used skills learned here in my summer job working for the major power in the Seattle area.  However, I'm sure if you work at McDonalds that your huge post might hold true.<br>
<br>
Not only that, but half the people who go to college WORK to pay their OWN tuition.  Thats right, they don't have their parents to pay it for them.  So not only are they working to dump money into something they don't directly benefit from right away, they go to school full time.  I have a couple friends here who hold 2 jobs to pay for school, pay rent, and pay for food to eat.  <br>
<br>
Nothing like the real world?  Yeah you're right, its harder for most people who don't have their parents holding their hand the whole way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 4:32:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Kerafyrm- the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> Agree Qalar.. I guess it depends what college. I don't even use text books in half my classes. We use articles written presently and we do projects, such as my survey to get real peoples perceptions. In fact reading material and learning new things opens your eyes to a lot more interesting ideas you otherwise wouldn't have thought of. In my college what we learn goes by the real world and life and not by some out dated text book. For highschool that might be true, but not my college. Even my old College it was true, but the University of Hawaii teaches very different<br>
<br>
- last if your going to call someone an ignorant bitch than back it up and show what they did thats ignorant.. I already proved how it wasn't. I gave the definition and it fit perfectly. No ignorance there, so it was obviously just a rude comment to try and distort the actual matter. Its called in sociology a stopper. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uodumok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>odumok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brownie Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/1/02 5:03:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.catsinhats.net/av/odu.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Kerafyrm- the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> Just cause someone goes to college does not make them SMART or not ignorant<br>

<br>
Anyone more than 5 years out of school care to comment?<br>
<br>
We've had the opinion of those in college now, I'd just like to see if those out of school agree or disagree with my statements. ie-am I as full of shit as I'm being told I am? Perfectly willing to hear arguements (as in statements to the contrary, not fuck-you-asshead type things (its a flame board, gotta be concise when using that word-LOL). But want to hear some from people who have the perspective of a few years out of school, to balance things out.<br>
<br>
For the record, went to school as an Engineering major, realized college wasn't for me and went and stumbled into the computer industry. Found it was not only something I was very good at, but also something that paid well and didn't rely on a piece of paper to say you were qualified.<br>
<br>
Unless you are in a highly technical field of study (medical, engineering, law), what you learn in college has about a 50/50 chance of being what you do in life afterwards if you don't decide to become a teacher in that field-that's an observation based on people I know, not hard numbers-might be 60/40, might be 40/60, but its probably really close to that figure either way.<br>
<br>
Friend of mine went to college for 5 years and got an English degree, with a concentration in Creative Writing. He works in computers now, too. <br>
<br>
Only difference between the two of us, really, is the fact that he's paying off loans I never accrued.<br>
<br>
Another friend of mine went to school for 4 years, decided on majoring in Philosophy. He quit school three credit hours short of a degree (failed his 4th semester of German, never went back to finish it off). He's the manager at a restaurant.<br>
<br>
Yet another went to school for...hell...I don't think anyone even remembers anymore. Dropped out early like I did, went to a trade school for hotel/motel management. He's been GM at a few hotels, think he's managing the banquet facilites at a hotel now-haven't seen him in a while-at least, that's what he was doing last I saw him.<br>
<br>
Long story short, college is not the real world...I don't care if you work three part-time jobs to get through. Bagging groceries and delivering pizza to pay for books and beer is still part of the institution. Granted, it's highly commendable and a hell of alot closer to real life than the ones who are riding mommy's and daddy's bank account, but there is still a subtle difference.<br>
<br>
Course, that's just one man's opinion... <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

Sometimes Arrora you have good points and sometimes I think you just talk to hear your own head roar. <br>
<br>
Nightgod is definitely correct. What you learn in School and the way the business,political,and social world really work are not the same. <br>
<br>
I know a couple institutionalized folks myself in all three of the catagories you mentioned. They are all dependant on them. I have a good friend who is a professional student. His dad is the dean of philosophy at his school. When they have their annual superbowl party I get to chat with all these college professors who are completely out of touch with how the rest of us view the world. <br>
<br>
As far as Qalars and Arrora's responses are concerned, you really arent qualified to answer are you? Niether of you have left school yet and severed the ties of that institution. Since this is a msg board for a game that will be gone in 5 years and not a doctorate thesis we will never know if your opinions change in time. I do know that time is the only way your opinion will change.<br>
<br>
By the way your opinions and feelings about a lot of things will change with time. I know mine sure did. I find myself thinking completely the opposite on issues I was pationate about when I was 18 or 21 or even 25.  <br>
<br>
Im still pretty damn young 35 and the one thing I have leared is I will prolly feel differently still when im 60.<br>

10 years out of school here and my take on life is that the longer you are out of school, the more you realize you DON'T know.<br>

You can read as many books as you can find, and take as many surveys as you can generate, and it still doesn't change the fact that college is a closed, and very insular environment.<br>
<br>
I do look upon my college years with a certain amount of wry humor though - sheesh - I once participated in a protest against raised tuition (this is in New Zealand where education costs next to nothing and isn't worth much more than that) where we chanted &quot;Education - a right not a privilege!&quot;, without even thinking about the fact that there is a world of difference between K-12 and college. Heh! Oh well - better to be able to look back and recognize when you did stupidass things I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I do however believe that college is leading me in the right direction and I learn things that no matter how long you live in the real world, you could never know unless you went to school and read a lot.I actually had an excellent college teacher that influenced my major of sociology ( minor women studies). If not for her and all the things I learned I never would have even considered that aspect of sociology. Also, sometimes what happens in the past is just as interesting and informational as what is happening in the present. To me I enjoy learning about many different things. I enjoy taking philosophy classes, feminism, sociology, American literature.. ect ( I'm not a math person though, I don't suck at it just don't like it lol).. To me its just about expanding my horizons and learning about new things that the real life can't teach me.<br>
<br>
I do see your point though its kind of like life experiences or street smarts. However learning about other things can usually help you in your own real life so I feel college is a good way to start. For example if you ever want to get a high paying job your going to need a basic understanding of English and writing. Just simple things like that you need college lvl classes for in order to sophisticate your writing techniques. blah blah you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
To tell you the truth sometimes I don't know why I bother responding to morons I know are just talking out of there asses to piss me off.. I guess thats part of my out spokeness I feel I have to respond.. even though I know they are going to say something even dumber in reply haha.<br>

<br>
&quot;the more you get out in the real world and interact with people on an adult day-to-day level, the more you'll realize that 99% of what you learned in high school and college beyond pure, raw facts was pure, raw bullshit. Or, at the very least, so excessively tainted by the views of the presenter to as to be rendered all but useless.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think that is true.  When you go to school, you learn basic problem solving techniques and things like that.  I'm confused by what you mean by &quot;excessivly tainted by the views of the presenter.&quot;  How can the tainted views of your engineering professor effect how basic engineering works?<br>
<br>
&quot;The world isn't the black and white your textbooks are printed in, its not the yellow and green of the chalkboard your teacher writes notes on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, you're right, but I think people know that.  You're given views of different people on different subjects in which you all take in to make your own judgement based on everything you've learned.  Professor's are not dictating to you how things MUST BE, unless its proven fact, they are giving you their point of view.  Thats the whole point of college;  to learn what your teachers know about the given subject from their experience.  For example, my first computer science teacher was a part time teacher.  His other job was working for Microsoft on the X-Box project, so you can't tell me he doesn't know how &quot;the real world&quot; works.  Another example would be my current electrical engineering teacher.  He part owns a company which makes pace makers, he knows alot about &quot;the real world&quot; too.<br>
<br>
&quot;College is like the military or being in prison-its an institution. And people who become institutionalized end up so insulated and isolated from the realities of existance outside that which they know, they begin to believe in a skewed version of reality. Some can't handle the stress when thrust into the 'real world'. You know those guys who end up arrested two days after the get out of jail, or the ones that retire from the Army after 30 years and only leave then because Uncle Sam refused to sign the contract on his side, or the person who is 45 years old and hasn't stopped taking 12 credit hours+ a semester and being a TA since the day they first walked onto campus as a student? We call them career criminals, lifers and professional students. But they're all the same...institutionalized and unable to cope.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, you sure must not have liked college, or have a seriously skewwed vision of it.  Comparing college to jail or the military..hahaha, right.<br>
<br>
Then Odumok says...<br>
<br>
&quot;Just cause someone goes to college does not make them SMART or not ignorant&quot;<br>
<br>

&quot;I don't think that is true. When you go to school, you learn basic problem solving techniques and things like that. I'm confused by what you mean by &quot;excessivly tainted by the views of the presenter.&quot; How can the tainted views of your engineering professor effect how basic engineering works?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hence the inclusion of the phrase &quot;pure, raw facts&quot;...seemed simple enough to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you're right, but I think people know that. You're given views of different people on different subjects in which you all take in to make your own judgement based on everything you've learned. Professor's are not dictating to you how things MUST BE, unless its proven fact, they are giving you their point of view.

Another example would be my current electrical engineering teacher. He part owns a company which makes pace makers, he knows alot about &quot;the real world&quot; too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just because your teached knows alot about &quot;the real world&quot; doesn't mean you understand half of what they're telling you about it. I'm willing to bet that 5 years from now, you'll look back on some of the things your teachers told you and think &quot;ahhhhhh...THAT'S what (s)he meant&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, you sure must not have liked college, or have a seriously skewwed vision of it. Comparing college to jail or the military..hahaha, right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, the fact that you laugh at that statement only further proves my point...as a person who has been in both college and the military (not jail, though, sorry, well, at least not more than a night =P) I can tell you honestly that my points hold a hell of alot of validity. Didn't see it at the time, but I can oh-so-clearly now. And, for the record, when I was in both college and the military, I loved the hell out of what I was doing, and still have very fond memories of those times-I just know now that the view of reality while seen through those filters was very skewed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So very true, but not in NightGod's case &quot;<br>
<br>
Tsk...resorting to crass personal attacks, how droll....though saying &quot;yes, I agree&quot; to a statement with two opposing viewpoints (smart or ignorant) is pretty foolhardy. That's like answering the question &quot;would you like to live or die?&quot; with &quot;yes, thank you&quot;(extreme point used to illustrate, for the record).<br>
<br>
<br>
And Arorra: yer starting to get it, at least. Now, answer this, though, and please be honest: What are you planning to *do* with a degree in Sociology (minor women's studies)?? Its not really a career path that translates directly like &quot;I'm a mechanical engineering student&quot; or &quot;I've been working towards my law degree&quot;. Not trying to be mean here, just honestly curious what one does with a Sociology degree-I know a of couple people with them and their chosen careers seem to be all over the map. <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

You might have missed out on a lot of interesting things.<br>
<br>
College and college professors aren't at all like the military or dictators. I have a choice to attend or not to and I have a choice in what I learn( picking classes) and I have a choice as to what information I interpret. I get to choose my projects and papers also. My boyfriend is also in the military ( Navy Diver) so I know that the two are nothing a like in my circumstances. That doesn't mean though it wasn't like that for you.My professors teach me not just one point of view they teach me all the points of views from themselves and what others think, and then let us determine what we believe. My college is very open and opinionated. We learn by debating what is thought to be true and what we think of that. Its nothing like you described. If you want to learn more in real life it helps to know facts and information from classes. Maybe you could learn it in rl or maybe not. I can tell you that college has completely opened my eyes to things you don't think of in the rl and to things I never would have studied out of college, but it was well worth knowing. Such as philosophy. How many people would read philosophy for the hell of it? Then be able to translate it lol? I loved my philosophy class and without college I never would have broadened my mind set and learned it. However, yes you do learn so much just through experience and living life that is more than I would know, but education to me is a key way of understanding what life means and why things happen the way they do, and what goes on in our society.<br>
<br>
Know about my degree=) Sociology is a very large and broad field of study and its what I like doing. I plan on doing counseling, seminars at large businesses( such as sexual harassment ect.), and there are so many other things to choose from that I haven't even fully researched. Why the women studies you ask. Its very simple. Half of sociology deals with feminist issues. I can easily go into marriage counseling, women abuse counseling, family reconstruction ( about how to raise your children with love and nurturing), adolescent counseling( children who have problems in their young adult lives), anorexia counseling.. or basic issues that have to do with women's conditions and mens conditions. Feminism also covers gay/lesbian counseling.Some deal with feminism and some don't. However I have realized that what I learned from feminism goes way beyond just womens issues, but more reality in our society and whats really going on, and then whats wrong with it. <br>
<br>
Basically I want to do something that helps make the world a better place. I want to help people feel good about themselves and let people know that they don't need to be thin with big boobs to be beautiful or change anything about them.(Just for a tip of information Anorexia and Bolemia aren't rooted in the persons weight they are rooted in how society and the people around continuously judge and ridicule them. This leads to having no self worth and is what really starts the disease). Basically its about judging the society's views and determining if those are right or wrong or fair to all people which they are not for the most part. Don't get me wrong we are a wonderful country and I love where I am, but people are not fully equal and its something I would like to take part in changing. <br>
<br>
Basically what you said about the degree being all over the map is very true, thats why I love it. I like that if I don't fit with one career I can easily change to a more suiting one, were as being a lawyer you would have to basically go back and get another degree. <br>
<br>
Anyway if you want to know more about sociology and womens studies you can always email me=) I seem to find new interesting things about it every day it seems. my toughest thing is going to be narrowing my choices down and choosing one. There are so many directions. Sociology is generally about helping others who have problems in their life, whichever way I decide to take the path. I like it because it has options. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A> at: 3/2/02 2:54:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 611<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/2/02 2:37:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=565.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> How did waking the sleeper end up at a college flame?!<br>

all it means is I have weakness in my writing which I am working on and trying to perfect in my college writing. Just because I spelled one word wrong doesn't not mean I am a moron or unintelligent. All it means is I'm not perfect just like you aren't perfect. I'm going into sociology not trying to become an English teacher ok. So spare me your cheap shots and grammar lessons. Me spelling your, instead of you're does not disprove or make anything I said or anything I stand for false or less important. It definitely does not mean I am not smart.
