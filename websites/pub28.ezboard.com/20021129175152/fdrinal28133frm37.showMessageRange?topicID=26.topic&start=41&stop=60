Ash the hate hide/soul leech thing, if your gonna get someone an epic it works well to focus on one at a time and another thing, if your Hammers such hot @#%$ and better than the lance, which has a better ratio than epic, wouldn't your hammer be better than epic. Ya you could go on talking about the proc but the lifedot on it is only so useful. Kila though im not Kald i may as well say something bout ya leaving, the losses i'd say is 1. a good chanter 2. Someone who knows all the high ac caster items less your obsession has changed and 3. a good conversationalist. one other thing Ash which is something i talked to ya about after ya left, Why'd ya take Ada seriously thats like taking me serious for more than 1 out of every few hundred things i sputter out. And if you don't know me saying i talk alot is a big understatement, i generate about 70% of the talking going on when were just messin around, on a raid i talk a bit less but still throw my opinions around at every chance.<br>

guiliate your joke are in good humor and 95% of the time very very funny ^_^ but adaster was being plain cruel and malicious... thas not what i want from a guild experience.. however if we could some how just throw adaster in a wood chipper and clone Guiliates.. i could make a guild that would literally kill gods with good times... good times...<br>

You find the guild not to your standards and guildremove and that is all good and fair.   Especially because the feeling was mutual, no one had a real problem with you leaving at all.  Then you come here and post a hysteric flame, that changes things a bit.  That means your head is going to be bitten off by everyone that have any idea what is true and right.<br>
I have no problems really, going through your posts here and tear them apart...it might even have some entertainment value for the crowd.  But as has been pointed out here fighting like this is rather distasteful and besides, everyone I really care about, know the truth in this matter and I have nothing to prove to the others.<br>
<br>
Kilamyan.  No, I was rather bummed over your departure.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the situation was that CS needed a chanter for a raid and you were the only one online.  You stated that you didnt want this to be like being at work, this was supposed to be a game.  So you left.  And quite honestly I thought it was a shame, you were fun to have around and one damn good chanter.<br>
I did send you though a couple of sour tells, as this happened when I had just spent 2 days straight in SF trying to get a hold of your epic mob and I felt that you could have been a bit more appreciative.  But that is water under the bridge. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/kald.jpg"></CENTER> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukald.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kald</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/16/02 2:17:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uashrahmsoulcrusher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AshrahmSoulcrusher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 2:18:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> huh?</span><hr size=1> Trak telk.. whatever man ... when was this? because i could have sworn trak dropped Bp's... cause i never seen him drop anything but Bp's and teeth. either way i think you seriously have me confused with someone else because i never even asked for a trak cloak or whatever.. only thing i need from trak is  a tooth to finish Vp key....  <br>

<br>
You had a hard on for me since day one. You came into CS, thought you deserved all the SK loot because you where level 60. The first day in the guild you where bitching about getting your epic. What you failed to see is CS is a pretty close family. You had a cow in seb because I got a cloak of peity. You had a cow because Tyrs got a Lance of Thunder, and you where not even at the raid. Xilith took the time out to take several people to the hole to help them finish there epic, only to have you f*ck the entire raid up, then after getting your group back down to where everyone else is, you ask for a TL out so you can screw you girlfriend. Pretty much everyone in CS is glad your gone. Think about that. Is all of CS wrong or is there something wrong with you. You where invited into CS by a mistake, your tenure was a mistake, the only right thing you did in your brief stay was /guildremove.<br>
<br>
Kilamyan on the other had, it was a sad day when you left CS. You are one of the best enchanters I ever had honor of grouping with. /salute<br>
<br>
Klaria I miss you /hug<br>
<br>
Jarak I never really knew you, but I do know Kaldrani. He puts the guild before himself or any other one person. He is one of the fairest people I have ever met. You made the choice to leave CS, Kaldrani didn't kick you out. Your consant attacks on Kaldrani are growing old. I'm quit sure Kaldrani has a better rep on the server the you. Let it go.<br>
<br>
The reason CS has survived is because Kaldrani has a very loyal group who have been with him for almost 3 years. I am honored to count myself among his friends. CS endured a lot, and I am very proud of its members and its officers. <br>
<br>
Adaster has spoken, now STFU<br>

But after I left I got flamed alwayz happens.  Just let it drop and have fun in the game that is what it is all about.  I let it go and hopefully not many ppl in GoK have a problem with me anymore I enjoy the game want to have fun and that is what I am doin... This game is for FUN not to FLAME a person.... Game on =)<br>
<br>
/hugs everyone<br>

<br>
Just for arguments sake, let's say Ashram logs off pissed off and writes a message on our member board about him being harassed by Adaster.  More than likely, Adaster would have been talked to and it would have stopped, maybe even an apology would have followed.  Adaster speaks his mind very freely and I'm sure has /r STFU hotkeyed.  When people take him very seriously however, he tends to back off.<br>
<br>
This action would have shown that you were really looking for a solution to the problem.<br>
<br>
However, /guildremoving in anger and then writing a bash on the member board is something exactly like what was described with the coach analogy.  Getting pissy and removing is the quick way out, as if it will be a punishment to us for not having you, or as if it will cause a lemming rush out of the guild.<br>
<br>
I personally believe this was a poor execution of a rant.  It has been said that if you leave the guild in anger, your posting rights will be removed, so what did you expect?<br>
<br>
As for how I feel about you leaving, it's sad to see anyone cause such a stirring of the bullshit, especially when it's underlying intent could be argued as being to intentionally harm the guild, by putting assumptions in possible members heads and planting the seed of discontent among members.<br>
<br>
As a person, I never had any problems with you except you seemed to be more of an individual than a team member.<br>
<br>
Jarak and Kilamyan- both of you guys were great players and never had any problems with either of you to really speak of.  As far as I'm concerned, you are both missed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uklariaminimagi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klaria Minimagi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 1:34:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /sigh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Adaster has spoken, now STFU<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
First things  First.. Aanilye.. tell them why you don't like me..  and tell the truth.. We had planned to marry our characters when we were in Lost souls of Drinal. However because i didn't have the time to be on and because i was moving to Inferni Millites.. i told you and i do beleive it was KINDLY that we should call it off because i won't be around LSoD as much as would have hoped.  So yes you are bitter... and i am sorry if that hurt you.. but the circumstances sucked and the situation didn't work out.. If you still harbor feelings for me then i suggest dropping them cause i am involved ^_~ i know this may be hard for you but please.. try to forget the bad.. and cherish the good... teehee &gt;_&lt;<br>
<br>
ahem.. Nidabu.. you've always been a kind person and when i heard how completely in trouble you were anyone with a heart would help you. My experience with CiH hasn't been golden but i do have a new found respect for the skill they show in how they run their ship. And with people like you in the guild they can't be too bad.. not too bad at all. So i thank you for mentioning that in my support.<br>
<br>
Now... In regards to taking Adaster Seriously... On 2 pervious occasions i Emailed Kaldrani himself asking him to settle the situation with Adaster... NOT ONCE DID I GET A RESPONCE. which shows how much he fookin cared. On more than a number of ocasions i have told Adaster please stop givin me a hard time i don't need this nor do i deserve this... it never stopped so Jareck i beleive you are incorrect in your assumption of Adaster.<br>
<br>
IT never stopped so my guild removing that day was not just one time it was MANY times and one LASt time..<br>
<br>
This cloak of piety.. what do i need with it exactly? <br>
<br>
and no adaster you weren't even ON the first day i was in CS... AND NEVER did i ask that the entire frigin guild go out of their way to get my epic.. i asked on a non raiding day if anyone who had nothing to do want to come to the hole with me... That is not demanding everyone do my epic, that is asking for support for something that could potentially be fun and exp for a group. <br>
<br>
You wonder why my posts are so long that is becasue my statements come  with proof to support them. NO ONE who has attacked me yet has supported their insane accusations with proo just vague inferences and assumptions on what i might have been thinking at a certain time.. UNLESS YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WAS THINKING YOU DON'T KNOW. so please.. unless you have a screenshot of my thoughts SHUSHHHHHHHH.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uantaran77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>antaran77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 10:41:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: info</span><hr size=1> Ashrahm, your telling other people to forget the bad and cherish the good and yet you are the person who started this flame.<br>

-he is ruthless, steals and talks trash from rl friends / online friends (wheres my lodizal shield again? it got up and gated away on its own eh? cool thanks phil)<br>
-he sold ashrahm at lvl 54 with pof gear and STOLE him back at lvl 59.9 with all his good gear (minus maul, which he just zoned into tov to loot it his first day owning ashrahm again)<br>
-his excuse for wanted to get his epic even though he already has 23/23 maul, 'Im more of a swords man and im the best sk so i should get it'<br>
-he drives his RL best friend into quiting eq (seen hooshier/silenka around? nope)<br>
-he doesn't realise im gonna beat his ass so hardcore next time he's back in town.<br>

just keep that in mind when the words and stories from ashrahm's mouth seem to be a longshot, long winded, twisted and defensive.<br>

cya later phil, give me a call next time your back in town.<br>

p.s. excuse the harsh talk but I, along with others, have had enough with this shady wannabe kid.<br>
