Why would we have a roleplay-ish name? I guarantee you that probably 80% of the guilds with neat little roleplaying names don't actually focus on roleplaying. <br>
<br>
And you know what? We had 30 people around the day of the guild's creation and we all had to come up with a name we all liked. Some of the 'serious' ones just sound lame for one thing, and mainly we wanted something original. You don't forget &quot;Cats in Hats&quot; as a name of a guild as easy as you could forget ... well I can't remember any of the names I wanna use as an example cause they're all cliche, over-used, duplicated with 15 ways of saying it, found in every game kinda names. <br>
<br>
I personally didn't like any of the 'serious' names thrown into the pot when we were trying to come up with something because I think ALL of them had some sort of precedence that we'd have to live up to. If its a name from a fantasy novel, or it makes a suggestion about your guild (anything with &quot;Innoruk&quot; or &quot;Hate&quot; or &quot;Holy&quot; or &quot;Marr&quot; or &quot;the likes) then your guild damn well better back it up with the way you play.<br>
<br>
I think our name is great for what our guild is. We are trying to have fun in EQ, its a fun name, everybody who is in the guild likes the name (that should be all that matters since its not offending or anything). If you want to accuse us of not being a roleplaying guild, then do THAT. If this guild roleplayed 100%, we'd have a name that you'd never remember, not notice, and not care about, but was appropriate to our style. I wouldn't like to be in a guild with a cliche fantasy name (i think i'm making the word cliche way too cliche, somebody gimme a synonym)because its not unique and doesn't say a damn thing about the guild. Nobody in Cats ever has issues with YOUR guild names, even if they aren't appropriate to what you do in EQ, so keep that in mind before you go up in arms over something as trivial as a name, a name that we happen to like. <br>
<br>
In the words of the ever-wise evilcabbot (poster of this thread) - &quot;What the fuck...everquest is about fun you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldn't agree more evilcabbot, I assure you we have fun with our guild name and have fun killing Fire Giants to get our clerics the weapons they dream of.<br>
<br>
BTW ---- I've said that we're not a roleplaying guild, but thats not to say we don't have some roleplayers. (/wave m'lady Anemone)I've even been known to do it from time to time, but thats what my characters name is for, not my guild's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img

I myself have leveled on my own for almost all of my career. I like playing the game with my friend, and he doesn't get a chance to play as much as I do, so, i could either be a sucky ass friend and tell him to level himself, or I could spend a few days, and help him get up to my level so we can venture together. And if he lost his character to a bug, I'd spend countless hours and do it all over again. EQ sucks when your friend is to far away in level to venture with you.<br>
<br>
My end thoughts:<br>
<br>
As long as the power leveler isn't causing you or your group any problems with trains/kill stealing etc, go ahead and let them level their other characters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(12/10/00 9:49:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turtles in Girdles this is for you! </span><hr size=1> Took me about a year and a half to get from 1 to 50, I'd definately avoid taking that long route again.<br>

<br>
First, Evilcabot, tone down a touch.  Everyone plays Everquest for different reasons.  While I don't particularly care for farmers, ks'rs, camp stealers and the like, I'd be the last person to say that you can judge an entire guild (especially one the size of Cats) by the actions of a few of them.  Cats in Hats is usually on 3 or 4 raids at a time and some people call that 'farming.'  I, on the other hand, can't help but wonder (as our guild grows to a substantial size of upper levels as well) when WE will be able to do the same thing.  Others will say we are guild farming.  Why?  Because we happen to need to kill a dragon several times over so that all of our members can get the item they need for their epic from that particular camp before we're all too high level to do it.  After that, you might find us in Sol A killing Lord Grimbox (sp) a few times over for all our clerics.  And ya know, we are definately too high level to be there.<br>
<br>
The name issue....do I really want to get into this?  Well, Cats in Hats (imho) is a silly name, but it is their right to have whatever name they choose.  Honestly, which sounds more &quot;roleplay&quot;....Cats in Hats or Edge of Sanity?  Not really a lot of difference from a roleplay perspective (though I must say that Edge of Sanity is perfectly fitting for 98% of our members).  <br>

Do I have a problem with Cats in Hats?  Yes and no.  I don't like the fact that Cats in Hats are usually holding 3, 4, and sometimes 5 major camps at one time.  But that isn't really their fault...they just happen to have that many high level members.  As Edge grows, I see groups from our own guild holding 2 or 3 different major camps as well.  However, we don't have the membership to walk in and take ANY camp.  That isn't Cats in Hats fault and I, personally, like it that way because we are able to keep a handle on who our members are, what they need/want, and how they are behaving and representing our guild.  That is something that Cats in Hats can't say.  The point is, members of different guilds are IN different guilds FOR different reasons.  If this was not the case, there wouldn't be 50+ different guilds on a server, just one big chat room.<br>
<br>
Furthermore (gads this is longwinded), you cannot judge an entire guild by the actions of a few of it's members.  There are people in Cats in Hats on my ignore list.  But there are others that I would trust to save my life if I needed it.  I could say the same for Edge of Sanity (except that I won't put EoS members on ignore).  There are those in Edge that represent us very well (Doofy's doin' a good job of it here on this board, as well as Tatianae) and others that I occassionally receive angry tells about because of their actions.  <br>
<br>
I notice a few EoS members posting here and to all of you (though not all of you seem to feel the same way as Evilcabot), I want you to remember the CREATOR of YOUR guild is a member of Cats in Hats and I believe (though I cannot speak for him) his original intention was for EoS to be something like CiH or at the very least, a competitive force.  So, by downgrading CiH 'the guild' rather than confronting the actual 'members' of CiH that have caused you problems, you are downgrading also the creation and original intention of EoS.  I'm not sayin' you have to like what CiH does or what they stand for (the term 'uber' comes to mind, though I could be off on that) or even that you have to get along with a single member of CiH.  I'm just saying remember where EoS came from and have a little respect for that.<br>
<br>
And btw, Edge of Sanity power levels members on a regular basis.  We did a lot of this after the server split when some of our members were left behind and wanted to start over on Drinal.  We even power level *gasp* our guild twinks.  I don't see anything wrong with it so long as the player takes the time to learn how to correctly play their character.<br>
<br>
Okay, enough on that subject....it's damn early for such a long-winded post.  And Boofy...did you say Cats in Hats rocks?!  /guildremove Boofy  *grin*<br>

<br>
they were so strict on it you ahd to email all this information in to them then wait 3 weeks for them to have a group of people approve your guildname and charter.<br>
<br>
then about a ayear ago the loosened up big time you just had five people applie across the chat channel and bang you were a guild. I am sure this is when &quot;Cats in the Hats&quot; was formed. you saw many many names for guilds appear that had absolutly nothing to do with the world verant created.<br>
<br>
Well now many of those guilds collapsed some florished. the guild Tolkiens Revenge was one and it was recently disbanded by verant after being around 9 months or some such. their stance it was tolkien was a copy right infringement. if that is the case then &quot;Cats in the Hats&quot;<br>
cant be far behind. this is very very close to the title of a Dr. Seuse book. lets face it a lot of your guys have pictures of their charicters with a &quot;Cat in the hat&quot; hat on their head.<br>
<br>
Verant ahs tried to tighten down guild policies again. I am not sure how well. if a guild was really formed named &quot;Turtles in Girdles&quot; then i would say they are failing miserably.<br>
<br>
However all that said yes you want to have a silly guild name you should be able to. and if the powers that be allow it the so be it. however be warned i for see a day when the powers that be might deguild you guys. it may not be this gm. it might not be next week or next month but i see it comeing somewhere down the road.<br>
<br>
I am surprised afterlife gets to keep theirs isnt that the name of a different computer game of some sort?<br>
<br>
Verant is really bad in handling the policy. it comes down to who yells and who doesnt. so if the owners of the cat in the hat dont get wind youll probably be scott free.<br>
<br>
and one note on the RP type names. verant never said if you rp you will have an RP name and if not you can have what ever. they said something to the effect of the guild name had to fit with in the World of Norrath. if anything Cats in Hats is very um urban not very norrathian. You guys are really lucky the removed that from the guild creation rules.<br>
<br>
anyway<br>
<br>
Hasta<br>
