I started EQ octobre 2000 so pretty late on Mithaniel Marr first, then moved over to Drinal when all my friends were moving. First char was a Paladin but I decided to play a Cleric since we needed one in our group.<br>
Well, still playing still around and still having fun playing it (and my studies don't go that wrong at all =) )<br>

I then saw that that week they were taking applications to be in beta, so I signed up. Well, I got in near the beginning of beta 3 and started a human paladin named Malachaix. I can still remember I didn't even think to buy cloth armor because I figured since you were wearing clothes in how your character looked that it was pretty much the same thing. I can remember zoning to west karanas at level 5 with nothing other than my buckler, a rusty longsword, some silver pieces and a fire beetle eye to light my way (I zoned in at night and had no idea it was a higher level area than qeynos hills hehe). Somehow I managed to survive and wandered to the ogre camp, and at that time there was no chief there, and they were all non kos to me. When i was leaving there it was a problem though, because I stumbled on those named Cyclops that whacked me. Anyhow, I kept playing because of these fanciful stories I heard from high level folks (level 15 to be precice lol) about places like Befallen and Highpass hold, and someone said that they heard of a place called Unrest, but the didn't know if it existed. I remember seeing my first ogre, and he was a shaman. All that stuff was cool. <br>
<br>
Still here today as well. Have had a lot of fun in this game over the course of time, and to be quite honest, it has saved me money. If I were going to movies renting movies or whatnot, I could EASILY spend ten dollars per night, so 10 dollars per month is a total bargain. <br>

Don't think I'd ever heard of it because it tends not to get too much publicity in Australia (Sony really should hire me *lol*). I convinced my friend he had to buy a copy as I was broke and he was flush and I wanted to see how it played. Watched him have a go, had a go myself - next day went back and bought the other copy in the bargain bin. My friend quit almost straightaway due to computer hassles, but I laboured on. <p><HTML>

So, around the end of Nov. we installed it and wham, been hooked ever since.  Had Jareck around lvl 40 or so until one day we were getting ready to try the Avatar of Fear in CT and I went ld and died... a patch bug wiped my corpse and that was that.

A few months later I decided to get the game because starcraft started to get boring.<br>
Someone in starcraft who I knew hooked me up with full leather for my druid and some gm gave me a skull of jentra because he thought I was a scrub.<br>
During this time I showed the game to juukak who decided to get the game ,and then he called up rompar.<br>
Rompar got the game then called up thump; then thump got the game.<br>
Soon after we started eq I met romp and thump which I became friends with them. <br>
The cool part was going over romps house at night ordering pizza and then playing some eq as we pulled pranks on people.<br>
I remember one night during hate when I was at his house we broke out of are groups and got with melr and ksed all the exp ,but shaere cought us later on =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushadowcastasoulshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadowcastasoulshade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/22/02 6:22:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2449.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shadowcasta.freeservers.com/me-new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Well I met Brackish and Aximander when I started working at The River...Needless to say they were talking a mile a minute about some game that I'd never heard of, and I'd been a hardcore gamer for years =p  Brackish talked me into buying it and said he would hook me up phat like if I did so I did and then he said no cuz I wouldn't learn anything that way.  started playing Nov of 2000 135 days played...Damn games! <p><html><b>Shadowcasta Fyrecaster</b><BR>

Tho I gave it another try and decided to buy EQ. God, barb war wasa my first char and I thought I was a big guy when I could slay goblins easy so I went for a mammoth haha what a nice barshin I took. (good ol' days) Then I played a troll war for 2 months (only zone I could play in without too much lag was feerrott... run from troll city to feerrot would take me 10mins also lol). Then I updated my comp, played a rogue up to 30 and screwed my rep cause I was a friggin noob. Then I played a druid  up to 50 in 2months.. was so easy and I learned a bit about the game.. then moved to new servers a couple times.. played necro to 50 and anher druid to 55. Then i quitted for 8 months cause a friend that gave me an account got me banned... saying he got billed ... Then I did a comeback on Vazaelle, played a necro to 56 and wizard to 60 which I trade for a 59 war on fennin to play with a friend.. then I quitted for DAOC and a month later I came back on Eq, friend wanted to play with me but got scammed twice on fennin so we got 2 chars on drinal... played Duemin up to 30 APs then I got scammed this week... will prolly be forced to move my 59 war to legends to play with my friend...  what a nice love story with EQ lol  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uthoggdlogg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThoggDlogg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg!</span><br>  Posts: 349<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/23/02 5:13:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2449.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  l</span><hr size=1> was a beta tester ;o) ..<br>

So, they pull up all these great websites, and my husband being a fanatical gamer since the dawn of time decides he must own this game.<br>
I had always played pen and paper RPG, becuase quite frankly I always get motion sick <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So I would go to his office, watch him EQ for a bit then leave quite nausiated. Eventually I got ussed to the screen movements and could sit long enought to see what he was doing and he told me he would let me start a character and I was totally against the idea stating that the game was &quot;too difficult&quot;. Of corse I can barely walk and chew bubblegum, so that is not saying much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Finally he talked me into it and I created a disaster known as a half elf druid with very low wisdom. But I was having so much fun I did not care in the least and I played her until I understood the game and the class a bit then one day declared her my test character and retired her and made a brand new druid in Kelethin. Having never actually *been to Kelethin, I just jumped out of the trees and had my husband (a ranger) come track me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I got a wiz to TL me to NK and ran camoed to Qeynos the only newbie zone I knew, and stared all over.<br>
I am now the Corrupt Druidess known as Sylvann, on both Drinal and MM, and part time monk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He was one of my buds, a group of like 8 of us always hung out. he had a ranger named Skymoon on Tunare, and was god of crushbone. he would tell us stories at lunch, then my neighbor got eq. He had the wrong video drivers, and a pos computer, soI wasnt impressed by the orc centurion I saw. He played a dwarf paladin named fracnerg.<br>
<br>
Then another friend in our group got it, he was Zoshageh a HIE wiz, and had met a HIE cler named Bendara(Falkin's rl ex girlfriend), and they would talk about in at chow every day. I felt out of the loop. I was still playing total annihilation online, irc, mplayer,kali, ten, heat, def-con, you name it. I remember a very good team on irc named 3B were always playing everquest.<br>
<br>
Then Chaz(another bud in the group) got it, started a human cleric named Bjornov. <br>
<br>
I started shaere late july 99, met a beta tester named Meggas(he had some alts, only one I remember was a ranger named Secret), and he showed me the sewers. <br>
<br>
Ahh before that I remember being lvl 1, and some barbwar was asking for a bind at the gates to qeynos. I saved all my money, bought 1 bandage, and went and bound him. ......<br>
<br>
Met a bard named sluin, we camped the djerr spot for mega exps, then meggas found us, showed us the 3 gnoll spawns in qhills.<br>
<br>
Then I went to the sewers, became a sewer rat, and used to get paid for touring cuburt, drosco, vin moltor hunters around.<br>
<br>
The rest is history<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Everytime we when into CompUSA to kill some time he keep going over to the shelf with the EQ boxes and staring at it.  <br>
&quot;I'm thinking of trying this.&quot; he kept saying week after week.  <br>
&quot;Whatever, don't expect me to play it.&quot; I always answered.<br>
<br>
Finally, he breaks down and buys it, installs it, and he doesn't leave his computer for a week.  I was furious!  I was at the point of saying the game, or me when he made his challenge.  &quot;You can try it if you want, but you probably won't be any good at it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I started playing that day.  Made a human paladin to level 5, she died alot.  I decided a big tall barb chick would be fun.  Started a warrior, she died alot.  Started a barb shaman named Sangori.  Wouldn't be any good at it my ass....<br>

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
