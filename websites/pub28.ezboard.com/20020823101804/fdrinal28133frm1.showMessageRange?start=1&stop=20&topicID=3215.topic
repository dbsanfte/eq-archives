So what can a paladin do 55+ where he is the main tank and healer?  Not much at all.<br><br>Verant messed up by making the 50's require so much exp.  Working all day for just a couple of blues doesn't give me a sense of accomplishment.  The less people in a group, the more exp that can be gained, the greater the feeling of accomplishment.  It isn't always a greed thing.  If you don't have the support classes available for your group, you have to limit it's size to get anywhere.<br><br>I always ask for a group in Fungus Grove when I pass through.

It's not because I feel I need all those people to hunt in a zone with, it is because I enjoy hunting with a good well rounded group of friends. The fights are faster and more frequent and there is always something to chat about. I do enjoy the social aspects of the game, pick up groups have been how I have met most of the people I play with on a regular basis.

Lately I was getting in to the rat camp in DN. I may not be the best druid on drinal or even a close second but I can tell ya this on any given day I can get a pickup group of 60's that will own in most places in a half hour or less. I wish I saw more people making their own groups and raids. It just seems people would rather bitch about not ever getting an invite or sit in VL for an ungodly number of hours with lfg on then actually take a couple minutes to do a who all (insert whatever class lvl you want) and send a few tells.                                  <br><br>Frankly I find a severe lack of sympathy for these type of folks. They are the same people who bitch about the current congress every year yet have never voted once since their 18th birthday. With the new chat channels implemented it is easier than ever to start a group even if your 5 other members are all in 5 different zones. Once you lead a few groups I think that is where the real satisfaction in the game is found when you take a few minutes to put together a raid or group in which everyone benefited and had a good time then you get those few words of thanks for the group ect.. nothing makes me feel better.<br><br> Although I must agree  I never have trouble finding my cleric or shaman or my main tank or monk or rogue, but enchanters above all other classes can be a huge pain in the ass to find on drinal. Generally there are not many on and the ones who are on are most likely grouped. So if your thinking of starting a new character and like the headache of timing spells and doing 20 things at once then do us all a favor and make a chanter cuz mine is only 42 and I am already sick of playing him lol.<br>Tater 60 epic drood<br>Darenenski 57 necro <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 1:06:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3215.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> /wave to Daren<br><br>Ghost from the past if this is the same one from MSR with Eatz and the crew back when. <p><img src="http://www.skybyrd.net/soulbonded/oakersiggy.gif" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uh0tr0d.showPublicProfile?language=EN>h0tr0d</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gifzboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shaere!!!!!</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/02 2:36:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3215.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~h0tr0d/_uimages/lemur.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I understand</span><hr size=1> that its better exp to solo/duo, and for me its loot.

But in this day and age of plvling, twinking, people are losing and missing out on the basic fundamental skills I think are vital to being &quot;uber&quot;.<br><br>I didnt learn how to play from being lvled fast to 60 and soloing everywhere.

I  learned basically how to play eq from grouping, then learned the raid scene after I knew my stuff.<br><br>I see people lfg all the time, clerics even. And well , wow! Clerics lfg? wtf is going on heh. And people shoudl wait until ct to learn how to play in a group?<br><br>Kunark release spelled out doom as far as I am concerned. Nowadays its worse with eacxh expansion making it easier and easier...anyone can be 60, we have disciplines, aa points, all sorts fo cool and easy armor to get...and while I like a nice laid back game, and understand how it is better for the general populace, I think it has made players soft.<br><br>Just something I noticed, the quality of players has gone down in my eyes, and how we play the game. And soloing and duoing everywhere is a huge sign in my eyes. The older players(not you kunark freaks) have grown soft, or aloof, distant, the kunark on players softened up as well, and they stick to themselvs and or a small group of friends.....<br><br>I didnt hunt certain places with people unless I knew them and trusted them. Some places, any old group would do.<br><br>Wheres the beef?<br><br>Wheres all the groups!<br><br>I fought kunark , I hated disciplines, and now aa points. Because now what, you have to make a planar lvl zone full of planar lvl mobs to make people group....because we all are so powerful  any normal mob wont do.

Because I'm very social... Also because I was always temporaly twinked for my level (one of the first with ES gear....one of the first with Golems Jawbone... one of the first with Bone Handled Simy &amp; Bone Braced buckler....)  ..  Just cause I had a friend with a kickass soloing 57 bard who got me all kinds of neat shit (/cheer Doof)...  <br><br>But I always grouped...  And I never had to wait too long..  Since I was popular (from flame boards....a lot more people read than post), people wanted me in their group... And I knew almost every zone, so if their were noobs in the group, it was really no problem..  I could always pull.... indoor or out..  Hehe...  even pulled Fear and Hate once or twice...  And I was versitile...  I didn't believe in meming gate for my own personal protection, because death is a part of EQ, and it would be even more boring if you never died...  So since I don't mem escape spells (Gate...SoC...Succor...etc..), which give me a few more spell gems open...which makes me more versitile...  <br><br>I also didn't mind being the healer... just because I don't do it every day..  I imagine it's a thrill for a cleric when there are two of ya in the group...  Then it's more than just sit....stand...heal...sit...repeat...  But since druids can do anything, I am always willing to do anything...  And since my big buddy Doof (and a little unbeknowest to them help from CS...) I was always twinked, so loot didn't bother me...<br><br>I guess I can just say that I was the ideal druid in a group..<br><br>It would of been nice to hit lvl 60, but hey....

Some zones like CT are no enchanter + cleric = no go and it's not always easy to find both on at the same time.   <br><br>If we're talking about places outside the norm (KC/Velks) it also takes some organizational time to get everyone there and that's usually a hassle too.  Try to form an XP group in Akheva and you might've someone die on the way to HTs and then you've to stop and rez them, and that gets annoying.  Some zones are quiet out of ways and takes a while for everyone to get there and arrange rides, and in general just a big hassle.  <br><br>You'll probably see more grouping if there are more dungeon zones that are relatively safe and short run from portals.  Akheva might be good xp but the run is anything but safe especially for the uninvised, and even invised you never know which mob is going to see invis (have had shade saw invis on me before, even though they usually do not).  <br><br>Offhand I can only think of Karnor, Fungus Grove, and Velks that fits this description.  This is probably why people are always there.  Cazic Thule is safe &amp; close, but it's virtually impossible without enchanter + cleric.  Probably need to revamp/itemize a few zones at some point.<br><br>Phantron Evanescence <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufantasmvi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fantasm VI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 2:54:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3215.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Disturbing trend</span><hr size=1> Shaere, seriously.<br><br>We can do Akheva like whoa.<br><br>Its just me running into the fucking place thats a bitch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uxanterthemonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xanterthemonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/02 5:02:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3215.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Disturbing trend</span><hr size=1> twinking it the reason there are so few groups. take out twinking, you are going to have groups again. but then again, i dont want to see twinking removed because the game is so repetitive now a days that twinking is my escape. people are always in the same place fighting the same things. make another character and do it again. its getting annoying as hell.<br><br>twinking gives you that chance to break that cycle. it gives you a chance to go somewhere new where no one is and solo. its unfortunate people arent more flexible and willing to go to different zones than the same old shit... loio &gt;
