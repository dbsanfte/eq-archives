<br>
Twice recently I've been the only person in SF, so I don't see how you can lay claim to something without even being there.  If you want RF then you better sit your ass in SF and camp him.<br>
<br>
The only problem I have with this list is what's exactly starting to happen...people get mysteriously bumped while new people get added in front of them.  How can you make sure the integrity of that list isnt comprimised?  I don't think you can. <p><br><br>

<br>
The fact is that this list is just getting off the ground, and it needs the support of the Drinal community to keep it going strong.  There are a few well-placed concerns, and we are trying to address them and keep everything fair and above board.<br>
<br>
I hope we can all work together to make this a success story for all the clerics who need Ragefire as their last piece.  To that end, I would encourage the clerics who are presently on the list to go to the new forum, read the guidelines, and send in their information and screen shot.  Likewise, if you know any of the clerics on the list, please direct them to the forum.<br>
<br>
A spot on the list still means that you have to put your time in and camp the spawn.<br>
<br>
This works for so many servers... I hope we can make it work. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usaelavee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saela Vee</A> at: 5/30/02 9:30:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uluvyen666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvyen666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 10:19:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3100.topic&index=104>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cleric Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> Just a quick comment about sittting in SF waiting for Rage to pop. The spawn times on this mob are known and therefore just because you don't see someone sitting there doesn't mean that the mob isn't camped. RF spawns 5-7 days AFTER he was last killed so there's a 2 day window when he will pop and that will be the time I'm sitting in SF, not for 5 days prior to that window when he won't even appear. I have better things to do with my time and don't intend to sit staring at an orb for 5 days just so I have to lay claim to a camp. That's what this list is for, and that's another very important advantage of the list.<br>

<br>
"When I talked to you in skyfire, you made no indication you wanted to be part of the agreement. I don't remember exact words but I do remember mentioning how we were helping each other etc and you didn't want a part in it. If you did, you never indicated that to me. So, you weren't put on the "list" persay, as other clerics hadn't because you did not indicate that you wanted to be. I didn't enforce the list because at that time it was an agreement between the clerics that were there, not an enforcable thing,"<br>
<br>
I do not believe his place has been dropped since he actually agreed to join the list. Also when I talked to Funno when he was in skyfire he told me he hadn't even completed the King Note yet. That is a separate matter all together, and as feelsgood said, and I agree with this completely, before you start this camp or sign up for it you have to have everything done.<br>
<br>
I plead with gotk clerics, to realize there are more benefits to joining than not joining. You are not looked down upon for any reason, heck I didn't even know HH and I stuck by him through his whole camped, even died to ragefire twice to help him keep aggro. Keeping the list organized from one cleric to the next is important, I agree, but according to what softly posted and the time that people had agreed to join our circle of camraderie by helping each other, those were the spots.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the tactic used in arranging the list was anything selfish. In fact I gave up my slot in the lineup 2 times myself. I would like to see everyone get ragefire. BELIEVE ME!<br>
<br>
As far as not camping for the full five plus days feelsgood, I know you might have more important things to do, but don't be surprised if another cleric comes in, doesn't see it camped and tempers flare when you come in zone two days later to camp. :/ Just be careful and communicate with the other clerics if you are going to do that. <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/magada/option.jpg"><BR>

If they want to be in on the list then they need to go to skyfire and talk to the clerics. This is a bad idea. I don't care for the rules either...who decided on them? Who agreed to them?<br>
<br>
Why can't a cleric get on the list before they have their shimmering pearl? Who decides?   While I realize that it is not fair for someone to take out Ragefire before they have completed the steps... I disagree with this send in a picture of your shimmering pearl etc.  I mean come on, anyone can get a picture of the pearl.<br>
<br>
This list was made by clerics. If they want in on a list they have to do the time in Skyfire and work it out with other clerics. Not all clerics read these boards.. not all clerics have even stepped foot in skyfire to find out who's camping and who is next etc. <br>
<br>
The only thing I think that should remain published here is the names of those that are on the list so there is no favoritism or bumping of members. <br>

When I ment KSing I did not mean him as Gotk is not made of one member. I am just gonna point out some facts:<br>
1) About 3 months ago Bushido Clan says that they will be camping Ragefire and that if someone has a problem contact them in the game. Well Molgar decides hell I will post it on Drinal.com about how there is no Ragefire list. Ok so BC gets flamed for that.<br>
<br>
2) Heldenhammer is camping RF and when it pops both Gotk and CS run for him (it can't be officially camped..right Gotk?). Well after a bunch of BS another flame comes up and Gotk is ALL for a cleric list..(why? Because no one in the guild needs it). So they go off promoting the list and stuff.<br>
<br>
3) Well the story goes full circle and there is finally a list for RF. Boomi from... Bushido Clan ! is next on the list. But wait... Funno needs his epic ! omg no list says Gotk. They won't support it. So, anyway the list actually worked, people came together and helped instead of fight and o did I tell you that while camping RF, Bushido Clan was actually thinking of helping Gotk take down a mob in Skyshrine. But that would be to nice of them since Gotk is the one that flamed them?!<br>

This is how it's fairly done on many other servers. The list is just starting, and while it is highly unlikely that everyone will absolutely agree with every detail, I think we can all agree on what we're trying to accomplish here. <br>
<br>
A link to this forum has been posted on UGoD, CiH, CT, TK, UC, WL, KC, FE, Max, and will be posted on as many guild's forums as we can find to make people aware of its existence. In addition, the clerics who are on the list are well aware of this board's existence, and should pass that information along to any cleric who visits Skyfire and inquires about the Ragefire camp. <br>
<br>
Hard feelings about the list has already arisen. If a cleric goes to Skyfire and finds a cleric on the list camping the spawn and takes the time to inquire, that cleric will be directed here, but will ultimately be the person responsible for getting his/her own name added to the list by sending in a simple e-mail.<br>
<br>
No cleric is ready to camp Ragefire if they do not have the Swirling Pearl. Taking the screen shot confirms that they are ready for the next step. <br>
<br>
I don't think there's anything prejudicial about the methods for getting your name onto the list. You can come here first, or go to Skyfire first and be told to come here. Either way, you'll make your way to the list. The ultimate aim is a civilized way of camping Ragefire that avoids hostility and bickering among people who would otherwise be friendly towards each other.<br>
<br>
We are just trying to support each other and try to get all the clerics who are ready a spot.<br>

The clerics from GoK that came here and posted their opinions about this list are just that...THEIR opinions.  Not once did an officer come here and say we would not support this list.

<br>
my 2 cents:<br>
<br>
Go and look on other servers where such lists exist for some time and you will find many new probems arise:<br>
<br>
1. A long list of like 100 clerics .. any new cleric has to wait 300 days to get a shot at RF even with very fast spawn time.<br>
2. There will always be people not respecting any form of list, and the server rules give them all right to do as they do, which is engage first with a force to take him down.<br>
3. How long is the 2nd in list going to wait before he moves in ? Example: First cleric falls asleep, noone else is around to call him on the phone. Is the 2nd cleric expected to wait 3 hours ? 6 hours ?<br>
4. If the 1st attempt fails, how many new shots does the cleric first in line get ? Does he get another ?<br>
<br>
So, just by those few points you see a little bit of the dilemma of a list. There are many more for sure which slipped my lazy mind.<br>
<br>
So in the end I think that this will not work.<br>
<br>
So long<br>

<br>
1. the list doesnt CREATE 100 clerics in line and thus a bottleneck...it just visualizes it...it is already there!! only thing is, as long the habbit keeps goin that who first comes serves <br>
a) only clerics of big guilds will get there epic, forcing others to either leave their guilds to join such a strong guild (very convenient for those) and thus keepin all those midlvl guilds down and away from thinggs they need for raiding..<br>
b) the constnt flaming, ksing and bad blood will continue between all ragecapable guilds, which is not really creating a nice play environment and which will take a lot of fun out of the game for all those that wont ever get their epic for their guild...........i dont know how u all think bout that, but i AM not only thinkin off MY advantage and MY fun i also respect all other players and THEIR fun in the game - just a thing to think bout<br>
<br>
2. look up and see who all IS supporting the list.....if u get in trouble contact all those guilds and u will get help ....a lot of help.....and i think every SINGLE guild will respect such show of union if they swoop in and find a group of every single other big or medium guild there supporting the campin cleric<br>
<br>
3. the campin cleric should make sure that at least one member online of his guild is WITH him in sf when he sleeps and give him his phone number :P or give someone who will be online when u sleep and u trust ur data to log him in asap on pop.......well u cant carry the mob to the cleric u have to do and endure a bit to get it<br>
<br>
4. the mob is easy enuf as it is....if u feel u dont have enuf peeps.....ask others that r supporting the list to join in !!! if u fail on ragefire u have done sumthin wrong he isnt that hard really. lack of force is no excuse there anymore<br>
<br>
5. as campin cleric u ARE the one holding the list...u ARE the one to explain it to others....u ARE the one who has to show that this works ....and  u ARE the one who has to show at least some compassion to this !!!!<br>
which means BE THERE even tho he cant spawn, since u are the frikkin link tat will make this WORK.......feelsgood u have better things to do then showin a bit compassion and work into ur last epic piece which will get u ur clicker? well so ur epic is not that important to u it seems(((<br>
<br>
i know this rage caamp is highly contested and is subject of many controverse debates......but i saw how the list worked for the last 4 clerics.....i saw the guilds behind this list SHOW their help........and i think if each cleric whos turn it is to camp rage accepts his RESPONSEBILITY and acts after that and puts a lot of work and compassion into this - as the last clerics did - it will continue to work!!!<br>

That's nice.<br>
<br>
Softly is one of the nicest, most generous players in the history of Drinal. Greedy? I have SEEN her give away thousands -- TENS of thousands worth of stuff. Hundreds of hours of playing time helping others -- and put up with more shit than you can imagine with a smile on her face. Including some from me.<br>
<br>
You are a fucktard, whoever you are. So STFU about my friend.<br>

I know it's not flames, but that's just bullshit. BULLSHIT. <p><center>
