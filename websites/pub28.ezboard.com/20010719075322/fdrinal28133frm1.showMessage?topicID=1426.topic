I am confident that no one cares about his pet peeve with me but for anyone who likes to read here it is.<br>
<br>
I met this ignorant bastard shortly before my guild leader, Leomund, asked me to please talk to Balrak about stopping the harrassment of &quot;N&quot; who Balrak labels as a slut on drinal.  Well, it seems that he was pestering her in real life with some emails that she found upsetting and she began to fear him as she felt he was exhibiting stalking behavior.  So much to the point that Leo either did contact the FBI or was considering it.  Well Balrak, a teenager with the mind of a six year old, could not leave it alone and he was gonna &quot;get hold of his contacts at Sony&quot;.  God only knows what became of that situation.<br>
<br>
His deal with me started when I refused to stop powerleveling my warrior to go on a silly ass picnic &quot;surprise&quot; that he had planned.  Good Lord! I dont play eq to have fucking picnics with children in the game. Oh, he was totally bent out of shape, how I was selfish and did not consider his feelings.  Following this childish outburst I decided to end all contact with him as he is obviously not right mentally.  I did indeed ask for my sebilite helm back for three days and he refused to return it. He was kicked out of the guild for this.  Then I did ask him to ress 2 of my characters, me and warrior I think or warrior and necromancer.  Anyway he decides if I want the damn helm back it will cost me 5K per ress. What total bullshit is that.<br>
<br>
If you want to know more about Balrak, read back through the posts and look where HE ninja looted the cleric helm in Hate.  There are tons of witnesses.  But as always he tries to look like a somebody and distort the truth. <br>
<br>
Fact is, yes, if you want to call me a bitch because I don't like childish bullshit and wont tolerate it, then, yes, I am a bitch.  .  Greedy, No. Liar - hell no and anyone at all who KNOWS me IG or IRL will attest to that.  Loot whore? No In fact that little bastard never gave me a God Damned thing but ask him about the rygor chain mail and the dark ember Penners got for him.  Oh nevermind, he'll lie and come up with some jackleg bullshit about that too.<br>
<br>
<br>
And this is a guy who IRL says he wants to go into the ministry?  ROFLMAO.  Can you say hypocrit?  At least I have the ability to recognize my character flaws; I may opt to not do anything about them which is my priviledge, but I am aware of them and have no problem admitting them.  Balrak, folks, IS the LIAR, THIEF, NINJA-LOOTER that he claims I am.  Ask how many guilds he has been kicked out of.  And the best cleric on Drinal... that is a riot. What a fool he is to toot his own horn when most people know about the mentally ill jackass he really is.<br>
<br>
As far as him judging my relationship with Dymanic/Budwycke/Harakirii, who is my RL x-husband, I think that our ability to be good friends and his readiness to defend my honor speaks to my integrity and his.<br>
<br>
As for Balrak, he will no doubt dream up some more fantasies about who does what in EQ and flame me and whoever else gives him the slightest hint of rejection.  I pity the poor bastard behind that keyboard. He is a very sick individual.<br>
<br>
That is all I have to say.  Take it or leave it.  If any of my friends chose to comment, great; if they read this and pass on by; then what kind of friend is that anyway.  And thank you to Tataiane, who took the time to think and respond like an intelligent human being.  In my original post was  I trying to ligitimately find a good guild.  Maybe there is still a chance, but I doubt it.<br>
<br>
For you kiddies who just wanna keep the flame going... have fun.  <br>

Cute post Penners, glad to see I got you all ruffled up now. Oh and when I have time I'll be replying to your post. Unfortunately RL calls ATM, oops that's right you said I have no life, I guess I better call up my gf and tell her to cancel the dinner reservations since the almighty Penners has said I am a nutcase and have no life, then I guess I shouldn't go out in public, no wait...maybe your just jealous because I do have a life and I do go out in RL and I do have a loved one in my RL life, maybe you say these things because your jealous of not me, but the fact that people other then you do have things going for them in RL.<br>
/shrugs<br>
<br>
Jealousy is a naughty thing Penners, as I said I will reply back to your feeble post soon enough. As far as N and I, that's a dead issue and has been for many many months, but then Penners, I heard about the letter ordeal and it never happened that way from what I was told. So um, I think you and Leo were just trying to provoke something now weren't you? <br>
/laughs<br>
<br>
Nice try Penners, but you know as a Psychologist as you claimed to be, you know I think it's you that needs to evalute your own self, you're very very bitter person, filled with much hatred. Very vengeful, why is that, why is it you like to flame people in games, as a Phsychologist you of all people should know anger is the way to resolve a problem. Then again unless you were lying about being one. Who knows, which I think you were because you obviously don't follow the rules, or if you are then as I told you, darn I am glad I never have to see one because if this is how you people act then no wonder the worlds so messed  up. Some help you would be to someone who really needs the help when you yourself can't even control your own temper or mouth. You've proven it many many times in game. Yet I won't say I am perfect, nobody is, I know this, I can at least be respectful to those who deserve it, you show no one respect, you are a princess, you think everyone should kiss up to you, well princess this is your wake up call, anarchy died off sometime ago, at least the type of anarchy fantasy world your living in. <br>
<br>
Oh and yes again, when your going to flame, learn to read and post the flame in the FLAMES section, but then again apparently you can't read. I feel pitty for you. <br>

Haven't you learned by now that people are going to flame you wherever they see your name?  It's obvious that the only way you can get your jollies is by yanking others' chains.  You're little more than a small minded twit screaming for attention.  A child ...<br>
