I remember Assram from Tunare back in Cazic thule when I was playing my twink there with my friend's cleric, he might remember Dardelion, they went at it all the time, anyway I couldn't stand the punk, then I heard he was friends with Silenka and Reinas, who I've known for a looong time... when I saw him on drinal around level 55, I heard he sold, and I got to know the "new" ashrahm a bit.. and he was a decent guy, and then the dickwad came back, I didn't know that part.

<br>
You and Joe both left to play Dark Ages of Camelot... Joe told me WEEKS before he left he was gonna do it.. this being your influence since you already left...<br>
<br>
I never took yer damn shield... i even let joe search my account.. and he admittted to finding nothing... why you can't accept that is beyond me...<br>
<br>
Maybe if you weren't so doped out of yer brain on K tranqs Ecstacy cocaine and whatever the hell else yer into now you wouln't be so paranoid...<br>
<br>
Yer are not one to talk about loyalty... you make up this crap because your bitter about somethign i had nothing to do with. But because you see this open chance to attack me you take it.  I was yer best friend when you needed money to buy drugs a the club... yer a liar... and a hypocrit.<br>
<br>
let's not even go into what would happen in a fight.. you don't frighten me... you idle threats don't frighten me and to be honest you don't have the balls ( due to the fact they have been shriveled up from drug usage)<br>
<br>
your little attack on my account situation was cute... but let's face facts.... you were never even Ananael to begin with.. you bought that account.. along with wilrowe...hell reinas probably wasn't yours either... <br>
<br>
you bringing my past relatinships into this was underhanded and flat out cruel... but if you want to play that game fine.... excuse me for not having a girlfriend who dosn't snort cocaine and run to florida with other guys to @#%$ them while you know about it... oh i'm sorry didn't mean to bring up your whore Ex.... how is she by the way? in re-hab yet?<br>
<br>
why don't you go back to DAoC and mind your own business.. we haven't spoken in over a year and now you try to post as if you have known me your whole life? yer a liar and a thief and a drug head and you need professional help....<br>
<br>
Do not post again.. you know nothing about me.. you never did... Very few people bother to because they listen to asses like you... those that know me personaly and that are my friends know i am not a bad person.. i am not a loot whore... <br>
<br>
This goes for everyone.... Patrick (Ananael, Reinas, Wilrowe, Waylinn) doesn't know me... he never did apparently... we were aquaintences through mutual friends... The most he knew about me was my name...<br>
<br>
His entire post is a ridiculous lie in a vain attempt to get revenge for something i didn't even do. <br>
<br>
By the way Pat.... yer lodi shield yer missing? I spoke to joe about it.. and guess what.. oh wait you might not have talked to him see he and i both are in a real college not some po dunk school for retards in south D.C. you see... i told him since he was getting an extra 200 bucks from this guy on Hooshier now... for that shield which is missing.. you should ask the Original owner of hooshier about that... that i would scrap some stuff and buy him one simply because you guys appear to be screwed... For all i know you STILL HAVE the shield are simply trying to make me pay for it so you don't have to give it up...<br>
<br>
either way i bought a lodi shield... with the money i was saving for a CoCW.....  the new hooshier can have it when his check comes through.. <br>
<br>
Joe begged me to do this in PERSON 2 weeks ago.. and i have been busting my ass to get one because i still consider joe my friend.... But it's apparent all you care about is your drugs and your ridiculous DAoC.<br>
<br>
Don't ever cross my path again Patrick... never again... i consider our ties cut.... and if Joe is in on this and i find out.....  it will not be pretty...<br>
<br>
This is Separate and goes for everyone Readin this...<br>
<br>
You think i'm loot whore... you think i am a prick.... You don't know me.. never have you taken the time to know me... You go by word of mouth or what some person who feels they need to hurt me  has babbled in a hallucinated state. <br>
<br>
I rememebr someone before accused me of being an individual and not a team player.... There is a difference between a team player.. and a pawn... <br>
<br>
What happens to me in the future i don't care... <br>
<br>
Just please... think for yourselves... if you hear someone is a @#%$.. why don't you find out for yourself.. talk to them... group with them... <br>
<br>
BE a team player but don't be a pawn... Think for yourself.. and become better and just enjoy this game.. i have tried to.. <br>
<br>
My entire reasoning for this post has been lost in the confusion and the flinging of insults...  just stop..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry.... I openly admit and agree i was harsh and out of line with the attack on ALL of Clan.. my words were not chosen well.. It was an attack on the way Clan was run... you cannot for any reason punish someone for having a mind of their own... This leads to intolerance and pain... And right now there is nothing anyone could flame to make me hurt more than what i read from a person i once considered a friend...<br>
<br>
I will continue to play.. to adventure with friends and make this game an experience for myself and those around me to enjoy...<br>
<br>
Group with me sometime.. actually send me a tell that doesn't involve the words loot or whore..... get to know me and i am positive you will see that these accusations are unfounded and incorrect.. <br>
<br>
Jarak... know this.. i do remember those time... And to you i apologize.. i am not that same person.. i was younger in high school.. full of rage and full of contempt and to eb honest i was not the best person to be around.<br>
<br>
In the last 2 years i have become someone else... MY days in college and with people close to me have made me find that the person i was.. even I HATED... i am not that boy anymore... And i ask you not to judge me on things that happened so long ago... Give me a tell sometime i would actually like to talk to you..<br>
<br>
I am sorry to everyone that i have caused disruption in their lives. This was not the best way to go about things.It just angered me that my reason for leaving clan was completely fabircated and being spread..<br>
<br>
i left Clan Skallagrim because i  feel that Certain individuals in the roles of leadership and  a few individuals who were close to the leadership, were both disrespectful and uncaring.<br>
<br>
I /guildremoved myself on that day because of the harsh things Adaster said to me then and in the past... none of any of this has anything to do with loot, the lance, or my epic. It never did.<br>
<br>
I would ask that Aleal... someone with Admin ability just close this thread.. lock it... i don't want to fight anymore... i just wanted to be heard... because i fealt that i was not being permitted to... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usinolas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinolas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/17/02 6:29:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The TRUTH about Clan Skallagrim</span><hr size=1> This thread is starting to get funny.<br>

At first I just thought you whined too much, or you couldn't shut up. No real biggie, there's lots of whiners and you learn to tune them out. Left clan? what ever, maybe clan wasn't right for you. But all this posting crap puts a whole new spin on you. Stole a Lod shield? Stole you account back after you sold it? Spreading lies about people you know in real life after they warn us what a scum bag you are? You wouldn't be Matona's brother perchance would ya? Cuz if you are, we might all have to reconsider her stories of her brother stealing all the blue diamonds, and ninja looting breast plates and such.<br>

Just wanted to say thanks for wishing me well, I'd like to do the same for you and any of my old friends that might see this.  They were fun times, while they lasted.<br>
<br>
And to Pat, and Phil.  I'm going to buy a pair of Nerf bats and let you two beat the crap out of eachother until you feel better.  <br>

P.S.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to add that, as Ananael mentioned, me = Silenka.  The old Silenka that Jar, Domo, Aleal remember.  And probably anyone else that remembers the days of O.K. and so on.<br>
  <br>
Now those were fun times for me, making Vodka and other assorted booze for the two drunks(Read: Domo and JarJar), and laughing at Reinas.  Ahh, the memories. =p<br>

I got to know you as a friend in GOTK. After you left I heard you took the account back because you got lvl 60.. .<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if this is even the Ashrahm I know from GOTK like you said it was. All I know it's alot of banter and useless flaming here. Clan Skallagrim is a great guild. If you have problems with a few no reason to bash the guild that took you in and you consider friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
I spoke to you after you left and sorry you left.  However it's very dissapointing to see you post something like this. <br>
<br>
I Do not think you are the same Ashrahm I grew to know in GOTK.<br>

You say &quot;Yes i did whine about all the SHD Deffering, but I was online when you were let into Clan. You were told you were Going to be at the &quot;bottom of the barrell&quot; Because our old timers that we knew were in it for the long run always get first dibs. They are what makes Clan Skallagrim stay strong and going.  You said you understood and had no problem with that. We didnt even need you when you were let in, you were let in by mistake if I remember correctly. So all the &quot;I was farther along bullshit&quot; Dosent matter because on your day of interance you were told you would be last. If you had any problems with that you should have /guildremoved alot longer before that.  I havent played much lately due to RL issues. But Clan Skallagrim isnt a sinking ship, I along with many others will be CS if it gets down to 30 members, its all about family, and its all about friends you have had for 2 years. I have known 20+ CS members for 2 years or more, which is why i'm still in a such a low lvl. 54 is low for CS. But They know I dont care about loot, I care about Family.<br>
