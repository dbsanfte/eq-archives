<br>
Yes I am sure most of you know I left GoK, but if ANYTHING would have kept me in GoK it would have been Garathson, Festyr and a few others they know their names.  Sorry I am not in the mood right now to list them all this is the first time I read this post and it took me at least 4 hrs to get through all of it.<br>
<br>
OMG Marias how many times did I come to you about ppl Flaming me.  You want to know something it hurts... and the ppl who did it know who they are cause I refused to give my friends their names although I printed the logs to remind me how stupid and immature ppl can be.  I play this game to have fun if I want Crap I'll go and talk to my Ex he has enough BS to say about me.  I got alot of Love for a lot of ppl, and I just want them to know this.  And as for Garathson I may tease him about not being able to hold a Tuant but that is because I am Teasing.. its not a flame, its not a Mean remark saying he lacks skill... Its something to bring a smile on his face and works everytime.  /hugs Garathson<br>
<br>
Garathson has been there to support me has been there to cheer me up when ppl do this crap to me, and I am there for him till the end.  Btw Garathson Sorry for not saying goodbye but didn't see you online (.  If Garathson ever needs me and I am available to help he knows he can count on me and that is what ppl should be here for.<br>
<br>
I am tired of hearing everyone whine about everyone else cause of stupid things.  Why can't you work your problems out in Tells or Gawd Forbid Drop this Crap... I have alot of ppl that are on my personal sheet list but you don't see me throwing posts up, or even belittling them.. I group with them on occasional.  You wanna know why cause this is a Frickin Game and I pay the monthly bill so that I can ENJOY myself not to hear ppl rant and rave over stupid sheet.  <br>
<br>
And above all else Marias STFU plz I got a headache and I am tired of being in the middle of this crap.  I have stood up for you and this is the final straw.. I can't defend you if you dig the hole deeper sooo all I got to say is maybe if you showed some respect you'd get some in return, kk? Now I am still your friend and I am there for you Marias, but I am Garathson's friend too.. and at this point you are making EVERYTHING I have said about you look like a Sham *sigh*.  I am no longer gettin involved in this and if you ask me to choose a side Marias you may be surprised at the result because at this point You sound JUST like everyone who did this to me, and I remember what you said about them although I'd never call you that =(.<br>

I encourage people NOT to come stick up for me or get involved in my quarels , If it doesn't concern them there is no reason for them to come post and have a buncha jack asses flame them for stateing a Fact ....<br>
<br>
 Now , Bangle  TY SOOOO Much  HAHAHA .. I now can be perfectly content with what you're talking about ...  And even on UGoD boards people came to say what really happened , people that I had no ties to ....  LOL ever wonder about the other people she  all of a sudden &quot; Hates &quot; ??  Because they wouldn't play or lil games either ...<br>
<br>
  Now Slokt ... I've  gotten an E Mail  that made me realize the seriousness of your Accusations ... Now I ask you .. If you feel I did something wrong and you were there are the computer when it happened , Why didn't you screen shot the text , Log the Text , and then report me for it .... If you hate me sooo much that would have given you the Chance to have me Ban'd for good , but you didn't ....<br>
<br>
  Slokt , you decided to come talk about my RL an shyt so here you go bud ...  Me and my friends Joke around , tell dirty jokes , and have a good time ... Beacause you are sooo sick to take 2 ppl joking around and start thinking of playing with yourself  does not mean I think like you ...  You are like one of those people who will report a man for standing too close to his daughter when Hugging her Goodnight , There's nothing Pervurse about it but in your SICK FUCKING HEAD   the Urges you have to do things that Are un-acceptable  you must slander the persons name just beacause you think of what YOU want to do  and ASUME they are thinking the same way ...   SLOKT , I think you need a Shrink (head-doctor) Seriouslly  before the urges get to you and you do something Horrible ... I feel for any Children allowd to have contact with you ... My Sister was the Victim of Perverts like you , he allways acted the same way , First person to jump and call someone a perv  for  somethin Harmless .....   Slokt , Don't think I'm saying this just to piss you off because I'm not , I seriouslly think you have a problem  that you need to  look into ... you disgust me and do not deserve to breathe <br>
<br>
<br>
   NOW , Back to EQ ....  Ronnadorr ,  I was waiting on your post .. you're allways jumping to defend Garathson ,  Ofcourse when I left GoTK  it was YOU that  was Crying and Bitching , YOU were the main person I was trying to stick up for , and YOU turned tail and took off soon as they Said I left for not getting my way ... I don't expect you to admit it  and I don't blame you for all the shit you talk ,  You gotta  keep up the act .....<br>
<br>
    Garathson , OK  this time I'm gonna try to be clear  and not use all the foul language so MAYBE you can actually understand WHY it is  I say you're sooo egotistical , and think about it as you read cause you know you can relate .....   You came here saying how Kildorn is 2x the shaman then me , all the things that other people can do better then me , and all that crap ....  Yes , I have an Ego , I do not compare myself to every single person  wondering if they are better then me , I don't need anyone to pat me on the back and tell me I did good ... When I accomplish something I haven't done before  wich  I had trouble with , I'm happy for Myself , I don't care who else can do it or who can do it better  ...   You , on the other hand , you gotta  compare yourself to everyone else , You NEED people to give you props  or you're not satisfied ....  I remember back in DL  you were dueling some guy  and I decided to Heal him just to fuck around ( back when we were guilded)  cause you were smacking him like a bitch ....  You won even after  my heals   and I told you  what a good job you did ....  Then you told me to give you props in GU  ... I Hesitated and you got a lil snippy ...  That is when I realized how much your EGO played in on your Friendships ...  Now , when I stopped giveing you props  and left GoTK  it all of a sudden  turned into  &quot; Oh I never liked you anyways &quot;  ....  SUUUUUUURE  , I was your Friend when I was patting you on yer back ...... <br>
<br>
 Garathson I'm gonna make you happy , I recall you talking about  me &quot; backing &quot; CiH  on the TK flame  and someone calling me an Ass Kisser ....  See Garathson I'm  gonna compare you to CiH .....   Garathson , If I had continued to tell you  how good you were and how much you own  and yada yada , you'd still call me friend .. I HATE THAT ...  I LIKE that fact that EVEN AFTER I made a GOOD comment about CiH  I still caught shit ... That shows that no matter how much you give them Props it doesn't change the way they feel about you .....   I don't like to have to sit there and congradulate someone every 5 minutes  or stick up for them Constantly  just to stay in there good graces , wich is WHY I do not like you Garathson  .. wich is also why my friends don't come here and stick up for me ... they don't have to , I can fight my own battles , they don't feel that they have to come back me up in order to stay my friend ........<br>
<br>
<br>
  Seke ,  heh  well , I wasn't planning on Flaming you in this Thread , BUT  you just HAD to come make a shitty comment ..  Seke , UGoD  is a DAMN GOOD  thing , It's there so that people do not have to leave their guilds to do the fun shit ...  A LOT guilds on this server would either not Exist  or would not have visisted the planes yet  if it were not for UGoD ....  I DO think  that with the riseing levels  in mass numbers and the  Better stuff opening up for the Game  , Fear , Pog , Hate , and  PoA  are  not gonna keep this going ...  WE BOTH feel the same way , I've given you option after option and offerred to help you  get things started NUMEROUS TIMES  without asking a damn thing except fun ... YOU YOURSELF , have said that GoTK abandoned UGoD  and you will do anything to get them back in the Mix , beacause they ARE the biggest Guild afilliated with UGoD ( wich I agree they ARE the biggest  guild affilliated with UGoD )   ... What you are doing in PoA , the lil twist there  is one of the things  that fall under &quot; doing anything to get GoTK back in the mix of UGoD &quot;  .  By your own admission I have done a lot to help UGoD , therefore I have a reason to Voice my opinion if I feel things aren't right within UGoD ....and I simply am telling you that If they don't want in , don't  go out of your way and kiss anyones ass to get um back  ..... <br>
<br>
  That basically Covers all I needed to Say here ... It's kinda getting Old and annoying allready .... I got what I wanted , I know who my &quot; Friends&quot; Are   and I got to use a lot of Profanity in the Process ....   Plus  I got to  Squeeze out this &quot;Underground&quot;  of Marias Haters ... TY Slokt for that LOL It was funny to hear that soo many people talk shyt behind my back .. Very Cowardly of you = ) <br>
<br>
<br>
  anyhow , So long =p<br>
<br>
Marias<br>
<br>
OH , also  just to clear 1 thing Up on a previous post , Dairmuid was NOT my puller in PoH  , He usually pulled for Nida ,  people that Pulled for me were Nodda and Treshorn and if they weren't available then we usually ended up with a first time puller who we taught how to pull the plane = p  TY <br>
<br>
ALSO , Slokt .. hehe Have no fear .. I only think of you when i touch myself /kiss *wink*   YOU PERVERT !!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukbern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kbern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/27/01 11:15:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  /Flame Garathson Because I'm bored and you suck!</span><hr size=1> Cool more Florida people, well at least one anyway lol<br>

&quot;Seke , heh well , I wasn't planning on Flaming you in this Thread , BUT you just HAD to come make a shitty comment&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, there, ya pepped up ape, but I choose to defend the people I consider friends when they are unjustly and unfairly flamed.  The stuff about yer crappy Inny raid is whole other subject that should probably be its own thread.  I was glad you tried, I was really looking forward to it, and I honestly believed that if you had actually been prepared (log on ahead of time, already possessing the necessary portal stones, and making sure we could go up at the scheduled time), we might have even pulled it off.  But what you actually did during the raid itself seemed pretty awful to me.  You showed up late, you didn't have the Hate stones, and we were missing a variety of crucial classes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Seke , UGoD is a DAMN GOOD thing , It's there so that people do not have to leave their guilds to do the fun shit ... A LOT guilds on this server would either not Exist or would not have visisted the planes yet if it were not for UGoD .... I DO think that with the riseing levels in mass numbers and the Better stuff opening up for the Game , Fear , Pog , Hate , and PoA are not gonna keep this going&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, at least we agree on something. <br>
<br>
&quot;... WE BOTH feel the same way , I've given you option after option and offerred to help you get things started NUMEROUS TIMES without asking a damn thing except fun&quot;<br>
<br>
Que?  Option after option?  Helped me what?  When?  We discussed the Inny raid after it happened, we talked about it before it happened, and what else?  <br>
<br>
&quot; ... YOU YOURSELF , have said that GoTK abandoned UGoD and you will do anything to get them back in the Mix , beacause they ARE the biggest Guild afilliated with UGoD ( wich I agree they ARE the biggest guild affilliated with UGoD )&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said they abandoned UGoD, so don't put words in my mouth.  I did say they do primarily guild only events, and I don't blame them.  If I had Molgar's personnel, I'd do the same thing.  They are still &quot;in the mix&quot; as far as I am considered.  Look around at any UGoD raid and you'll see a solid showing of GotK tags.  <br>
<br>
&quot; ... What you are doing in PoA , the lil twist there is one of the things that fall under &quot; doing anything to get GoTK back in the mix of UGoD &quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
You're accusing me of defaulting the blade to Garathson because I want GotK to do more open raids?  Jeezus, when did this become conspiracy theory?  Garathson is my *FRIEND* (guess you don't understand that) and he's done more for me than any high level warrior on the server.  He's helped me come up with a list of possible raid attendees.  He's helping plan the raid somewhat.  He's going to be my #1 MA on this raid.  He went to Air with Amadagu on the first raid of this style that happened a few months ago and didn't get a blade then.  I feel he deserves the blade, I want him to have the blade, and I hope I can get it for him, not so Molgar will beg forgiveness for shunning UGoD and thank me for getting his guild's main tank closer to his epic, but really so my friend Garathson could get 1 step closer to his epic.  There's no hidden agenda here.  My agenda is wide open for all to see--I want my friend Garathson to have his lightsabers.  Somewhere in the twisted mess of neurons you call a brain, maybe you're trying to find some deeper meaning, but I'm sorry, you're not going to find any.  <br>
<br>
&quot; . By your own admission I have done a lot to help UGoD , therefore I have a reason to Voice my opinion if I feel things aren't right within UGoD ....and I simply am telling you that If they don't want in , don't go out of your way and kiss anyones ass to get um back ..... &quot;<br>
<br>
You have done a lot, I commend you for what you've done.  I just don't get how, cause I've been on one of your raids and I was not impressed.  And you know I'm not trying to kiss anyone's ass.  I'm trying to have some goddamn fun in this game, and going to the Plane of Air with 24 of my closest buds and getting them rare epic items sounds like a hell of a way to do that.  <br>
<br>
Put away your conspiracy theories and whatever else you're working on there, psycho.  Grats on 60.  Look around.  Kinda lonely up there when nobody cares, huh?  <br>

Your the one saying some sick shit to people you you try imply that Slokt is a child molester?   He in fact did not report you for the same fucking reason I don't report people, it ain't worth spending 2 hours of playtime waiting to hear a GM say he ain't gonna do shit.   Slokt doesn't raise a huge stink with GM's cuz he is too busy hunting and helping friends.    You know for a fact your statements are the ramblings of your own idiotic fancy.  What sort of mental deficiency would cause you to come to the conclusion you did?<br>
<br>
I know your type.   You think the anonymity of the internet is fair game for whatever derpraved comments/behaviour you think if funny at the time.   Gives you a chance to say shit you would get your ass kicked for in RL.  And thats true.  But there are limits to that.   I think what you said qualifies as over the line.  Apparently so do others.<br>
<br>
And don't let your head get too big over the &quot;Underground of Marias Haters&quot;.   Its not like a guild or anything, lol.   You make it sound like we log on thinking things like &quot;Man, how can I spread shit about Marias?&quot; HARHARHRA.   Hell I don't even think about you till you decided to consecutively rip on 3 of the best people in this game for some of the most bullshit reasons I have heard in a long time.   And don't think your fooling anyone with your &quot;Officially over with this Thread&quot; BS, we know your still reading.<br>

ok, this I had to point out. What marias is saying can be symbolized as follows:<br>
