So you don't like someone? DEAL with it. Don't try to humiliate them, mock them or anything else that is sooo incredibly childish that my 5 yr. old is too mature to do. <br>
Racism and abuse are wrong, that is a fact. And the only fact that matters in this whole stinking thread.<br>
As to the rest of the 'facts'... history is in the eye of the writer. For every so called 'fact' there are at least 3 other 'facts' written by someone else with a different point of view. So what?? Just because someone doesn't believe the EXACT same things that you do... you have to ridicule them? <br>
One of the great things about the United States of America is that we have the right to choose our beliefs. We don't have to live in fear of people cramming their beliefs down our throat.  <br>
You should be happy that someone doesn't agree with you or believe in the same things you do. It means that you are in a somewhat FREE society.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uducwynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ducwynn</A> at: 2/10/02 9:52:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucallandrakotc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Callandra KoTC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Undead Magnet</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/10/02 9:58:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mediatechpro.com/gif_samples/mm3/butterflyT.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Herstory..and I am sticking to it.</span><hr size=1> I agree.

But one thing does stick out... someone doesn't like someone.. and they are trying to make that other person look bad. Didn't we stop that sort of thing in 8th grade?

Everything Callandria wrote was perfectly correct. Just for the record I do know what happened after Spain first started colonizing America. My only point was that Spain initially had something to do with it by spreading the word about all the riches and land throughout Europe. Then like Folok and Callandra and many others said, other places in Europe came and basically took it over and made what we know have today. I only added Spain to defend what the Original Flame, made about 30 posts ago=), said about the Spainish at war. If he had been racist towards Other parts of Europe I would have included that part too, but I didn't realize I was suppose to go through the entire History lesson to just bring up the little information about Spain. <br>
<br>
Regardless I am sorry for this stupid Flame. My whole Point in the end was " Can't We All Just Get Along Dammit" =)<br>

Why didn't I know that?<br>
<br>
I had not posted becuase you didn't say a single thing intelligent enough to respond to.<br>
<br>
Do you honestly think you could do to me what you said?  If you really believe that then you are sadly mistaken.  I've never seen you.  But from my experience, people that actually can/would do that don't go around boasting about it.  They wait until you cross them.  You are lacking in so many brain cells that you would probably end up cutting yourself in the attempt.<br>
<br>
You are so full of crap that your eyes are brown.  You can stop pretending like you are some tough guy, I doubt many people here believe.<br>
<br>
I can imagine you saying right now: &quot;Oh, but I know Karate, I watched 'Karate Kid' a hundred times.&quot;  You make me sick if you think that would help you against me.<br>
<br>
Boy, I could tap you on the forehead and you would fall down crying and begging me not to hurt you.  Or I could go and give a heart-punch and make your heart skip a couple of beats.  You can try and punch me and I use your own momentum to put you head first through a wall.<br>
<br>
In short.  You go off talking trash, but you've never seen me fight.  You have absolutely no idea what kind of training I've had.  You haven't the foggiest idea who I've had to practice with and on.  But in reality your comments taught me all I need to know about you.<br>
<br>
<br>
And one more thing.  I do not know how to play the banjo, and that is not a banjo you see in the picture.  If you were being sarcastic, then fine.  But your past displays of knowledge lead me to believe you were not sarcastic.  So here's some info for you.  Banjos typically have 4 strings, although some do have 5.  Guitars have 6 strings.  Look closely and you can see 6 strings in that picture, which means it is a guitar.  Can you say that word?  G-U-I-T-A-R.  Very good.  If you want more specific information.  That is a Gison BluesHawk with a Tremelo bar built on.  It has Ernie Ball Super Slinky strings on it.  Need more info?  If so just ask, I'd be happy to share it, in the hope that more knowledge can make you a better person. <p>Aweilii Nicewolf the

<br>
I knew ur god damn guitar wasnt a banjo, and u didnt need to go in so much detail and whatever the fuck it is, cuz no one cares. and about u hurting me, u must be fucking joking. im not some fag who plays a female on eq, and i can tell by ur picture ur shit. if u were to take off that shirt ur fat would be hanging out everywhere. i prolly got more muscles in one arm then u do in ur entire body, i only wish u could come across u in public, i would beat ur ass on the spot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uafahisx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Afahisx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/11/02 11:55:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Herstory..and I am sticking to it.</span><hr size=1> Aweils, i know Asd in RL, and he is fairly muscular, although he exagerates on how he could be the shit out of everyone.

<br>
Our ISP, @home, disabled multiple IP addresses on one account. Since they did that, i had to buy a router and network things myself. Since i have a router, any post from any computer in this house will have the same IP recorded. I can assure you all that Wyldinfrostwalker=tranix. Again, Wyldin=tranix. Wyldin is a RL brother on another computer. So again, please do not think i am posting this shit.<br>
