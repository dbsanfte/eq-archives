<br>
xylor's list of rules:<br>
sigs which arent stupid big (ie makes you scroll to left/right)<br>
keep flames in flames forum, market stuff in market forum etc..<br>
<br>
everythign else, let the people govern themselves, drinal has a uinique personality imo, and all the rules on this boards restrict the will of people to come out. <br>

<br>
When the boards were handed to me, I took it with great pride to not fuck anything up. And not you tell me I am becoming a nazi? Over what? A few rules that need to be there? It's not like I am running around editing out everyones posts and banning every single person, believe me, I could seriously do that if I wanted to. I could ban every single person I did not like, just because they got on my nerves. <br>
<br>
I could turn peoples titles into horrific things like "Poop monster from hell" (no that may not sound horrific, I'm trying to give an example and some people wouldn't think it was funny) and laugh at them when they wanted it to be changed back. Sure, I've changed peoples titles, but for the most part when they wanted it changed back, I have. <br>
<br>
I could only have my friends as admins. It could be a very clicky (sorry I'm not sure on the spelling) board. You'd have to be my friend to be able to even post here. This board is light compared to the way things are run on some of the other ones. <br>
<br>
You guys seriously haven't even seen some of the other admins that are lurking out there. Ever heard the term "Bastard operator from hell" (BOFH) I could be that, but I'm not that type of person, and sadly, I'm the type of person that tends to let people walk all over her. So if you think that a few rules here and there is bad, then seriously, check out some of the other boards. <br>
<br>
You do not want total anarchy on these boards, I promise you. What would happen if it was YOUR shoes. What would happen if someone got ahold of YOUR real life information somehow. Even if you say "I'm not stupid enough to give it out" they could be some stalker from hell and have tracked you down. Well let's say they did that, and came here and posted it in the flames forum and I didn't have the rules and refused to edit it and you were sitting here like a lost sheep with your picture, your telephone number, your address your mother and parents name and all of this real life information sitting here about you. <br>
<br>
Do not tell me you wouldn't freak out a little bit. Even if the guy is a skinny pimple faced freak and you're some big hot stud muffin, he could have big hot stud muffin friends, or better yet, he could have a gun. Or someone else on these boards could not like you enough to come find you. <br>
<br>
Now I apologize for the long letter, but I'm sick of seeing this "This board is getting nazi fied" When in all actuality, it isn't. Nothing much has changed. I've added rules, but what has changed since them? Has anyone been so changed that they have to make a big rant against me? I honestly wouldn't make these rules if they weren't good for the board. <br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>Now let's examine. The trading market rule. I made that one because I personally do not want to get involved in someone elses bad trade. If you want to get involved (which it wont happen because the person they are going to email is me, that's what always happens) then feel free. I don't want it to turn into some huge drama that could have been avoided in the first place. There are other places where people can sell their goods for real life money. Besides, who's to say Verant wont come here and try to say "Quit selling stuff for real life money, or we'll shut you down" I don't want to deal with it.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Let's examine the No Anonymous Accounts Rule. This was made because I was SICK TO DEATH of spending hours trying to find out who anonymousmob01 and joeschmoe02 were. I didn't have the time to try to match ip's because ezboard does not have a reverse IP lookup system. How many times has an anonymous user came and made some smart ass comment against YOUR guild that has pissed you off and you wanted to know who they were? OR better yet, how many times have they come and made a comment against you. Chances are, they are someone you know. That's why I made that rule. It's not a bad rule, it's a rule that most other boards use actually.<br>
<br>
<b>3</b>Okay let's examine the RL stuff. This was made after constant threats to sue me. I still get them you know this? Isn't this sad? People wanting to sue ME over a message board. Things that are OUT OF MY CONTROL that YOU GUYS POST. It really makes me feel like a Burger King employer when you guys threaten to sue me. I feel so cheap like I have been in the wrong. This rule isn't leaving and I'm sorry. Just imagine your picture or RL address/phonenumber/info being posted by your worst enemy on the flames board and it not being edited out by me. You'd be PISSED OFF and anyone who says they wouldn't is flat out lying.<br>
<br>
So there. Those are the _3_ LITTLE rules. It's not like I'm saying you have to be dressed up like Puff Daddy's invitation to come talk on these boards. Those rules are small and if you can't follow them, I'm sorry. They are quite easy to follow. It's simple netequitte (or however I'd spell that one too)<br>
<br>
Once again, if you made it to the end of this message without snoozing your ass off then congratulations. I just had to let that all out. <br>
<br>
-Elay <br>
And don't be angry with me please, that's not how I inteded my letter to come across at all, I'm just trying to explain things from my point of view. It really sucks how the internet works sometimes because you can't see body language, facial expressions yada yada.  <p><center>

<br>
I know that MY time is worth a lot of money and more to me -- and yours probably is to you as well.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all you do here -- and thanks for your light touch, as well. None of the rules are unreasonable at all -- period.<br>
<br>
Thanks again. I just hope no one pushes you away from doing it -- I've only been on this board for a short time -- but I was here when the Chaos Wars (as I just coined them) were going on -- and your management has fixed all of that. <p><center>

Now I think elayie your reaction was way way overboard. I realize you prolly take alot of abuse, but in my post I stated that I give the admins benefit of the doubt (my best intentions comment) so you are lashing out at the wrong person. <br>

I apologize if you think that I was lashing out at you, because I really did not intend for my post to come across that way, infact I was not even in a bad mood when I posted it.<br>
<br>
I was just trying to clear some things up and explain how I felt about things. I wasn't lashing out at you at all. I'm sorry if I upset you. <p><center>

off your first post and then say you were lashing out with him, what makes you think he took the time to really try to read and understand anything else? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55342>Grindle</a> 56 Luminary<BR>
