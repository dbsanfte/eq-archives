Several of my friends have done that very thing.  They smoke it at a party and drive home.  Driving under the influence of marijuana is actually less dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol (note I am not saying either should be done).  Both are INCREDIBLY stupid, yes, and just because I believe it should be a legal drug doesn't mean I think people should go driving under it's influence.  Alcohol is legal, drunk driving isn't, so do the same thing with pot and that solves the whole problem you seemed to have with it being legal.<br>
I do not smoke pot, but I think the drug laws are a bit harsh.  We're talking about a substance that's slightly worse than tobacco.  You can get stuff 2x worse than pot from your neighborhood pharmacy.<br>
Why do I think it should be legal?<br>
Well, as Thorsen said, they could tax the crap out of it and maybe put it to good use.  Even with high taxes, legal pot would be much cheaper than it is now. <br>
Also the real criminals (the mob, big time dealers, whoever else) won't be making as much money if one of the more commonly used drugs was made readily available.  <br>
<br>
And I wouldn't just stop with marijuana, but that's another argument.<br>

<br>
<br>
If I were rich enough to live on my own, and not have to take any drug tests for work, then would I smoke?<br>
<br>
Hell yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think there should be an age restriction on when you can purchase it....but I don't think it should be illegal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why is it illegal?<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The police agencies make shit loads of money off of busting:<br>
<br>
a) people selling it<br>
b) people buying it<br>
c) people smoking it<br>
d) people growing it<br>
<br>
<br>
But shit...what do we hear in the music today? Every other rap song has a refrence to weed, or coke in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's about as fucked up as Denver is....Listen to this.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's illegal to shoot of fire works in Denver, but not illegal to sell any.<br>
<br>
<br>
on the 4th of july, DPD grossed like $250,000 off of fire works tickets. It just shows you how fucked up the city is. I bet you the government was even selling the fireworks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like was said earlier....Weed is so common it's not even funny. You can go to any state, any city, and chances are if you walk down the street, you'll run into someone who can hook you up with some weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and that comment about hitting cars for extra points cause your stoned off your ass....<br>
<br>
<br>
well, i dunno what kinda weed your smokin, but marajuana doesn't do that.<br>
<br>
At least not unless you smoke a blunt the size of a redwood tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Marajuana is like 200 times more dangerous than cigaretts.&quot;<br>
<br>
yeah....but how many cigaretts does a person smoke each day? <br>
<br>
I've seen people go through packs in a single day. and the average weed smoker will smoke 1 joint a day...many times sharing with another person, or a group of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Weed being addictive....<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, here's something I agree on. I think weed is very addictive....about as addictive as cigarettes. My brother once walked a mile in like 2ft snow just to get some....the roads were closed, and everyone was off from school...him and his friend wanted some, and they tried for 2 hours to find someone who had some...then spent another 2 hours walking to get it, and walking back.<br>
<br>
Weed messing with metality.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree here....Weed is bad for the the personality....A person who smokes weed will be fine, when they aren't smoking weed, nothing really seems to matter to them. They have mood swings, and if things aren't going well, they get pissed off easier than they would if they werent on weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My overall view of weed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) weed is good for social situations much like alcohol is....It can make tense situations more relaxing....alot of this is due to people passing the blunt/pipe =)....*its easier to say you wanna take a hit, rather than hi...my name is* Plus, you don't look stupid if they reject your offer ;)*<br>
<br>
2) smoking weed should be used on an occasional basis, and not for every day life.<br>
<br>
3) weed makes funny movies VERY FUNNY.<br>
<br>
4) doing weed all the time can fuck up your life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm no expert on weed, but I have been in contact with it for probably a good 3rd of my life. It isn't by any means this wonderful thing that should be done during church. But it's not as bad as TV comercials, and school programs make it up to be.<br>
<br>
Weed is the gateway drug....this is true, it can lead into different things if someone isn't careful, and knowleged about it....that's why it should have an age restriction.<br>
<br>
My brother started doing weed his Sophmore year...He then tried shrooms...which i guess he never really liked, because I never saw him do it....unlike weed, which I saw him do all the time. He told me he even did Acid once.....which freaked me out, cause that's one of the &quot;bad&quot; drugs. But he said he did it once, and never wanted to try it again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm gonna say just a little more because I've already forgot what I wrote at the beginning hehe...and chances are no one will read this far anyways. So...to end this off, Lemmie sumarize what I wanted the main things to be said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sumary:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Most drugs are bad. coke...acid....heroin*sp?*<br>
<br>
2) Weed isn't any worse and Cigarettes/beer.<br>
<br>
3) no one has ever died from a direct result of Weed. IE...lung cancer/overdose.<br>
<br>
4) Weed doesn't make you see shit....it makes you relax, and makes you laugh.<br>
<br>
5) weed is good for social gatherings, but not everyday life.<br>
<br>
6) the only reason weed gets you into trouble, is because the law prohibits it. <br>
<br>
7) the law only prohibits it, because they make money busting you with it.<br>
<br>
8) weed can mess with your mentality through withdrawl....which is pretty much the same as cigarettes/beer.....if your an addict on beer or cigarettes, and you try to quit after being addicted...you'll act the same way.<br>
<br>
<br>
9) I'm done <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#939393>(8/7/01 10:23:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://wsphotofews.excite.com/002/7O/UE/aN/7V68762.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ....</span><hr size=1> <br>
I've never seen any of these reports or statistics.  All I have to go on is what I've seen with my own two eyes.  Out of all the friends I can think of that smoked or still smoke pot, some never went on to college, the rest dropped out or are still in after ~9 years.  Only one; my brother, who went from heavy usage to none at all about 3 years ago, has anything resembling a decent job which thankfully pays him good money and provides him the means to support himself and his family.  Among the same group of people that the above are a part of, all of my friends, myself included, who didn't smoke pot graduated college and went on to live comfortably in good-paying careers.<br>
<br>
With this past experience, I'm of the opinion that they should legalize the stuff.  The more people who do it means less job competition and greater job security for people like me.<br>
