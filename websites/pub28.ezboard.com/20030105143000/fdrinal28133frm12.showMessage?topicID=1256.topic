Clerics got upgraded (hammer pet, better DL), and the druid/shaman heals did not go live.<br>
<br>
I believe that clerics are in NO position to whine for upgrades in the high end game, especially now.  They are the most desired class for any high end guild, and all raids revolve almost solely around them.  Before a raid can go, first there has to be enough clerics.  I can't think of any other class where the numbers of that class present is so crucial.  5 warriors v 10 warriors? No big deal.  2 shamans v. 5 shamans? No big deal.  0 druids v. 5 druids? No big deal, and the list goes on.   4 clerics v. 10 clerics on a high end raid?  <b> Huge deal </b>, that's the raid called off right there.<br>
<br>
The fact is clerics are so in demand it has gotten to the point where they are the most fickle class out there.  Since they are so in-demand, they expect group offers as soon as they log in, they switch guilds the most on average, you name it.  Obviously this isn't true with all clerics, but I believe it is more true for clerics than any other class.<br>
<br>
Now clerics counter these arguments in two ways:<br>
<br>
1.  <b> Clerics are Unexciting </b>  They argue that their class is boring and needs all the upgrades it can get.  I'm sorry but I don't see how clerics are any more boring than any other class on a high end raid.  Arguments can be made that the implementation of the ch chain has turned them into robots, but any good cleric knows that performing a flawless ch chain is anything but easy.  They also say that all they do is sit and med before standing to heal, rinsing, and repeating.  I fail to see how that is more boring than getting within melee range of a mob, pressing "a", hammering kick, and pressing taunt when aggro is lost.  The fact of the matter is that no class in EQ is extremely difficult to play, but all of the classes are difficult to <b> play well </b>.  The same applies to clerics.<br>
<br>
2.  <b> Group Desirability </b><br>
<br>
Clerics argue that new heals for druids and shamans will decrease cleric group desirability.  I fail to see how druids or shamans will replace clerics in a group in places like cazic thule or ssra, where the best group exp post-patch is to be found.  When I make a group for either of these places, I prefer the composition to be: warrior cleric rogue monk enchanter wizard (all 60 of course).  Obviously I will make exceptions for friends or guildees who are lfg, but the above is the ideal group.  Sure a shaman slower is nice, but if all 6 players know their class well, as the ones I take do, it's by far the best dps/exp with the above composition.  <br>
<br>
Why should I take a druid?  They fill the evac spot, and yet they do a tenth of the dps of wizards, and good clerics won't need the secondary healing.   Thus they simply lower dps.  If anyone has a right to whine about group desirability, it is druids, or paladins, or necros, or any one of a number of classes that don't hold a critical niche in exp groups.<br>
<br>
Just because clerics fail to receive 5 requests for groups every 30 minutes doesn't mean they lack group desirability  (don't make me list the bazillions of times I've spammed /who all 60 cleric to round out a group and found none available).  Sure maybe they aren't the most desirable class for duoing in fungus grove, but the same can be said for warriors (shaman/monk is better), druids, paladins, and many other classes.<br>
<br>
Clerics also whine that they can't solo as effectively as some casters can.  So?  Do you think warriors solo particularly effectively? Do you think rogues solo that effectively?  Would you like to be able to teleport, slow, debuff, mez, and tank also?  No class was meant to have every capability and not all classes were meant for soloing.<br>
<br>
And if all else fails: make a group yourself, it's not that hard and the rest of us have been doing it for years.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let's examine druids.  The new patch hurt them by lowering the exp benefit when soloing lower level blues.  Druids didn't even receive their new heal thanks to cleric whining.  What important role do druids play in groups?  What important role do druids play on raids?  (Oh sorry I forgot to mention 1 of them can buff the whole raid with circle of seasons, that's so powerful!).<br>
<br>
<br>
I could go on and on but I find the whining of the clerics on their eq board sickening.  Clerics are the most desired class in EQ and the jealousy they exhibited when VI attempted to toss druids a bone was despicable.  Clerics have a stranglehold on the high end game and I welcome any change which lessens it.  No one class should play as big of a role in a raids success or failure as clerics do now, and I had hoped that druid and shaman heals would alleviate that problem somewhat, but alas it was not to be.  I hope clerics enjoy their hammer and new heal while druids got jack shit (oh nm, their epic effect got changed!).<br>

(The small print:  Yes I realize some clerics wanted the heals and that many aren't at all fickle.  Many clerics didn't whine on the cleric board, and many didn't even care.  Yes, I realize much of the blame rests on VI, not just whiny clerics.  Yes I realize many druids are talented to the point where they still benefit raids a great deal.  Yes I realize classes besides clerics are critical to raids (just not to the same extent). I also note that I do not begrudge clerics these upgrades, I simply don't appreciate the jealous class rivalry and whining they exhibited when it appeared the druid/shaman heals might go live. <br>
<br>
The above opinions apply to the high end game above level 60, not to groups in velketors labyrinth or fungus grove.  If your responses don't apply to the context of my post, please don't counter with arguments about the roles of clerics in karnor's castle left moat group at level 54.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufizbenx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fizbenx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 12:42:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Board</span><hr size=1> Dont forget that after Whining and bitching about the Ragefire spawn in solb they had it changed to Skyfire so they could bitch some more to have the final part of the quest dumbed down even more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueqwolfran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWolfran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><center><hr width=75%><font color=blue><b>Keng of teh moutein</b></font><hr width=75%></center></span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 12:55:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.seaforthlanding.com/images/~alan/Toothy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Board</span><hr size=1> *Waits patiently for the &quot;you're not a cleric so you have no right to speak&quot; defense*<br>

<br>
That's the life of a cleric on raids.  It's not fun.<br>
<br>
I bet I couldn't even recognize half the shit we kill, because I never see it until it's a corpse.<br>
<br>
Look at exp groups in Cazic.  Even before the patch, druids were slowly taking cleric spots in groups.  You don't need a cleric in most Cazic Thule exp spots if you have a slower.  Trust me, if your cleric has time and mana to nuke, you don't need a cleric.  And I'm a nuking bastard in Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
The reason people demand clerics for groups is HABIT more than anything else.  But since clerics are quitting the game our of frustration and boredom, people are starting to take secondary healers instead.  And discovering that it's working out just fine.  And look, their *healer* can also nuke and evac and dot and snare and do all kinds of other useful stuff.<br>
<br>
The cleric gripe, in a nutshell was this:<br>
Clerics can do NOTHING other than heal.  Clerics are dependant on groups more than any other class.  If you suddenly make clerics less desireable in an exp group than the BILLION or so druids out there, clerics will be relegated to CH monkeys for raids and then kicked to the curb come exp time.  AND IT WAS ALREADY HAPPENING EVEN WITHOUT THE NEW HEALS.<br>
<br>
I'm not crazy about this solution, trust me.  I'd rather they took CH away entirely and started from scratch on healing.  But too much of the game is designed around CH.<br>
<br>
The druid/shaman heals will go live.  If they don't, fine, pull back all the cleric changes.  I didn't ask to become a damn melee god, and neither did the majority of clerics.  This was VERANT'S idea of how to balance the class, not OURS.  You think we LIKE our entire class redefined after 3 years?  All we wanted was an upgrade to damn Remedy, for Christ's sake.  And maybe make our undead nukes worth memming again so we have something to do besides play our rogue twinks when we can't find a group.<br>

Pressing taunt does nothing if the mob is already agroed on you.  It gives you one more point of hate than the highest person on the list if it is successful, and does nothing if not.  You can research the steel warrior board for a plethora of topics on this.  This is why warriors want a fixed taunt which contributes cumulative aggro.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as clerics being able to do only one thing (healing), I'd like to know what else warriors can do besides tanking?  (No I'm not trying to whine about the warrior class, I'm happy with my class, but the argument that only doing one thing well is not a good thing I don't agree with).<br>
<br>
And no, druids/shamans aren't better than clerics if you're doing anything of substance in cazic thule.  It would take both a druid and a shaman to equal a cleric. I'd rather have a cleric/wiz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udashaadawarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dashaa da Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Muffie Diver</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 2:30:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Board</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info.<br>

I think if you examine the cleric complaints you'll find it's a combination of things.  Clerics don't expect to have it all.  Most of them really don't want to melee and find the hammer is a fun toy, but not really what they wanted.  So they don't exactly feel balanced by giving them something they don't even want.   While clerics like being needed, they don't like being needed too much.  It's like having someone depend on you to use the toilet.  It's not the sort of &quot;being needed&quot; people like being needed for!<br>
<br>
Many raiding clerics would like to get OFF the cheal chain.  If giving out big heals to other priests then they'd go for that.  Even up to complete heals.  Where the concern comes in is their viability for grouping goes way, way down if that happens.  Groups are concerned about DPS and maximizing their experience gained.  If a cleric isn't contributing to that then their spot would be better filled by someone that can use their mana more flexibly.  I'm not talking about replacing a cleric with a druid.  I'm talking about replacing the druid with a wizard, rogue or monk and replacing the cleric with the druid.  Then you've got your evac covered and your DPS just went up by a whole lot.  Plus your heals are taken care of with free epic dots, nukes as mana is available, debuffs, regrowth and so on.<br>
<br>
Sony opened a huge Pandora's box and the complaints and bitterness is the result.  My advice: stay off the class boards if it bugs you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 139<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 3:30:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Board</span><hr size=1> I think the biggest problem I would face as a cleric is having too much pressure to log in for raids, which just shows how powerful clerics are.

These changes were not put in to effect the high end role of clerics.  The highend role will, and always be healing/buffing/resing.  These changes were put in to counter balance the effect of the new druid/shaman RAID ORIENTED heals.  The heals were to be put in to make druids and shamans (druids in particular) more useful in RAIDS.  The fact is that they have a serious effect on the grouping game as well.  The cleric changes were designed in order for clerics to have the OPTION to solo slightly and provide a marginal amouont of DPS to groups.  As you should know, being a high level player, DPS is all that matters in EXP groups.  A Warrior Warrior Cleric Druid Shaman Enchanter group might have tons of staying power but it would be horrible for exp.  Currently there is 1 major exp zone in the game where clerics could be considered necesary for grouping.  That zone is Cazic thule,  and even there, in most camps you can get away with a shaman for healing.<br>
         Prior to the hammer patch, you were doing yourself a disservice exp wise by having a cleric in the group when doing any other exp zone.  With the new changes to druids/shamans, a cleric without the hammer upgrade would be useless for all but raiding.  Clerics dont want to be the number 1 god like class (hi monks), they just dont want to feel that they are taking away from a groups potential exp by being in it rather than a druid or shaman.  So it was a trade off, druids/shamans got RAID level heals, while clerics got a dps increase.<br>
        About the warrior issue, try worrying about a 6 eom/pli pull and having to tank them all with only 6 warriors online.  It doesnt happen.  The same can be said about many classes, try a multi unmezzable mob pull in vt with only 2 enchanters and 2 shamans, then try the same thing with 4 of each, it makes things infinently easier.  The same can be said about every class just about, maybe because of the level of mobs your killing doesnt require the use of every class, many others need a signifigant number of every class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udentoneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DentonEq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 4:36:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The New Cleric Changes/Whiners on the EQ Cleric Board</span><hr size=1> Yes i agree with cenlibik, wtf a druid healing in CT? fuck that i wouldnt step foot in that place with out a cleric, sure the cleric i was with was FM most of them time, but you think i care one bit?

For over 3 years now clerics have been for the most part, a boring class.  Who cares if they are the most desired/crucial.  Clerics aren't going to do you any good if they have become burned out on the raiding and no longer wish to play anything but a -fun- alt.<br>
<br>
Most classes are repetitive, but come on.. standing up, healing, then sitting down isn't really the same as a warrior.  I've played Vale for 3+ years and Zinreavl *cleric* for 2+.  I'd much rather play Vale at any given time.  It's some of the simple things like falling for 900 damage and not having to worry, or hitting defensive and swiming around through seahorses in SG.  That reminds me.  Warriors that camp through SG or wait for a succor really need to start another class.<br>
<br>
Now before you try the arguement that a cleric should 'know their role' when they make a cleric.. I'm sure that person wanted to enjoy a game and help others at the same time.  Take a break and help someone do a quest or just run around like you used to, before high end raiding/exp became so important.  If you're number crunching every change to the game, then you might as well quit.  EQ hasn't been perfect and never will be.   <p>Valekrin Z'eimisra
