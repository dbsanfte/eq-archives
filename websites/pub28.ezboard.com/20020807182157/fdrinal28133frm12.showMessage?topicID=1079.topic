I've always been one to say UGoD wasn't the place for flames, so I'm going to practice what I preach, and respond to you here.  <br>
<br>
You said:<br>
&quot;You chose to try to destroy our Guild, Phoenix Order, rather than to allow our Guild to work with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, Aarghus.  All I did was find out that 40 other people were as unhappy as I was with the state of affairs.  I was surprised it ran so deep.  But it did.  When I left, it wasn't just me.  It was 30 or 40 people.  Most left and came with us to UC, and almost every single person from that group is still proudly wearing a Unconquered tag 8 months later.  Some left and went to other guilds, or left EQ for a while.  But IT WASN'T JUST ME.  The people who left did so because they had an idea of what they wanted out of EQ, and PO wasn't providing it.  And they're now happy to be in UC.  Could you see PO having the kind of rules that UC has?  I can't, because of people like you.<br>
<br>
You said:<br>
&quot;Your attitude was &quot;do everything my way or I will destroy you.  I've been down the road of vague demands and nothing specific - and then, unless we agreed to do everything your way, you would do everything possible to destroy us.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like you're doing it again with UGoD.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hardly.  And you know it.  We *not just me* asked for the smallest of concessions, a tiny adjustment to the charter to reflect how things actually were in everyday life in Phoenix Order back in November.  We were turning into a raiding guild with a family backbone.  But the people in charge--you among them--refused to recognize that.  Considering what we initially were considering asking for, believe me, we hardly asked for anything.  We just wanted to make a start, make some headway in the right direction where I felt most of the guild wanted to go.  Meanwhile you and others spouted numbers about how it was just a small portion of the guild, claiming that we should give the same weight as the guy who plays every day and is active in the guild as we gave to some schlub who we tagged and then never saw again for 8 months.  Well that 'small portion' of the guild turned out to be most of the highly active folks in the guild.<br>
<br>
Me, I'm trying to help UGoD not make the same mistakes we made a year and a half ago.  What are you doing for UGoD?<br>
<br>
<br>
You said:<br>
&quot;I think it's time your self-serving egomaniac demands are recognized for what they are and that people realize the only thing you care about in EQ is Seke.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you honestly believe that, then you need to open up your eyes and look around.  I don't even have to say any more than that.  I'll let my reputation defend itself.  <br>
<br>
You said<br>
&quot;You are a very wise and intelligent raider and you've used that effectively. Your insistence on things must be done your way has been and apparently continues to be one of the most destructive forces I've encountered in EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
You call it destructive.  It's only because you and other people involved with PO at that time refused to look around and see things for how they really were.  You had this silly idea that ... /gasp ... things had to be the way they'd always been, *your way*, and that they could never change.  Well, things changed.  And you wouldn't acknowledge it. <br>
<br>
So we left, and you know what?<br>
<br>
I'm happy.  I'm in the best guild I've ever been in.  I'm guilded with the kind of people I always dreamed about getting to be guilded with--my brothers and sisters from my time in PO like Sangori, Kyarra, Durin, Atlan, Uzzamo...UGoD friends like Ama, Aanallein, Tukk, Stumpp, Aanilye...newer friends like Pern, Diomedes, Niden...and everyone else.  <br>
<br>
And, thankfully, not you. <p>Seke Darktower<BR>

You along with some others of your ideals would rather see those you would call family be unhappy and bitter because they weren't able to enjoy their gaming.  You gave those that weren't of your ideals nothing but crap and guilt trips.<br>
<br>
You know I get mad when someone leaves a guild for another, no doubt.  But its about being hurt that they left most of the time *this does not include loot whoring assholes that got a few things they wanted and disco'd, those types are just fuckwads and asshats*.  I at first believed that to be true of the PO people that gave my brethren grief.  But now I know that isn't the case.  You are just a jealous bitter player that wanted company in his misery and are pissed you don't have it anymore.<br>
<br>
Go fuck yourself and leave my guild alone you shit talking fucktwit.  You have the chance to do alot of things with UGOD, but instead you decided to flame someone.  Way to go asshole.  Hope you are proud of youself, personally I hope you wrot in your self induced loathing hell.<br>

I only met Seke in Unconquered after coming from Souls of Eternity.  He has been a great guild leader and teacher to a lot of us that started out young in the guild (38 here).  He has always been very supportive of me.  I have watched him be very protective of UGoD stuff over the past 8 months - he will back down when he knows something is going on.  <br>

<br>
First let me say how truely truely sad I think it is that you and some of the other current members of  Phoenix Order have managed to dwell on our leaving.  Are your lives really so empty that feeding an excessive anger over something that happened months and months ago seems a wise use of your time?<br>
<br>
Those that left Phoenix Order did EVERYTHING in our power to leave on good terms.  We left with no animosity, or hard feelings on our side.  We just decided that collectively it was time to move on.  Since we have left we have also done everything in our power to keep on good terms with PO.  Helping when we can, being there for old friends.<br>
<br>
With all that effort to maintain our old friendships, PO and many of its members (more correctly would be to say its leaders) have met us at every turn with ill will, blatant rudeness, and unfounded personal attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Aarghus, how dare you!  How dare you attack Seke.  How dare you attack the people that did everything possible to make Phoenix Order everything it could be.  How dare you tarnish the time we spent in PO and the potential that is UGoD with that uncalled for flame!<br>
<br>
Phoenix Order's by-laws always stated that &quot;Above all else have fun.&quot;  Well, I know for a fact that I am having more fun in EQ than you are right now.  Have a nice day.<br>

I've heard a lot about this from both sides.. being in a guild that was allied to PO at one time I really got to talk with many of the members and hear their side of the situation.  <br>
<br>
But it comes down to this.. simply.. There were dozens of members, that came forward and were asking for a change in the guildeline of the guild.. long standing, productive, members that respectfully asked for a change in the status quo to make things better and more enjoyable.  People resisted that change.  So what were they to do?  They said I'm sorry you feel that way, we need to move on then.  Ever since they've been persecuted and challenged by those left behind.  Either through envy, jealousy, or feelings of betrayal.  <br>
<br>
The point:  They came to the leaders of PO to ASK for a change.. to try to WORK towards changing things to make it better for a large part of the guild's population.  And what happened?  They were scoffed.. so they had no choice but to move on if they were to have any hopes of still finding ways to enjoy the game and to make new achievements.<br>
<br>
It could have been handled so much worse.  <br>
<br>
Kudo's to UC for trying to be tactful and respectful in their approach, discussion, and finally resolution to their problems within PO.<br>
<br>
And yes... this is just my opinion on the way I saw things from an outsiders view. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55342>Grindle</a> 55 Shaman<BR>

<br>
and it sucks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I really like the UC peoples. I have been on a bunch of raids with all of them, had lots of fun with them, been outlevelled by all of them /RUDE...<br>
<br>
I am bummed that hard feelings exist between UC and PO. There are really, really, let me stress REALLY great people in both guilds.<br>
<br>
Just as an FYI, PO now belongs to Drinal Alliance. DA is not as high level and does not do the same stuff that old PO was probably capable of back in the day. That being said, DA is working on it. We are teaching people how to raid, getting people epics, having fun, etc, etc...<br>
<br>
Hopefully instead of being pissed at UC, people can spend their time focusing on the task at hand of bettering the people that count on the more experienced players in DA. I know some old PO members are angry, but there is a whole new batch of really cool people in DA that are worth helping, and are willing to help you in return.<br>
<br>
It sucks to be in the middle of this bad blood. Sang, I guarantee you that most of the PO people aren't just sitting there being bummed about UC. Most of them are enjoying themselves doing stuff with DA.<br>
<br>
Anyway. I don't really know what I was trying to accomplish with this post, but to say that Drinal Alliance values our Phoenix Order friends, and there is plenty of stuff to do (Hi, I have a FOOKING TENT with my name on it at the TD hidden oasis) instead of being bummed out at UC. I can use all the help I can get. <br>
<br>
I think we have something really great in Drinal Alliance. It is the future (if you want it). Bad blood is the past. Seke has done whatever he has done, and from an outsider's perspective continues to try and help people outside of UC whenever he has time to spare, while at the same time running a high-level guild (not easy to say the least).<br>
<br>
So please put your energy into our alliance if you really support it. Things are just starting to get interesting anyway.<br>

No, you know what, I've wasted to much time in the past explaining myself to children like you /points to Aillar. You could not comprehend the answers then, so what makes you think you're capable now? So don't look forward to another reply, this includes you as well Voices.  The reason I don't reply to your silly posts is because; my time, is to valuable to be spent wasting it on peons like you. I cannot stress it enough, the only reason you attempt to drag my &quot;gf&quot; into this is because you're desperate to ruffle my feathers... well, you failed. I grew tired of babysitting some of you on here months back and remember, sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never harm me. I know the truth of the ones near to me. When it's all said and done, that's all that matters; not what a knave from a flame board thinks.<br>

<br>
I have only been in one guild on Drinal - UC, and from day one I can only say my respect for the leaders has grown over time. They started this guild only a few months ago out of a smattering of people to form one of the top guilds on Drinal - if that isnt a testament in who they are then I dont know what is. They lead most of us in totally new experiences, and we follow out of respect - would we do this if Seke or Ama(insert rest of name here gimp :-P) were bad people, or self-centered? No. Stfu gimp and go back to camping Dorn pls b/c you are burying yourself here. Dont dishonor DA anymore than you are now, b/c I know I hold respect for many of the members of it - Jakle, most if not all WW (/hugs Kass).<br>
