/smiles<br>
<br>
That's right Synide, you see when I was at the fear gate last night offering to help people get to their bodys and break fear, you showed up. Funny thing was, it was as if no sooner did you see me you ran off. Why is that? Well I would have to say, to sum it up in a nutshell and it only points to one reason, you're guttless, spineless and certainly the way you act on here, certainly below the age limit to play the game. You see a real man tells it to the persons face as it is, they don't come to some silly board type a few words you heard your mother say to you, because we know your slightly mentally challenged. You see, the next time you see me in game, why not be a big boy and at least say it to my face. Ohh wait, that's right your not of that age yet, your still in the breast feeding stages. Ah, well just letting you know the laws clearly state your obviously underage for this game, go back to playing with your barbie dolls, yes I heard you like to play with Ken, not as him. <br>
<br>
Synide, talk to the hand because the ears not listening, bitch. So take the reply your thinking of right now, bend over and stick that keyboard up your ass where it belongs because that's obviously the same area where you do most of your thinking from, your lower head.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ublazeodead.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blaze ODead</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/18/01 6:29:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Synide it's ok really</span><hr size=1> There is no age limit to play the game dipshit.

It's T for teen &quot;Teen<br>
Titles rated &quot;Teen (T)&quot; have content suitable for persons ages 13 and older. Titles in this category may contain violent content, mild or strong language, and/or suggestive themes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now if you knew half of what the fuck you think you knew, then you'd know that means there is a AGE restriction. Which means in order to legally purchase this product you MUST be 13+ years of age, obviously the salesman that sold you this product BROKE the law, because the way you act here it's very clear you are underage. Pull your head out of your ass and maybe obide by some laws you dickhead they're set up to keep dumbass morons like you who aren't of age out of a adults game. Oh here, allow me to post the url to the site, so your dumbasses can read just what the hell these ESRB ratings mean and what they are for, since you obviously have no fucking clue. Make sure your mother reads this so next time she to has a clue what the hell she's doing.<br>

Synide, you're still the cock sucking pussy as always. I must admit, they didn't get fear broken for sometime, however in the end it was broken and they DID manage to own fear. I was not there for the raid, I came on only when I heard there was trouble, ohh and want to bash guilds, where's your sorry ass been? I didn't see your ass volunteer like Shaere and his guild and other friends of mine. I applaud those people who showed up and son, for your future use, you best watch who or what guilds you flame. You just may come begging to join some day, so fuck off you jackass because from what I've seen of Amadagu's souls of eternity, they've got one hell of a nice group of people there in that guild, you've got a problem with me jackass, bring it. You go bashing Amadagu's guild and you truly are just that damn stupid or that damn jealous. I didn't see your pussy ass walk into fear now did I, now who's the little cunt ass bitch. You fucking pussy. <br>
<br>
Only reason you like to flame myself here is because you're fucking jealous, I was on again last night, yet did Synide dare send me a tell I was even in the same zone as he, did he say a thing? Hell no, like a little guttless wench that he is, he tucks his tail and runs off. Synide, son it's time you step up to the plate, I called your pansy ass out once, I'm doing it again. Bring it the fuck on I will own you. You talk the talk but I see how you play and you surely can't walk the walk, you're to gd stupid to even want to mess with me.<br>
<br>
As I once said, you can take your little mouth, and pucker up and kiss your own ass with it, because that's about as far as your words will go with me. Aww, did Balrak piss you off Synide, aww you pooooor baby, aww. Go plug your mouth back in ya momma's titty, I think you need fed again, my how you whine like a little bitch Synide. Hell I even bet your also the same guy who posted another flame here towards me, it's quite easy to make many accounts on these boards. From all the people I've talked to, there's no one I know who likes you, so there ya go. So you can take your little no one likes you and shove it down your throat, because apparently, no one likes you either, how ironic.<br>
<br>
Synide, you and your lil buddies can all come kiss the Raks ass, because he just doesn't give a flying fuck what you think about him, he's going to keep posting and keep flaming you and that's the fuckin truth, so you can get used to this, because I'm having one hell of a fun time here pissing you off. Damn it's nice to know you're able to piss off dicks like you. I needed a good flame today, thanks you jackass. Muhahaha<br>

Lola, GD how many times were you ebayed? Lets see I KNOW the original Lola, so shut that hole in your head you call a mouth you twit. You're like a hooker, you've been around the block so many times, I'd be afraid to get near you. Heaven knows what you have come down with. You're sorry hides been ebayed more then anyone else I know on EQ. So I wouldn't be to proud of yourself there. The original Lola was the best she *yes was a REAL female* was a doll, but you, well all you have is mostly thanks to her. She made the name not you nor the other two twits before you who had that account, so why not for once try playing a character WITHOUT buying your lvls. I don't care if people sell their accounts when they are done, that never bothered me, what does is some fool like you who thinks you know what your doing and comes out running their mouth to veteran players, you 0 room to even talk so begone knave.<br>
<br>
Synide can't hold a candle to the wind when it comes to trying to talk dirt on people, he just tries but in the end like the rest, you mess with the best you will fail like the rest. Got it? Get it? Now deal with it!<br>

Dickhead, I never tried to hide the fact that Lola was EBAY'D therefor I care less what you or anybody thinks about it for that matter. I happen to at that time in my life have more money than time and the RL friends I had that were playing the game were all like 40+ in level. So Lola became mine... End of story. <br>

As for you my point was that reading a flame shouldnt require fucking cliff notes. Whatever the issue may be, whether your right or wrong, I think yer a fucking asshole who doesnt get enough attention in real life and feel the need to spread your words of &quot;wisdom&quot; in your epic like threads.

You truly  are a hoot to get all fired up.<br>
<br>
Do I need an epic? Why would I need an epic when I can cast the spell? LoL, now gee, I suppose I could get it but instead of being a greedy cock like you two, I spend my time helping others obtain lvls and so on. Oh wait, I forgot, you'd rather be a ME ME ME person then helping others. Ahh yes, I forgot that's what EQ is about anymore, it's all about you getting loot.<br>
<br>
You two really are a piece of work, I wouldn't doubt your both lovers in RL to. As for the sending me a tell, you won't even dare accept my /duels in the past. The reason you won't say this in tells is because you're just afraid to face me, just another sign of your guttless, spineless attempts to try and dethrone your superior.<br>
<br>
This is such a hoot, please by all means keep it up. I'm enjoying this conversation. Why are you so upset I flame back at you guys? Can't you handle the heat? A poetI may just be, perhaps I'm a drill instructor in the military, maybe that's why I tear into your guttless asses. Maybe it's simply because your pissed I'm letting everyone see how you two TRY to change the subject, fact is you never did accept any of my challenges in game, nor were you willing to help others. You're to afraid to face a challenge. <br>
<br>
Lola, what did you say? Sorry is there an echo here, I thought Lola quit over a year ago, who are you? Some imposter apparently. My there's a nasty echo in here. Why don't you two buttfucks try to stop repeating me and try for once on your own thinking up something original to say.<br>
<br>
Ahhh, my ribs are sore now from laughing, hell I even called some of my workers in to point out to them how unedumakated you two, three, four ahh heck all of you who don't like me are.<br>
<br>
Here's a tip Synide, lets toss in some poetry shall we; Sticksand stones may break my bones but you calling me names just shows to go how much you need to get off welfare, earn your own damn living and buy your own damn games not let uncle Sam flip the bill for your sorry asses. Darn, it didn't rhyme. Oh well, maybe it wasn't mean't to. Don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out.<br>
<br>
Oh and one last time, who ever said I quit? My how you like to spread the rumors let me say again, I don't intend on quiting, because laying some heat down on you people who like to fight is just to fun. Round two, ding ding. Lets get it on, oh wait, I just handed you the old one two punch, KO, Balrak wins, again. Really you all, Penners, Budwyke, Kini, Synide, Lola and anyone else I am forgetting, you're just not a challenge on here. Face it, you lost. But then you can't do that, then who would I have to flame here anymore, seeing as of how I get along with the rest of the people. I'd like to reply further but I can't help but laugh so hard at the two of you. I'd like to reply further but I can't help but laugh so hard at the two of you. You all brought it upon yourselves and I'm not the only one to agree to that. <br>

Second off, you've never challenged me to duels. Ding ding ding KO cancelled out by judges :(.<br>

Third off, never said you quit, but if you did you just going to leave w/ -200 bucks, that you paid 10$ month, or you going to leave w/ +800-3000, most ppl say 800-3000.  Or else eBay wouldn't be a problem, or was.  <br>

Fourth off, loot whore?  Hah.  I've given away so much shit you couldn't believe.  Blood Ember Breastplate(bought that), to varggoth.  RS cloak to vaminn.  Fbss/Locustlure to Ramper, another RS cloak to him also.  HBC to Duno.  Kalorek Spine Razor to Gonif.<br>
