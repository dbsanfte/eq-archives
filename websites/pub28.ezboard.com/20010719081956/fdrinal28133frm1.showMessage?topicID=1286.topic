hmm what else...ahh back on Mith Marr. we where doing hate from the corner before they put in the 3 mobs. NOTE: I moved hot key 5 to f1 and hotkey 6 to f8 and f8 is my range weapon hot key. so shishio pulls like 7 mobs and FD's. so i change my view to see what he had pulled, after I was done looking I went to press f9 to change back to my regular view but accidently hit f8 and shot one of the mobs. hehe soon as i realized what I did i shouted &quot;wtf who shot?&quot; god we so got owned.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
k what are some more...ahh there was this gm event in oasis and there was this giant running around and half the zone was trying to kill him and theother half was trying to heal him and see if he gave a quest. so anyway after the giant finaly died i typed, there was like over 150 people in the zone. with the spacing trick,<br>
<br>
Aakla says hi der<br>
&lt;GM Name&gt; says,'Due to the lack of participation when it comes to gm events I have decided to step down as a GM. Your new GM is Brother Emrok.<br>
<br>
I spamed itlike 3 times. good lord like half the zone thought it was real and started freaking out. then I found out that it might be a bandable offence so I talked to the gm and was told not to do it again. but I was literaly in tears i was laughing so hard.<br>

The boat was so packed full of people....half fell off, and those that stayed on just got ported back in the center of oasis....it was funny hehe.<br>

I turned around and was facing the groups explaining that this would probably be a 4-pull, etc. etc. and all the sudden I'm getting beat on.  People in groups start saying 'nice pull Nodda!' and 'wtg!' and stuff like that.  I turn around to see that a single frog and scarab had aggroed on me.  To this day I have no clue how I pulled just a frog and a scarab at level 51.  At the time, all I said was 'thanks!'<br>

<br>
back in Cazic Thule when rubi droped and there where 82 people in the zone.<br>
<br>
Ok im in the lower zig with my group and im level 27 (i think i was 27) and after ahwile I go LD. I crash to my craracter select screen. so I log my char back up and i say &quot;sorry went LD&quot; and someone in my group says &quot; We all did the zone just crashed RUN NOW&quot; or something to that effect. so I say &quot;What does zone crash meen?&quot; and he says &quot;everything just repoped RUN NOW&quot; its at that moment that I see the uperzig &quot;tae archon group running towards us with a whole bunch of mobs on them&quot; (Still no idea how they managed to get that many agro coming from the upper zig since the mobs path different then you) so I start running back through the maze towards the zone. You dont realy know how many lizards are in that maze till you see it repoped. I had to run into like 2 liazrds at every turn i made. so I finnaly get to the Courtyard and the place is Chaos there are a bunch of people (mostly dead) fighting like half the mobs in Cazic Thule. so i run tothe hallway that leads to the zone, and there is the other half of the mobs in Cazic Thule all packed into the hallway killing the other half of the players, and everyone is all bunched up and stuck in one giant kiling field. To this day I dont know how I managed to get passed eveyone and zone out, but i did and lived. of the 82 people that where in the zone when It crashed, only 12 of us made it out alive. poor Xave was there for hours trying to res everyone. If only Bouncer Hurd had showed up right as we all zoned out. that would have been like icing on the cake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ushadowcastasoulshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadowcastasoulshade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(2/18/01 9:42:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some of my more memorable moments</span><hr size=1> Hehehe Well that had happened to us when I was level 30 there, and that was chaos, we were heading through the maze and then our clerics invis dropped, had every mob in the maze swarming in, mostly green but damn they hit hard and fast.  So i'm casting spells chanter is AE mezing and then we're running only to meet 15 more lizards standing over 4 corpses of pc's, lol. So they are chasing me and I'm dead meat and i run into the dead end, and I'm like, OK it's mytime to die, i was oom no way to gate, so I die and I'm bound right inside the zone in CT and i pop 8 corpses lying on the ground and 15 lizards bash me to death again.  Then i go back to the room finally after managing to escape that one, where my corpse is, and it isn't there, I petition a GM and he says to me, &quot;Did you find your corpse yet&quot;, I'm like hell no, it's not where i died, where could it have gone?  He says, &quot;Well it's sitting right over here at the Tothe Hall, I'm like what?   he says he was standing on it, got my whole group over there and no one else saw it, cept the GM, and we all had a good laugh about that.  That was the first time I petition for a GM and got one in less than 5 minutes.<br>

I remember running back to fear after a bad break and we where waiting for the cr to begin so I head to CT naked and 2 rusty 1h swords. I went into the maze for some reason, not sure if i was gg'd there or I went on my own. anyway myivis drops and I get lost in the maze. well at level 60 when you agro mobs in the maze onlyl like 3 or 4 will follow you at a time. the others will wait till on e of the first ones die then it will agro and come after you. so i fanaly find the door and the Courtyard is crouded. so I stop and turn arond and only see the 4 lizards so I go and kill then. then everytime I kill 1 another pops. and there are alot of people in the Courtyard (none of whom will move out of the way so i can zone the stuff) so after killing like the 7th mob, this group of like 12 people start standing around me chearing me on. hehe Im like uh can i get some help here this is going to take forever. and all I got was &quot;OMG what level are you&quot; like 2 people helped the rest just sat and watched. I think I killed like 20 lizards before they stopped agroing. hehe that was fun...sort of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ushadowcastasoulshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shadowcastasoulshade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(2/18/01 2:45:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some of my more memorable moments</span><hr size=1> hehe thats just funny...<br>
