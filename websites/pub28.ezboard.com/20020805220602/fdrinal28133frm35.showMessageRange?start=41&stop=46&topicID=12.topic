<br>
I would like to see some of the underdogs get epics yes, not just UGoD. <br>
<br>
The list is looking good some for some people and bad for others. EQ2 comes out in the 4th quarter of 2003 while some clerics on other servers with this list will still be waiting for their piece and the characters are transfurable. =/<br>
<br>
I for one would support anyone having this camp that came to me for help, with or without the list. If I was so asked to do so and there are many out there like me, so not all underdogs would get KSed. Logs and pics of events can also make VI take the appropriate actions for those &quot;taking&quot; the camp. Yes, I know it sucks for other clerics not to be able to get the supports and so a guild just pop right in with several groups of people, but thats the chance part of the game. The chance part is what makes it fun to some of us. (although I'm not saying being KSed is fun) but its a risk of the roleplaying system. I wonder how many clerics will become epical just to drop their characters for EQ2? This also plays into why I consider it to late for any list really. You got a little over one year before eq severs start losing alot of people, look how long EQs been running, it kind of takes the hope away from those wanting to be epic clerics if they don't turn in their pic for the list and be within the next 30 people on the list.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to down the list any longer, I've really said all I have to say about it. I'm bowing out because I finally got a real responce.<br>
<br>
Hats off seke<br>
<br>
had keep something going here anyways. Someone like to remove rants about ragefire in the rants and flames section. (not mine though) My thoughts are here. For people to look at, and if the only reasons for the Rage list are for support for the few people that can't get it every now and then. Maybe I've done better with my posts than I thought i would.<br>

(one thing I would like to leave here saying is it still puts an empty spot in my stomach to see people on the list that by not agreeing you UGoD or Durinal Boards long ago, are on the list now, while those whos camp they claimed have people still waiting) No I do not follow UGoD, but I bend to there rules, just as I bend to the majority rules. I have helped on UGoD raids, and will in the future if asked, but i don't follow their boards, I just do what i deem right, and most would do the same.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udrinkalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drinkalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 4:56:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Cleric Ragefire List Discussion</span><hr size=1> Errrr gunthur snuck one in while i did the last post so I feel I have to reply. Time played may seem as a stupid way, it does show whos put more time into the game, I doubt you'll see a lot of people being within a few hours cause they had some days they stayed logged on. Yes some are ready for this part before others, but you really don't have to have anything for this part. You can do it to start the cleric epic. Some people don't want to get involved in there epics till something makes them get um started. For example (some wizards could care less about getting thier epic till they can get the enraged golem inear as a huge booster to get them going) Rage can be like that for the clerics as well, but guilds push the clerics to get thier epics and the easiest way is in order, maybe some don't want to do it that way.<br>
<br>
Like i said before eerything I feel is out there. You can listen to it, ignore it, poke fun at it if you like now. Just got ideas in place. People don't like to rock the boat and with the list as it is in place now, if it was changed the people on it would be agrovated. I know it won't change, but maybe I can help keep lists from popping up all over EQ2.<br>

<br>
I see many guilds having more than 1 person on the list, and i'm 100 % sure that those guilds already have some cleric epics.  I think there should be given a priority to guilds who don`t have an epic cleric.  <br>
<br>
Why ? Well, just see it this way, those guilds will get many, many epics, wich ain`t all that important to them.<br>
<br>
Some guilds have to wait 6 months to get their ragefire, and yet they don`t have 1 epic cleric yet.  for them having to wait 6 months is ... well, who knows if the cleric is ready to wait 6 months anyways.  <br>
<br>
Those guilds having more than 1 will be getting epics for alts that they won`t probably play much, while a Primary cleric of a guild has to wait behind those.<br>
<br>
Fairness and useness should be given a priority on this RF list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unirtox.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirtox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Man from the Moon</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/02 5:10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fairness ??</span><hr size=1> Hiho,<br>
<br>
pls keep in mind that Epic isnt just about guild stuff. Guilds change, disband, you change guilds .. what stays is your accomplishment of having your epic. So why should a cleric in a big guild which has like 10 epics step down ? He has done all the pain stuff to egt there as any other cleric, so IMHO he got the same right to get his shot at his time.<br>
<br>
If the majority feels diffewrent than me change the rules (but who would keep track of epic clerics in guilds ???).<br>

I am in a guild with no epic cleric.  We want one pretty badly.  I get filled with mild frustration when I see people who belong to guilds with a dozen epic clerics far above me on the list.  (See my name.... waaaaaaay at the bottom.)<br>
<br>
However, I don't think we can find any method at all that allows us to objectively state that Person A from a_small_guild_01 is more deserving thatn Person B from uber_guild_02.  After all, what if, immediately after getting their epic, Person A dumps a_small_guild_01 and moves on to uber_guild_02?  What's to keep people from leaving big guilds, joining a small guild to get their name high on the list, then going back to their original guild?<br>
<br>
Also, we shouldn't punish someone just because they belong to a guild with a few epic clerics.  The epic does have a use outside of raiding; a cleric that does the work should have their fair place on the list.<br>
<br>
My one and only hope is that there are no bots on the list.  That's the one thing I truly could not abide: that someone who's botted a cleric trying for an epic over someone who's actively playing a cleric.  The distinction may be fine, but very important to me at least.  You want to bot a cleric, fine, just don't try to make that cleric epic while this Ragefire spawn thing is so screwed up.  Let &quot;real&quot; clerics get it for now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, those are my two cents on the subject.  Since it would be impossible to judge who &quot;needs&quot; the epic more, the first-come first-served method is the best that can be devised.<br>
<br>
Now, if only I could find a way to get the SF zone to reset after every RF kill.... &lt;wistful sigh&gt;<br>

How does any of that make me any less deserving of my epic?  I put in the time and effort for each and every stage of my epic.  I ate 2 unrezzed deaths in solb due to some misinformation I received.  Just because my guild has more then one person on the list and just because we have epic clerics does not make a difference.  I have worked long and hard and at one point was #24 on this list and am now #10.  And now people are saying that I nor others that may have epic clerics in thier guild are less deserving?  This is my main.  It is not a bot or an alt or anything of the like.  To say I or any other cleric is less deserving of their epic for these reasons is BS.  Flame me or say whatever you like but everyone on the list has put forth the effort to get on it and each is just as deserving as the next, period end of story. <p><p>Racknar Steelhammer<br>60 High Priest of Brell <br>Guardians of the Keep <br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140143>Racknar's Profile</a><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=257064>Klarisa's Profile</a></p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=46><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35>Cleric Ragefire List</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
