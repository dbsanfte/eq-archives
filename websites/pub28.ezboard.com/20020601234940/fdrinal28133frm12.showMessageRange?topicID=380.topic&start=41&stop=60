<br>
I knew about Ozzy, and it was I that authorised his re-invite after he told me he had done a mistake.  No one is invited to CS without my authorisation.<br>
<br>
And it is interesting to read Lord Spox's rant.  There is a guy that Jarak has potty trained quite well.  What he knows about me and CS comes from Jarak, and is full of the same shit that my members told me Jarak had been using to plant seeds of discontent within the guild.<br>
<br>
And really, if I am as horrible as you want people to believe, why do people stay in CS?  Why, in the last 5 months have only 5 people left this guild?  Why was it that not a single one left for DaoC? Half of the guild is European, why did no one do /movelog?  You want me to tell you?  It is because we are having one hell of a ride.  They love it.<br>
<br>
And btw, I have been trying to get a word of Nadin from the people who know her and I have not heard anything about her being in bad shape, let alone being in the hospital.  Not that I want to elaborate on her especially, Nadin is a very private person and would hate being dragged into some idiotic flame like this one.<br>
<br>
And yes.  I responded to Jarak with an attitude.  It is because I have no respect for selfish pricks like him.  If they stay out of my face I dont mind too much, but if they come asking for it I have no problems telling them how I feel about them. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/kald.jpg"></CENTER> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujarakmase.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarak Mase</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/rat.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/8/01 7:49:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=380.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.iol.it/okandrea/rat.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Jarak</span><hr size=1> I realize it's pointless responding to anything you write Kald, seems we get told different things by the same people, and too many conversations get taken out of context. you know the main problem between us? we never had the time to talk things out, I tried poking around it, to start a conversation about things that were going on, and concerns I had, but you were too busy. so I gave up, and everything got passed down a chain and lost meaning, and picked up some others. Now I'm not sure what to believe anymore, I hear someone I trust say one thing, and then it's counteracted by another person, which has been going on for quite a while. I didn't have to tell Spox about CS, he was in CS, and got to see what went on, he was at my house watching raids, he experienced things first hand. <br>
I can't believe this thread turned into a 2 month old flame about Me vs. CS, and I didn't want anything too personal about my relationship with Nadin to be posted up here either. I thought it would probably be a mistake starting this thread, and it probably was. But there is someone I care for ill, and the only thing I can do about it is type.<br>
You can think what you want about me, accept what all others tell you, and finish the story without reading the book. whatever makes you feel better. <p><b>Jarak Mase</b> (60th level Assassin)

<br>
It was good that you posted Ozzy, I had been wondering where the quote Jarak had in his second post was from, namely <br>
<br>
&quot;Kaldrani: &quot;and I'll make sure you never get in a guild larger than Stein&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I could not remember having said that to Jarak, and I agree, it would have been pretty childish.  Now I did not really remember having written anything about Ozzy either, he usually was in a pleasant mood, showed up and did his shaman rituals pretty well.<br>
<br>
After reading the drivel Ozzy left here I did go back to my posts looking for what on earth he could be talking about.  And yes, I did actually mention him in one post.<br>
<br>
The occasion was that Ozzy had left the guild without giving back a Trak BP he had borrowed from one of our shamans.  Several of the officers had written that they were afraid that he might not return it at all.  And yes, there I found a post, well, more like one sentence, about Ozzy.  This is it:<br>
<br>
&quot;I will get on him (...). If he thinks he can keep it he can forget joining any guild on this server larger than Stein...&quot;<br>
<br>
And there you have it.  Ozzroy and Jarak together looking like complete idiots.  Ozzy betraying someone’s trust, revealing that that someone has let him into the officer board, not to mention how totally groundless that post of his was.  And Jarak with his, to say the least misleading quote.  This is called lying where I come from Jarak.<br>
<br>
I could continue shooting to pieces every single word these gentlemen have written here.  It is the biggest collection of garbage and groundless drivel I have seen in a long while.  But you know what?   I have better things to do.<br>
<br>

Jarak has not &quot;potty trained&quot; me, I am one of the most out spoken and blunt people you could come to know. Everyone who knows me realizes this.  Another thing is Jarak isnt a backstabber he is a person just like everyone else that plays EQ.  He has always been a good friend and a generous one. He has spent more than 100k on my and my chars across several server as has Ozzroy. And you call him selfish. He has devoted so much time to helping his friends with quests, Teleports, items and cash problems its not funny.<br>
<br>
I was 45 and solo'ing in Lguk while Jarak/Adinus was going around Norrath helping people! I surpassed him in lvl quickly in game but I have never and will never surpass his integrity, intelligence, generosity, and the Honor and Loyalty that he devotes to his friends.<br>
<br>
The man had different views and different goals and because of this you made him your enemy. I fail to see the logic or reasoning behind this. I was in your guild. And what can I say when I played as Jarak I would sit and wait for 3 or more hours for players to arrive for a raid, this is pathetic. 6 groups for PoG, over kill and you equip your &quot;son&quot; in PoG gear with out him doing the work, thats dishonorable!!<br>
<br>
You may have a large guild but that doesnt make your right, nor does it make you the best. The lvl of your char doesnt measure your skill in the game either. I'm glad you like having a big guild. But I would rather have 15 of the most skilled players than a thousand semi-good players. You pursue THINGS not skill, and not perfection of the class. You do not seek to better the skills of others around you or improve their ablility to play their class to a higher degree. You want things you got things congrats! Its a hollow and shallow existance.<br>
<br>
I worked my tail of to become what I was, and while you were sucking your moms tit I was killing FG's and Naggy. You have no respect for the lvl of difficulty the old players went through to become what they are now.  Kald you are the greedy and selfish one, Jarak is the one who wanted info on a person he cares for, and your hate is for Jarak prevents him from easing his mind by finding out that Nadin is truely well.<br>
<br>
I know my words fall on deaf ears, but they will fall! As you will Kald, all leaders fail, it is destiny.<br>

In the end, this game is about people-I don't care if player_01 trained me in every zone I ever saw them, KSd every mob I tried to kill and ninja-looted me every time I turned my back for a second-if they sent me a tell asking for me to contact player_02 about something as important as someone being in the DAMN HOSPITAL, I'D FUCKING WELL DO IT. <br>
<br>
Kaldrani...yer an ass-if ya can't put aside petty shit that happened months ago to make one phone call because someone is sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, then yer as shallow and worthless as I've heard. Jesus, even your own guildies aren't supporting you here, just expressing concern over Nadin.

Well isnt that nice.  Lets just say I was kicking Naggy's tail before you started the game! and Lord comes from me being leader of a guild with Lord in the title. Lords of Exile was a guild of 45-50 persons way back before Kunark came out so back then being 50 was......what do you new people say Uber?<br>
<br>
My first char on tunare was Zepp, and if I am not mistaken I was the first DE warrior to 20 on Tunare. Something I was and still am very proud of.<br>

<br>
I have someone in game I hate with a passion, he tells me I /report it he comes in same zone as me I /d he's dead. BUT if he sent me a tell asking about one of the mutual friends we have being sick, you better believe I would do my best to help him out and set our differences aside. Personally I think what you did was not appropriate for a leader of any guild, especially one with many members. <br>
<br>
You arent helping your cause any by posting a quote you made about making sure someone didnt join any guild bigger than Stein, because of something as pety as a BP.<br>
<br>
It makes me sick to think a leader of a guild could respond to anyone in such a manner, as you did.<br>
<br>
People say the actions of guildmates refelct the guild as a whole, shouldnt that go double for an officer and triple for the leader?<br>
<br>
It really makes me wonder how you would respond to a tell saying a guild mate of yours just trained me ninja looted my mob, etc.<br>
<br>
Im guessing by your previous posts that it wouldnt be very helpful or polite.<br>

I received word that Nadin is well. I did not want this thread to turn into a bitch session from 2 months ago, I let it get out of hand, it is my fault. I posted here on the flame board, because I was disgusted, and frustrated with the way things were handeled by a certain guild leader. I wanted info, and I got info, by other means. There is no reason for anyone else to post anything after this post, if any of you choose to make a flame CS thread, by all means, start a new thread, but I don't want to see anymore on this thread. I'm not going to apologize to anyone for what was said here, it's my own problem that I let this thread get out of hand, and I'm sure it really doesn't bother anyone else. <br>
Thank you everyone who was showing your concern for Nadin's health, I can just say she is doing well. <p><b>Jarak Mase</b> (60th level Assassin)
