Ok, first I will paste an excerpt from my post made in the thread started by Tat.<br>
<br>
<br>
My first character was the only one I played until he was 50th level. Truehart, my Paladin, was played with total focus on XP and exploration. I had great fun with him. I had never even SEEN a chat room.<br>
<br>
Then at about 24th level, I was seeking a bind in Freeport for my first trip to Cazic Thule. A Druidess (NOT Merianne, long before) with a very flirtateous nature offered to bind me. Her and I talked some, and the flirting continued... and soon we found ourselves as full-time adventuring partners. We talked about our RL marraiges, about our likes and dislikes of a personal nature, and a strange type of bonding occured. It was something new to me, and hard to describe. Our attachment to each other was so close to RL feelings that both of us were scared, yet unable to stop it.<br>
<br>
Since her RL husband played, and was an Officer in our guild... we kept our closeness secretive. Eventually he became suspicious, and rather than to continue under the unpleasant circumstances that were now happening, I told her that I should leave the guild and stop seeing her in game. She was very hurt... I was saddened by it also. And thus began Truehart's legacy.<br>
<br>
After that I very soon met another very nice lady, and another, and another, then finally Merianne. In the early stages of these new 'friendships'... JUST AS IN THE ONE MERIANNE AND MYSELF JUST ENDED... light flirtation leads to extended conversation... leads to playing together on a daily basis... leads to very romantic conversation where BOTH persons tell each other what they would do to the other if they were in the same room. It is no cyber-sex dirty-talk where persons are typing 'one-handed'. It is more of a craving to reach out to that other person in a intimate way, and find some method of expressing the deep feelings of affection with another person that you are not able to physically touch.<br>
<br>
Well, here is where I went wrong and got the reputation that I have. In a RL meeting and dating that leads to 'going steady', the persons have everything ahead of them. Living together, marraige, raising kids...ect...ect. But in this EQ world, these relationships reach a point where there is no place to go but RL. Inevitably, both persons involved desire the RL meeting. It is only natural. And in the deeply emotion-charged atmosphere of a newly blossoming relationship online... one are both persons are very likely to make statements that they cannot follow thru with.<br>
<br>
When the guy says &quot;Gosh, if we could only have one night together..&quot;, and the woman says &quot;Oh, so you only want me for one night???&quot;... if the guy is a fool like me, he replies &quot;No, I think we would never be able to let each other go if we ever were to hold each other&quot;. And it goes on and gets deeper...and then one day the guy (ME) realizes &quot;Doh! I have a wife and son, and I cannot possibly go thru with what I am telling this lady!&quot;<br>
The next thing he says to himself (myself) is &quot;I have to get out of this NOW, because it can't go any farther here in EQ, and it has really gone a lot farther than it should&quot;. He (I) leaves the relationship.<br>
<br>
Now I am a cad, a scoundrel. The lady is telling all her friends what a jerk I am, and how I used her. But the fact is, up to the day I told her &quot;It is over&quot;, I was the best guy in the world. And that is what is happening with these /flame posts made by Merianne now. They are in response to me asking her to just be friends.<br>
<br>
Here is another bad part... the feelings of warmth and closeness one gets in these close relationships is really pleasurable... even addicting. And over the time I have played EQ, I have been in quite a few of them. They genarally go thru the same cycle that I described above, and after each one, I swear to myself &quot;NEVER AGAIN!&quot;... until the next Wood Elf sends me a tell complimenting me on how big my 'weapon' is, and what other big 'weapons' do I have. Then it starts again.<br>
<br>
Now as to reputation, I am a good player. I have never 'ninja looted', KSed, or left my group dead and camped. I have gained a &quot;bad reputation&quot; solely because many of my former lady friends have told all their friends that I hurt them, and their friends tell their friends... and in time I get people I don't even know telling me that I am a prick, and they can't even explain why.<br>
Then I also become sensitive to the point of thinking any person telling me the raid is full, or that the guild is not accepting new members... is telling me this because of being told something about me by a friend of a friend who was friends with a lady that I ended a relationship with. I want to be judged by my abilities as a player, not because of which lady I ended a relationship with. But people are loyal to friends, and I cannot blame them for that.<br>
<br>
So if this makes me a &quot;predetor&quot;, I can't say. What I can say is that Tat is completely correct in what she says in this post. Ladies, find your men in RL. Guys, be careful and play for the challenges of the game. If I were single, I would have probably never played EQ... would have been to busy out at social places meeting nice ladies to get to know. But having a wife that is probably better than I deserve, I stay home and play EQ.<br>
<br>
Sorry Merianne if I hurt you. And sorry to any other lady that feels that way also.<br>
*********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Now, this &quot;bad reputation&quot; spoken of by a couple of persons posting in this thread... I understand your supporting Merianne. She is a great lady, and although now showing herself a bit vendictive... and really just causing unfortunate problems for my friend who now has taken over my account.<br>
<br>
I am uncertain of his ISP address, but my DSL uses floating ISP and it changes every time I log on. So I am lost as to why you are saying that I am he. I had been logging on to my old account still, and those times I did, you would know because I said hello to you.  Any time that Coldhart was logged on was usually me, and after Eldarious removed Coldhart from Legio, I put him back... which I should not have. Now Eldarious has him in Seventh, and I no longer will be playing the account AT ALL.<br>
<br>
MERIANNE<br>
So since this issue you have is with ME... and furthermore, it is not based on any factor other than our personal relationship, what is the reason for posting stuff on Seventh Ward board? Are you worried that I may still sneak on and play on the account? Sorry, no. I have had my fill of EQ.<br>
<br>
And I do visit my friend's house and he visits mine. Our wives are good friends. And when he showed me the thread I went to post a reply on his pc ONE TIME. And I forgot to switch to my EZ-Board account before posting.<br>
<br>
The main thing is, I am not going to be contacting you, talking about you, even THINKING about you. We would have remained friends except that YOU could not handle us no longer being in a EQ relationship and decided to launch your sympathy campaign and warn the world about me. <br>
<br>
The fact is, if I want to play EQ again (which I doubt)... there are 100 ways to vanish, to PL new chars, or to play on any number of servers. And I am good at this game, so I will always find a good guild, make good money, and have a successful char if I so desire. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I really lost my temper when you posted on Eldarious' guild's board. The goal of that post was purely malicious, and went beyond your simple warning to ladies to avoid chars on this account. <br>
<br>
My friend did not deserve it, whether you believe he is me or not. Simply posting that ladies should avoid him would not have bothered him, but attributing my words to him was wrong. <br>
<br>
The facts are, I asked you if we could simply be friends instead of continuing in a online romance. Is that not true? And I would hope you could respect my wishes in that regard and none of this needed to take place. <br>

I don't even know where to start or why I am posting here, but I feel I need to chime in (God help me, against my better judgement!)<br>
<br>
Truehart/Coldhart/Propheci/Eldarious...<br>
My experience with you has never been anything but positive.  I can say honestly that you have always been a good player, an amiable guy and never offended me in any way.  I do not have any reason to NOT like you at all, but I do feel the need to relay a couple opinions.  When it comes to EQ relationships, the essence of each relationship is the bond between friends/lovers/spouses (depending on your RL situations and/or your desires in gameplay).  The fact that such relationships occur is natural in any &quot;human&quot; environment where this much time is devoted.  People will naturally gravitate toward certain others, and eventually those people become friends/lovers/whatever.  The setting may be vastly different than real life because we are &quot;pixels&quot; really while we play, but the essence is much the same as real life (personal interaction between people)  And thus, the approach to the these &quot;friends&quot; should be identical to that which occurs in the &quot;real&quot; world.  I would venture to say that not many who play EQ are out to spite people, or &quot;prey&quot; on them to make themselves feel better (although we all know there are those 12 year old kids that just bug the HELL out of us =P) but there are bound to be some who in fact, do these sort of things.  <br>
<br>
*pause*<br>
<br>
I'm going off in a direction I hadn't intended...  To the point, the relationship you had with Merianne is and has been your own.  When it comes to dealing with emotions that, by your own admission ran both ways, you above anyone here aside from Merianne herself should realize that your choice (be it fair or not, it is your own and you have every right to choose freely) to end this relationship would hurt her and/or you.  Friendships in any form are hard to end in any &quot;world&quot; and hurt is generally the result from that end to one or both of the parties involved.  The part that I do not understand is this:<br>
<br>
About your history with women from EQ and the relationships you have had with them...  Why would a man with a wife and children EVER involve himself so thoroughly with another woman, even if it is online?  I ask you that not in an accusatory manner, but in genuine curiosity. You seem to have taken on a stance above making yourself out to be the victim of a campaign of slander, when in fact you have as much fault for letting things go as far as they did, and hold the blame for your &quot;reputation&quot; amongst EQ women in your own hands, shaped by your own actions.  The fact that you have shaped this reputation in the manner you have, while having a wife in real life simply stuns me, but then again there goes my false hope in the moral fiber of mankind.  We, as men have a certain role and responsibility in our relationships with women, be it online or not, that you seem to have forgotten about somewhere along the line.  That responsibility is honesty, trust, support and any number of things we as men have an obligation to uphold when we invest our time and ourself with a woman, and ask her to do the same with us.  I don't understand how or why you would let this world spill over into RL.  Yes I have and will continue to speak to my online friends about my RL issues/concerns, no I would never lead anyone to believe in something about me that was not truthful.  That fact in and of itself, completely boggles me.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;emotions&quot; involved here, Merianne's post, although somewhat sharp at certain points, did not sound vindictive at all, and in no way did she attack you as you have her.  I doubt very much that someone who cared as much as you say you did/do/whatever, would rip into someone like that and bully them into a corner by revealing things that were shared between you during your relationship privately.  To me, that is just childish and flat out rude.  Did she originate this post?  Did she ask for anything from you when things ended?  Did she ever threaten to reveal to anyone the things you have said to her in privacy in a public forum?  Did she ever do anything during your relationship to warrant anything but your kindness and companionship?  Even with the rumors that were flying around before the final &quot;straw&quot; was drawn, she stood by you and had faith in you when many others were saying bad things about you and how you conduct yourself around female players.  As a man who has been through relationships (with a wife and a family no less) I would expect you to understand the emotional upheaval she is feeling at this moment, whether she wears a proud face or not.  As someone who cares I would have hoped that you could let her mourn in her own way, who cares if she warns women about you?  You don't want to do this AGAIN anyway you said, so why should that matter if your only concern is game play and not the relational side of the EQ world?  I understand you wanting to defend yourself, but the facts are the facts my friend.  You have made your own bed, and sometimes you just have to lie in it.<br>
<br>
As for you and your friend and sharing accounts...  Nobody will ever know for certain who plays, or who they are dealing with when they come across your characters.  I very seriously doubt there are 2 of you, based on opinion, experience with all 3 of the characters personally, and just plain common sense.  Let's be honest for a moment, anyone who has 3 characters past level 50 in this game would not just up and quit because of this.  You have as much of an &quot;addiction&quot; (gah, I hate saying that word to myself even) as the rest of us to this game.  Saying that you have very many alternatives to retain your anonymity is a lot closer to the truth, but if we stop to think for a moment and think of the time invested, we all would come up with a solution most likely similair to your own.  Say you &quot;gave&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; your account to someone else and don't play EQ anymore, that way you erase the bad name you have unfortunately earned, while retaining the ability to play your high level characters for the fun/loot/adventure that a lower level character even twinked to the gills cannot hope to achieve without more arduous time invested.  I guess none of us will really ever know when we come across these characters...  /shrug<br>
<br>
I realize now that I have chosen which side of the fence I stand on, and I regret that we have to be on opposing sides because I have learned from and respected you as a player and a groupmate/guildmate.  But I for one, will not stand to see a lady as sweet and giving as Merianne (no matter what her alleged &quot;cyber-sex&quot; fascinations may or may not be) dragged through the mud by a man who cannot come to grips with the reality he has created for himself through his poor judgement and questionable actions.  As I have said in another way above, sometimes as a man you just have to take your lumps and wait for tomorrow to come.  Respect your history with her and the false hopes you led her to, if not yourself, enough to let it rest.<br>

I like how you try to come off as Merianne is the first person you've hurt True/Eld (and yes, YOU have told  people in game that it is indeed you, you claim to have changed your name for various reasons..... one of which was to get away from your current lady ... I take it that was Merianne) Oh wait, I forgot..... everyone is always out to get you.... you are never the bad guy, always the injured party.<br>

Thank you to those people who have posted and validated my first post. To those of you wanting to protect Eld, well i applaud you for comming to the aid of your so called friend. But I know what I know. If you believe him that is your choice (and I wish you well and hope he causes you no pain or grief) Eld and True are one in the same.........

Your points are well thought out and very accurate. I accept the admonishment willingly. Yes, getting involved in such online romances is not morally upright. I along with many others who are in RL relationships are guilty of this. We look at it innitially as just a game, and the romance as make-believe. Eventually real feelings develop and the ante is raised. If you take a look at every couple sharing a last surname in EQ, I guarentee you will find the majority of them are married in RL to somebody other than their EQ marraige partner.<br>
<br>
As to my unleashing of information about Merianne, that was a loss of temper resulting from her deliberate aims at trying to simply cause problems for the characters on this account. If it were simply warning others to beware of getting involved romantically with chars on this account, my response would have been...as it was...measured. She went the added length of posting on the guild board of my friend Eldarious' guild. Her objectives here were only to inflict harm and cause trouble, not just issue her warning. Since Eldarious has no plans or aims at getting involved with females online, I don't think warning females to avoid him would really be any trouble for him. She took my post and applied it to him with the intent of trying to make Seventh Ward be offended by him. It was a malicious cheap shot that was not called for simply because I asked Merianne if we could just be friends, and end our online romantic involvement.<br>
<br>
Countess Consuela,<br>
If you read my post more carefully, you would see that the relationship I spoke of in it was not Merianne but I was speaking of my first online relationship. There were many... including the one with you, I assume... that happened between that one and Merianne. And why do you always replace &quot;ended the relationship&quot; with the term &quot;hurt me/her/them&quot;? You always say &quot;Truehart hurt me ... Truehart hurt them... Truehart hurt her&quot; when the truth is, there was a reason my ending the relationship hurt you. That reason was that you did not want it to end. Otherwise, it would not have hurt you. So the truth is, I was a good partner... fun to be with, and I met your emotional needs at that time. The only thing that I did to &quot;Hurt You&quot; was to bring the relationship to an end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 6:08:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> You know, it just occurred to me that nobody has really heard exactly how this happened. I think it needs saying.<br>
<br>
Merianne and I had slowly began spending less time together. Our play hours no longer were compatable, and we had been talking less and less over the last month. <br>
<br>
About a month ago, I had spoken to Merianne and explained that the possiblity of a RL meeting was not really feasable to discuss, and that I was sorry that our previous talks had held it as such a possible outcome.<br>
<br>
Then about a week ago, I spoke to her and asked her if we can end our EQ relationship and just consider ourselves friends. The conversation was amiable, and ended on a positive note. <br>
<br>
Then 5-6 days passed... and all of a sudden this /flame post appears, and I learn that she is telling our personal business to other persons. They in turn are sending tells to Eldarious, and he calls me up saying WTF!<br>
<br>
Eldarious changed the password on me because of this, so I cannot go into game unless I start a new account, but I have access to the boards here... which I read at Eldarious request. And so here we are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unagicamfumblephinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nagicam Fumblephinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 9:30:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> I wish you had not left also Merianne. =(<br>

You only deserve the lowest scum on the bottom of the ocean. The more you talk, the deeper your grave grows. I'm definately GLAD Countess made this flame. Not because I would ever get into a relationship with you, but so more people can see what kind of sick idiot you are. So flame me &quot;HONEY&quot;.. but I will tell you this, I do not know anyone who has ever had a relationship with you.. so you can keep that little part out of your story. The more you defend yourself only tells the world how much of a liar you really are. Only manipulators and liars go on and on and on over something like this. Other people would just say 'eh, she's pissed. I'll give her some time'<br>
<br>
I can't believe the woman you had kids with puts up with you. I generally wont attack someones real life stature, but you need it. Whatever, you're a loser. and Yes, I SAID LOSER. Go to hell. You make me and probably 90percent of the women who will ever read this, SICK! Why do you think us women hate men so much at times? Moments like these. And yes, Karma will come to bite you in the ass. Just wait till your wife finds these boards. I pray for her heartache. I pray for your son. Why not do yourself a favor, and just leave the boards now, since you've already left the game. There is nothing more to defend now, because the more you talk, like I said, the deeper your hole gets and the more people reply. So this discussion will never be over until you leave. Later jerk.<br>

<br>
Well I tried my best to keep my distance from most of this relationship mess while TH was in Jus Divinum, but obvioulsly that is impossible with the way he conducts himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Truehart was one of the first people I grouped with that I didnt already know from JD.  Basically I was trying to hang out with Merianne and a few others and TH was always with Merianne so we grouped a lot.<br>
<br>
While he may want you to believe he is a great player etc... from my groupings with him he proved often what type of player he is/was.<br>
<br>
Here is how things would go, we would have a small group in KC back around lvl 47-51 or so, usually Merianne was the only healer.  I was around 47-49 and relatively new to the zone at the time.  We would pull stuff to the zone and fight.  Pretty straight foward it would seem.<br>
<br>
However when things started getting heavy and too many mobs (no chanter no cleric) I would call &quot;zone&quot; out to the group since without true crowd control or a cleric AND given the fact that we were low 50s/high 40s, 3-4 dogs was too much for our small group.<br>
<br>
Truehart of course would say &quot;no dont zone&quot; so considering he was the group leader and more experienced with the zone I listend and stayed.  And I would die, oh well I am a tank that is what I do, but Merianne would also die, and *THEN* truehart would zone after we died.<br>
<br>
Now that is pretty normal if it happened once.  But it happend again and again, he would second guess anyone elses calls, and I think on that night I died 2X Merianne died 2-3X and truehart never died of course.<br>
<br>
I chalked it up to bad luck, but I had a deeper feeling that if we were zoning when I called it perhaps Meri  and I wouldnt have died so much, but I forgot about it no big deal.<br>
<br>
Until of course it happend on every raid and every group I was with truehart.  Being the greedy bastard that he was, zoning to him was the last case scenario, which is ok if that is your plan and the group is ready for that kind of thing.  But it was really funny how Truehart never died and his &quot;beloved&quot; wife was always dieing in the groups I was with him.<br>
<br>
Another event comes to mind in SolB.  We were going to try efreeti with 2 groups, I had never done him before so I said sure.  Well trying to FD pull the imps wasnt going so hot, couldnt get them to split but I managed to FD with 3 at the rocks.  While I was FDing Truehart ran over to see what was up.  A mistake but not that big of a deal since I was new to the zone , of course he attracted 4-5 imps even though i was /shouting/oocing HOLD HOLD HOLD (standard FD statement)<br>
<br>
So he brought back a bunch of IMPs to the camp and the proceeded to wipe everyone's butt.  Of course I was yelling NO NO NO when he agroed the imps and the smart thing for him to do would have been to just stand there and die.  Of course if you played with TH on Mith Marr you would have realized that he doesnt do that.  He waits til you are dead then he runs :)<br>
<br>
So instead of just dieing at the spot I was FD at he brought back a ton of Imps to the camp and a few of us were like &quot;Holy shit GATE!' and truehart of course was &quot;NO STAY AND FIGHT&quot; so as the group went down to the imps that he pulled to camp DESPITE me saying HOLD and DESPITE the others saying gate , we all stayed and fought til most of us died, NOT TRUEHART though of course, and when most of us died, he finally called gate for his group BEFORE he died , of course.<br>
<br>
While I am far from the most elite EQ player ever, I have had my share of successful raids (most after lvl 51 or so when I started really learning how to do it) but like most others I have made mistakes.  Truehart doesnt though, he does things intentionally to try and get that last big of XP or to get that phat loot , he will intentionally let his wife/guildmates die knowing that is even more XP for him if the mod dies and he can just zone.<br>
1 time is like oh well, but 3 times of refusing to zone in a matter of 1 hour that causes 6 deaths of other people and 0 deaths of your own wouldnt you tend to rethink what you are doing?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh well I chalked that up to bad luck as well, but similar things would happen over and over, truehart letting everyone else die DESPITE people shouting &quot;zone or gate&quot; etc.. because he was such a brave paladin, but somehow he managed to avoid death at all costs.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has played with me in EQ knows that I die and its no biggie, but I might complain if I feel the death was totally unwarranted.  I never complained during any of these events and since Meri was his GF I just trusted Meri on these issues and thought maybe our play style doesnt fit<br>
<br>
<br>
Later on a fear raid with JD and others there were some paladin boots or something that dropped.  Guladan won them and decided to let Silia loot them , basically giving Silia the boots that he had won the rights to.  No big deal, nice boots for bluebie Sil right? Wrong<br>
<br>
The next day Truehart writes this big post on our JD boards with all this hypothetical analysis of how if it is ok for Silia and Gul (he left their names out as if no one knew what he was talking about) to give each other items won on a raid then perhaps he should bring 10 paladin friends so that if any of them won something that would increase his chances of getting it.<br>
<br>
Yes he actually said that based on Silia and Gul exchanging a lottoed item that whats to stop him from bringing 10 paladin friends who might win it and then just give it to him. <br>
<br>
Would anyone here ever post something like that on their own guild's message board?<br>
<br>
I was like &quot;drak wtf is up with this guy&quot; and Drak bit his toungue like most of us did.  We tried to work things out and smooth it over but of course things like that kept coming up again and again.<br>
<br>
When I would vent to a friend about this type of crap they would all say the same things &quot;dude, I learned long ago to just avoid that guy at all costs, I love Merianne so I wont say anything bad to her about him, its easier just to stay away&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I would mention the events like repeated death at the zone in KC because he insisted that we not zone and how he never died, and I would get the same response<br>
&quot;Dude didnt I tell you to avoid him :) Its your own fault for grouping with him&quot;<br>
<br>
After a while I wondered how the hell did this clown get in Jus Divium anyway.  and I would hear<br>
&quot;well we sort of rushed him in because he was friends with Merianne&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I heard about the whole GBC thing etc...<br>
<br>
Ok fast forward and he moves to Drinal and takes our Meri with him :(<br>
<br>
Next thing you know he is posting the most disgustingly kiss ass thread on the Cats in Hats message board ( i used to post there occasionally) that I might just did up so we can all have a good laugh; trying to get invited into their guild.<br>
<br>
So we all know about how he views EQ women, he admits freely that he should have just made them &quot;bite the pillow&quot; he also likes to label all his exes as &quot;bitter&quot; and vengeful, and there is some debate as to whether or not this is him playing this account or someone else.<br>
<br>
I think we should all take that advice that I should have taken and just avoid him.<br>
<br>
It just amazes me that it has taken so long for this to come out, finally we have people speaking out on their take on truehart.  I am sure Drak has 100X the stories that I have re: this guy.<br>
<br>
I bit my toungue back in the JD days, and now I kinda wish I hadnt.  The fact that he was sending soap opera head shots out to women in RL is just so friggin sad, you can rationalize it all you want guy but it just points to what a friggin sad sack you are<br>
<br>
I think this quote sums up the *real* you and what you are really about<br>
<br>
[quote]
Anybody want a testamony on the evils of EQ marraige, here it is. Best thing is to flirt, tease, take a lady friend of to some hidden spot (after making sure she really IS a lady) and make her bite the pillow... then be on your way with no mention of the "R" word (RELATIONSHIP). Long as you stay away from those, I think you will avoid my situation... that of having a line of former EQ wives and girlfriends wanting to tear you limb from limb.

Dang me. Dang me. They outta take a rope and hang me... up from the highest tree. Woman would ya weep for me? *grins*

<br>
If anyone knows Drak, then you know to get on his shitlist you really need to be quite the asshole.  As much of an asshole as people think I might be [/wave weylin ;)] even the longwinded Saevan Expane remains in his good graces ;)  Just imagine what this truehart fool must have done to make someone as good hearted as Drak look down upon him.<br>
<br>
While my many pointless deaths at the expense of Trueharts XP bar were easily correctable (by grouping with anyone else but him ;)  The pain and hurt and asshole manuevers that he pulled were so shameful and mind boggling that his reputation is and should be forever tarnished.<br>
<br>
The fact that you asked Meri to pay for you to play EQ is just so damn low, you truely are the biggest scumbag I have ever come across in game.<br>
<br>
And now you come here and disrespect this fine person to try and defend yourself...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukerneytinkertrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerney Tinkertrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 1:52:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> plz dont hate me because i have a penis <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 3:35:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> Well, up until now I was pretty much pointing out that I have been wrong. I was accepting criticism from many that gave honest oppinions of their feelings. I was only in defense pointing out that the thing I had done wrong was ending past relationships that caused hurt because during those relationships RL feelings became involved. <br>
That was up until Saevan posted here with a complete pack of lies and half-truths. On what night did you dream all these deaths while grouped with me? Anybody interested can ask Merianne herself about this. Merianne was hurt by our relations ending, and because of things I said and did not go through with, but she is a very honest person. She will be the first to tell you that Saevan's account of everybody getting killed while I zoned out is a complete lie. Saevan grouped with me because I was always able to form a good group in KC, and I knew how to pull there. <br>
<br>
The account of the Fear raid is a half-truth. Gulmer had been playing his Shaman exclusively since I joined the guild. His Pally was not a good group companion for Silia, who he enjoyed grouping with daily. So when I went on a Fear raid and saw him playing Gulmer, I was quite surprised... but assumed he was there to get some Pally armor for his char and maybe start playing him again.<br>
<br>
Silia won Val Gloves. Our loot rules in JD said no player may get 2 pieces until all have won something... as most guilds concur. Well not long after, Arms dropped and me and Gulmer were in the lotto. He won...which was fine, but then he asked Silia to loot them, giving her 2 pieces. Then it dawned on me... he was not really there to equip his Pally, but to win Val armor for Silia. To me is was simular to a person bringing a friend along playing an alt to give them added chances of winning Planar gear. <br>
<br>
I posted the next day on JD board leaving out names and just stating what happened. The Officers that responded agreed this was probably not right. THEN Silia posted revealing who the involved parties were and SOME oppinions changed... Silia was very popular in JD. But Saevan posted most notably in her defense, and while I was only seeking a rule to cover the situation on future raids... not asking that this be admonished or rebuked. Saevan posted factless emotion filled dribble to endear himself to Silia. <br>
<br>
Once again Saevan posts a epitath of factless exaggerations and even out-right lies in the hope that nobody will dispute what he says... since he feels Merianne is upset enough with me to not correct his made up history of past events. Merianne just might suprise you, Saevan. She was there too, and we did not die hardly ever. I remember ONE occasion that we got trained and at Right Moat by some adds... and YOU died there... and me and Meri ran and she got killed before making zone. So you take that one evant and try to say it was a regular occurrance. What are you smoking?<br>
<br>
And the Efreeti Raid that we got wiped on ... you were FD pulling and I was pulling off you. You got hit hard with a couple failed attempts to FD and died. I was *trying* to get close enough to /corpse pull you out and I got aggroed. And I had Meri pick me up and take me back to Lava and I took ANOTHER death to pull your sorry ass close enough to LBugs for us to get our corpses. So I don't know WTF you are remembering. Once again, I will say ask Merianne what happened. You obviously have Altzhiemers /s Disease. <br>
<br>
You have a bad habit of trying to see which side is winning in a debate, and jumping on the side that is on top ... spouting a bunch of exaggerated BS and trying to gain popularity points. Just STFU <br>
<br>
I am accepting my thrashing for ladies I have hurt by leaving relationships after they have gotten deeply involved with me emotionally. But I will not have you adding completely false BS, Saevan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 4:05:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> I am going to end my participation in this thread now. <br>
<br>
I accept that I was an ass and a selfish, egotistical fool. I got in relationships and falsely made statements that there was a real chance of RL involvement when I knew that I had no intention of doing so. In doing that, I allowed many fine ladies to adjust RL affairs in anticipation of meeting me, even to the point of not dating or seeking to meet nice guys in RL... while they waited for me to arrange my affairs to go be with them. <br>
<br>
I don't know why I did it, and I did at times entertain the idea of going thru with at least 2 of these RL meetings... but in the end that matters little. The only thing that matters is that ladies were hurt that did not deserve to go thru the crap I put them thru.<br>
<br>
I deserve no sympathy, and ask for none. I understand why these actions would affect the way I am veiwed in this game. The closest thing I can say to a defense is that I never entered any relationship online with the intent of hurting anybody. It was always intended to be a game. <br>
<br>
So place my name at the head of the EQ Asshole list along with the other people that were ran from the game. The EQ community has rendered judgement, and I am found guilty. <br>
<br>
Merianne, I will send you the $30.00 I owe you. You know that I offered to pay you on 2-3 occassions and you would not accept it. I realize it will not relieve the pain I caused you, but at least it will remedy you being financially affected by our relationship. It was wrong to allow you to pay my acocunt when I cancelled my credit card... and your offering to do so was out of love. I would offer to pay your account for a few months ... even now, if I felt you would accept it.<br>
<br>
Good bye Drinal. I am sure you will be cleansed and more pure without me tarnishing you with my presence.<br>
<br>
I think that Eldarious will end up being donated to Seventh Ward, and Truehart and Coldhart will certainly be deleted. It will not be me playing Eldarious, that fact is for certain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqwack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qwack</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://home1.gte.net/chiefq/icon1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/01 5:20:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> A synopsis of what I posetd elsewhere,  Saevan there are so many of us that continued to bite our tongue and now wish we didnt.

Well I don't know what happened between you and these other women, but I will go off what I know of you from the past.<br>
<br>
Ma Yuan = Days of old where Tru was part of, heck practically your entire cats in hats guild at one point was all ex Ma Yuaners. Anywho, Tru was always a good lad, willing to help those when they needed. <br>
<br>
Now to the lady he broke it off with in EQ, you need to realize, he made a mistake, he admitted it, he is doing what he should of done right off the bat. Realized he has a family and is a father and can't be screwing around on them like he was. As much as you may think it was innocent, it wasn't. Anyone who thinks this who is married apparently has a weak marriage or has a hard time staying loyal to one person in life.<br>
<br>
If Tru, wanting to make right the wrongs by no longer associating with this lady *neither should of never let it go that far to begin with* then darnit, let it be. You know I think you all forget if I read the posts right this lady is married as well? To all those out there saying Tru is a evil man, then explain this to me, it's ok for her to fool around on her RL man but it isn't ok for Tru? See where I am going here, takes two to tango and they BOTH are at fault. Both in RL marriages, this lady is as much at fault here as Tru is for allowing their feelings wander away in a game and betray their wedding vows they once took up. <br>
<br>
Their both wrong but those who are coming here saying what a bad man Tru is and how hurt this other lady is, well maybe you need to go see your local priest, pastor or whatever and get a photo copy or have them explain to you the vows of marriage. Don't be condeming just Tru here, if she thinks tru is evil for realizing his wrongs and breaking up with her, then she needs to get over it, because she broke the sacred vows of her marriage as well and that makes her just as guilty. <br>
<br>
I love how people seem to forget just how sacred the vows of marriage are anymore. Grow up, gain some responsibility and people stop letting your sexual urges do your thinking for you and keep sacred the vows you swore to your loved ones! *shakes his head* I shouldn't of even had to say that, that's just common sense!<br>
<br>
Tru, he's a good guy, he screwed up BIG TIME, but so did this other chick so LET IT GO ALREADY and let the man alone, he knows his responsibilities lie within his RL family first, thank goodness he finally realized that! All of you &quot;ladies&quot; who came here flaming Tru need to drop it and remember, it was also a lady who is responsible for letting it go as far as it went, again takes two to tango.<br>
<br>
You can say what you want but in the end you know damn well I am right by what I just spoke of. I hope both Tru and this other lady get their RL lives settled and take care of their RL mates they swore to love and cherish in greater or for worse and become good rolemodels for their children by displaying good examples to them from here on out. <br>

I can not stand the person it is about and have tried to avoid any conversations with/about him at all. (even to the extent of it causeing a rift between my RL sister Merianne and I) I am posting now however due to the fact that my name was mentioned (thanks Saevan *Hugs* you brat!)<br>
<br>
I will not sit here and Flame this guy, cause if I did I could write for days, and I'm sure no one wants to hear my jaded opinion on this guy. I will however tell you that it hurt to see my sister so hopeful about something and so trustful about something and then see her hope crushed.  Yes she championed this person (that is the way we were raised, if you care about someone, you take up for that person) Merianne championed to the fact that she lost a lot of contact with people who were truely her friends but frustrated she would not even think to listen to them.  I also was an officer of JD...... and I was the one a lot of others came to when they had complaints about this person cause no one wanted to upset my sis.<br>
<br>
My last staw with this person came when he posted his hypothetical situation (see Seavan's post :) about me and a good friend i happen to group with in EQ.  He didn't even get the facts straight........ and when it was called out, facts kept changing. ( I will not get into the numerous facts that were wrong because it would take too long and i'm sure no one cares, all that know what happen know there was nothing dishonest with what happend)<br>
<br>
It is very sad that someone waited this long to post this.  Bal, I agree with most of your post about looking at both parties involved, but the point I disagree with is the fact you only talked about &quot;one&quot; lady. From all I understand, and from all the info anyone has ever givin to me he's done this repeatly (and even admitted to it), I'm sure not all of those women were married.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Sis, I am very sorry you got hurt by this and I really wish you had never left Mith Marr. There is one reason why I did not split with you and this post is about it. *hugs* I wish we could get you back on Mith Marr but you have told me you have made some good friend there so I guess I'll just have to talk to you on the phone *grin*  BTW I'm glad to finally have my sis back again :)<br>
<br>
As for you True, we are pretty much aware of what the other feels about each other so I will not lower myself to post my personal feelings of you here. I will say for all i've read and all i know YOU are this cleric Eld. But I'm not going to argue it cause it's not worth the effort.<br>

PS.  Oh, hehehe good opertunity to say hi to all my friends on Drinal :) Hi, and I hope you all are doing well!!!!<br>

<br>
As far as you having &quot;good groups in KC&quot; it was you Merianne and myself, perhaps you dont remember us dieing , but I do.  As I said &quot;why the heck are will still dieing at the zone even when multiple people are calling zone&quot;<br>
<br>
Another case? Hmm Chardok raid, Becman was pulling and calling out mobs.  Truehart decided he is going to start being the leader and calling out mobs despite Beckman having lead the raid for a while, finally after about 5-6 times of Truehart trying to take over control, Beckman asked you straight up &quot;would you like to pull and lead the raid&quot;?<br>
<br>
Still think I am lieing? oh well, ignore my post then and look at the 30 or so folks from Jus Divinum who cant stand the sight of you.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is I knew NOTHING about you or your past when I joined JD&gt;  I made a very strong attempt to be friendly and get to know you. when I had these problems NO ONE in JD would get into ANY detail about anything and just bite their tounge<br>
<br>
I figured out after a while for myself what you were all about.<br>
<br>
And here you are many moons later and all this shit has come out about you , funny how that works out doesnt it, Me, Qwack, Drak, everyone wished you and Meri well when you left for drinal, and we meant it honestly, but you treated Meri like shit over here it seems in addition to pissing off countless others and now you have illegally transferred your account.<br>
<br>
I may have varying reputations on Mith Marr, most of my friends know who I am and what I stand for. Any bad rep I have on Mith Marr is from speaking my mind (probably a little too much at times) and telling the truth.<br>
<br>
Even those people who dislike me/hate me do so because of words we exchanged straight up disagreements over something, not because of some backhanded twisted lies.<br>
<br>
Perhaps there is an archive of your posts on the JD boards, most of them seemed like opening statements in lawsuit. :)  You made us all very uncomfortable in Jus Divinum and still we wished you well on your journeys, we thought well if Meri is with him then perhaps it will all be ok in the end.<br>
<br>
If you only knew the way Drak and Qwack and other bent over backwards to try and make things run smooth with you around.  They did Truehart dmg control all the time and never blabbed about it to anyone outside of our JD home that I know of.<br>
<br>
So even with your reputation  I got to know you with a clean slate, and I figured you out bro, I just didnt figure it would turn out this bad or you would truly be this ugly of a person.<br>
<br>
Maybe you are a lawyer in LA in RL and thats where you get it from ;)<br>
<br>
Again if you dont want to believe me, that is fine, I am merely one voice amoung many singing the same chorus.  Funny how I came to the same conclusion as so many others, even though I had no idea who you were to start with <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=229.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=229.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=229.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=229.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=110.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=229.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=229.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=229.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
