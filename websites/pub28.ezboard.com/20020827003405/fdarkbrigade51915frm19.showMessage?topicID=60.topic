Does it matter to you which guild you join?<br>
<br>
Edit: I see you actually posted to our guild after you applied to At Death's Door. Does this mean you have an epiphany in the 7 minutes between posts? I am sorry to sound cynical if your intentions are honest, but I like to think that my guild is special and deserves better than someone who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> appears</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> just to be looking for an &quot;uber&quot; type guild. We have a lot of potential to offer, but we aren't uber and it is more important to us to be part of a team rather than &quot;l33t&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to respond, I am interested in what you have to say.<br>

another edit: reading my post, I think it can be interpreted as being bitchy. I really wasn't meaning for it to come across that way. I was merely questioning the motives behind the double posts, and X was still hanging around the board and responded right away. Thanks for clarifying your original post as well. Personally I don't see a problem with checking out more than one guild as long as you are upfront about it.<br>
<br>
I went and checked out the web site for your other guild, and it seems they had been pretty busy lately. I also noticed the message board is similar to the ones here. Unlike SZ folks, RZ don't seem entirely wrapped in PvP and griefing, and have lives beyond ganking fellow players. Again, hope I didn't offend, and thanks for answering my question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwhytspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whytspirit</A> at: 7/1/02 6:39:20 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujubiley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jubiley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen JuJu Bee</span><br>  Posts: 601<br> <font color=#939393>(7/2/02 9:09:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdarkbrigade51915frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Applaction of X PKER of Rallos Zek XBLADE</span><hr size=1> <br>

The Rambo comment he made about himself was given by me.<br>
I gave him that title because of his actions.  He took it upon himself to pull mobs while the MT pulled.  I saw him use his bow at one point and questioned him about it.  He said he didn't use it but then later on he admited to it (which was a good thing because I wasn't the only person who saw him do this).  Luckily we had a strong group and was able to finish off all the mobs.  It got bad to a point where I had to literally tell him that he was endangering the group and he needed to play smart.  I'm not positive but I think he might have even broken a few mezzes and I know that JuJu don't like that hehe.  There were also a few times when he would stand around (I don't know if he was laggy or not) and I would have to ask him what he was doing.  I think he's a bit rough around the edges (maybe from playing on a pvp server) but he isn't a bad guy and nor am I trying to make him look bad in any way.  Just stating what happened when I grouped with him that one day in UD.<br>

Please send a /tell to an officer and let us take care of it.<br>

We don't exactly want to make judgement on others on a public forum.  Unless they are 'ninja' class type folks... then we will sufficiantly publically humilate them.<br>

I played my Shaman alot to 60 I also leveled a 55 necro mance on RZ only to get him  hacked and Banned /sigh =( I have leveled a 55 Sk and Delevled him to 35 with full Umbral and Soul Leech to Pk =) I leveled to 51 on Sullon Zek a Paladin on the neutral team he was on the same account as my Necro. I loved to play my Shaman but aslike I stated in my orginal post its time to move on and would like to play on Quellious. On Rallos zek everyone is not a pker, you have your anti guilds and Pkers we fight alot lol, then you have your anti guilds to War the other top guilds. I remember back in the day when a Sector that had 4 guilds in it fighting another Sector that had 4 guilds all the guilds were so uber yet they fought. Synergy Vs Rebirth those were the 2 sectors yet atm both are gone from Rallos :/<br>
