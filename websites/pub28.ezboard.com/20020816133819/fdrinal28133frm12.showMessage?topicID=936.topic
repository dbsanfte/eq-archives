Needless to say, because -I- am not straight, it pissed me off, and I went off on the bastard for a little bit...it ended in me being really pissed, and the other guy......being a prick.<br><br>Now, it was a level one, so who the fuck cares who it was? He camped and probably deleted, little bitch.<br><br>But I've seen this MANY times in game, people have started the whole &quot;Ohh..ohh....gay is wrong gays are evil, kill all of them&quot; or whatever bullshit, or they preach to people like me about HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE. Now, if I want to go out, and have wild unprotected sex.....I'm going to, you cant stop me, I'll just face the consequences.<br><br>But this has to fucking stop...okay? It's not like I run around screaming &quot;CHINKS SHOULD BURN! NIGGERS DIE! DOON COONS, GO SHOOT SOME PEOPLE UP, YOU DAMNED IDIOTS!&quot; Because that isnt me. I think that's wrong, and what I think personally shouldnt matter as long as I don't shout it across the lands....I'll think what I want, but do I broadcast it? No.<br><br>K, and what is even worse, is that people will talk about how &quot;homos&quot; should all die, even like, in ooc in some places. Yes, okay, why don't I just fucking break?<br><br>Bottom line is, it has to stop, and I'm so tired, the grammar is probably horrid here......but yes.<br><br><br>Oh, and to all those in white wind (my guild) I have not been on due to this and because I'm out on personal leaves, because I'm sick of this type of shit happening, when the fuck did EverQuest go to shit? level 60 newbies running around, people harassing others, STUPID FUCKING SHIT. I'm also really torn over something that happened in real life...but God, Everquest is an escape, who cares whether your tall, short, white, black, straight, gay......etc?!?!<br><br>I might be on again this week, but I'm tired of ALL of the petty shit that is going on, I dont care if WIII is coming out, still no excuse for some stupid fucking loser on a powertrip to sell his account....... (sorry this got off track, I need sleep) <br><br>So, uhm, don't down something until you have tried it.....or you have friends in that position. Have a gay friend? Sure, then talk all the shit you want, because....in my eyes, that makes you one of the fucking people in this world we can live withOUT.<br><br><br>*/bitch off* */grammar check on*<br><br>Briyan Transeau<br>White Wind<br>Monk of 48 Beatings  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujazminatheshaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JazminaTheShaman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 3:51:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=936.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  /report and blow them off</span><hr size=1> Well, I know all the close minded fools are gonna try to rip you apart in this thread. Its just so predictable.<br><br>But I, for one, applaud you for having the strenght and courage to be who you really are. The only people that should matter to you are people who are going to accept you just that way. Noone else means anything.<br><br>People are just people. You can't help the way you are and to judge or harass someone b/c of something they can't help is really immature and stupid. So, ignore them and be proud of who you are. You cant make someone thats ignorant, not ignorant. People have to change themselves.<br><br>The minute you see someone in game saying things like that /report as fast as you can and that will get them banned. Banned is what they should be.<br><br>Here is something for you I want you to remember-<br>&quot;Don't take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others- you won't be the victim of endless suffering.&quot;<br><br>Anything anyone says has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them. Half the time I think people in everquest, or online period, are just trying to piss people off, its just a big game to them.

That being said, you belong to a great guild of really extraordinary people. Try to focus on that instead of the bad things that are always going on in-game.<br><br>Also try and realize that the average maturity level and age of this game is going to be lower than RL. That being said, there are a lot of really cool people playing (your guild has a preponderance of them). I do know that if you allow people to get under your skin, you are not going to enjoy what is otherwise a really fun and really wonderful escape.<br><br>More than anything, people are judged by what they do in game. You saw what we went through for Kassiopea to get her epic. I don't know who Kass is in RL.I don't know her RL name even. What I do know is that Kass is a wonderful person in-game, and worked really really hard to try and do Phinigel (5 kills or something, every 14 hours, tracked, waited for pop, and set up raid party), She went on lots and lots of Dragon raids, went to Fear over and over (every time playing by the rules and watching loot rolls go against her, etc) and always maintaining an attitude of dignity and hope that it would some day happen. When the opportunity came up for me to try and help her, there was no question in the matter.<br><br>You don't have to ignore your feelings when something like this happens. It is good to have motivation in-game and be passionate about something, even if it is just working against people that are unjust to you by being happy. I find that people that act like this generally end up getting what they deserve. They get kicked out of their guilds, get ignored by people, end up quitting, etc...<br><br>Don't allow assholes to win by letting them ruining your fun. When a jerk thought it was funny to make fun of my mom's failing health and the heart attack she had suffered, I was ready to explode. I couldn't believe that the person could be such an ass. But it did solidfy my resolve to accomplish the things for her that I wanted. <br><br>Just go out and have fun bud.

How much do gay people care about those friends? <br><br>The ones I know have all answered with,<br>&quot;I love them&quot;<br>&quot;I care for them&quot;<br>&quot;I adore them&quot;<br>&quot;I hate them and love them&quot;<br><br>The only difference between a gay/hetro relationship and a gay/gay relationship is the sex.<br><br>One has sex with the opposite gender and the other has sex with the same gender.<br><br>Other than that difference relationships are the same Gay to Gay or Hetro to Hetro.  THE SAME, that one expection noted.<br><br>So now it comes down to difficulty in that relationship.  FOR WHATEVER REASON a gay person has chosen that in order to have successful relationship, they must have sex with the same gender, and seek like minded people out.<br><br>Let me give you a sexual encounter and show you why its so easy.<br><br>For a woman/woman relationship a woman have sex with another woman is EASY because each ones body is similar, they know what they like and know where and what to do and when to do it, its EASY for same sex people to fullfill that part of a relationship.<br><br>However for Hetro sex its harder, men dont have woman sexual zones and vice versa.

Posted something similar here myself recently. As to why EQ is down the pan, with it's newer players, well. Simple really, look at the market VI has, EQ is no longer about RPG, or the people who play RPGs. EQ is aimed at whoever SoE/VI can get to pay a monthly subscription, hence EQ is given away on the cover of magazines, and sold in 2.99 bargain baskets. /shrug <br><br>Be safe, and try to have fun in the little pixel place.
