All that was meant to be was basically a hello with a joke. You wanna talk about lack of respect my friend. If there was anyone in our friendship that had a lack of respect, it was you. You have a problem with looking at people as your equals, you are always better then everyone, and that is the way you always treated me. Always with the bitching and complaining about who fucked you over this time. Man, what am i supposed to do about YOUR problems. I would log on and instantly have a barrage of tells from your direction how yer trying to get this char banned, or get this chars reputation ruined on the server. It was a little fun at the beginning, but in all seriousness, i got sick of it. And what did you do when one day i would log on and say, sorry man but I'm in a bad mood and really dont wanna bother with this stuff. You would lash out even more at me cause i didn't wanna listen to you.<br>
<br>
So who has the lack of respect now, and please don't go lying on yer posts. You state that it was you who stopped talking to me. Wrong again. YOU were one of the main reasons why i left MM server cause I just got sick of yer constant bitching. It was a hard decision to make yes, because I was guildless at the time, and you really were the only person that i knew, but i felt it was a decision that had to be made. Also I don't remember ever you calling me on to the arena, all i remember is you logging on, me saying hi because someone on the guild said that you were online, then me asking what level you are at now, and then i got 30 mins of tells from you about how you arn't gonna joing cats. Again, you took something totally out of context. Someone who i havn't seen online in ages logs on, and is on anon, I am gonna be curious about your level, just beacuse i WANT to know. I had zero intentions of trying to recruit you into cats, cause i know if i did you would totally flip out, and the tells would start coming in(which they did anyway) I remember being on a Tormax raid when you logged on that day, so if you indeed DID call me to arena, then most likely it was due to battle spam(rogues hit very fast) or the fact that i have an ability to just ignore your tells, even though i dont have you on ignore. Don't claim to be so tough because a level 60 rogue did not come to the arena to duel you, it's mainly because i could care less about you anymore, and coming to the arena to kill a level 54 or whatever you are cleric would be a waiste of my time, and not worth skipping out on a raid for.<br>
<br>
Also you mention, after all you did for me. What the hell are you talking about. With the exception of powerlevelling my druid for 30 mins in oasis(big fn deal) and helping me for 15 mins in East Karana on my epic(big fn deal) you did nothing for me, except making me yer personal person to bitch to about god knows what. After the year that I knew you, it should be you who should be thankful to me for putting up with your crap for all that time. I have had people who I barely even know help me out more then you have in your days. I am a self made player Balrak, and I have never asked for any handouts.<br>
<br>
Balrak, you seriously need to know how to be a friend. Friends speak on the same level, which you obviously don't. Friends treat each other with resepect, and you respect no one but #1. During that short time while you were still on MM it was a godsend to me, i did not have to listen to you. EQ got way more enjoyable, and one day while levelling Derfel in Oasis i met a little halfling druid named Torrin, Torrin is the best thing that has happened to me on EQ, if he ever left EQ, I garuntee you, i wouldn't be to far behind. because he makes this game FUN and he speaks to me and respects me at the same level which i respect him, when he did not pass his trial period into Cats, I was extremely close to /guildremoving myself.  Ask anyone in the guild how pissed I was. I chose to stay in the guild because i know one day I am going to be able to get him back into Cats. Would I, or did I ever back you up like that, hell no. When you left EQ(which I thought you did) I was glad. To this day Torrin is my best friend in EQ, and much of a better friend then you ever were, and ever will be, to anyone. I love when you tell me peoples names who you claim to be your friends(who I am not going to mention, because it is up to them to show there true colors) i will ask these people about you, and they feel the exact same way i do, we just can not stand your shit.<br>
<br>
Also in your post, you called me an ass kisser, PLEASE, that is the last thing I am, and ever will be, if you can back that up i would like to see it. I never kissed anyones ass to get into cats, and now that im in Cats I do not kiss any officers ass to get l33t shit, I win items by my ability to play my class well, and the time and effort that i devote to Cats raids. Ass kissers are the lowest form of life, and it is something that i NEVER will be. I joined cats because I was probly a week or so away from quitting EQ because as you know(I believe i told you this) I said Derfel is my LAST twink. I was level 60, had great gear for my current situation in EQ and Torrin left(for like 3 weeks) to play anarchy online, i was very very bored. Also if you were around for the last year, you would know that I have been in many guilds in my days, and met many different people. Do a /who all cats, i garuntee you I have been guilded with about 70% of them in one of my former guilds, whether it was Clan Skallagrim, Inferni Millites, or Ancient Realm, some people even going back all the way to House of Zen'Tar, I knew someone from everywhere. For bringing excitement back into EQ, and showing me how fun the level 60 life can be, I thank you Cats. Balrak please, i have not really had a conversation with you for a year, and you really have not been playing on Drinal for a year, so do not take shots at me or my guild without the proof to back it up. Going on a rampage about shit you can not back up is just pointless. <br>
<br>
As far as this thread goes I am going to state my claim here while i am writing this essay. As far as the Sleeper goes, I NEVER want to see the Sleeper awake on Drinal, for the reason that I respect other guilds efforts, and would love to see other guilds try for Sleeper keys, get Primal, and kill Ventani. It is better for a server as a whole to always leave 1 warder up. Sleepers is a challenge that is put in front of guilds, and if we wake the sleeper, then the challenge will no longer be there for other guilds, which does upset me.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>

What you and everyone else do not know is I've been around I just didn't tell you or anyone else. You all assumed I quit, I never said I left, I was out on another server actually. <br>
<br>
As to lack of respect, that's a two way street and your saying I was the reason you left MM, then take 50 bucks smack it down on the table and transfer again. Don't give me such a load of bs there. As I recall the last time we spoke you made mention to me of CiH and I said I would NOT join them and don't even ask me. I was clear and to the point. Then you developed a smart attitude and starting badmouthing me. Prior to that you had developed an ego as well and that's maybe why I did not speak to you. Usually when a person doesn't not associate with another it's for a good reason, did this perhaps not cross ones mind?<br>
<br>
I have found your humor to be of poor taste, senseless and uncalled for hence I have no longer have ties to you, nor would I want them. You no matter how you see it, you did not say it was a joke, in fact I know you know for a fact the only reason you say it was a joke now is to try and remove yourself from my badside, all you managed to do was dig deeper now. But then I have lightened up, you can act as you want, I don't really care, the fact I no longer associate with you should be your first clue I am not interested. Before running your mouth on here you had other options, you know what I am talking about and you also had in game tells, so this it was a joke thing I don't buy it, unlike some I am not gullible. What was my saying for sympathy? I'm a firm believer in tough love, you want my sympathy after walking over my feet look in the dictionary under the words jack and shit and that's where my sympathy lies.<br>
<br>
Domo, indeed you may just wonder where I am, what it is Balraks up to. Right now let me enlighten some people out there, Balraks in the process of helping out young members in a guild at the present. He's busy training them for later on, busy showing them how to run, coordinate, and communicate within a raiding environment. They're learning fast and they have a long way to go, as do I, but at the present that's my primary interest. Organization is the wealth and health of a guild, hence forth I set that as a primary focus, not lvling an alt character. Do what you enjoy, this is something I enjoy doing and will continue to do so.<br>
<br>
I think I said all I am going to say to you from here on out Sansum, you care to drag this on, be my guest. <br>

I do...yet then we had about 90 people request that Balrak name the guild, but he avoided those parts of the post on a constant basis and never did get around to naming it...Balrak you are a attention-deprived person who is trying to fit into somewhere where he cannot be...You lie, manipulate, and complete falsify information to make yourself look more impressive to others.

So yet again you have taken something totally out of context. I never said once that I wanted you in CiH. I would not wish your presence among my fellow guildmates. You always jump to conclusions. That night when you logged on and I sent you a tell this is how it went, and don't fn lie cause you know I am right<br>
<br>
Derfel tells Balrak,'what level are you now?'<br>
Balrak tells Derfel,'OH NO...I am not joining CiH'<br>
(after this you go on for 30 mins how your not joining CiH, and then lie about your level anyway)<br>
<br>
Honestly how hard is it to go<br>
Derfel tells Balrak,'what level are you now?'<br>
Balrak tells Derfel,'56'<br>
Derfel tells Balrak,'ah cool'<br>
See how EASY that was, and it saved you 30 mins of ranting a raving.<br>
<br>
That is ALL i asked, and i did not once ask you to join CiH, and you know it. So please, before you go on and write another one of you novels about how the world hates you, DO NOT write it without proof. I have extended the courtesy to you and everyone on this board by not bull shitting. It is obvious that you can not do the same.<br>

<br>
Brownie king does not spawn once sleeper is awaken thats just a myth. <br>
<br>
<br>
the True way to have the king of the lands &quot; brownie king&quot; rise back to his army &quot; brownie legion&quot; is done through a long hard quest that begins in the zone (surefall glade) by getting a bear in the cave behind the water falls to talk to you. <br>
<br>
Once the npc bear trusts you   he will give you a mini quest ( 45+ quest)  after you finish this simple quest  go back to the same bear and give him the quest item.<br>
<br>
He will  then basicly tell you  hes about 4000 years old and begin to tell you the First part of the Rise of the  &quot; brownie legion&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Before there was Humans/trolls/dark elfs/elfs  the land was overrun by the dragons  most of the region leaders are on the blood line of the DAR  (expample hara DAr , phara Dar , etc.)<br>
<br>
The Dar clan  was said to be almost along the same blood line of  Veeshan and At the time the Leader of the dragons was Rehtom DAr , She was unlike any dragon of todays terms.<br>
<br>
Rehtom Dar's clans and dragons took over every single land mountain sea and forest, But  some races began to fight back ....<br>
<br>
Once the karanas use to be filled with thousands of trees for the aviaks but over time the dragons destroyed them all... the only place left was one last line of defense  the lands of the brownies of lesser fay. <br>
<br>
The brownie race and the aviaks built a gigantic army and took the fight to Rehtom Dar in the lands of Odus.  The war lasted 5 months the skys filled with dragons and aviaks and the land was a pure flowing brown  of thousands and thousands brownie warriors. <br>
<br>
AFter a long battle most of the Dar bloodline which was about 300 dragons was down to a simple  handful  and only Rehtom Dar was left on the battlefield. <br>
<br>
Hundreds of aviaks and brownies lost thier lives to the power of Rehtom Dar but in the end after a long brutal battle a simple  Brownie Farmer  got the slaying hit on Rehtom Dars Heart.  The land had peace  and the simple little brownie farmer was turned in to the <br>
<br>
    BROWNIE KING! <br>
<br>
 The brownie king swore that the lands would never be ruled by dragons again and so he made a force to forever protect the planet and called it &quot; brownie legion&quot; A royal army trained by the best to always stay in the shadows and under rocks or behind a tree waiting to rush out and stop  the clans of the dragons if they ever tried to take over the lands again.<br>
<br>
The bear npc then goes on to say that most of the dragon clans have all died out due to mass wars or other races killing them for treasure but he has heard  that the brownie king still sleeps underground in the forest of lesser fay Ready to awaken once the Dar clans of dragons become strong again. <br>
