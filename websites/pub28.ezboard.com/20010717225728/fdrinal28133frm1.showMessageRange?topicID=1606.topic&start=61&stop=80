<br>
Tat, you didn’t help anyone that day.  All you ended up doing was getting killed over and over.  I bust my ass doing CR and most of the times that I die nowadays is while helping out or keeping someone else alive, but Christ, even I asked you to knock it off.  I actually felt guilty because I had suggested trying to get to the corpses *if no mobs were up*.  Upper sebilis isn’t exactly fearplane or Veeshan’s Peak.  We had plenty of options available to get those corpses.  <br>
<br>
Let me put it this way…there’s a fine line between bravely sacrificing yourself to save others and foolishly pissing away your character’s life.  <br>
<br>
I was actually curious to see who you list, but all I see here is petty rambling to rival that of the rednecks back home.<br>
<br>
Keep this bullshit on the flame (children’s) board.<br>

Best SK out there woot! If I cared about dying I would certainly try not to die helping people who are clealy jerks like you guys. What you people don't seem to get is that some of us aren't fixated on getting those pixels. I stopped trying after level 51 because I didn't want it to become a career, experience moves too slow. I just played and tried to be helpful when I could (mistake was ever playing one night with you). The funny thing is if I were feeling less lazy right now I could go dig up your posting from this forum where you seemed to think (after the one night we grouped) that I &quot;might be a good enchanter&quot;.<br>
<br>
Someone in the group asked me to try mezzing so that the corpse could be obtained, I tried a couple of different approaches since a cleric was there.  Didn't bother me any -seems to bother you. Maybe you are the ignorant one for thinking my experience gain or loss in attempt to help people is a determinate of the quality of player I am. I say the guy who comes in here to flame a person for &quot;trying&quot; shouldn't apply for a management position any time soon.<br>
<br>
Nodda I used to think you were one of the brighter people in here but this has spiraled so out of control I am convinced that you too have the mentality of a gossiping 14 year old boy. <br>
<br>
I personally wouldn't compile a list of best players since I haven't played with all the people on the server. Let them win the BOTB that is probably a better determinate. <br>
<br>
If I were going to list my friends you can bet I wouldn't put one over the other and try to categorize them as better than one another. I never viewed eq as an individual competition - it was more of a congregation. <br>
<br>
If I wanted competition I'd go play Age of Empires instead -where I can build and out-strategize my enemies in a few hours and in a number of ways, quick thinking, with more complexity and with random variables rather than play a static game for 2 years where all variables are already known off the web *yawn*. No one would have to put in the web board if I were the best - my stats would show it.<br>
<br>
You could brag all day -about yourself - your guild - your friends but that is what it is self, guild, friends. Others have done &quot;it&quot; first - whatever it may be - your button mushing could be slightly more perfect depending on how much coffee you had and if you are paying attention at the 9th hour on. <br>
<br>
I could be the brightest, nicest, compassionate, quick thinking person on earth and if I started as a level one on this server today not knowing anyone in real life or encountering anyone to powerlevel me it may take me 6 months to a year to get to 50. Then it is all about who I meet along the way (usually twinks who aren't real interested in the low levels any more) and how which determines the guild I will ultimately wind up in. I might by some probability factor wind up in CiH, TK Kings Court etc. but it will be heavily weighted on a lot of variables, eg. whether they are accepting applications from my 'class' of char and who I met along the way. This doesn't make anyone better competetively, more skilled, an ultimate player, it means you at the top ranks by default win without any stroke.<br>
<br>
Then 2 years later you can sit here in this forum and pat each other on the butt and say how great you are to massage your own ego's ROTFLMAO@you! I sat on my ass 2 years longer than you did from beta 1 nanny nanny boo boo I rock! you suck LOL! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/22/01 9:16:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqalarrubican.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qalar Rubican</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/22/01 12:51:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> You must worked for VI if you were in beta 1.

Tat I'm not the best...far from it.   Neither am I an ignorant 14 year old.  I make mistakes, but I learn from them, and I rarely make the same mistake twice.   This isn't ego, I have no ego to massage.  This is simply what I do.  I don't deny you were a decent enchanter, but you're a shitty cr'er.   And no, I don't regret grouping with you, even having to suffer to see you die multiple times due to my train.  Yes it bothers me, because it was my mistake that started it.   It bothers me that you continued to waste away your character when there were other, more efficient options available.  Why?  No, not because of some misconceived notion that exp bar = skill.  It was simply because it was a waste.  If you think this is wrong, and that you should keep trying something no matter how many times it fails, then I suggest you read about World War I.  <br>
<br>
Stop thinking up a flaming reply and think about what I say. <br>
<br>
Mashing buttons doesn't make a player 'good'   How you react to a situation does....the same as everything else in life.   Do you panic? Do you keep a cool head?  Do you plan meticulously in advance or do you set a goal and rely on snap decisions to obtain it?  Something in between?  If you fail, do you keep trying with the same plan, or do you look for other options?   Do you accept responsibility for your mistakes or do you blame others?  Does the judgement of others bother you or are you self-confident enough not to care?<br>
<br>
I never read any strategies off the web.  Everything I know is from hard-won lessons of the past.   New situations are dealt with from this past experience.  It is the same way in everquest also.   I don't need a tips and hints for this.<br>
<br>
People at the top of anything didn't get there with a pat on their back and a smile.  Do you not realize this?  They busted their asses to get to the top.  They got out what they put in, what is wrong with this?  Yes, you could get into Cats in Hats or TK or the astronaut program or the white house, but you'd have to bust your ass to do it.  We all did, The Kindred did, the astronauts did, the president did.  No one's going to pamper you.<br>
<br>
The people in Cats In Hats didn't get a free ride to get where they are.  At some point in their past they busted their ass to be the best they could be.  Why should anyone who joins now be any different?   Would you expect to go from mailroom boy to Executive Officer just because all the top brass are already there?   Say but this is just a game, and I'll say you insult everyone on earth who plays as hard as they work.   Talk to Michael Jordan.  You know what he did?  He busted his ass to be the best he could be.   Do you now insist to be on the Chicago Bulls?<br>
<br>
There's some great players listed in this thread, who have put a lot of time and effort into being the best they can be, and are being given recognition for their efforts by their peers.  Why belittle their accomplishments?  You would not like this done to you.  Do not do it to them.<br>
<br>
If you see my posts as a flame, then don't open the newspaper, because anything you read must be an insult.<br>

I LOL every time I see the statement &quot;have been here since Beta blah blah&quot;. I have an enormous amount of technical knowledge and a great deal of skill in some technologies and know enough about others to be dangerous. Game development isn't in my portfolio nor will it ever be. <br>
<br>
I would definately not equate getting in to an older guild as rocket science - more like political science. I prefer to keep my beauracracy and heavy dutypolitics isolated to my profession only and experience &quot;freedom&quot; when I am at home. That isn't work nor does it present skill. <br>
<br>
If playing eq gets individuals in panic mode they should head out for some real challenge and strategy then come back. Sorry I don't mean to insult but EQ is very slow moving even in it's most dangerous situations. It gives ample time for planning before presenting yourself with any scenario unlike multiplayer games where your opponents are other human beings who are making decisions real time.<br>
<br>
I take 100% accountability for my actions - to the degree that I actually forgot about that CR and didn't even care about it. It wasn't a significant event for me - only for you guys apparently. Actually it was only brought up because Qalar was searching within himself very hard for an insult about me to justify supporting his friends flaming in here. It just wasn't a significant event. <br>
<br>
You guys fail at trying things all the time - every one does - the posting about the situation was just defensive posturing for supporting the little rumour mill that began day 1 that Dogguk's forum posting went in here. I was surprised Nodda of all people was  sucked in to the little point fingers stance, but oh well, I didn't know you well enough and apparently had a grave a mis-perception about you.<br>
<br>
It seems to be difficult for some to grasp that one can try &quot;three&quot; different ways to pass frogs all within the enchanter spell set. We are armed with a lot of spells. I won't detail it too much because you guys are just exhausting me trying to make a case for your accusation over a very insignificant event.<br>
<br>
You heard my dialogues with the cleric if you had alternate solutions you should have proposed one, otherwise I had no problem trying 3 different ways to retrieve a corpse. It doesn't make me a bad enchanter nor a bad CR'er it means there were three different approaches I tried and all failed. The first being mez, second being area mez, third being root.<br>
<br>
I didn't think about it as though I were running in to the same wall 3 times I thought about it as trying 3 approaches (you exaggerate with your six comment to glamourize your case and you don't take accountability for that which isn't my problem). Thank you tatianae for trying to help us now have a nice day.....not &quot;enter public forum and tell Tatianae she is a dumbass&quot; (but then that seems to be a cultural fit for your little clique - and yes I refer to clique in fond rememberance of junior high school 16 years ago)<br>
<br>
The really amazing thing though is that I am explaining this at all.<br>
<br>
Tatianae can you please justify why you chose this name<br>
Tatianae can you please justify why you were walking through east commons at 9pm on Friday night<br>
Tatianae can you please justify why you decided to use root instead of mez on the night of December 12, 1999.<br>
Tatianae can you please explain why on June 2, 1999 when someone casted clarity on you (an enchanter) you didn't know what it was.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nodda, can you please justify why you made the pull<br>
Nodda, can you please justify why you wear a bucket<br>
Nodda, can you please justify why it is you tried to darkness a mob which had high mr. on the date of December 3, 2000. (Silly guy tried to cast it 3 times thinking it might stick the next time around what a fool he suxor!!)<br>
<br>
You know I don't need to justify every action of my characters career for 2 years. The topic is only up for discussion because I challenged Qalar to find the very reason why he resented me. I challenged Jorply. I pointed out Jorply and I had an incident he apparently didn't remember about the ancient cyclopse in sro. Does it mean when I saw him a year later I gave a crap? No because I knew a year later that he had grown moved on in the game and it just wasn't relevent (which is why posting about such events and fighting about it in the forum is stupid in the first place).<br>
<br>
EQ just isn't about skill. Sure there are good players and some who might drink on a Friday night before they log on who may not play so well etc. But for the most part there is usually a strength in one person which is a weakness for the other and vice versa. It is called Diversity. One person may be planful, strategic, insightful, another one great on the fly, another one generally diplomatic helpful and kind. There are a lot of areas in this game in which to excel but I wouldn't compare it to the competetiveness of football, work, a real time strategy game, etc. EQ just doesn't equate.<br>
<br>
I do and continue to take the posting as an attempt to insult. I am just as sick of you guys as you are me....trust me!<br>

<br>
Does the lenght of time you've played the game have any bearing on how skilled you are at it? I've know 2 poeple from beta 2 (not that anyone should give a shit) that I have played with since my first day of EQ. One of them should not even try to play the game. He sucks, I've told him he sucks, and he knows he sucks. He just really likes to play and I like to group with him because he's funny, even though he gets me killed a lot. The other person is AWESOME at her class. They've both been playing the same amount of time. It has nothing to do with how good you are. Some people just have a knack for it, some people have to work for it, and some people just don't get it and never will. But the funny thing is, none of that really matters. I don't care how long you've been playing unless you post under a &quot;How Long Have You Played?&quot; topic. I don't care how good you think you are unless you post under a &quot;How Good Do You Think You Are?&quot; topic. All I care about at this moment in time is who you think is the best player at their class. Hell, the question was not even who IS the best player. The question was who do you THINK is the best player. If you've got something to say OTHER than the answer to that question, make a new topic or something.<br>

and, to add to my previous post, IMO, Jarls was a damn good paladin, and not having grouped with very many, wins my vote for best paladin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulukasz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lukasz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/23/01 5:25:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, EQ takes no actual skill.  <br>
