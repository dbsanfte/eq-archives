That's great!  You know what?  No one here fucking cares about you.  I personally, don't care about who you are, what you do, your opinion, or the fact that you only have 36 useable chromosomes.<br>

I think that if you were ever to shrivel up and fall off the earth like a rotten fruit that falls from a tree, no one would miss you.<br>

You are a quintesential pud mangler who really needs a refill on his prozac prescription.  Next time you feel that we would all be better off hearing what your little monkey brain has to say, do us all a favor and shove your head way up your ass.  That way all we have to hear is the muffled sound of whatever bullshit your trying to sell us.<br>

Head back to the monkey's ass, nothing here for you to see ass monkey.<br>

<br>
I know this to be fact because my girlfriend is finishing up her last semester of college, and was not eligible for more than $1,800 this semester because that would put her over the $24k cap.  Her parents still claim her as a dependent, and her father makes enough money so that pretty much every other student loan option is NOT an option to her. Unfortunately, he doesnt make enough money so that he could help her come up with the difference this semester.<br>

I could not qualify for any college loans or grants because I was majority and my parents made too much money. I feel that everyone should have an opportunity to get a higher education wealthy or not and appreciate the agencies that help less fortunate but the same services should be made available to everyone regardless of what their parents make. I myself went to 1.5 years of college and dropped out. Personally I think college is overrated,  depending of course on what you want to do in life but that is neither here nor there....either way the system is flawed.<br>

<br>
However it does not matter if your dad is Donald Trump and claims you.<br>
<br>
You can still qualify for the same exact amount of loans, just not at the same interest rate or lack of any interest.<br>
<br>
The only difference is the government will offer poorer families Subsidized loans while the richer families get Unsubsidized.<br>
<br>
Only difference is the govt pays the interest to the lender on the Sub. ones while attending school.<br>
<br>
Grants, your right, an entirely different matter that only people with very low incomes get any type of need based free money.<br>
<br>
However if you were a decent student in High School, most school will offer you some type of merit based scholarship not dependant on need. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
My parents were middle income.<br>
<br>
I did average in High School, didn't listen to anyone, thought I knew it all.<br>
<br>
I applied to a school that was $22m (m=Roman Numeral for thousand), got in, had to bust my ass to cover what little financial aid I got.<br>
<br>
I didn't get as much as I wanted the first year, and the explanation was that there were folks who 'deserved it' more than I did.  I didn't piss and moan and complain that I didn't get what I deserved because I was white, or because my parents worked hard for what they have, and I couldn't cash in on their success.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I busted ass and got more scholarships.  I found more work.  I did better in school so that academic grants became available.  <br>
<br>
I took the responsibility for myself and did not seek to blame others for my position.<br>
<br>
Don't piss and moan about the &quot;system&quot; and how unfair it is because Chuck got a free ride because he wasn't white and you are.  Get your fucking act together and make that shit happen.  No one is gonna hand you the golden fucking parachute to bail your ass out.<br>
<br>
College is overrated?!?  Let's see you get a job that will pay you enough to support a family without one.  Sure you have examples of those who do, but for each example you show me of one who does good without a degree, I'll show you a hundred that haven't.<br>
<br>
If you say you couldn't get any loans, then you didn't look hard enough.  If you can't get a scholarship, it's because when all of the people who told you to pay attention and study hard, you were too busy playing EQ to care what they had to say.  <br>
<br>
The only person you should be bitching at is yourself.  You let yourself down, no one else.  Get your fucking act together, stop looking for a hand out for something that you should earn.<br>

<br>
Wow, Sorb, you managed to say a whole lot of nothing and look like a moron.  You contributed nothing to the actual argument, and I would really recommend switching to decaf.<br>
<br>
My flame was directed at the system and those who use it to get places at others' expense.  I don't know everything about everything, but I know that I applied for loans after seeking out help from a college financial advisor.  I took every bit of advice given to me by the &quot;professional&quot; that was there to help me, and I nearly drowned in payments halfway through my Junior year.<br>
<br>
Kbern, I do appreciate your input on this topic.  It's still frustrating to the person who doesn't get all the benefits of it, but that's just me complaining.  My real anger stems from the fact that I worked like crazy to make it happen, and came up short, while I watched others cruise by, not hardly caring, worrying only about beer/drug/parties/sex/etc...<br>
<br>
I apologize for the slams aimed at Kbern, and I hope to eventually find a financial advisor with his common sense, so that maybe my kid can finish school someday when it costs even more.<br>

To the random people who stop in on these boards and don't even post an opinion on the subject at hand, but rather, pick a side and just start yelling profanity... get a life.<br>

Yes college is overrated. Ask any successful businessman and they will tell you the same. <br>
<br>
No one is looking for a handout, its about equal opportunity...the same rights you have when looking for a job. If I feel the system is flawed, I have every right to voice my opinion on it. Even someone who works in the system admitted the system was flawed.<br>
<br>
Oh and I didn't really need to bitch at myself for not getting a handout or failing because I own 2 businesses, a home and have a beautiful wife and 2 kids.<br>
<br>
As far as your calculations are concerned, there are way more than 1% without a degree or college diploma that have the same things you do and are the backbone of this country.<br>

I've put myself through 2 years college, and saved enough money to pay off a car, a greedy ex-fiancee who ran up 4k in credit cards, and will have enough for my masters degree. I also save enough for a trip to Europe every year.<br>
<br>
While I may have to take out loans for my masters I'm not concerned. If nothing else I will work in a real job for one year return for my masters.<br>
<br>
For your flame at the lower income bracket, I've no pity for the people who say they can't do X because they lack $.<br>
<br>
So what if you can't go to Stanford, Oxford, Ivy league colleges big whoop.<br>
<br>
America's greatest money makers, greatest inventor's all lacked a college diploma. <br>
<br>
Everything I've done, I've worked for, paid for myself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showUserPublicProfile?gid=molgar8>Molgar8</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/28/02 10:19:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1563.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: man..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Unless you're going for a technical position I don't see the need for college.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, sorry, you're wrong.<br>
<br>
The stories you hear of people becoming CEO's and never attending college is because that person was in the right place at the right time, they had connections, or were incredibly brilliant and thought college was a waste of time.<br>

I don't know the figures but alot more people are &quot;successful&quot; and don't have degrees than you may think. My definition of successful may differ from yours tho...that is a whole new can of worms. The point being is you don't need a degree to be successful or fulfill your goals and dreams unless it's a job that actually requires a degree ie: Physicians/Nurses, Teachers, Attorneys all of which makes up a small amount of the work force.<br>

Huh, let's see.  After my post, you did a 180 and took back your rant on KBern, we rooted out that your only complaint is that you have to work hard while others don't (you are lazy and expect things to be handed to you), we also found out that you're in a pissy mood.  Maybe you got too much sand in your vagina?<br>
<br>
I'd say that's pretty good for being a moron.<br>
<br>
I agree that in the past, no degree was not a preclusion from success.  But this no longer true, and this mindset will doom you to a life of servitude to another master.<br>
<br>
I am glad that you have 2 businesses and all that stuff.  But answer me this, if you could take a class to teach you how to save an additional 10% on your pre-tax earnings by learning how to categorize your G&amp;A expenses properly, would you do it?  Or would you rather go thru life not knowing what others before you have learned, and suffer the same mistakes that they made?  <br>
<br>
I know that you would invest in four hours a week to learn how to save you countless hours of aggrivation.  And you say college is irrelevent??  If you could go to someplace for four years, and learn what it took someone a lifetime to learn, isn't that a good investment??  How is that irrelevent??<br>
<br>
And that doctor you go to see, would you like him if you knew he didn't have a degree?  Would you let him operate on you?  What about the architect who built the school your kids go to?  Would you feel comfortable about sending them off if you knew that he didn't have many years of schooling to teach him how to design safe structures?  <br>
<br>
That car you drive?  Ford may not have had a college degree, but the fact that you can go over 20 mph is because someone with a college degree found a better way to do it. The computer you use everyday?  May not have been invented by a guy with a college degree, but I know for a fact that the applications that you run right now wouldn't be a possibility with out those folks who went to college to learn all that they could about programming.  The light bulb that lights your nights?  Edison may not have had a college degree, but the fact that you can have a bulb that uses 1/3 the power and generates 10x the candlepopwer, is due to those folks with degrees.  The TV you watch?  Maybe not invented by a guy with a degree, but the fact that you can watch it in color, is due to the guy who went to college and got his degree, the DVD you throw in when you are bored, the paper you write on, the pen you use, the clothes you wear, get the picture?<br>
<br>
Would you have any of this if people with degrees and college educations had decided that college is irrelevent? <br>
<br>
Any system that doesn't work to your own selfish needs is flawed according to you, because you don't benefit from it.  <br>
<br>
I agree what we have isn't the best, but it works to keep those who have from having too much, and those who don't have the opportunity to have more.  <br>
<br>
Does it suck that others get more for nothing while you gotta work hard for what you get?  Yup.  Is that ever going to change? Nope.  What are you gonna do about it?  Piss and moan? or get the fuck up off your ass and make your own way?<br>
<br>

Well its like this simp. Your either gonna pay at tax time or pay at revolution time. Our system exists as it does to keep those that don't have from taking through force everything you own. It is in our best interest as a nation to ensure our populace is educated well enough that the populace can earn a living wage and minimum wage isn't a living wage. <p>Proud member of White Wind<br>

Sorry pal, but I started typing my previous post before I even SAW the post of yours that wasn't just mindless profanity.  I pulled off of KBern because of what HE brought to the table - not you.
