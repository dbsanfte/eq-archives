Nothing better in all of Norrath for relieving a dust-parched throat after a long journey!  And indeed a long journey it has been!  For I have been journeying non-stop for almost a month!  From the land of the dragons on that accursed continent of Vellious, this inn where we meet is the first building of human (or even of your honorable kin the Teir`Dal) construction that I have seen since before Vellious was found...I dare say even before the mighty Trakanon was slain!”  He motions to a table near the fireplace, and offers a chair for you.  When he is assured that you are comfortable, he raises his hand and looks over to the bar. “BARKEEP! TWO BOWLS OF YOUR FINEST VENISON STEW!  AND TWO EMPTY GOBLETS, PLEASE!”  Nodda looks back at you and smiles, and takes a seat across from you.  He clasps his hands together and leans forward.<br>
<br>
“‘Twould be no trouble at all, milady, to attempt to enliven your evening with my humble tales of past deeds by men of recount.  Of whom would you like to hear?”  He pauses as the barmaid sets down two bowls of rich-smelling stew and two empty goblets.  He winks up at the barmaid and digs into his food.   After emptying the bowl in record time, and mopping it clean with a chunk of bread, he looks at you thoughtfully.  “Maybe the story of the mighty Trevellon Darkvon and his Crusades through the mountains of Rathe?   The journeys of Odumok the Wizard?  Or perhaps the dark adventures of one of the famous necromancers such as Sithcahsin or Arma?  Eh?  What is this? Ahh…my tale of Niltik’s recovery of my fellow Knight Sir Norsith of Freeport.  I fear, milady, that is a rather incomplete tale, one which I am currently working on, but have not the chance to complete yet.  But do not pout, milady.  Fortunately for you, I have had ample time to lay the story down in my head...if not to the very end, at least more of it!  Allow me a moment to collect my thoughts so that you may be the first to hear more of Sir Norsith’s deeds during Lord Sorith’s campaign...and from one who was actually there!”<br>
<br>
Nodda leans back with his goblet of elven wine (Thanks to the Lady Driin!), seemingly lost in thought as he stares into the fire.    <br>
<br>
        After stopping at the stream to wash and replenish their supply of water,  Norsith and Niltik decided it would be best to attempt to sneak their way through the high elf outpost in Firiona Vie to reach Lord Sorith’s encampment outside of Karnor’s Castle in the shortest possible time.  A’tlael, her services no longer needed, had declared that she would make her way back to the Teir`Dal outpost.  After obtaining her word that she would not repeat what she had heard at the entrance of the ancient city of Sebilis, Niltik thanked her and handed her the promised payment.  As it turned out, those two were the last to see her alive, for she never reached the Teir`Dal outpost.  A few months later, a captured goblin revealed that she had been waylaid in Warslilk Woods, which would explain the current Teir`Dal campaign against the goblins of Kunark.  Most people believe it was just bad luck, but I believe to this day that Niltik had arranged for her…demise…at the hands of the goblins to protect the information that he and Norsith were taking to Lord Sorith.  <br>
        You appear to be a  Teir`Dal of refinement, Lady Driin, and thus I will not distress you with a recount of how Norsith managed to get them out of Firiona Vie after being caught and taken before Governess Shanna.  (Nodda grins slyly here) Suffice it to say that the governess had a certain…weakness for human men, and was forced to remove herself from the political arena soon after it became apparent as to the means of Norsith’s escape.<br>
        Shortly thereafter, Niltik and Norsith found themselves wandering across that barren waste in which the Castle of Karnor is located.  Niltik had heard the story of how this once lush plain had become a wasteland, but he only half believed it.  True, there had been magic involved, but the magic of one wizard?  Highly unlikely.  True again, wizards were powerful people indeed, and well-educated, too.  Many a lord or king ruled partly because of a highly skilled wizard to aid him (wizards of the Guild of the Arcane not being allowed to hold political power themselves, as you well know), but none that Niltik knew of could even imagine wielding enough power to cause the utter desolation that he and the Knight were traveling across now.  Shaking the thoughts from his head, Niltik checked his map again.<br>
        “We should be able to see Karnor’s Castle shortly.  From there we will turn southwest ” He glanced at the sun overhead.  “That will place us at Lord Sorith’s encampments an hour before nightfall.”<br>
        “Very good,” Norsith replied.  “Verily, I must admit that I wouldst not be wont to stumble blindly out here after dark, which I surely would if not for thou and thy ability to follow a map.”<br>
        Niltik nodded and put the map away.  He had always been good at reading maps.  He had to be, in his profession.  Norsith looked down at Niltik, his cold brown eyes peering at him from the shadows of his helmet.  “Tell me, what news hast thou of the negotiations between Sorith and that fool who claims to rule this land?”<br>
        “There’s not much to the negotiations, really.  They both know that Sorith’s army could easily wipe out Sethir and his legions.  However, the orders from Neriak are to treat the Drolvargs as allies until Trakanon is dealt with.”<br>
        “Thou sayeth nothing I did not already know, knave.  What of events since my recent excursion?”<br>
        “I was getting to that.  It seems that the Teir`Dals had finally been told by Lord Nagafen that he and the rest of the dragon world cared not what happened to Trakanon.  It seems that Trakanon is an outcast of sorts.  Why this is, only the dragons know.”  Niltik paused as a snake slithered out from under a rock and across his path.  <br>
        “Verily,” Norsith replied as the snake stopped in front of him to taste the air with its tongue.  Without missing a step, Norsith ground the snake’s head into the dirt under his boot.  “I have seen for myself this loathsome beast, and a foul creature he is.  Rotted flesh hangs from his limbs and body, with a stench to wake the dead, so sunk is he in the embrace of necrosis.   Ambassador Nagafen said the dragons wouldst not retaliate?”<br>
        “Aye”<br>
        “Perhaps Trakanon’s experiments in necromancy is the reason, although who can know how the children of that accursed Velious reason.”<br>
        “Aye”<br>
        They walked on in silence until the mighty ruins of Karnor’s Castle came into view, guarded as it always was by two Drolvergs at the entrance.  Norsith had noticed that they hadn’t seen any Drolverg patrols as they walked here from Firiona Vie, and mentioned it to Niltik.  It was very unusual, since Venril loathed the high elves and vice versa, and there were frequent raids on Firiona Vie by Drolvergs and into Sethir’s holdings by high elves, and the borders were usually heavily patrolled.  The invasion and establishment of the colony at Firiona Vie had been foolish indeed, even for high elves, and resulted in the alliance between the Teir`Dal outpost and Sethir.  Thus, high elf expansion was checked, while Neriak made plans for colonization and eventual control of Kunark.  <br>
        Niltik and Norsith paused for a quick meal outside of Karnor, then headed southwest towards Sorith’s encampments.  They talked politics for a while, as most travelers do, and talked especially of Neriak’s plans for Kunark.  The Teir`Dal had established their outpost shortly after the lost continent had been discovered, and the first race they had encountered had been the Drolvergs.  Shortly after, the high elves had landed at Firiona Vie, which was a harbor used by the Drolvergs at the time.  Deciding to establish a colony there, the high elves and Drolvergs soon began fighting.  When the high elves landed reinforcements there to invade Karnor’s Castle, Lord Sethir asked the Teir`Dal for help.  After a brief but fierce battle north of Karnor, the high elves were repulsed, and retreated back to Firiona Vie.  There they stay to this day, the only high elves seen outside of their colony being raiders and the occasional adventurer or explorer.<br>
        Neriak had soon discovered that there were three major powers on Kunark.  Venril Sethir, Trakanon, and the Iksar.  The Teir`Dal ambassador in Karnor was given instructions to convince Sethir to allow the Teir`Dal to defeat Trakanon while Lord Sorith, one of Neriak`s more able generals, was given an army and sent to Kunark.  Sethir flat-out refused at first, allied as he was with Trakanon and fearing repercussions should the Teir`Dal lose, but another appointment with Ambassador Tal`Lin had convinced him to consider it at the least, and Sethir continued to delay his decision until the morning he awoke and could see Lord Sorith’s army encamped south of Karnor’s Castle.  When he demanded an explanation from Tal`Lin, he was told that the army was there ‘to take care of Trakanon, if you give your blessing.  Other nuisances if you decide not to.’  The thinly veiled threat was not lost on Sethir, and he gave his blessing, deciding he would claim ignorance of the campaign when the Teir`Dal were defeated, or at most severely weakened, by Trakanon.  <br>
        Meanwhile, the Teir`Dal outpost had been attacked by Trakanon himself as a warning to Neriak not to interfere in his plans for Kunark.  After the fires had been put out and the dead buried, the Teir`Dal there had begun looking for the dragon themselves independent of Neriak’s plans.  The Council back at Neriak did not approve of this act, deciding if they could do this by themselves, the colonists might think they no longer needed Neriak’s rule.  They did not want a repeat of the debacle in Mistmoore from a hundred years ago, and so they took secret measures to delay the outpost’s attempt to find the location of Trakanon’s lair, which still remained a secret known only to Trakanon and his guards.<br>
        Unknown to the Drolvergs and the Teir`Dal at the outpost alike, another army was waiting at the ancient wizard gate in Nektulos Forest, ready to gate in and march on Karnor’s Castle as soon as Sorith and Sethir (who had gathered his Drolverg legions to accompany the Teir`Dal) discovered the resting place of Trakanon and left to do battle.  The plan was to take care of two threats at once;  Karnor’s would be lightly defended with most of Sethir’s army gone with Sorith, and news of the defeat would not reach Sethir until after Trakanon was defeated, at which time the second army, led by Lord A`Lin would follow after them and defeat the remainder of Sethir’s forces along with Sorith’s army.<br>
        <br>
        Nodda leans back in his chair. ‘Forgive me for the ramblings on the recent history of Kunark, milady, as you no doubt already know of it.  I am merely fixing it in my head for when I humbly attempt to commit the story to paper when I have returned to Freeport.  Pay close attention!  The story takes an exciting turn of events, for Norsith and Niltik are soon to reach the camp of Lord Sorith, with the politics that no doubt result of which you, as a fine lady of proper Teir`Dal heritage, will surely find interesting.  I can count on one hand the people who know truly what transpired at the meeting of Norsith and Sorith.’ Nodda leans forward and grins. ‘Fortunately for you, milady, I was there!’<br>

Shortly after Sethir’s army came into view (and Sorith’s army beyond), the two were halted by Drolverg guards and asked their business.  Niltik sensed Norsith’s temper begin to flare, for rare is the man who asks a Knight of Innoruuk his business with such impertinence.  Before Norsith could open his mouth to speak, Niltik hastily told them that he, along with the Knight, had urgent business with Lord Sorith.  Niltik revealed the letter signed by Sorith allowing him free passage during his mission as an agent of Neriak.  The letter was handed to one of the three Drolvergs (which Niltik decided was the ranking officer of this patrol), who appeared to read over it carefully.  The Drolverg, with letter in hand, escorted Niltik and Norsith to Sethir’s encampment until an escort from Sorith’s army was fetched and brought back to authenticate the letter.<br>
        And this is the point, Milady Driin, where I come into the story!  Having been in the area after finishing up some personal business, I had heard of the gathering of Sorith’s army, and had proceeded to his encampment as an observer for the Freeport guild of the Knights of Innoruuk.  As you know, this sort of observation by representatives of other orders of the Knights of Innoruuk is encouraged by the Clerics of Innoruuk themselves, which most believe is to retain unity and cooperation among the wide-spread followers of Innoruuk.  *Nodda leans forward and lowers his voice*  However, I believe it’s to keep an eye on each other to ensure that no one faction grows too powerful without the rest knowing of it. *Nodda leans back again and smiles*<br>
        In any case, I soon found myself in the company of Lord Sorith, discussing with him the upcoming campaign against Trakanon and the plans for Venril Sethir which would soon follow.  I listened in awe as Sorith described the bold double attack which would be crucial to Teir`Dal victory in Kunark.  Sorith explained to me that A`Lin’s army, awaiting orders at the wizard gate in Nektulos, would be an occupational one after Sethir was defeated, ensuring the loyalty of the outpost and also the absorption of the Drolvargs into the Teir`Dal fold, to take their place alongside the Trolls and Ogres.  Sorith would then be free to campaign against the Iksar.  <br>
        It was at this point where I learned of Niltik’s bold journey with At`lael to recover my fellow Knight  I must say that I was surprised when I first heard that Norsith had been defeated in battle, and mourned his loss as a fellow Knight, guildmate, and friend.  As you know, his reputation is such that most believe he will be one of the few Knights of Innoruuk to die of old age, although many more wish it were not so.   Sorith explained that he had learned of Norsith discovering the location of Trakanon’s lair, but had taken the information to his grave.  Therefore, he had called upon Niltik to find the location of Norsith and have him resurrected and brought back to Sorith.  The conversation had drawn to a halt soon after he invited me to join them when Norsith arrived, and I had taken my leave.<br>
        That had happened a week earlier, and I found myself practicing swordplay with some Teir`Dal brethren when word arrived that Niltik and Norsith had returned.  Excusing myself from the roped-off practice area, I donned my shirt and went over to where Sorith talked with the Drolverg who had come to give the news.  Overhearing the conversation, I quickly volunteered my services when it became apparent that the Drolvergs required an escort from the Teir`Dal to confirm the claims of the two travelers they had stopped.  After all, I had known Norsith since before even the campaign against Guk so long ago, and Sorith nodded his agreement.  Two other Teir`Dal Knights as escorts and a wizard to confirm the letter were to accompany me, and we followed the Drolverg back to Sethir’s encampment.<br>
        The walk was a short one, and we soon approached the tent which the Drolverg pointed out, saying that the two were inside.  Two Drolvergs guarded the tent, and I asked my fellow Knights to wait outside to keep an eye on things while the wizard, a fellow by the name of Drathmir, and I went inside to confirm Norsith and Niltik’s identity.<br>
        The two were carrying on a conversation about the inns of the Oasis of Ro when I began to enter, but they quickly fell silent as I went inside, followed by Drathmir.  It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness inside, and when they did, they fell upon my brethren Knight.<br>
        “Innoruuk protects,” I said when I recognized Norsith.  <br>
        “Innoruuk protects,” he replied.  “Truly I sayeth, I am not surprised to meet thou under such unusual circumstances, Sir Nodda, judging from past experience, although I didst not knowest thou to be in the area.”  Norsith turned to watch Niltik hand the letter to Drathmir.<br>
        I grinned at this.  “Aye, Sir Norsith.  Personal business brought me to this land, and when I heard of Sorith’s army forming up here, I came to observe.  He needed someone to come out to confirm your identity, so I volunteered.  It’s good to see you alive and well after all these years.”<br>
        “The same,” replied Norsith as he turned back to me.  “I wouldst like to question you of news from home when we have the chance.”<br>
        “Of course.”  I turned to Niltik, who had handed Sorith’s letter to Drathmir for confirmation.  “Greetings, Niltik.  Your reputation precedes you.  The tale of your adventure into Lady Vox’s lair is a favorite at many inns.”<br>
        Niltik grinned. “Thanks.  Trust me, I wouldn’t recommend visiting Vox unless she invites you.”<br>
        Drathmir left the tent to inform the Drolvergs that the two travelers were indeed who they claimed to be, and the three of us inside talked for the several minutes that he was gone.  It was during this time that Niltik related his tale of recovering Norsith, for which I am eternally grateful of having the chance to hear and record for the audience at large.  Drathmir returned, however, and as the sun disappeared over the horizon, we found ourselves entering Sorith’s camp.<br>
        We were met by two of Sorith’s personal guard, Teir`Dal Knights of Innoruuk who had been with the General since before he had attained his rank.  They were fiercely loyal to the General, and tales of their deeds were used to frighten children in the elven cities of Faydwer.  After a brief exchange of introductions, Norsith, Niltik, Drathmir and I were ushered into Sorith’s headquarters, a fair-sized tent which seemed smaller on the inside due to the large table in the center covered with a map of Kunark.  A small fire in one corner and several lanterns would have given the tent a certain coziness, if one forgot that a war was being planned here.  I was slightly surprised to see A`Lin deep in discussion with Sorith as they leaned over the map, which had tiny blocks on it that represented the armies in Kunark.  A necromancer, which I knew to be one of Sorith’s advisors, took notes at a small table near the fire.  A wizard sat at a similar table with a lantern on it, also taking notes.  I assumed this was the wizard who had brought A`Lin here.  Two other Teir`Dal stood over the table.  One I recognized as D`Astori, a Knight of Innoruuk and Sorith’s second in command.  The other I assumed to be A`Lin’s second, although I had never seen him before.  Two others sat in a corner, conversing with each other and taking notes.  These were observers like me.  One was a necromancer from Paineel who had arrived two days ago, and the other was a cleric I knew from Freeport.  They looked up as we entered, and I returned the nods of greeting that they gave me.<br>
        Sorith was speaking as we entered. “…should be here, within a day’s march if I require assistance.” Sorith looked up at A`Lin and grinned. “Once that happens, the only fighting going on will be in tournaments at next year’s harvest.”<br>
        A`Lin chuckled. “Aye, and our only danger will be in cramps from filling out forms for shipments of seeds!”<br>
        Sorith laughed, and raised his goblet of wine in a toast with A`Lin.  Sorith emptied his cup and looked over at us as one of our escorts cleared his throat.  “Sir Norsith, Milord,” the guard stated simply, and Sorith’s gaze turned to Norsith.<br>
        Norsith bowed his head, “Innoruuk protects.”<br>
        “Innoruuk protects, indeed, Sir Knight.” Sorith set down his cup and leaned against the table. “Welcome back to the world of the living.  I trust you have been told of that which I seek?”  Norsith dipped his head in affirmation.  “Very good.”  Sorith looked at Niltik. “Good work, Sir Rogue.  You will be paid as had been arranged.  However, I cannot permit you to leave until after the campaign is completed.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance, and I trust you will understand.”<br>
        “Aye milord.” Niltik bowed, “I am at your service, as always.”  If he was displeased at the prospect, it did not register outwardly.  I sincerely doubted that it would have registered if he had been told his mother was a dwarf.<br>
        “Very good,” Sorith replied.  “We have much to discuss.  Make yourselves comfortable.”<br>
        As Sorith ordered goblets and wine for us, I pulled up a chair with my fellow observers and beckoned Niltik over.  There, we caught up with the news of the day, which included the latest contingent of Teir`Dal clerics, all of which were females who, as I found out later, were most experienced in the arts of massag… but I see that Milady Driin would rather hear more of the conversation which occurred at the main table.  Very well. *Nodda pauses to fill the now empty goblets*<br>
        Lord Sorith beckoned Sir Norsith to the table and made introductions.  I overheard that A`Lin’s second was named T`Val at this point, and recalled that name from among a raid which had nearly burned Felwithe to the ground some twenty-five years ago.  T`Val was older than he looked.<br>
        Sorith got down to business.  “Tell us what you know of Trakanon’s Lair.”<br>
        “The foul beast Trakanon resides deep in the ruins of Sebilis, Sir General.”  A`Lin raised an eyebrow at this, but Sorith merely nodded. “The ruins are well populated by his followers and guardians, even more so than Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox’s lairs combined.  The upper level is inhabited by frogloks, kin to those foul beasts which once occupied the dungeons of Guk.  Verily, I would not hath believed it unless I had seen it with mine own eyes.  They are much tougher than the frogloks of Guk, but nonetheless die just the same.  <br>
        “When first exploring Sebilis, I discovered an underwater tunnel which leads to the lower areas of that wretched hole.  Their dungeon is there, and below even that is a passageway which leads to an area inhabited by beasts similar to the fungi of Guk.  However, these are more dangerous than even the frogloks above.  They have a King, which doth pay fealty to Trakanon in exchange for inhabiting this area, which would be perfect for breeding their young.  Beyond these, I encountered the gates to Trakanon’s lair, guarded by beasts which remind me of the golems of the outpost.  Although not as large as the outpost guardians, they are just as dangerous.  <br>
        “I made my way deeper into Sebilis, by then having recognized the stench of a dragon.  Verily, it was combined with the smell of necrosis, and I hardened myself to it before pressing on.”  Sorith raised an eyebrow at this.  Rare an occurrence it was, when a Knight of Innoruuk had to harden himself to anything.  D`Astori filled his wine cup and took a sip as Norsith continued, talking as if he was describing a walk through the Commonlands, and not an exploration which had cost him his life.  <br>
        “I passed rooms of magi, who conducted experiments in magic which would entertain thine wizards in study.  Soon I reached Trakanon’s lair proper, and it echoed with the sounds of snores as he slumbered.  From a vantage point, I studied the routine of his lair for some hours, with the comings and goings of his guardians.<br>
        “Harken thee to mine words, Sir General, for the most dangerous creatures I have yet to see guard that foul beast while he rests.  The leader of his golems stands twice as tall as the dragon itself, and the air itself crackled a powerful froglok enchanter practiced his magic.  After satisfying myself with a count of a dozen golems who patrol the entrance to his lair and guard their king, the enchanter, and Trakanon himself, I moved so as to gaze upon the dragon myself.”<br>
        Norsith looked at Sorith’s advisor.  “He is a necromancer, sunk in the embrace of necrosis.”  The necromancer returned Norsith’s stare and pressed his lips.<br>
        Every necromancer who has ever lived runs the risk of succumbing to his art.  Once that begins to happen, a necromancer is bound by oath to take his own life.  It is simple to avoid, however, ever since necrosis was studied and first understood.  It gives a necromancer extreme power, but also gives him extreme pain and madness such that he cannot control it.  The conclusion reached was that one who suffers from necrosis is possessed by an evil darker and more primitive than that of Innoruuk, and thus it should be sought out and destroyed at all costs.  Only once in recent memory has a necromancer succumbed to his art.  Hoping to study the effects first-hand as long as he could, he sunk into necrosis, defeated the Neriak necromancers sent to destroy him, opened a rift to Innoruuk’s plane, and attempted to destroy Innoruuk himself.  Innoruuk was forced to deal with the necromancer personally, and sent Hate, his most powerful minion, to Norrath to guard the rift.  Thus is the reason why one dares not enter Kithicor Forest at night, when the rift is open. <br>
        Norsith continued his story.  “I was discovered there, and barely escaped by faking death.  Trakanon had me placed on his treasure horde for examination later, presuming I was dead, and there I lay for several hours.  Trakanon left his lair soon after, headed to the Teir`Dal outpost from what Niltik hath related to me.  I escaped using a gate potion that I always carry with me, and met back up with my party.  We reentered Sebilis to explore the upper areas, and it was then that we were discovered, overrun, and killed.”<br>
        Norsith fell silent and waited as Sorith digested this information, staring at the map on the table and tapping his empty goblet.  The only other sounds were those of the advisors, finishing up their notes on the account.  Finally Sorith seemed to reach a conclusion and looked up.  <br>
        “Sebilis is just two days march from here through Firiona Vie.  Neriak would not approve of that, as it is a colony of Felwithe.  That would mean war on the main continent.  However, there is a pass through Frontier Mountains which would allow us safely by Firiona Vie without detection under cover of night.  It will require an extra day and night, but it is better than the two week’s journey it would take to get there by way of Warslilk Woods.”  He turned to A`Lin.  “Sir General, have your army ready to gate to the Wizards Spire near here four days from now.  March straight to Karnor’s Castle and occupy it.  It is very important that no Drolvergs are allowed to send word to Lord Sethir.  Leave an occupational force there, and march without pause to the ruined Iksar city in Emerald Jungle.  I want you there seven days hence, by which time Trakanon will be dead.”<br>
        “Very good, Sir General.”<br>
        “I will send a messenger ahead when we leave Sebilis.  When he arrives at your encampment with word of Trakanon’s death, you will march without haste to here.”  Sorith picked up a block of wood and set it on the map.  “Cavern of No Hope.  Here we will defeat Sethir.  His army should be weakened sufficiently that it will be an easy victory.”<br>
        Sorith’s second looked up from the map.  “Word is that Sethir plans on us taking the brunt of the attack, Lord General.”<br>
        Sorith nodded. “Yes, I am aware.  I have an idea to prevent this which I will go over with as soon as the Dragoon Commanders are assembled here.” He looked at one of his Knights standing guard at the entrance.  “Sir Knight, inform the Commanders that I wish to meet with them within the hour.”<br>
        “Yes, Milord.”  The Knight left the tent.  <br>
