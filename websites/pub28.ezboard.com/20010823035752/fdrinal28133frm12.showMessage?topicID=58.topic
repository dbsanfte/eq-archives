So I told my group, fg r theirs, come out into this hall, away from, them.<br>
<br>
Now I am bggled how a 57 war, whatever lvl cler edgecrusher is, a monk named apoca...a rogue nameed synide, a shaman(Who is cool as heck) altec, you guys had more didnt you?,<br>
Die on tranix pull. <br>
<br>
Ubergroup_09 Owned. OK , myabe bad luck np, we help w cr.<br>
<br>
I asked sallace if they were doing fg, he said, &quot;we are only here to kill tranix and leave, the monk wants a crown.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boto told me, they are NOT staying to help with ragefire, only galana. <br>
<br>
Sallace asks me if I can get solo pulls at 60.<br>
<br>
Look, I can get solo at lvl 40. too often players rely on lvl 60 to bail em out. Whats that? cant pull? Get a lvl 60, smaller aggro. Whats that? cant do such and such? The answer MUST be we need some lvl 60 players.<br>
<br>
WRONG.<br>
<br>
I told sallace, gl with fg, if that monk wants a crown, he better freaking earn it, and pull tranix himself. <br>
<br>
Well, those 3 fg raped them, and only a feew left standing, sallace asks for help.<br>
<br>
I said no, u want tranix, you kill him. Im not here to help you, and as bad as it sounds, if that monk wants the crown, let him show he deserves it and pull tranix.<br>
<br>
Well, I had my group go help anyway, and they did cr. It had a torque. None in my group needed, so I told sallace, torque u guys loot. He tells me, its ours, all they came for was a crown.<br>
<br>
Roflmao. I hate this goto hate,, kill inny, leave half the plane spawned. Or goto fg, kill tranix and leave. <br>
<br>
Whatever. I ask sallace again, im told they JUST CAME FOR TRANIX are are leaving.<br>
<br>
Whatever, ragefire ppl start coming. Well all sudden you guys run up to the throne room. Guess you lied to me., or someone changed their mind.<br>
<br>
Apoc pulls skarlon room, and no one announces looot. Gee, it was a sword. I ask the warriors there if they need, leland and razorscale say sure. Some monk whose corpse was in the throne room, just got ressed, kneels on the loot, saying , &quot;Its for dimmes&quot;. Who all dimmes. There is one player in eq. Anon dimmes./w dimmes. There is one player in solb. Who the hell is dimmes? Some twink you had coming fro sword?<br>
<br>
Listen kid, I asked repeatedly, if you were there for fg. I said , if you want fg, theyre YOURS, we will just wait. But when you lie to me, and move on, and use us to bail your asses out because you cant pull, or handle the pulls, Im not there to kill so your guildtwinks can get loot.<br>
<br>
It wasnt me taking your skarlon sword. IF you guys wanted fg, you should say so. Not say no, we just came fro tranix, then have your monk pull trains, hoping we will bail you out, and then let you bring twinks up for loot. Wrong answer. So I askedsallace, please take your people and go.<br>

Our 57 warrior was afk, and sitting a little bit off the wall straight back from the stairs.  Apoca...lus did not realize our warrior was afk and not against the wall, so when he FD'ed the 4 giants went right for him.  Hence, 4 FG's including Tranix, and 5 peeps without crowd control = DED. <br>
As for the warrior asking you to pull...i have no idea.  As for us just killing Tranix and leaving, i was under the impression that we were gonna kill them all.  Until, i got a tell from another guildmate asking for help in Chardok, with his FA.  At that point, it became clear that helping with a guildmates FA, was more important then XP.<br>

My understanding was they were leaving.  The Skarlon pull was fought because my groups didnt even realize it wasnt pulled by us.  Regardless of who pulled it the bottom line is they couldnt handle doing FG's with the 5 they had, hard as that is to believe it was obvious. While organizing and forming groups which took way longer than 2 med cycles they did nothing and I didnt even realize they were still there.  Sorry guys but if you wanted to finish FG's all you had to do was say it when I asked and do it reasonably timely so we didnt have wait around.  And we woulda been happy to help, but I guess you wanted that sword for someone named Dimmes who wasnt there?  Might I ask in what way this person deserved the sword or why you wanted him to have it?  Just curious, regardless sorry for the miscommunication but I did try to figure out what you wanted.<br>

Like i said he FD'ed, in which i would only assume was to split the FG's (maybe i am just crazy).  Then they agroed on our A.F.K. warrior.  <br>

<br>
I told sallace, fg areyours if u want.<br>
<br>
IM told no, all we want is tranix.<br>
<br>
Ok then, so we will finish fg.<br>
<br>
Well It strikes me funny a monk would want the crown, so they come for tranix. Only he cant pull tranix with one or two, it becomes a 3 or 4 mob pull. Which is cool, if you can handle it. But if a MONK wants the crown, and he cant even pull a pull his group can handle, to me thats a joke.<br>
<br>
If i saw a crown, id give to my group as we got the kill, and we were asked for help.<br>
<br>
Its like hateplane. If the monk wants the sode/cloak, let him pull hate and earn it. I always say the same about pallies and their fa a bit ago. They want thee holy sword? the fiery avenger? Let the dragon raids be a test, and have them lead and show they deserve it.<br>
<br>
I wasnt making fun of anyone. But wheen 2 monks cant pull a tranix room  with ubergroup waiting, Im not gonna do it for you. If you need help, ask, but whewn u say &quot;wqe just want crown for monk&quot;, well that monk better get it himself. Or hee can buy mine for 1000000k, what u guys sell them tranq staves for?<br>
<br>
And ganghas holding skarlon loot for dimmes? who the hell is dimmes? They would died if we hadnt been there. We save em from tranix pull, so they can go up and kill skarlon, after telling us they werent gonna?<br>
<br>
LIe after lie after lie after lie. Whilee synide keeps handing me 17 sp to be a dork. So I said, please go. <br>
<br>
Why dont you go tank sumpin nodda, say sumpin stoopid like sks can tank. That I can laugh at.<br>

And unless you ARE relying on some sort of short aggro due to being level 60, most FG pulls aren't single to start out with, and you have to do something called &quot;Feign Death&quot; at which time you fall on the ground. The fire giants will then turn around and go back home, sometimes 1 at a time. At this point you pull the Fire Giants that are not home. <br>
<br>
Read the post, someone was afk and aggro'd the giants before Apocalus could split them. How does that say anything about whether or not Apocalus can pull? Contrary to what you think, you don't decide who deserves everything, and your opinion is not higher than anyone elses. Stop being so righteous and saying who deserves what and who doesn't. I'd like to see you kill 3 fire giants and tranix with 5 people and no crowd control at all.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uemrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>emrok</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://angelfire.lycos.com/images/animate/dogrun.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#939393>(1/12/01 9:41:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shol</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#939393>(1/25/01 11:45:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Lol the bole stated &quot;Ebay&quot; monk just won the botb!
