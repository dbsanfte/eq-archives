This littleblurb was sent to me by a friend this morning and I thought it to be interesting. I had never paid much attention to this , but I will start watching.<br>

<br>
Military courtesy change...........<br>
<br>
I picked up on something very funny this morning. CNN showed George  W. leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right face to stand facing GW's back...something that was missing in eight years of the Clinton presidency.<br>
<br>
 The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new president. That one goes back to the days in the rigging, when the marine orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of movement, to be ready to receive an order.<br>
 <br>
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone? ...And for eight years, they did.<br>
<br>
 This pleases me greatly, The subtlety of it is elegant in it's simplicity.<br>
<br>
Clinton never knew the difference, yet it occurred in front of the whole world. <br>
<br>
Here's to the Marine Corps<br>

Fact is, the Clinton administration engaged in more post war(WWII) military actions around the world than any other US administration before. It remains to be seen if a Bush administration will exceed them.<br>

Either way, war is a part of keeping capitalism at the top, dying is a consequence.<br>

Its interesting you say &quot;communist POS unions&quot;.  That would pretty much put you into a small, maybe 2% of the US population who haven't directly benefited from unions in one form or another since their creation.<br>
<br>
Given that you are here posting, I'm guessing that you are not in that top flight 2% and that your post is made due to a lack of the historical knowledge of what unions have actually done  for the average American over the course of time.<br>
<br>
Your post would only seem to make sense if you are talking about corruption in the unions?<br>

*Edit* Why would they draft someone who couldn't make high enough on the ASVAB to know the difference between a gun and a hammer? You have no worries. There are plenty of men and women in the armed forces that will gladly take up your slack.

Here are some blunders from a certain vice president.....<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;In his first appearance in a nationally televised candidates forum, he <br>
was asked to name a past US president from whom he drew personal <br>
inspiration. the future veep unhesitatingly replied that he especially <br>
admired another &quot;dark horse&quot; candidate, and a product of his home state, <br>
the great &quot;president James Knox&quot;. The only problem is that the history <br>
books show that nobody named Knox ever occupied the White House.<br>
<br>
On a televised tour of Monticello, the historic home of Thomas Jefferson, <br>
he paused in the entrance and blinked up at four busts over the door, <br>
depicting Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis <br>
de Lafayette. as the CNN cameras rolled the veep-elect inquired &quot;who are <br>
these guys?&quot;<br>
<br>
At a meeting of the institute of world affairs, he provided an original <br>
translation of America's official motto, praising the city's ethnic <br>
diversity as an illustration of the great principle &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; - <br>
&quot;out of one,many&quot;. Many conventional Latin scholars translate the phrase <br>
as &quot;out of many,one&quot;<br>
<br>
During his second hallowe'en as vice-president, the fun loving leader <br>
hosted a party for journalists and their families at which he appeared <br>
with his face painted green in the style of Frankenstein's monster and <br>
handed out an original poem composed for the occasion. the ditty promised <br>
&quot;bats and rats and such as that&quot; along with &quot;very scarry (sic) Hallowe'en <br>
news&quot;<br>
<br>
More &quot;scarry&quot; news came 3 months later: when sending out a letter to <br>
the press apologising for yet another embarrassing gaffe, the earnist <br>
vice president promised reporters that this time he had &quot;learned an <br>
important lession (sic)&quot; - though apparantly not spelling. for those who <br>
wondered whether he might ever wise up, the answer came at a press <br>
conference where he solemnly declared &quot;we all know that a leopard cannot <br>
change his stripes.&quot; &quot;<br>
<br>

The communist PoS union comment was purely a nudge at the far left, people I realy don't see eye to eye with. It was merely a childish counter-attack to the other childish statements I have already seen on this post.  Why? Because I am the Mad Man, opinionated and rather loud. I don't always feel I have to spell it out for people to get my point across, but since you have brought me back and I am feeling a little better today, I will explain my statement for you.<br>
<br>
To start out, no I am not in the top flight of the American population. What ever the top flight of anything is. Use a better word in place of flight in the future, its borderline annoying. If this isn't an original thelime phrase, please direct what I just said to its origin.  back to the subject I don't consider myself part of any teir, no matter what the government defines me as. <br>
<br>
As for historical proof you seek. Historians write opinions losely based around facts.  More often they reflect their own personal beliefs and what they feel is right for our country and society.  Is this wrong, no, but you can't take it at face value and if you do your are not adding anything to your argument in my eyes nor will you convince me that the unions are right just because someone wrote about them and what they have done. At the same time I find it rather humorous after saying all this that I am a History Major, I enjoy it, but I think through it.  Life isn't like jepardy, the right and &quot;factual&quot; answer isn't always the truth.<br>

Now for the unions.  The ends never justify the means... if you live by the reverse of this I have no respect for you as a human being. Unions are based totally around greed.  I say greed because instead of working harder or re-educating themselves to improve their economical stance, unions and their members try to fight for it through the lack of work, pickets, sit ends, intimedation, etc. They also view independent workers that don't have anything to do with them as a threat which is in itself wrong. If you don't like how you are being treated in your job get a new one and give your boss the finger, there is always another option. Corruption? Yes union corruption and abuse sickens me and makes me hate the idea and the pratice even more.<br>
<br>
I hope I expanded my thought enough for you...<br>

I didn't like GW during the election, I voted for Alan Keys. But seeing him stick to his guns by making an effort to cut taxes, which will help the economy more than any union ever will, and restoring the military to some semblence of the force that protects our freedom, I give him the thumbs up.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubargeroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bargeroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#993300>(3/19/01 12:41:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting (nothing to do with EQ)</span><hr size=1> OH Boy. <br>
<br>
Speaking as someone who has been in the workforce for 20 years and was a member of a Union at the age of 16. I can tell you that Unions are a good thing especialy in principle.<br>
<br>
Now I also speak as a manager(no longer in a Union) who has had to deal with the Teamsters union, Carpenters union, Electricians Union, and Decorators Union for 4 years now, they can also be a pain in the ass. They often protect employees who should be fired, refuse to service their customers appropriately etc.<br>
<br>
To sum it up quickly Unions were created to give the workers power. You see it used to be one sided there Mardin. If you wanted to work you worked for the company that owned the town the store the electric company and your house and you worked for what they paid you no negotiation. You also worked under what ever conditions they say fit. Unions also brought about many of the safty laws we consider a given today. Ask anyone who had relatives die of Black lung disease if they think Unions are a good idea. Now becuase of anti-trust laws and Labor Unions the power has a little more balance. Do Unions often abuse their power? Absolutely. How is that any worse than an employer abusing his power over his workers.<br>
<br>
Remember the old saying &quot;power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;<br>

&quot;who has walked a mile in both shoes and still thinks Unions are a good idea damn it&quot;<br>
