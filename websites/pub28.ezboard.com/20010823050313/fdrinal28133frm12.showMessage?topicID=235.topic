Miscommunication- One of the big friendship killers in EQ. Sometimes bad stuff happens in EQ, sometimes people mess up. Sometimes people say things and you read it wrong. Sometimes people are gonna dislike each other. All I ask is that you try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Probably if they are in your guild, they had the best intentions... talk to them about it before flying off the handle. Sometimes your gonna die directly due to someone goofin up, it happens, try to remember its just a game. As always, talk to an officer and/or post about any problems you have. <br>
/snip<br>
<br>
Or sometimes people are just ignorant shitheads who enjoy generating conflict:)<br>

You know what?  Fuck you, you ignorant slut.  He doesn't dig back 10 pages to find fucking posts, and bring them back for a flame and point them out to people.  Yah, you're pretty fucking cool.  Lukasz is my age, yah about 16.  So I'm guessing he has a life.  Want me to define life for you?  OK:The interval of time between birth and death: She led a good, long life. <br>
The interval of time between one's birth and the present: has had hay fever all his life. <br>
A particular segment of one's life: my adolescent life. <br>
That is prolly the one you're referring too, not the total scientific definition.<br>
<br>
Better yet, you're trying to use it as a damaging thing.  Most of us have gotten used to it.  'Get a life man.' 'You're a loser.'.<br>
<br>
We all value life.  Some of us value it differently.  You're a pretty ignorant piece of shit for being a hypocrite.   You reply more to these boards with WORTHLESS posts.  Ones that dribble on and on.  You want to make yourself the fucking bitch ass Drama queen.  Just go the fuck away.  People have asked nicely.  People have told you or asked rudely.  I'm the latter.   You're worse than Balrak.  Why? Because at least his posts mean half a shit from what he's saying and you can understand compared to your posts that dribble on the same thing.<br>
<br>
You like beating dead horses don't you?  I can't believe I bothered helping your ass in hate and helping you get armor.  IE I invited you.  Don't try to say you were the only chanter around cuz there were more.  I thought you were a decent person.  Til you turned overly bitter and enjoyed this spotlight as the Drinal Bitch.  <br>
<br>
You think you're a player... telling ladies to fuck EQ relationships.  EQ relationships aren't that serious.  Just friendships and getting married to someone to the opposite sex in EQ doesn't mean you're going to go across the states and go bang them.  <br>
<br>
Both you and I lost the meaning of Everquest a long time ago.  It was supposed to be fun.  I know people who barely post here and think you're one of the biggest bitches ever.  Because you just dribble on and on about the most worthless shit.<br>
<br>
In summary: Get the fuck out, and don't dis the quality of other people's lives when your own is not perfect or even good.  You seem to work, post.  Ya, I bet I got more posts than you. Go fuck yourself.<br>

The go fuck yourself tat is right.  Yes, I am a loser?  Mmmkay, I'm sure you've got a mental image of me.  I'm sure it's wrong as mine is of you.  You could be some pimp of the ladies, always hanging out with your friends.  As of right now, I'm enjoying my life.  Hanging out with friends, doing whatever, smoking weed, going down to the dunes(just a place to go hang out near Lewiston.. no one has any idea where that is).  Bumping Trisha Yearwood downtown and having drunks dance to it at stops.  Maybe I'm a loser in your eyes.  Which is fine with me, because I don't know you, nor would I probably want to.  <br>
<br>

Haha... ok, I drink every now and then, compared to weed.  Let's compare.  No hangovers... if you do too much of it you don't throw up.  You don't stumble around all over the place.  It's more relaxing in my opinion.  I'm just not the all out drinking type.  So I smoke weed ;). <br>

The Trisha Yearwood thing is funny as hell.. especially when you can get drunk guys to dance to it at stop signs, haha.  We like to fuck off.  Do I actually listen to Trisha Yearwood? No thanks.
