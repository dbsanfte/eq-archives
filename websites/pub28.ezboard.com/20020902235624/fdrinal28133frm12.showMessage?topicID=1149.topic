We get flamed hard for every mistake, every incident that we happen to be involved in, and every foot we take. <br>
<br>
before this RF incident, practically none of the flames on this board were about, or involved cih (since ST post). <br>
<br>
Over half the people that are posting &quot;hate cih for what they are and what they do.. etc..&quot;  i (me personally) dont even know, heard of, of even knew they are. Yet they are able to try to boycott CiH, the entire guild?<br>
<br>
You say (the cih bashers) that CiH doesnt do anything for the drinal community? Thats another totally outright false statement if i ever heard of one. On weekly basis i know of members in my guild saying that they will be a bit late for raids, or they cant farm ore till later, or farm comms till later due to helping someone with their epic. Yet we still dont help the community? what do you want us to do? Donate money for a horse for everyone?<br>
<br>
You say(the cih bashers) CiH KSed ragefire. Was i there? no, were 99% of the people there that are saying it? NO. Do people know all the facts? no, yet they still post &quot;hate cih&quot;. Another example of people jumping on the bandwagon. <br>
<br>
Do I know exactly what happened? no, for i wasnt there either. All my posts concerning the RF situation have all been about the RF list. When did this RF situation happen? about a week ago, and people still going on about it. <br>
<br>
Anyways, i just find it astounding how people jump on teh bandwagon, and start posting 'hate cih, for doign this etc.. boycott them, dont do anything for them, they do noting for us' etc.. Hell, reeko has gotten over the situation, the one the whole RF thing surrounded (him being the person ontop of the RF &quot;list&quot;). <br>
<br>
Note: I forgot what post i was posting this under. This is not directed to kaleigh at all, just clicked onthe wrong one =)<br>

If a cleric in my guild tried to KS ragefire as yours did NO ONE WOULD HELP THEM. If a cleric and a group of players in my guild did take a spawn away from someone in your guild THEY WOULD ALL BE GUILDREMOVED. <br>
<br>
Thats the difference. <br>
<br>
We all have disagreements where we both think we are right. We all race each other to a spawn from time to time and see things our own way. But we dont all say hey hes in my guild he gets my support no matter what he does and we dont say hey my guildmate is an asshole but that doesnt reflect on me. <br>
<br>
Now go ahead and bring up some other disagreement to try and deflect the original issue and continual issue that you just cant understand. <br>
<br>
hey maybe all you cats guys are right. Go my team and fuck everyone else but I and many others just arent gonna agree with you on that one and as long as we do your gonna get flamed when these things happen. <br>

You may really really like those guys in that B Class team, and everyone there all knows each other and gets along great, but you're an aggressive person and you play the game to win. So of course you try out for and make it onto that A class team whose playing every night and kicking ass. Does this mean that you agree 100% with EVERYTHING that the A class team does when they're not on the field (in eq terms, a raid)? Probably not. When you're on the field (raid) as a team, you're just that, you're a team and the best of friends. When the game is over and everyones doing their own thing, that's their OWN thing.  If one of them pisses off another member from another team, you can talk to them and just go &quot;hey man, that's not cool&quot;, and hopefully it wont happen again. But you dont throw them OFF the team, unless they like pull out a gun and shoot the guy or something.<br>
<br>
Just because i'm on this team, and the other team is my competition, doesnt mean i have to go around refusing to socialize with the guy on the other team. It's all for fun. You  can be fierce on the field but when the games over you shake hands.<br>
<br>
Maybe i just view games and guilds differently than everyone else? Don't get me wrong, i love cih and everyone in it, imo (although biased) they're the best bunch of people on the server, and i'm sure each and everyone of you feel the same about your guild or you wouldnt be in there. But hey guys, it's a game, dont lose sight of that. If you dont like someone, just dont talk to them. If they're harassing you, put them on ignore or petition them, otherwise just let them go on their way and you go about your way, is that hard? <p><P>

(please provide any logs that say different which you wont because you know im right). You mean when I was asking you what do you want to do to work this out amicably and instead of replying to 3 tells you pulled tormax? which btw we did not interfere with and zoned out asap. When we came back in you were dead (so I guess you really werent raid ready yet were you), then we pulled and died (I guess we werent ready yet either =p), then you pulled and died again?(so you still werent ready an hour after this whole fiasco began which again I offered to solve in the beginning) then when we were trying to pull a 2nd time you kept interfering with our pullers and sent them a tell saying (this isnt a direct quote but close maybe Moayen can provide the logs) &quot;no way your killin tormax I can keep this up all night&quot;, while all this was going on several of your guildmates were insulting and threatening us in ooc and shout and tells while there wasnt a peep from any CTer in a public channel except for me offering to roll on it and solve it? Then a GM showed up and you insisted on not rolling so he DTed tormax.<br>
<br>
If your refering to this &quot;incident&quot; which im pretty sure you are, no we didnt guild remove anyone, but I would have guild removed you (for your threat to another person once I saw the logs) and warned any member that made any of the comments your guildys made. <br>
<br>
but just like I said you try to derail the topic with noise and counter accusations kinda like Ubars sig. <br>
<br>
btw I normally wouldnt engage you in a pissing match but since I havent logged in for a month and who knows when I will be able to again the gloves are somewhat off. <br>

What is it about that crazy giant that brings out the worst in people.  I have my own little Tormax story that happened a little while ago.<br>
<br>
Long story short, we pulled Tormax while a rival guild was amassing their troops.  They didn't like this because they had<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> guild member in the zone first.  They didn't have the force to pull yet, but got our shit together faster and we did have the force.  So they send 3 monks to fd in our camp.  We figure they're just setting up to pull if we wipe.  It's a pretty standard tactic and we ourselves have done this.  Anyway, Tormax is pulled in and our MA gets on him.  Everything's going fine and then the fd monks pop up and start trying to trade food with our clerics.  This totally fucks up the healing rotation.  Yeah, I know they should have had &quot;accept trades&quot; turned off, but we really weren't expecting it.  So even though we tried valiantly we can't survive minus 3 clerics and we wipe.  The only survivors are 2 of our necros who feigned.  The rival guild pulls Tormax while a bunch of us /petition.  The GM shows up while the other guild is fighting Tormax and drops the whole fucking zone.  When it comes back up, no GM and no Tormax.  I started laughing when they told me the GM dumped the zone.  I really fell out when I heard there was no Tormax when it came back up.  All this for crap for some loot?  Why do people get so worked up over this shit? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufflewddurfflam.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fflewddur Fflam</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/02 3:34:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1149.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fuctards that are going on about CiH</span><hr size=1> Windailya,<br>

<br>
First let me say I think that I have a pretty damn good reputation in game, and anyone that knows me knows that I call things how I see them if I am involved and know the facts, regardless of who my friends are or who I am guilded with. On the evening with that Tormax deal, I logged on a mule and checked and Tormax was up. I checked doing a / and only a lower level raid on the arena was in the zone at the time. After just a moment a CT monk happened to log in right next to my mule (Akuktoo being the mule) and I assume that he put out the call to arms as I had. Long story short, people started showing up from both CT/WL and CiH. The first group with a raid capable force (capable of Tormax at least) was CiH. We had 29 people in zone and buffing (including a full staff of healers) while there were only 19 people from CT/WL in zone at the time (and this included only two clerics) and possibly Fierire (although from when I was in tells with him since he is a friend and past guildmate, I was not sure if he was there to assist you or not). This is the point where the competition should have stopped. We had the numbers in zone first with the correct classes to accomplish the task. We beat CT/WL to that mark. I had fully expected the alliance to back off of the tormax issue at that point just as Cats had backed off of Yelinak a month or so prior (when we all arrived in at roughly the same time, but you guys had a CoH person already up top, so obviously had us beat because of that). Sure there were some folks that wanted to get a GM involved, but I at least surely did not counsel that as a wise move. I recommended we back off because we had been beaten to the mob with the proper force to kill him. And we did back off. Anyhow, I had expected the same sort of courtesy when we had beaten WL/CT to tormax, but I was surprised to find that it did not happen that way.<br>
<br>
As for what went on in tells or whatever, I cannot comment on that because I was not a part of those. I do know that our first pull did go wrong and I believe it was because we were rushing the issue because even with only 19 people in zone from CT/WL, Maoyen shouted out a warning that Tormax would be pulled soon. From there everything wwent downhill until finally the GM despawned Tormax. IMO, it should never have gone that far in the first place. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, this is what I observed there as I was there for the duration. I don't make a comment positive or negative on something like this unless I know the facts, so please dont assume that I am making a statement about anything else with this post. Thank you. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229714 target="web">Aktunka Wormflinger</a><BR>

<br>
You perceived yourself to be there first, with suffecient force (What even determins this? Sure you know after the fact but its pretty hard to know before)<br>
<br>
And We perceived us being there at the same time, and didnt gain &quot;Suffecient force&quot; till the same time we did. Simply put it was a race.<br>
<br>
<br>
We Were finishing up rhag 2 when Tormax popped, we sent everyone who was not there to Kael, Due to some of your guildmates talking near zone out in Ssra we knew you knew too, however on a scan of /who cats all it showed 19 people.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly due to a strain of people due to many heading to kael, and a mistake in setting up rampage list we were not sucessful, but got a cleric out. and Quickly ressed and TL'd to Wakening Lands<br>
<br>
When I zoned Many other CT/WL were appearing as were CiH, we all quickly ran to Kael, and when i zoned in, we had about 24 people, and CiH had about 24.<br>
<br>
At this point we contacted you proposing a roll for the spawn, because we were both getting there in equal force, we do not enjoy races, and didnt want the shit that happened, to happen.<br>
<br>
Another Scan of /who cats all showed that many other had logged on, or become un anon.<br>
<br>
The Numbers steadily grew on both sides, Our monk and your guys puller (you didnt have a monk) raced to tormax's throne, You guys aggroed first, took him to zone and we all zoned out, because we respect first aggro, scanning who cats all soon many appeared in Bazaar or nexus and we zoned in to many dead CiH, evidently due to adds, (which we were not part of, as we zoned, most likely due to the fact that between being rushed to pull the spawn, and having no monk, having a Druid pull.<br>
<br>
We zoned in and foolishly pulled to early and zoned out to add's.<br>
<br>
You guys pulled again, and died again,<br>
<br>
We started to pull again, a GM appeared, asked us to roll for the spawn, and Trevize refused, and GM DT'd him (Tormax)<br>
<br>
During the whole incident there were insults and heckling coming from CiH, and admitaly some of WL as well.<br>

There is no doubt of your good rep and great sense of humor. <br>
<br>
I dispute your numbers but understand where you may have only thought we had 19 since we had several unguilded people along with us as well. We invite lots of non CTers to our raids often and dont always temp invite recruits especially when its their first raid or two. I can see where this would give you a false impression of how many folks we had present. <br>
<br>
I think you know my rep as well and I can asure you our numbers were dead even throughout the race. I did a zone /who every 10 seconds or so hehe =p. We would have 10  to 8 then you would have 12 to 10 and back and forth. I will try and dig up my logs if I get the time for exact numbers if anyone really cares. To me that conflict was legitimate. We both knew we were racing we both thought we were right We tried to offer an amicable solution. We never interfered with your pulls or attempts. <br>
<br>
I can also assure you that if we ever thought you had us significantly outnumbered we would have walked away as we have also done many times. <br>
<br>
For Trevize to suggest this &quot;incident&quot; was anything like the rage situation is ludicrous. <br>
