I would like to thank the corporate nazis for killing the fun in this game for me. Your random nerfs and changes to improve the &quot;balance&quot; of the game have been irking me for almost 2 years now. Damn I spent 2 years in this game, that is sad in itself. So I guess at the same time I have to say thanks for finally waking me up the realization that &quot;your world&quot; is a very boring and monotonous. My personal favorite nerf was the can'tcastonawaterloggedmob fix instead of improving the AI of the mob or noticing your clip-plane coding... might need a little work. So 2 years later we have the horror of a zone respectfully nicknamed the Siren's Ghetto. But the thing I can't figure out is why did you make the game extremely difficult and time consuming instead of fun. For those of you left.... don't level past 50 and in truth the best part of the game will always be level 1 - 20. And to the arse kissers and techies that form the entity VI, (formely known as verant) you may know how to code a game, but you sure as hell don't know how to play it 8 ). So to Alan and Absor especially /rude and /buttsalute! I mean come on guys when /gem is more fun than the actual game there is something very wrong. Instead of balancing the gameplay guys, why don't you concentrate on other areas like fixing bugs not fixing stuff you forgot to test, oh yeah and testing things before you put them live, (hindsight is 20/20, but you piss a lot of people if you try to whipe your butt 2 months later after making poopin the doo after its already become part of the ecosystem) and leaving some zones out that were on the map oh man that disapointed me back in the day. I could add so much more here but you have already wasted to much of my time.<br>
<br>
Mardin Greystone, the un-uber and proud of it<br>
<br>
p.s. if you see the GM known as Valindor, tell him he can kiss my dog's arse.<br>
<br>
Valindor shouts, &quot;This is GM valindor...there will be no more pvp in the arena until 15 minutes after the match&quot;<br>
Mardin says, &quot;No shit? I thought it was Britney Spears.&quot;<br>

They are right you are wrong, is this a god complex they suffer from? I would have to say absolutely.<br>
<br>
You see, I can understand trying to keep balance, but in that process they fail to realize they are ruining the fun of the game, lets face it in EVERY rpg there will ALWAYS be a class that is slightly more powerful then the others, it's the way it is. They do not go about nerfing the game senseless to correct it, rather they let it be unless it's really lopsided.<br>
<br>
Verant does seem to refuse to accept responsibility for their actions, they do refuse to accept to let players play the game the way THEY want to play it, not the way Verant wants them to play. I don't care if its Verants game they created, I'm paying them a monthly fee to rent a few megs to save my game date *aka a storage locker in short*. I will not be told I can't do this or because your to strong in our eyes we will nerf you. Nooo, you just don't do that after 2 years of being on the market, that's why you have extensive beta testing. If it's broken you don't sell it, it's called bait and switch tactics, one verant has relied heavily on the past 2 years. They give you a BP that has great stats, oh wait, to strong, so what if its been in the game for a week or a month, NERF it.<br>
<br>
Now the critics will say, we want to evolve the game to make things harder, to make mobs smarter, to make your spells become less effective against them, ok that's fine then I want to learn how to evade an attack better I want to be able to evolve just as well as the monsters do that I've been fighting for nearly two years since topping 50. But this won't happen because it will make the game to easy for the players hence we will get bored and leave sooner so verant looses income, but they are doing more harm by their current actions by these senseless nerfs at times.<br>
<br>
Point being, my GF plays a monk, two patches ago FD bug hit and so did a mend, she's contacted verant officials numerous times asking, when will this be fixed. They tell her the same thing, we're working on it.<br>
<br>
Well now call me crazy but what the heck, these are the two most viable skills a monk has and you've botched them up and are not even in a rush to fix them? My first question is this, what testing do you all do? Really, how could you possibly miss such a bug out there, secondly, when you do botch something up why is it never corrected immediately? When you feel an item in game is to strong you bust your butt to nerf it but when you botch up a players ability to function properly with his or her skills being broken, it takes you weeks, months, years to correct those problems. I would like to know, where do Verants priorities lie within these matters?  Don't tell me your fixing something, just fix it and get it up and running again asap, I don't believe it till I see it, so stop beating the players around the bush with excuses.<br>
<br>
You know it's very poor business ethics for future games to mistreat a player population as such and I honestly will not play under such a dictatorship ala Verants &quot;vision&quot;. I don't break their rules but one reason I do not play much is because everytime I turn around they botch something else up and then they have the nerve to tell me it's better for you this way, sorry guys and gals but I decide what's good for me, not you, not a company, not anyone else but myself.<br>
<br>
As the Rak would say, you can take that vision and shove it up your candy a$$.<br>
<br>
I've spoken, Verant listen up, you can try to tell me how to play, but you like the rest before you who tried to run my gaming life will fail.<br>
<br>
Other then that, have a good one folks and just remember, perhaps a gaming revolutionary war needs to take place in order for verant to realize, they can create a game, but in the end it should be the players who determine, how it's to be played. Though sometimes I must agree, some players act immature and that is when a company needs to set the rules. So I am not saying allow players 100% freedom, but I do think this &quot;vision&quot; crap has to go.<br>

Think about that before you go off on a GM the next time you petition, I know they take alot of abuse and I apologize to them for the players who have made their lives miserable some nights. <br>
<br>
Hey lets face it folks, could be worse, we could be back on a certain server dealing a head gm there, I heard he's BAD, real bad, banning people for no reason, umm killing mobs just to mess with people. That type of behavior is unacceptable in my eyes and it is someone like that, that does need to be removed from his position.<br>
<br>
I want to thank Val for helping a friend of mine who mistakinly deleted a wurmslayer and what did Val do, because my bud was nice, he gave my bud another. That's pretty darn nice, I spoke to Val about it and thanked him and this is what he told me:<br>
<br>
See, I'm not a jerk all the time /grins  ;-)<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents, take care all and thanks again Valindor. Ohh and a special thank you to my favorite head guide, Lili, we'sa misses you baby!!! <br>
