EVERYONE has to know who you are on these boards. You get me? The whole of drinal would have to know (Let's say your name is John Dillion) John Dillion in real life. <br>
<br>
Defamation/libel wont apply to an anonymous person unless the public knows who you are. Just because you post your real life name, does not mean that they know who you are. These boards are still private. Now, if it was on a newpaper and someone wrote up some false statement on you, John Dillion then you could collect the damage because the news paper is a public paper.<br>

<br>
*Who* would be held liable stands to reason. I would personally have held Morbeas the most accountable, but the story then became more convoluted. Because rather then just modding out the messages, you banned me on top of it. haven't banned others for this reason, didn't ban morbeas who posted the pic. That is when liability transfers from only being Morbeas your being involved as well.<br>
<br>
You and I worked all of that out in e-mail to what I thought was a reasonable understanding. It wouldn't even have to be rehashed if the little forum gnats would quit bringing it up. It is not like I am going to give in an agree, they do not have the expertise to consult me on this fact.<br>
<br>
So what stands to question is why are Dirra, Zueloth still persuing it. End of the day - If I modded this board I would point everyone to the ezboard terms of service and state you are better safe to follow them then sorry you didn't. <br>
<br>
There is no justification for what happend. It was wrong. I will forever and a day disagree with Zeuloth, Dirra or whoever who thinks it was right. The only thing that would tempt me to &quot;act&quot; upon it is if there are real life - &quot;monetary&quot; or - &quot;life changing&quot; implications from it. If it resulted in a lost job opportunity or a lost sale - then the net total of the incident and it's impact on me is higher. I would take action if that were happen. I realize many do not think that if you post peoples names along with their photograph and information in here which is defamatory it would have implications, but most are also too young to understand those implications.<br>
<br>
Why be silly and further encourage it. I suggest that people in this board stick to the safety zone and only flame avatar's if they are going to flame at all. Keep the real life part out and you will save yourself potential liabilities. <br>

I'm pretty sure of that. In fact, as I recall, I mostly stayed the hell out of the incident -- admittedly, I've been rather forward in making fun of your reaction to it, especially recently.<br>
<br>
Course you will probably dig through old posts and such and find out that I'm lying or whatnot and accuse me of being a dick and dishonest and what all; don't bother with doing it though, as once again you would just be dragging it back up (course then you could bitch once again about everyone else dragging it back up. Sigh.) Or go for it, whatever floats yer boat.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I love the Amateur Attorney posts; it's a vice I like to indulge in as well and it's amusing to see the various &quot;legal&quot; opinions that are posted here when we all know damned well that nothing will ever come of any of it.<br>

Be safe rather then sorry. You treat that risk as though it doesn't exist, it does exist. Financial implications could result. If they did - something would come of it.<br>
<br>
How I reacted? I reacted by telling Zandalay she was sick - I reacted by discussing privacy laws - I reacted by discussing liabilities. You didn't ever &quot;discuss&quot; these points - you reacted by trying to dilute the conversation in to further reactions.  I speak my mind - or try to make a topic for discussion and you guys shit in your pants because we aren't talking about farts any more - we are talking about an honest to god serious subject which has honest to god implications.

It's contributory to any alleged damages you may suffer (damages that I think are pretty damned remotely possible).<br>
<br>
You seem to not have a good time here, or enjoy being around the boards, people harass you, etc., and yet you keep coming back. If it's so damned unpleasant, or risky to your career, or whatnot, one would think you'd go away and not come back -- at least to the flames section. By and large, the flames don't spill out of this little folder (thank God).<br>
<br>
I think you actually enjoy it; I can relate, I get a lot of enjoyment out of the flame boards even though there are a short list of people here who apparently view me as a Folok-substitute.  Almost every post gets tagged with some blithering juvenile idiocy, except during school hours and while mommy is putting food on the table for supper. And I post my share of foolishness as well. But I rather enjoy the boards regardless; frankly, and don't tell him I think this, Fibbies picture post today took my breath away in it's flaming beauty. I suspect you feel the same way -- there's no other explanation for you coming back for more and more and more.<br>
<br>
And frankly, most of what you get here is because you react to it; you know that, and yet still you keep on, while trying to turn it around. Yes, I've trolled you. Yes, it's fun. Yes, you react. <br>
<br>
Hell, stop feeding the trolls, and I have a feeling they will turn to other people, alot like the Lad from Sol Ro turned to me when his pal Folok went off to the service.<br>
<br>
Say, where's Didrika? I feel another stupid troll coming on... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Life</span><br>  Posts: 1223<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/26/02 4:20:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1337.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  ...</span><hr size=1> I come back because <br>
