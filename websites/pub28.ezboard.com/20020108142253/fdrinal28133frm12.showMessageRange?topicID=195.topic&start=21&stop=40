Siusiu aka Jonny?  you ever consider you didnt get your epic or win items because your a straight up fuckin prick?  if we chose too we would completely spam this flame with shit you did wrong against guild members...out of anger, animosity, bitterness, etc...<br>
<br>
for example...i tell you straight up, your lil sister is nicer then your prick ass...you disband me in group in the middle of pull...thank god for feign death =) another time i ask you where bank was in Kael..you say &quot;your annoying&quot; another i ask you to reconsider why you are in CiH? and you attack me with excerpts like &quot;you want me disband now?&quot; etc...  your a fuckin asshole, with buckteeth, dandruff and zits beating on your sister cause she's more socially inclined and friendlier then you, and kicking your dog cause he has worms from eating his own shit cause your so involved in EQ you neglect your everyday chores your whore bag of a mom has given to you, getting beat down by your drunkard dad for slapping your mom and telling her to shut up cause your playing EQ.<br>
<br>
Mutha fucker you wanna get rude?  lets dance!!! otherwise you can tongue my ass, swallow my shit crumbs and shut the fuck up?<br>
<br>
My equipment is not really what i would say &quot;L33T&quot;  but its decent.  id say i own when i go on raids.  HELL, everyone in Cats do.  Ill even go so far as to give you credit where credits due and say you were good.  But your attitude and your dimeanor was completely shitty towards your guild mates.  It was rather negative.  How can you even question your status within the guild?  Do you see me crying and flaming others cause i didnt win an item i would &quot;love&quot; to have?  Hell naw i dont talk shit cause whatever decision the officers make im sure is the right one...otherwise if people didnt agree they wouldnt be in Cats.  Sure i am an asshole and i talk with such foulness.  But my aim in guild is not to demean, degrade, or bring down in any way the morale or attitude of my guildmates like you have done so often...my speech is merely to lighten up and cheer up oppurtunities that might need a little laughter not through suttle means...but through brutal gut busting laughter.  <br>
<br>
i was glad to help contribute to adding fuel to the fire that was burning your testicles and causing your hemmroids to flare.  GAWD DAMN your fucking lucky that im tired and i really dont have time to seriously flame your 500lb bed ridden, shit sheet stained, smellin like you suffocated and killed the cat between your cellulite infested ass cheeks when you rolled over to finish that wet burrito you got down the street from chongs taco stand, fartin every time you turn or flip a bard song, face lookin like you gotta take a shit..you know that face that looks like you smelled something bad?  Next time you go down on your dog and your tongue is all up in his ass, have a mirror handy you prick ass muther fucker, youll know what the fuck im sayin.<br>
<br>
Have a goodnight and please for the LOVE OF GAWD JONNY!!!! GIVE USA OUR FUCKIN SPY PLANE BACK!!! cock suckin, fudge packin, tobacco spittin, droolin fuckin INBREED<br>

Siu I would constantly try to help you and get you support for epics and shit. If it didnt happen that day, you would go and post a 5 paragraph load of shit about how the guild needs to change, how the officers are lewt whores, how we are unfair and dont care about anyone but ourselves. Then expect help again.<br>
<br>
Lather, rinse, repeat.<br>
<br>
Thats why you rarely got help.<br>
<br>
Now on to my feelings about you, your claim of skill, and your im the best attitude.<br>
<br>
You got paid to play this game, not a bad job. YOu where at times nice, your knowledge of the game was, immense.<br>
<br>
As far as skill, you where aobve average, when you where awake, but since you slept 90% of the raids you attended, it never shined through.<br>
<br>
Now your shithole attitude that you have, your jeleous &quot;I am better at every class, and make better guild, take down cih&quot; this bullshit you have said repeatedly.<br>
<br>
WHERE YOU AT NOW?!<br>
<br>
Why must you disrespect us all for busting ass and dealing many months of being the second best behind AL, to finally have come into our own, and start to dominate shit.<br>
<br>
We are the youngest of the known uber guilds. by MONTHS, and you think you can make a better guild? 2 years of all of us trying and trying to find ways to improve, and we finally do, and you talk shit?<br>
<br>
I considered you an in game friend. At times you where cool.<br>

&quot;Sorry for being negative in the pass&quot;<br>

&quot;I wish to rejoin the guild, Cats in Hats and I hope you officers and everyone will be accepting me again. I cannot make a post on ez because I forgot my account pw. If any chance anyone in guild know my other accounts info I hope someone can change them, I cannot let my chief ed gain the ability to logon my characters, he is trying to delete them so I lost my ability to work on my new EQ website.&quot;<br>

Hahaha Jorply u must have failed Gr.10 math badly, 90% of all cat members have their epics? u wanna go back to ur member page and count how many of them have epics? use your 10 fingers if you need them. oh btw, yeah all the officers and their friends have their epics, go figure.<br>
<br>
and to this Ad0b0 guy, all I can say is if he is in cih then shame to you cats, not only he is a racist bastard, he is full mouth of shit too.  Scumbags like him deserve no place in this world, they should be burned in hell, that's where they belong.  Don't mix freakin politics with a computer game you loser, you have no clue about anything. lol do us a favorite, get lost, you are in the wrong forum.<br>
oh in case you didn't know, there are asian players in cih too, if you are in cih then you've just insulted one of your own, how pathetic...<br>
<br>
And to driztalin, aren't u one of the 5 officers in cih? hah where is your attitude now huh? are fuck you and asshole the only words that you can come up with when defending ur guild? hah..ever wonder why so many people on drinal have absolutely no respect to cih? attitue problem anyone?<br>

And I am not going to go through every members unfinished item list to see which has an epic and which doesnt, it would simply take too much time. When you say that &quot;the officers and all their friends have epics&quot;, you seriously dont know what you are talking about. Does this mean as soon as someone becomes friends with an officer BAM they get an epic? No. Some people have the determination to camp and finish it regarldless of whos friend they are or aren't, and I highly doubt you know enough about the people in the guild to judge the system that way. No one is asking anyone to &quot;like&quot; CiH althgough we do try to maintain our rep, so if you have a problem just keep it to yourself and things like this wouldnt escalate. Oh well, ive spent too much time on this post, but sometimes people just really tick me off, when they make moronic mindless replies. Just go back to karnor and level your insignificant character.<br>

<br>
never liked rayne *tunare* what...a..bitch... <br>
<br>
newbies...god, what pests <br>
<br>
pests in general which later in the game=anybody except my small group of l33t friends<br>
<br>
siusiu is best off on another server btw, he was best at powerleveling char after char and having friends log on his chars that werent alrdy logged on so he could level even faster /bye, laf, flaming is fun, especially when you alrdy sold both your accounts and you dont care what anybody thinks about you, because...it doesnt matter...<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
*twinks*<br>
oh, people that leveled up fast/were helped to level and think they deserve stuff and arent and THEN whine about it saying i want to quit waaahhhhhhhh wahhhhhhhhhhh, lol what a joke, /wave rhanie, never liked her ever since i got a tell from jorply asking me to tell rhanie that driin is really a woman, because her and kerney were talking in group chat saying they thought driin was really a guy, but jorply was awesome, best warrior in cih hands down, played alot and he was knowledgable about his class unlike alot of twinks, and he knew that standing close to the mob would get him more aggro unlike some twinks that got assistance leveling and had groups made for them on a usual basis <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usedain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sedain</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/26/01 10:43:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucarlon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carlon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/01 7:29:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> Cats in hats might be able to kill uber mobs but it's only because of numbers and levels. Before I left did /who all 60 me and warrior a few others and 90% CiH. You guy's all have epics because when they first came out everyone needed to have one and that's all you did was raid for them. If i remember correctly like 10 or 15 people left or wanted to leave over the greed. Officers being fair is a joke, look at the CiH cleric's and Barnak was first to have full PoG and now only one you see with templar's armor. well 3 weeks ago. I only visited this board to delete the link so EQ will take up zero time from now on. Figured I tell things how they were/are.<br>

Officers didn't decide who won items back when PoG was farmed, remember?  He won lottos and was fuckin lucky.<br>
<br>
You fuckin prick.  <br>
<br>
I think my biggest accomplishment as an officer back then, was kicking you out of the guild.  Wish I had the balls to remove other people who have left as well as to not give them the gradification of 'leaving'.<br>
<br>
<br>
How does it feel to lose you chances at killing really hard mob because YOU gated out of XP groups and raids, as small as they may be?  Sucks once you're 60 and got nothing to do, huh Carlon?  I got alot of tells as an officer asking me why you were in the guild in the first place.  Alot of other clerics in the guild would tell me how shitty of a healer you were, and some warriors too. <br>
<br>
But, not like it matters, right?  You've quit EQ. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uqalarrubican.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qalar Rubican</A> at: 5/27/01 9:03:40 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=195.topic&start=81&stop=83>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=237.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=240.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=195.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=195.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=195.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
