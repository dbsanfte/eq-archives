There's plenty in norrath maybe, you're blind.  Maybe you just don't think, let's see ok, sharing, you got PoG for VS/Trak equivalent loot and seb loot, heh.  You got Lguk, Dreadlands, SolB on and on, and you guys bitch about sharing, it's camped move to another spot.  You got Veliuos and Kunark out, both places have plenty of room and good loot, I haven't been into sebilis and it's been fully camped and i'm sure if it was, there would be vacant space in Charasis, or velk's or icewell or whatnot.  Just look and you shall find.  <br>
<br>
Sharing loot?  This game is based almost all upon greed, what's the point of gear?  To be more wanted on raids, more wanted for groups, better solo'ing, etc.  <br>
<br>
And what's happened to this game?  Same thing, humans nature is greed, to look out for #1.  But we've exaggerated it way too much on this server, and we all look out for #1 and hardly look out for our friends and guilds and jump at the oppurtunity to better ourselves over other ppl.  <br>
<br>
So keep on bitching and I'll keep on flaming.  Oh, on my first raid on drinal which was lead by an MM'r we tried to not let armor rot, on mith marr my hate raid, the shaman missed his greaves by 2 minutes =( sorry dono :( I'm sure you got them now.  So Don't /gasp like an ignorant freak, you speak of MM, hint be specific, I bet I could name a few ignorant/greedy bastards from Tunare but I won't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/01 3:25:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Come on Synide, don't be so retarded...</span><hr size=1> Okay, why don't you jump your ass into Sebilis and go kill something for some phat loot....oh wait, you need a group for that..  Hell, you need a few groups for that.  THat is what everyone is getting to.  Unless you have full plane/Kunark/Thurgidin armor and your epic, you don't get invited to get phat lewts.  Yeah, you could just try to get it yourself...And die quickly..  People are just saying that all the Mith Marr people (which I am not sure myself) are all to uptight to invite anyone outside their guild on a raid to get loot.  They would rather let pieces of plane armor rot then let someone they don't know have it.<br>
I mean...I don't believe I will ever be invited on a Venril Sathar raid...why?  Because I'm not in full planer armor and I don't have my epic.  Only problem is..I need to be on a venril sathar raid inorder to complete my epic.  So I'm stuck.  Why?  Because all the major guilds (CS ; CiH ; etc..) aren't accepting new members and the guild I'm in now can't do raids on Venril Sathar.<br>
So I have been rejected from getting an epic weapon because of uptight assholes who run the large guilds.<br>
<br>
That is why people are pissed off.  They just want a piece of the action.  They pay 10bucks a month so that they can be told &quot;No, you can come&quot; and &quot;No, you don't get to random on this because your not in the guild.&quot;  Crap like that.<br>

<br>
Any of you who were never on MM dont know shit about it so STFU. It wasnt as bad as you all say it was. People from MM are not all evil. Just as not all people from Tunare are whiners and crybabys. <br>
<br>
We always invite non guildees on our raids. Im sure the big bad CS and CiH do too. Have we had run ins with them? sure. But it usualy gets resolved pretty quickly and in private.<br>
We always try and find someone to loot armor if its gonna rot guild tag or no. <br>
<br>
Our lil Guild has had maybe 2-3 problems with other guilds tops since moving here. all in all its been fine, less crowded and now more stuff to do than ever. Guess what we have cooperated with Guilds from MM and Tunare even done joint raids.   <br>
<br>
Heres some free advice if you dont like the server ask to get moved back to Tunare (verant seems to be letting anyone who wants to move) Id love a lil less crowding. <br>

Wanna see how greedy I am, I got about 20 pp in total (from doing kael faction quest, woot?).  Or uh, inspect me sometime.<br>

Oh yeah, I don't give a shit   if you have planar armor or ur epic or not, especially druids.  All you need is 200 wis and youre more or less equal.  <br>
<br>
Appropriate level, that's the biggest reason.  Only case I'd consider equip is for warriors, for obvious reasons.  I'll take someone who has a clue over a dumbass in ph4t sov/kunark armor any day<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Another great example, logged in at magi in lguk one day, killed one mob, aggro'd other on accident so I relogged.  Roughly 50 seconds after I hit the camp button I reappear, mob corpse still laying on the ground.  Lo and behold there's a certain Tunarean druid sitting by magi room.  Turns out he claimed the camp because I had logged off, and it doesn't matter if I was just relogging.  I was even thanked for killing a mob for him, how thoughtful!  Whatever, I didn't make much of a deal about it..<br>

I haven't seen you in the game, or maybe i prolly just wasn't paying attention.  Oh, the dragon loot (good things) that i sold was prolly selling for a friend bugazi, i did his deals a lot.  I never would go to a dragon raid, hoping to get an item that someone could use and sell it.  Why should i go around giving bard drums to ppl I don't know?  I'm not that kind of person.  I'm greedy, where in the post did i say i wasn't?  Where in the post did I say it was wrong to sell off *extra* dragon stuff, that people and won't use (those who attended the raid).<br>

Boofy: To get 6 friends to go to sebilis isn't hard, I know it might be for the mentally impaired, out of a server w/ 1500-2000 ppl.

I'm sure ppl in the smaller guilds would go for a pickup VS raid... and learn how to do it, or at least have the chance to attempt, I have no desire whatsoever to kill VS, I don't need him and i think pog legs are better and easier to obtrain than a 7 day spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/18/01 3:39:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Synide....come on..</span><hr size=1> 2000 people on the server<br>

<br>
Senadiel, I think back through all the victories and defeats that my guild has gone through, with all its accompanying ridicule when we lost and instant friends when we won.  I remember the highs and the lows in the history of the guild, and the never-ending struggles to accomplish the impossible.  I recall the derision and mockery, the bias from people who have never even seen a guildmate, the naysaying when we've shown time and again that we have no desire to own this server.  The close scrutiny that my guild gets daily from people who are just looking for an excuse to call us assholes, greedy, or scum of the earth.  The pleas for help from those same people, who then can't understand why we might say no.  The greetings that are ignored by old friends due to nothing more than the guild tag next to our names.  Instances where members of the guild risk all to save or rescue a player that they've never met before in their life, only to see things like 'DIE CIH' from the same player he just rescued or saved.<br>
<br>
Do you still find it so hard to comprehend why we don't invite people from out of guild as often as you would like?<br>
<br>
And through it all we somehow are still able to have fun, laugh at jokes and cheer at victories.  We form a raid and go, sometimes knowing it will be an easy victory, sometimes knowing that we will die over and over, and sometimes not even knowing either.  We don't believe might makes right, although at times it seems that everyone else does.  CiH is a guild that was formed from friends and people who wanted to have fun at the highest possible level of the game.  We don't brag about our accomplishments and rarely make them publicly known, but we're damn proud of them.  <br>
<br>
Does this make us assholes?  Or does it make us only human?<br>
Is anybody else in a guild that started on Mithaniel Marr any different?<br>

Probably just residual from spending four months in guk trying to get the SMR that never dropped pre-level-50. I am starting to feel like if I hear those frogs croaking for endless hours while I try to collect another blue bar of exp - my head is going to explode. <br>
In other words frogs &amp; karnors are getting monotonous. And well I've done Karnors about 100 times. <br>
<br>
All three nights this weekend I logged and read a book, or attended to real life matters instead  - Seb and Karnors have lost their appeal. <br>
<br>
If anyone wants to go to Charasis, The Hole, anywhere in Velious and needs an enchanter I'd hop on it instantly.<br>

Oh? Oops! Might wanna talk to herbal about that one :).  Ask him about Bannion / Me :).  But that's a whole other tangent ;).<br>
<br>
Boofy: Tell me where all those numbers are from, I've never had problems starting pickup raids , or groups.  Oh yea, last time i checked a raid was more than 6+ ppl.. at least my dragon raids are =(. Sorry about your friends list being so small you can't do stuff with them :(.  I got 30 45-52, or sometimes less, hell sometimes 40 ppl.  I didn't care about their gear, as long as they had some form of CR/FR gear and could get 60+, and the main tanks at 80+.  But it's all good, someday you and me can group and have fun! :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzanoan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zanoan </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/22/01 12:35:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Seb</span><hr size=1> I like the thing someone acused Cher for ninjaing a mithril torque, lmao. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=105.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=105.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=106.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=103.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
