Tell me how could it really be a god if it can controlled by a man?  Tell me how can it be a god, something that should have extraordinary superhuman powers, and be created by a man?  Who are we as humans to define &quot;God&quot; and put him in a box?  We can't.  Thomas Paine was a man that wanted to live his own life, for his own self-absorbed interest, but couldn't justify doing so without faith, so he created a faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
This man says that the Bible and Nature are contrary to each other?  But they aren't, they are complimentary of each other.  You cannot say that the Bible contradicts the evidence in nature when the Bible itself mentions that nature cries out about the awesomeness of God.  Here, Psalm 19:1-4  &quot;The heaves declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.  Day after day the pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.  There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.  Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theologians refer to nature as &quot;General Revelation.&quot;  In nature we can see that there is a god, there has to be.  But that it takes &quot;Special Revelation&quot; or written revelation for mankind to know anything about him.  Without the evidence of God in nature the Bible is meaningless.  Without the Bible, the evidence in nature cannot lead to salvation.<br>
<br>
At the end of his letter Mr. Paine mentions in passing the &quot;justice and goodness of God.&quot;  So he believes that God is a just God, how did he come to know that if he didn't believe in the Bible?  But that is besides the point.  The U.S. governmental system distributes Justice, which most often is in the form of punishment.  God is perfect, holy, without sin, and he commanded mankind to do and be the same.  But mankind fell short of that.  So out of his justice he must punish mankind, but out of his goodness he provided a way out of that punishment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udrenomar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drenomar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 333<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:33:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> I dont know why Jesus/Allah(sp?)/Buddha needs my money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#3333cc>Drinalese</font></span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:38:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> Wow Am, I'd would have to say I believe in what you said. Basically there is no way for anyone to know whether the Bible or any other book is the word of God or not because no one knows. Like Dir said, its just your beliefs. However I would say that your beliefs tell you there is a God, but logic should tell you that it's possible for not everything in the Bible to be correct or the word of God. Most things I believe are just interpretations.( Hence why I call myself agnostic) lol<br>
<br>
Also I would like to note that the Bible was written so long ago. How do we know that it has been copied over and over word for word? I tend to think that somewhere along the lines people have copied in things they want you to believe and think, but aren't actually the case. The proof of this would be why there are so many different Bibles and religions. They interpreted events differently and wrote their own version of it, so maybe the Bible is just one of the many re- written versions some people have chosen to believe.<br>
<br>
Also another bit of information is that Christianity and the Bible aren't the worlds most practiced religion as most Americans might believe. Its actually the Muslim religion. <br>
<br>
Just a small comment about Zands post, I personally would not think God would want infants to be killed. How can infants be evil? They haven't done anything wrong, they can't even speak. Doesn't God believe in loving everyone? Doesn't God believe in giving people the chance to live a good life? Why should an infant die who has never done anything wrong? Should we then go kill all the children of the word who have been born through rapes, people who You would consider evil, but others may not? I'm sure many people would consider our military evil since they have murdered others should we kill their children? <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=amaranth54>Amaranth54</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:53:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> Gods justice?  This is exactly what I believe is spoken of by Paine.  Let's not forget the multiple wars fought in the name of God.  The head of the Christian church levied war against the Turks for their occupation of the Holy Lands as well.  Invasion, slaughter, and the razing of cities in the name of Gods justice.  Cruelty at its finest.<br>
<br>
Manifest Destiny, a term I will assume you are educated in, was also about Divine Right.  My anscestors were drivin like cattle in the name of superiourity through a belief.  Once again, cruelty in the name of God.  There is no stretch in believing such a veiw could be precidented by the Hebrews invading &quot;the land that the Lord your God (had given them) as a hereditary portion&quot;.<br>
<br>
Lastly, slaying a man because &quot;Above all else...he hated God&quot; is seen as extremely cruel and immoral act in our society, and many others.  Suppose he was &quot;was an evil man and carried out tremendous acts of cruelty&quot;, and few modern societies I can think of would justify killing his people, to the last man and child, because they &quot;were abominations to God&quot;.<br>
<br>
However, there is a group that supports this veiw of killing those who are &quot;abominations to God&quot; and who they percieve to have &quot;carried out tremendous acts of cruelty&quot;.  Al Quida is the moniker.  Al Quida also believes in the slaying of citizens and non-combatants for the actions of their government, and for their heretical beliefs.  Need I say more?<br>

<br>
ok you said quote: Who are we as Humans to define "God" and put him in a box?<br>
<br>
- Its what you do everyday when you read the Bible. The Bible is your little box. Also please note that Muslims and Jews and many other religions also believe in the same "God" they just don't use the same book and don't give him the same name. Amish and Mennonites also believe in the same "God", but they also have their own version of the Bible. All of these religions take their interpretation of a piece of work and then conform it to what THEY believe. Who even knows that the Original piece of work even was the Bible? We don't. We just assume that because most of us are what you call ethnocentric, we believe that our beliefs are the right ones and the normals ones. However all these different beliefs, sects, written books of God, they are all attempting to put God in a box in the form of a book. Then they teach children from a young age that everything in this book is what you have to believe as fact and follow. They take away a childs ability to use their own logic and brain power by forcing something on them. If we were all believing in this superhuman God and not trying to categorize him Bibles wouldn't exist as a way of life they would just be books to read, educate, and interpret for ourselves. <br>
<br>
- also their is scientific evidence that discusses the makings of earth, its not just the Bible. Also like I just stated, the Bible and other religious books are not use to educate us and let us interpret, they are used as a way of life.<br>
<br>
One more quote=) You said how did Paine come to realize there is a God. The same way I did. He experienced different things, read different books and held what he believed to be true. He didn't eat up every remark made word for word. He interpreted information into what he felt was moral of a God and what seemed to be manmade. How many times have you heard other people and religions justifying the deaths of thousands of people because of the word of their God? it happened on September 11th. Now re- read the Bible and how many people justified killing people because it was the word of God telling them to. If we consider the Talibon wrong for what they did than why should whats written in the Bible that discusses the same scenario be right? Couldn't it be possible that that information was written in there by people trying to justify their cruel actions? <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A> at: 4/2/02 1:00:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzandalay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zandalay</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#ff9933>Drinalien</font></span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 3:58:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ticketvision.com/madonna-tn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> Arrora I can assure you that the Muslim religion is certainly NOT the oldest religion known to man.<br>
<br>
A Muslim is in fact a follower of Islam and Islam is a religion that states that there is only one GOD and  Muhammad is his prophet.  Muhammad, author of the Koran writes of Jesus, Moses, Mary, Noah and other Biblical figures in the Koran.  <br>
He speaks of the Jews and the Christians and in fact, if you have ever read the Koran...remember when Muhammad was under attack and took his people to rest in safety under the protection of a Christian King.  <br>
<br>
As for babies dying in war, that is a fact of life.  The sins of the father....etc.  But it was Man who brought that pain and suffering into being, not God.<br>
<br>
And Amaranth, it might surprize you to know that I'm married to Turk,  ah yes...he married an infidel. I don't need a Turkish history lesson and your use of Turks as lambs is even more surprizing.  I can't think of many other people who were more fearless in conquering and have quite the list of slaughters on their resume.  And extremist groups are just that...and come from all sides of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*  Yes you did say practiced and I did not read it correctly, but you are still wrong.  Islam is one of the  fastest growing numbers, but the not the most practiced.<br>

<br>
Paine, in my opinion, didn't create his own God.  He sought God, but found the God of the Bible to fall short.  He adopted Nature as the perfect representation of Gods nature, as an artists paintings lend insight to their feelings.  He never found God, or in my readings, claimed to comprehend God.  His beliefs were much less ego-centric than a Christians, as he never claimed to commune with his God, or to have some ability to know his Gods will as Christians oft do.  Evaluate that statement fully before replying, as I'm sure you'll find a Christians &quot;personal relationship&quot; with God is much more self-centered than Paines Deistic veiw of disassociated Deity.<br>
<br>
Paine would agree with you that Nature cries out to the awesome power of God, however the rest of the passage you have written there is merely proving dogma from the bible with a bible verse.  This is much like me believing I am superiour to everyone, and then justifying it by saying so - It proves and shows nothing.  Paine, however, does a fine job of portraying why the bible contridicts Nature.  Re-read the passage, and try another approach.<br>
<br>
General and Special Revelation are, quite simply, buzz words for a modern age raised on General and Special relativity.  It is a good example of the education that Paine speaks of that makes those raised in this part of the world Christian, in a modern sense.<br>
<br>
The Taoist, Hindu's, Buddhists, Islamics, and Jews *all* believe God is just, and yet none of them follow the Bible, and no doubt few of them have read it.  Paine's concept behind this is that of blind justice and balance, which is exemplified in his God's work, Nature.  The rest of that paragraph is, sadly, just more dogma.<br>

Its also logical if you really think about it. Christianity is only practiced the most in the United States. Islam however is practiced in all of North Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. The numbers are obvious. At first I also thought the same as you until I was shown the evidence myself because most of us are Ethnocentric and we think that our ways are normal and we center everything around our beliefs. However after you logically think about it you can slowly come out of that. The second most practiced religion is Hinduism which is mostly practiced in Asia and finally the Thirdly most practiced religion is Christianity.Fourth being Catholicism. <br>
<br>
EDIT-- I was thinking maybe our difference in views is because I didn't include Catholicism into Christianity. However I don't see how they are the same when most Christians mock the Catholics for praising Mary and not emphasizing Jesus. If we look at it in the time it was developed I am positive that Catholics didn't consider themselves to be Christian and vice versa.<br>
<br>
I merely stated these facts to show how the word of God is not set in stone in the Bible, it is interpreted differently throughout the world. Most people believe in it so conclusively because its all they know and have been exposed to. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A> at: 4/2/02 2:11:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 6:36:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> If you were a betting person, don't you think the odds are in favor of betting on God?<br>

If you believe in God, and follow his commandments, and live a good life, perhaps you will go to glory with Him.<br>
<br>
So, here's the bet -- you can do that, and one of two things will happen: <br>
<br>
1. You were wrong, and you are dead, and there's nothing. Course, the same would have happened if you hadn't believed.<br>
or <br>
2. You were right, and now you are with Him in glory -- course, the same would NOT have happened had you bet incorrectly.<br>
<br>
It's a slam dunk bet, in my book. <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">

<br>
I have read, and re-read that quote from Paine.  Now my opinion is different, which is probably obvious, but for whatever reason be it background, point of view, or beliefs it is different and I see a different meaning in what he wrote...<br>
<br>
One disclaimer, when I refer to Christianity I mean the Biblical Christianity, not that which is filled with hypocrisy, but the Christianity that is spending one's life in service to God, and following the Bible's morals, commandments, and doctrines.<br>
<br>
I've rethought what I said before, and you are probably right, he did not create a god for himself.  But he did choose one that required nothing of him.  I looked up self-centered just to make sure I have the right definition.  Dictionary says, &quot;Concerned with oneself and ones own interests.&quot;  Christianity is lived in service to God, and in service to fellow man.  I see in no way that being self-centered.  But what about someone who chooses a god that requires nothing of them, would that not be more self-centered?<br>
<br>
The statement was made that Christians having a personal relationship with God is self-centered.  Following that same logic, me being friends with a person would then be self-centered.  That is not true, and cannot be true about being friends with God.<br>
<br>
I was not using the verses from Psalms to show that God exists or that the Bible is his word.  I was using it to show that they do not contradict each other.  I was saying that they cannot contradict each other or one could not use the other as evidence.  In that passage the Bible is using nature as evidence to God's existence.  If they were contradictory that would not be possible to do.<br>
<br>
From nature we can learn nothing about God, aside from the fact that he must exist.  Nothing in nature tells us any details about him, well that he's powerful, but that doesn't tell much.  It takes some form of written revelation to learn about God.  It is a matter of faith which of those revelations one believes, be it the Bible, the Koran, the Apocraphal material, the Book of Mormon, or whatever form of written revelation.  It is also a matter of faith to believe none of them.  It takes just as much faith to be an athiest as it does to be a Christian, a Muslim, and Jehovah's Witness, or any religion.<br>
<br>
For the life of me I cannot figure out which of Paine's statements show how the Bible contradicts nature.  This is prolly cause of my point of view in reading it.  Would be a great help if I knew which ones you were refering to =+)&gt;<br>
<br>
Next, (hehe this if fun, and a challenge too) yes General and Special Revelation are buzz words, but so is Diesm, Marxism, Democracy, everything has a buzz word to it.  It is these words that tell us concisely what someone is talking about.  If a person comes up to me and askes what form of government China has I would say a Communist one, because it is much simpler and quicker than going through and explaining the different governmental and economical policies of the country.<br>
<br>
All those religions you listed all have some form of written revelation don't they?  Yes I said the Bible in my original statements but it is more accurate to say special revelation (which is any form of written revelation, and as I said before its a matter of faith which (if any) of them you believe is the true or accurate one).<br>
<br>
One last thing for tonight.  (Gah, I logged out to go get food and I'm here.)  Sickness and disease, those are part of nature right?  In what way would Paine describe those as just?<br>
<br>
Off to chip away some more at level 54, /sigh.   After I get that coveted substance first, FOOD.<br>

Well Arrora in the Roman Catholic Church at birth everyone suffers from original sin. The only way to rid yourself of it is to be baptised. So to answer your question, yes even little children are guilty of sinning. These sins have been passed down to us from Adam and Eve. <br>
<br>
About the bible, there's no doubt it's been interpreted throughout time to meet the language requirements. However, the language requirements all over the world in regards to the Catholic Church prior to Vatican II was strictly Latin. It has only been recently that this has changed, Catholic Churchs now use the English Language in the USA, Spanish in Spain, French over in France and so on. Actually I am not entirely true there either, most European countries still obide by the Latin language requirements pre-Vatican II. Unfortunately I don't have more time to discuss other things but I'll try to when I have the time. <br>

<br>
Now someone who doesn't believe in that particular religion would not go by that statement. Personally I think children are born free of sin and are innocent until they commit an immoral act. I do not believe anyone needs to be baptized in order to be saved. When making a logical argument you can't assume that everyone is a Baptist or Catholic. According to judgment we don't sentence people for things they never did, so why would we call someone sinful if they have never had a chance to do anything but eat and sleep?<br>
<br>
And yes that might be the Catholic Bible, but lets remember there are more Bibles and religious books claiming the word of God and the ways to live your life besides the one made by the Catholic religion. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/2/02 9:09:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: organized religion</span><hr size=1> Huh? <p><a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/" target="_blank">
