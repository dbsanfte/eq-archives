Except that you can't predict reliably when the spawn will occur, like with Sev.  Yesterday, one of Unconquered's clerics had a monk FD at the spawn location of the new Ragefire in Skyfire (a cleric who has everything else he needs for his epic, yes).  Basically the whole guild had been helping watching for the spawn, as many of us tried to keep a FD monk or a tracker in the area to help with the camp effort over the last few weeks.  Sorta like it was SolB.  <br><br>Anyway, Rage spawns, we begin mobilizing (but not as fast as we possibly could have, since I guess we felt we had the spawn and had no real rush to zergling rush the entire guild there).  Nobody thought to kite Zord (I guess cause we had a monk FD at his feet), AA gets there while we are mobilizing and kites him until the rest of their troops arrive and later kills him. <br><br>As far as how Unconquered feels about this...<br><br>1) We are disappointed Stumpp was not able to complete his epic, seeing that he had &quot;camped&quot; the spawn in the old style of Ragefire camping which was, as we had observed by the respect people demonstrated in SolB, a valid way to camp it when Ragefire was in SolB.<br><br>2) We were sincerely hoping that, due to the multi-day window in which this mob can spawn, the same etiquette that was extended to clerics camping it in SolB would be extended to clerics camping it in Skyfire.<br><br>3) We do not feel AA did anything wrong. We are aware and we certainly could have kited Zord around, we just did not expect it to come to that.<br><br>4) We congradulate AA on their kill and their new epic cleric. We are worried and disappointed that their actions may turn a spawn which was handled with a good degree of etiquette on Drinal (when it was in SolB) into another Severilous, which is one of the most disgusting fought over spawns on Drinal. <br><br>What I'm really trying to say is....do we have to turn Rage into Sev2?  Sev sucks.  We all know Sev sucks.  At least with Sev, you know when its gonna pop.  With Rage you have a 50 hour window, at least, according what I have seen so far on eqclerics.  I guess we were assuming the same respect for a cleric camping the spawn that was shown to clerics in SolB would be shown to clerics in Skyfire.  I don't know why Drinal hadn't had the same kind of problems other servers had with Ragefire in SolB, but honestly, I have been a part of many Ragefire camps over the last few months and people were very respectful of that camp effort in SolB, whether it was just a FD monk, a group clearing FG's, or whatever, people respected it.  <br><br>Just wanted to get some discussion going.  I am now of the opinion that we'll just have to handle this like Sev, and basically, when Rage pops, you can get your force there fastest and get &quot;initial agro&quot; by kiting him until your troops arrive.  Zeny has been trying to hammer the point into me that we don't have a choice, VI turned it into Sev2, but I am of the opinion that the Sev spawn stinks to high heaven and I can't see why we want that again.  Unfortunately...rare epic spawn...outdoor zone...easily accessable to druid/wizard portals...well, you get the point.  It's going to become another Sev.<br><br>Kudos to AA for getting the kill, and to whichever cleric is the lucky holder of a new water sprinker.  I have no hard feelings, and I chalk this up as us just struggling together to set the &quot;rules&quot; for how this spawn is going to work on Drinal.  <br><br>Seke<br>Unconquered<br><br>*edit fixed typos* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/useke2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seke2</A> at: 2/7/02 8:19:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uasanti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asanti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 8:37:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> Out of curiosity.<br><br>When you say you began mobilizing, but not as fast as you could have...<br><br>Are we saying that Zord was up for awhile before you began bringing people to SF?  (a few minutes?  an hour?  several hours?)<br><br>Did you choose to do something else first?<br><br>Did you actively have people on the way to SF when AA zoned in?<br><br><br>I’m not sure how relevant these questions would be to any agreement that is worked out, but I do see a difference between the two camps.  Camping rage in Sol B required a consistent commitment from a group of people in the form of regular FG clearings.   Being the first cleric in the zone really has no meaning unless you happen to have some support to obtain and keep the camp.  This isn’t to say that your idea can’t work, just that I think there is indeed a difference between the two camps.<br><br>I know the warriors started out with the idea that a player could camp the zone for sev and it would be honored.  The problem came when one person camped for an extended period of time but was unable to wait it out due to RL issues or even fatigue.  Then when sev would spawn the next day, that person felt they had as legitimate a claim, based on time invested, as the person who was currently camping the spawn.  It went downhill from there.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utrewayn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trewayn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 8:43:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> IMO This is not going to be another Sev spawn.  This is going to be a whole lot worse.  The warrior epics are nice to have but are one of the first epics to be made obsolete by other items now dropping in the game.  The same cannot be said for the cleric epic.  It was, is and always will be the most important epic to any high level guild which does any degree of raiding.<br><br>I think one of the reasons the SolB camp has remained so civil is the effective &quot;remoteness&quot; of the area.  It's in the far end of a zone and actually required some small degree of effort to monitor (i.e. killing giants to get the area and possibly keeping them cleared.)  Nobody is about to battle their way through a semi-spawn of giants just to bicker with a camper over a spawn.  New Rage is so easy to get to that this effectively cheapens his rareness by increasing his accessibility.  Add to this the very real danger that some guilds may even kill him just to farm for warrior and bard scales and you end up with a nightmare for clerics.<br><br>It's been proved time and again that trying to organise some kind of etiquette on Sev doesn't work.  It would be great if something could be worked out on one spawn or the other and applied to both, but I don't hold out much hope that it will.<br><br>Are there any threads on the cleric forums regarding this problem? <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24811">Trewayn Fifate</A>, <font size=1><EM>Virtuoso, master artisan and all round good egg</EM><br><a href="http://nmcs.com/kingscourt"><b>King's Court</b></a>, <a href="http://www.drinal.com">Drinal</a><p><table border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=40%><tr><td width=15%></td><td width=10%><td width=15%></td><td width=10%><td width=15%></td><td width=10%></tr><tr><td><b>Tailoring</b></td><td><b>210</b></td><td>Fishing</td><td>198</td><td>Pottery</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>Baking</td><td>157</td><td>Smithing</td><td>135</td><td>Fletching</td><td>181</td></tr><tr><td>Brewing</td><td>187</td><td>Jewelry</td><td>170</td><td>Drunkard</td><td>200</td></tr></table></br></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/useke2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seke2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 8:48:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> I don't really think the events of yesterday are relevant to the discussion.  I'll answer your questions, Asanti, but I don't see the relevance to the overall discussion.  I've talked with AA's leaders, so have my other officers, and there doesn't seem to be any unresolved issues.<br><br>I got all this info second hand since I hadn't logged on yet, so perhaps one of my guildies who was online when this happened can give more specifics, but as far as I know:  <br><br>Zord spawned, we began coming right away. I am fairly sure we did not do anything else first, it was just an XP night for us.  Yes, we actively had people otw to SF when AA arrived, and from what I have heard, there was some bickering (mostly from my guild, /bonk Unconquered, sorry, but we were just frustrated after all the work we put in for this) over /ooc and /shout.<br><br>Like I said, this will probably just go the way of Sev.  There's too many parallels between the spawns for it to go any other way...with the exception that while Sev spawns basically as a certain time, predictable within a few hours, Rage spawns anywhere in a 50+ hour window, and while Sev is very difficult to kite due to it being a dragon....Rage would be very easy to kite, cause the human form is not terribly dangerous.<br><br>Seke <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/useke2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seke2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=red><B>Dranalite<B></FONT></span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 8:51:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/002619.html">eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb...02619.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Only thing I could find so far on Skyfire Rage etiquette on the eqcleric boards.<br><br>Seke <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uraventoy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RavenToy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 9:13:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> Hey Seke  ...<br><br>  /hugs to you and all that.<br><br>and /hugs to Stumpp, too... I started talking to him when I was on as my monk laying in LS staring at Lava.  I waited 5 days for Rage 1 there - that in itself is bogus because he's *supposed* to be a 1-3 days (24-72 hour, whatever) spawn after server down, then either every 24 hours or within 24 hours random (not sure about that) spawn thereafter, according to the original post by VI.  Since I believe there has only been one server down, and that was the original patch when this was implemented, it would appear the timer is screwed on this one.  Though I'm not sure how many people have done the turn in to Rage 1, either.  So his timer could be just fine and I simply missed his spawn every day for 5 days.<br><br>EQCleric had people posting all over the place that Rage 2 had never spawned on their server, and finally VI admitted there was something wrong and patched Skyfire.  <br><br>I hadn't seen mention of Rage 2 popping on Drinal till yesterday, so I'm not sure if that was the first spawn or not - if so, the timer still seems to be a little *cough* off.<br><br>In any case, first impressions would indicate this is going to be a messy one.  I saw Stumpp online and sent him a tell asking him if he'd gotten the dragon yet, and his AFK message indicated that the human Rage had just popped, and he was getting people there as fast as he could.<br><br>I of course jumped on the bandwagon, tickled to be able to see the kill go down and see Stumpp get his epic .. I headed there with three other peeps from CT to help out, and we got there within about 10 minutes.  By the time we got there, AA had started kiting the human.<br><br>I am with you Seke, on this one .. not blaming anyone, gratz to whomever, yada yada.  I guess I took that as a learning experience, and made a note to myself to be darned sure that as soon as the human Rage pops to have a kiter on him immediately.  I too would never have considered that until after yesterday.<br><br>I guess it remains to be seen as to how the population of Drinal will handle this.   On the one hand, it's good that it's no longer linked to the Naggie kill.   On the other .. well .. unless people respect a shout or /ooc from the person camping Rage at that moment, it will be a race every time.  I'm not looking forward to it at all.    <p>- Ceny<BR>Norrathian Grape of Crimson Twilight, Drinal<BR>Midgard Healer of  Encroaching Void, Morgan Le Fay  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uasanti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asanti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 9:31:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Ragefire...bleh</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the response, Seke.

Getting my epic is not something I MUST have tomorrow or I'll just die!!  I would rather wait my turn and have it uncontested, but I just can't imagine everyone sticking with the rotation agreement.

We all know how important cleric epics are to what our guilds can do.  I am very thankful that Unconquered has 2 cleric epics and a very good friend with a cleric epic as well, that we obtained before VI decided to make Sev2.  I feel a lot worse for guilds trying to obtain their first cleric epics, and especially, the smaller guilds on the server.<br><br>I can say, for one, if I am online, and I find Unconquered in the same position Arcane Asylum found themselves in yesterday, I will not issue a &quot;go&quot; order for my guild to engage Ragefire.  I personnally will try to respect a cleric's right to sit in Skyfire for 2-3 days straight waiting for this spawn.  <br><br>I just wish we could find a better solution.  But there will always be someone who won't follow the path everyone else chooses, and that will put us right back where we started.  <br><br>I think Basenji's suggestion is a decent one.  If someone is kiting Zord, and their guild is arriving, I would hope most people would at least have the decency to respect that, and give the relevant cleric time to assemble his guild/friends.  And no, this won't prevent some other guild from gating in, seeing a single guy kiting Zord and saying &quot;screw him, we have the people here, he doesn't&quot; and VI saying &quot;nothing wrong with that&quot;...but I think that's the least degree of decency we should be able to expect from each other.  It at least gives the cleric some opportunity to put the effort in to watch for Ragefire's spawn, and then hopefully have a kiter alt/friend/2nd acct to occupy Rage while their guild arrived.  <br><br>Thus, yielding a reward for putting the time in to watch for the spawn.  Nothing is worse than spending hours/days camping a spawn only to get nothing for it.  I've been on 2 Ragefire camps that went past 40 hours only have to have a server rest (in SolB) ... believe me, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for a while.<br><br>Seke <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ufolokthedwarf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Folok the Dwarf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cool d00d</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/02 6:33:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /shrug</span><hr size=1> dont forget, SF is not Solb.

Unconquered from the beginning was seeing the new rage as a camp just like the old one.  From a post i went back and looked at on our boards, from the beginning we were looking at him as a Sev camp, one of the reasons we never bothered posting the famous sleeping monk, like we've done in the past.  We have had druids (Qtea, Casidy, and a few others) make regular passes between there and EJ to look for him on track (it wasn't an accident that he was spotted so quickly by one of our druids).<br><br>What the end product was:  2 guilds who had camped a mob in 2 completely different ways under different assumptions.<br><br>Frankly i don't like either of the options:<br>With doing it the old style, what ends up happening?   a monk is sitting there and as soon as one rage goes down FD's, and claims next spawn?  What happens when 2 3 or 4 guilds have monks there just waiting to FD?  It's not like the old style where there may be a naggy there between em, or you have to work through FG's and a zone of annoying greens to get to the spot to lay the claim.<br><br>With the option we used.....ick.  I've never liked the PNP rules as they are.  I despise the sev camp and all that it's about, and this one (even if we did &quot;win&quot;-a term i lightly use-) is no exception.  We have adapted to them, and do work by them, they are the rules weather we like them or not.<br><br>AA a few months ago came to fully embrace the PNP rules a few months ago, not out of like for them, but out of need.  On several raids we lost out on because we tried to do the &quot;nice&quot; thing and let those who were gathering first go ahead, then we were loosing out because we were starting a raid first and someone else mobilized faster than we did.  Basically we were loosing out all around from trying to work with the &quot;honor&quot; system.  It came down to either loosing out all around, or embracing the system that goes by the rules.<br><br>With this new spawn, it's a bit worse than Sev........   just aggroing sev and leading him around the zone on a leash is not the easiest of tasks LOL.   Rage in human form however is pretty easy.  So, just like the group of FDing monks stated above, It can turn into the group of bards/druids/rangers just standing by the spawn hoping to grab his attention first.  THEN i see more arguements popping about who has forces to take him down first after all, it isn't JUST about aggro but who can do it as well............  I forsee many more ugly situations comming out of this, a lot of grief and heartache.  Hope i'm wrong, but i don't think so.<br><br>With Respect and Regards;<br>Astpahs Vorn`Sharrek<br>55th circle Beguiler of Erudin<br>Member of Arcane Asylum <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2388.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2388.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2388.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2388.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=2388.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2388.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2388.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm28">General<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
