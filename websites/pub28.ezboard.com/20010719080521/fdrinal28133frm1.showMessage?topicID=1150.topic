                             CS gets pissed! Sweet!<br>
<br>
                          I hope that if they don't want to share spawns, that this<br>
                          lights a fire under our ass. Been waiting for some<br>
                          competition.<br>
<br>
                          So, don't flame them, don't do anything. Let your<br>
                          actions speak for you. Beat them to the first few<br>
                          spawns, and they'll be whining for mercy!<br>
<br>
                          Kinda reminds me of the US before WWI, when the<br>
                          economy(guild moral) was stagnent. Then after they<br>
                          found a common goal(the war), everything turned<br>
                          around =).<br>
<br>
                          Keep your cool. Remember, they have 2x the members<br>
                          we do, and you know how difficult it is to get started<br>
                          with everyone we have sometimes. its 2x as bad for<br>
                          them. Devatar watched them try to go from Cobalt Scar<br>
                          to Western Wastes, and it took them near 4-5 hours.<br>
                          they had their gaters logging, doing something else, etc.<br>
                          They have one CoH person, which means we must use<br>
                          that to our advantage. We start asap, then CoH the<br>
                          rest. I hope our mages take matters into their own<br>
                          hands when doing this, you guys can do it =).<br>
<br>
                          CS was formed over loot, much like we started, but WE<br>
                          are more then that now; they are not. Beat them to a<br>
                          few spawns, and you break their back, k.<br>
<br>
<br>
                          Gonna need total guild motivation and drive to want to<br>
                          beat them. Well see how we do =)<br>

                          I agree with Qalar 100%. Clan Skalagrim doesn't even<br>
                          compare to us. They got this success almost over night<br>
                          right after they decided to recruit anyone 50+ and<br>
                          unguilded. We killed Trak with what 36 last time? They<br>
                          are still bringing like 80 to down him. I was readin on<br>
                          there forum the other day, and they were talking about<br>
                          how they needed 60 people just to kill CT, i am<br>
                          impressed. We just need to get our butts in gear, and<br>
                          they will be asking us every time they want to kill an<br>
                          uber mob.<br>
<br>
                          Just my opinion, but i think most will agree<br>
<br>
                          *edit* and i remember here about a week ago when i<br>
                          got killed in Karnors by a CS train ( I know Terok<br>
                          remembers) when they came in mass to kill VS. Now a<br>
                          good guild has to be smart enough to realize if a mob is<br>
                          even up before they swarm to the zone. Needless to say<br>
                          VS was NOT up at this time. /cheer CS. Thanks, death<br>
                          to a naked corspe because of your incompitence... <br>

                          does turn into CS/Cat race war all the other guilds who<br>
                          can kill or want to try those 2 ubermobs gona be left<br>

                          I agree with Q that this could be the kick in the ass we<br>
                          need.... a little competition is always fun and its just<br>
                          what we need right now.<br>
<br>
                          But we also can't forget that our numbers have depleted<br>
                          drastically lately.<br>
<br>
                          The casualties: powan, drexen, marc, ananael,<br>
                          daysprung, renkey, neuania, spleefa, lola, gallsurses,<br>
                          twig, bakkoneth, aady, fiver, herbal, beebela, carlon,<br>
                          shryke.... and others i'm sure i've missed.<br>
<br>
                          That's a huge chunk right there, most noticably 3 level<br>
                          60 wizards.... I know we've added a few here and there<br>
                          but not nearly enough to offset those losses.<br>
<br>
                          Gid<br>

I know im totally in the wrong but the game has just become so much of a joke lately and these supposed conflicts over a game are insane.

<br>
one we don't NEED more then 36 to kill trak we have done it with 36 and only 2 deaths.<br>
<br>
Two we dont NEED more then 18 to kill cazic.<br>
<br>
we take that many with us because as a guild we feel its our responsibility to let other guild members who are wanting to go go.<br>
<br>
When was the last time cih rushed trak with 3 or 4 juggs still up in his lair like we do when we have those kinds of numbers ;) ?.<br>
<br>
We dont do it out of any need or because we  have to have that many.<br>
<br>
When you start saying sorry you can't go you get people who are upset within the ranks.<br>
<br>
 cs works like a family not like a dictatorship.<br>
<br>
How many people have left cih in the last 2 months ?&gt; how many SENIOR people have?<br>
powan, drexen, marc, ananael,<br>
daysprung, renkey, neuania, spleefa, lola, gallsurses,<br>
twig, bakkoneth, aady, fiver, herbal, beebela, carlon,<br>
shryke<br>
<br>
You wont see that with cs becuase we are just that a family.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly this is not a war this is simple fact that we got tired of trying to be respectfull with a guild who would shout obscenties about us in /ooc<br>
<br>
So we shall respect any reservations if notified by the other guilds.<br>
<br>
Cih has however lost our respect.<br>

Hooked on Phonics must be paying off.  Thogg says &quot;I have killed the queen 3 times&quot;  &quot;It only takes 18 people to kill the queen&quot; refering to Chardok of course.  However Thogg is still without his warrior partical weapon, provacative. Oh! But that must because CiH went and screwed up your wedding day in Plane of Sky. Thogg will lie about the Queen just to try and make us look bad, He posted on the flame board for this server that he could do Chardok with 18 people, then when we kill the queen and Wuden gets his FA, we say we did it with 30, Thogg responds &quot;We can do it with 24.&quot;  Contradiction in numbers there, i think.  Thogg caught in a lie to make himself look better then us, impressive Why not lie about everything else to make himself look good.  We can kill Trakanon with 32 people and have 4 juggs on us at the same time.  Somehow i find that hard to believe.  <br>
<br>
Why don't you stop trying to impress everyone, because no one cares who you are, what you do, or even what you think.  I know i couldn't care any less.  Go add onto your 10+ hours a day of play time, and your 240+ hours of total play time, prolly at over 300 now.  And continue with your experience in Plane of Hate/Fear that puts everyone in our guild to shame.

so how exactly were you going to finish your FA that night the queen blade got ninja'd from you if you didn't have a spiroc blade yet?<br>

and if you did in fact have a spiroc blade that night, why were you so incredibly pissed off many many weeks later when CiH was on spiroc island the day you wanted to be there, cause it sure as hell wasn't just cause of your wedding.<br>

Once again no one is impressed.  When are you going to learn to shut your mouth?  I wish the CiH message board hadn't been changed or i would put a quote from it in this post here.  You did in fact say you could do the Queen with only 18. That would have been shortly after the Drinal opened, and CiH turned you down for acceptance.  As for CAZIC...what does that have to do with anything?<br>
