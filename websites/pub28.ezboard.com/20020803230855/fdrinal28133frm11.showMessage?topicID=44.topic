Tumpy sat on a medium sized log munching on his loaf of bread and water he had foraged himself earlier, the little halfling had only heard of this mystical land of Kunark until now, he was finally here, looking upon the shores leading to Antonica, his home continent.  Tumpy was beginning to think Tunare's presence was more gracious than in Rivervale and began to wonder when his delicate train of thought was interupted by a rustle in the bushes.... &quot;Who's there?&quot;, Tumpy sternly voiced, while his hand reached for the worn leather holster which held his dagger at his side.  A lizard walking erect, almost twice Tumpy's size emerged with a startled expression on his face voicing the very distorted words of, &quot;Greetingsssss.&quot;  Tumpy was still alarmed but to a minute extent compared to just a moment earlier, while straightening up and trying to look as brave as possible, Tumpy relaxed and said to the lizardman, &quot;Hail, I am a weary traveler who is stopping for a rest, I mean no harm and I just wish to seek Kunark's beauty and Tunare's presence here.&quot;  The lizard looked very amused at the foreign traveler and responded by saying, &quot;As i mean no harm to you&quot;, as he finished his statement he sat on the log which Tumpy had previously been sitting on.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy relaxed and sat down, relishing in his meal once more.  There was an uneasy pause as the lizardman sized up Tumpy.<br>
&quot;May I sssssssshare your meal?&quot; the lizard asked very politely.<br>
Tumpy, while munching on his meal, thought a moment and replied, &quot;Of course, as long as you will promise to tell me of Kunark.&quot;<br>
The lizardman nodded that he would, and reached his scaly hand twoards a slice of Tumpy's bread.  Tumpy noticed a deep scar in the flesh of the lizard's hand, and shot a curious glance to the lizard.  &quot;That wassss from the brawl,&quot; the lizard replied to Tumpy's glance, he went on by saying, &quot;I will tell you more after we finish the meal.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy's eyebrows deepened in concentration as he ate his meal, he wondered who the lizard was, and if Tumpy could trust the lizard, after all..he was &quot;one of them&quot;.  The lizardman took a sip of water and wiped his mouth with his arm, and leaned back and stared at the now risen moon.  Tumpy did the same, and the lizard began his tale.  &quot;I,&quot; said he, &quot;am an iksar, we are a lizardman race that were enslaved....we hated the treatment so much we overthrew our enslavers, and began the cruel practice to all other races.&quot; Tumpy looked frightened for a moment, but the iksar reassured him by telling him, &quot;I do not agree with  our ways, I was banished because of that, and acquired these wounds from a brawl to save my life.&quot;<br>
Tumpy mused to himself, &quot;I suppose I can trust this fellow, but I do not know to what extent, for now he would make a great travel companion.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The iksar went on, &quot;I am an outlaw..i wander this continent in search of others like me,&quot; the iksar removed his worn cloak showing a scaly back which was weather beaten and strengthened by many-a-walk.  &quot;However many years it has been since I was banished, I do not know...I think this is enough to tell for now, Kunark is a hard story to tell.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy was rather disappointed by the tale ending here but he decided to tell the iksar why he himself was here.  Tumpy revealed a tiny pouch from which he took out a bottle of Tumpy's Tonic....for which he was famous for making, he passed it to the iksar who readily refused.  Shrugging Tumpy began, &quot;I am from Antonica, a town of Rivervale, I was sent here by my lust to find Tunare's beauty everywhere I go.  I was transported here by my own will, to this very spot which I was observing the beautiful sunset when you startled me.&quot;<br>
&quot;I, like you would love to travel Kunark, would you come along with me?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The iksar mused for a moment...and replied, &quot;Aye, I'd love to, I am a monk, and my name is,&quot; he paused, &quot;Plango&quot;.  Tumpy relinquished his name to Plango and also his class, being a druid Tumpy rarely slept in shelter, which was a good thing because Plango didn't do that much either.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two carried on a conversation in which Tumpy told of Antonica and Plango told of Kunark, late until the wee hours of the morning.  The pair were both growing tired so Plango curled up at the base of the log and Tumpy on top of the log, and they fell asleep watching the stars.  The next morning Tumpy was awakened to an intense heat.  &quot;Good morning Tumpy, I have caught fissssh for breakfast,&quot; dangling over the intense heat, which was a fire, were two very large trout, a feast for Trumpy and Plango.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two ate, and Plango jeered Tumpy of his hairy feet.  Tumpy had heard this many times, and was having a good time joking of Plango's scaly hide.  By the time the two had finished breakfast Tumpy guessed it was around 10 A.M, and the golden sun was high in the sky.  Turning to Plango, Tumpy asked, &quot;I suppose you can sense where we are heading?&quot; while saying this Tumpy looked down at his cracked compass which was no longer in service to him, Plango snickered and replied, &quot;Of courssssssse, now lets go.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The odd couple marched on for what seemed to be an eternity to Tumpy, when he finally asked the question, &quot;Are we lost?&quot;  Plango, looking merely annoyed, snapped back, &quot;We are only losssst if you think we are losssst.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy had to laugh at this notion, which brought the iksar to a halt, he sat down on a mossy rock near where the two were standing and began to munch on the leftovers of their feast from breakfast.  Tumpy reluctantly sat down with Plango and pulled out his tonic from &quot;grandpas old cough medicine bottle&quot; and took a swig.  The two never noticed the stealthy footsteps of a third traveler behind them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hail, I am Thorgrym, I come from the kingdoms of Antonica, in search to destroy all evil.&quot; Plango looked tense as the knight went on, &quot;Stand aside halfling, while I do away with this stingy iksar.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy had been in this kind of situation before, so with a smug look on face, he went on to say, &quot;Sir knight, why not have a drink before you wallow in your victory over this powerless iksar.&quot;  Plango shot Tumpy a mean glare but Tumpy only replied with a wink.  Tumpy got out two mugs from his satchel and offered one to the knight.  Tumpy poured himself a glass, and secretly placed a small object into the bottle, then he poured the contents of the bottle into the knight's cup.  The knight thanked Tumpy, &quot;Thank you, it shall be my honor to save you from this filthy iksar.&quot;  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy suggested then sing a song, so Tumpy started out with his favorite drinking song, the knight become increasingly subdued and finally slumped over onto the lush green grass. &quot;Tumpy i cannot repay you other than to ask you the question of; where did you learn to do that trick?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy laughed and replied, &quot;I own a bar, I've had to settle quite a few disputes and arguements this way, he will be out cold for the next few hours.  Tumpy beckened to Plango, and Plango soon followed.  Plango took the lead, naturally, being of his scaly descent, he was the only one in the party that COULD lead.  Plango was leading him to his favorite spot, the ruins of Riptide.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pair passed by grand lake and azure skies of many moons, Tumpy couldn't help but ask, &quot;Where are we going to that takes so bloody long my friend?&quot;<br>
Shooting back, the lizard said, &quot;We shall see, we shall see....&quot;.  This quite frankly made Tumpy very doubtful of his new found friend's leading abilities, but remembering he couldn't lead anyone out of a wet paper bag, he decided to pipe down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lakes continued passing by, as did the sun, the moon, the rain, the cold....Tumpy appeared to have aged some as the pair went on in the journey, but Plango did not.  The tall glistening lizard was as strong as ever, and emotionally stable as ever.  On the 9th day of their journey, right before dawn, the two heard footsteps.  Thump........Thump.........Thump......<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thump......Thump.......Thump<br>
Thump.....Thump.......Thump&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It appeared to Tumpy as if someone had been following them, and continued to do so cautiously.  Plango's keen eyes squinted, as if searching far off to the lands from which Tumpy hailed from.  Drawing a small dagger, Plango crouched into a position, his legs tense as ever, preparing to lunge.  A golden voice sang out, <br>
&quot;Oh from the lands of Halas,<br>
To the shining seas,<br>
He comes to bear the burdons,<br>
Of exiles and refugees.<br>
<br>
His name is Plango,<br>
He hails from the north,<br>
He goes about his business,<br>
Of the rations given, he always took a fourth.<br>
<br>
This stranger,<br>
To whom none know,<br>
Has broken many hearts,<br>
And has never gone letting others be foe.<br>
<br>
He fought great evil,<br>
And came to our defense,<br>
In the golden lands of Perth,<br>
And made evil repense!<br>
<br>
This stranger has traveled far and wide,<br>
To help make amends,<br>
For foolish kings, with their iron rings,<br>
Who meddeled in things, and come to their defense.<br>
<br>
Among the sick and dead,<br>
He has walked,<br>
The lands of all he has touched,<br>
Of there he is always talked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost as if he had been sleeping earlier, Tumpy awoke to a start.  Plango was seated in a more relaxed position, and had sheathed his dagger.  Tumpy hadn't even pulled out his own, he felt like a fool!  Sitting cross legged, Tumpy awaited to view the owner of the voice who had bewitched him with her lyrics.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Out of the brush emerged a slender beauty.  Her hair was a deep brown, and her eyes a burning fire within her.  She fixated the orbs of flame onto Tumpy, and then Plango.  Her garments were of royalty, a deep purple clad on burning red.  On her back rested a cape, and in her hand glowed an oaken staff.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Plango rising, greeted the vixen with a graceful tone, &quot;My lady, you speak of events past, I do not wish to go to the times of fallen kings, for these dark times do reflect more of me than the golden age.&quot;  These words struck Tumpy, for the little halfling had never known the world off the only place he knew, Antonica, shocked and amazed he listened on as the lady in arms mouthed, &quot;Plango, tis you and shall always be you, but I know where you go, and the ruins of Riptide are not safe.  A great evil has beseeched Kunark, and will not let go.  I myself have seen it, many orcs, demons, devils, and necromancers cover the land.  You yourself are within a days march of an orcish dwelling.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Plango looking annoyed, &quot;Fair lady, what i know you know, and you know i know.  I plan to go to the ruins of Riptide whoever and whatever might occupy it at the moment.  My party member,&quot; he motioned to Tumpy, who grinned slightly, &quot;has travelled far less than I, and i find it wise that he should have the liberty of doing so.  There are many things on this earth that are mysterious to all of us, but much more to one of such stature.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman glanced at Plango, as if in pain.  The sun behind her slowly climbed over the glorious hilltops, painting the sky a reddish hue.  She studied Tumpy for a long time, and during this time Tumpy couldn't help but to do the same.  Squinting because of the sun, he darted his eyes this way and that, straining them as if he could see through her.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He does not seem ready for such a journey, are you sure this is wise Plango?&quot;.  In a cryptic tone Plango replied, &quot;Aye, tis risky, but he has a spirit that remains unbroken,&quot;.  Tumpy pondered this, wondering what the bloody devil this meant.  &quot;For that I have come to warn you, but as you have defied me before, I shall let you defy me again.  Bring this halfling to the enemy lands, so be it.&quot;  The elf, as Tumpy later learned, turned her cape, and chanting mythical tones she suddenly dissappeared.  An aurora surrounded the area, and soon all was quiet.  Having rested not for the past two days, Tumpy suggested that they sleep.  &quot;All right, but I want to make good time before winter sets in, tis the fall and we shouldn't be caught in the field of bone during winter.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy set down his small self with his backpack as his headrest.  Plango fixated his dark eyes on the horizon, taking in the morning light.  No sooner had he laid down his weary head, Tumpy had awoken.  It seemed that he had slept a good while, for the sun was in the west.  Plango smiled as he motioned for Tumpy to join him.  A fire had been lit, and apparently to Tumpy it seemed as if it had been going for a long while.  Tumpy had to recollect himself before he could join Plango.  Tumpy yawned, stretched, and thought to himself, &quot;Many a journey have I gone on, but none as mysterious as this one.  Here i am in the middle of no where, going to somewhere i dont know with someone i met less than a fortnight ago, Tumpy Irontoe, when you get back from this one you have to settle down.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Impatiently, Plango almost dragged Tumpy to a nearby rock.  Plango's weatherbeaten face suddenly lit up, as he motioned to a large stack of provisions.  &quot;Tis our luck, a caravan heading to the Overthere passed by, and gladly took some of your leftover ale for what you see here.&quot; Slightly put off, Tumpy sighed, after all, he had no more ale.  Plango looked confused, but soon realized, &quot;If you are worried about ale, do not worry, there is plenty in the stack, but not as high quality as yours, said the caravan leader himself.  I will now don a pack also, for this is plenty for our journey, and we cannot spare any behind.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy had noticed the vegetation had thinned on his journey to the ruins of Riptide, but since it was night when they camped, he now realized how sparsely the area was graced with Tunare's presence.  Few plants were to be seen, and Tumpy almost weeped, for a place without greenery is a place without friends.  &quot;Plango,&quot; the lizard turned to his short friend, &quot;why is there no vegetation here?&quot;.  The lizard cooly explained, &quot;The ruins of riptide is a barren place, and expect there to be less and less greens...it was ravaged by the evil of Valindor, long ago.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy nodded, out of half interest, half disgust.  &quot;We should get going, this area will not be safe soon&quot;.  Tumpy digested the thought of another person around them while looking into the cobalt sky....&quot;Why, there can't be another person around here for ----&quot; He never got to finish the sentence.  A blackened arrow landed less than a furlong away from him.  Startled, Tumpy jumped back.  Plango rose and donned his pack, as he had promised earlier, and motioned to Tumpy.  &quot;Quickly, this way!&quot;  The pair fled from the pursuers, running northwards, or as far as Tumpy could tell.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Their pursuers, Tumpy could tell between glances, were orcs.  The foul creatures, green skinned and ruthless, were not kindly to anyone not of their race, and sometimes even that was not true.  They quarreled often, and it was no surprise when an orc killed a kinsman.  Under the sizzling sun, the hunters and the hunted trudged.  At a blazing speed Plango ran, and if Tumpy had not been a wanderer himself, he probably would not have been able to keep up.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tumpy's keen ears would catch the sound of water now and then, but he thought maybe it could have been the clanking of the armor on the orcs, the foul beasts.... &quot;Quickly, faster, faster&quot; exclaimed Plango, as he veered off to the left.  Tumpy followed, and was quickly aghast.  The slender lizard had suddenly jumped, right off the edge of an unseen cliff!  Tumpy stopped, and peered over the precipice...he soon learned why.  Underfoot was a gorge, with a roaring river going down the center.  As if he were praying, Tumpy soon followed his taller friend, right into the ravine.  Before he could utter a scream, Tumpy felt the cold knock the wind out of him.  Gasping for air he broke the surface and breathed easily.  The current was strong, and almost too strong for Plango.  Plango was about 10 meters ahead, and kicking wildly to the left..... Tumpy employed his swimming skills and managed to follow Plango's course, and with Plango's assistance he was pulled out of the river.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ahhh, as I said before, we need to hurry.  Orcs cannot swim, but they can call for friends.&quot;  Realizing that there were probably more on the other side of the river, Tumpy relented all speed to Plango's directions.  They trekked down the dusty riverbank until nightfall.  Plango instructed Tumpy to make a dim fire, but to conceal it with whatever was at hand.  Plango disappeared into the night, and did not return for hours.  Tumpy had improvised a shelter for his fire with sticks he found in the riverbed.  <br>
<br>
