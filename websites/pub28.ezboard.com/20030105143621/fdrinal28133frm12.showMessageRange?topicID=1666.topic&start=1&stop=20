<br>
Racism:<br>
<br>
It does exist.  OMFG.  People are...RACIST.  Some people don't like rednecks, some don't like Jews, some don't like blacks, some don't like asians.  Popular words like ch1nk, n1gger, and inbred are slanderist (Actually, on a board it's libel, but you know what I mean).  OMFG!  He's making fun of my race!  Seriously, people make fun of your glasses, the way you talk, the color of your hair, the way you walk, and the amount of brainpower you were born with.  Things that you do, because that's who you are.  Well, the color of your skin, and the way you were formed at birth are who you are too.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Offensive Sigs:<br>
<br>
Come on.  You must be fucking kidding me.  A Hitler sig is offensive?  What the fuck?  I hate to break it to all you fucktards out there that think the 3rd Riech(sp?) is dead, but NAZI's DO EXIST STILL.  I've seen parades, I've seen demostrations, and it's all legal and all that.  I'm sure parading in a Jewish section of town (I cannot remember the name of the case, but it was in Chicago) was incredibly offensive, but it was LEGAL and perfectly within their RIGHTS.<br>
<br>
<br>
The point is simple.  This is the internet.  A virtual world.  Something that doesn't exist.  Of ALL places, a FLAMEBOARD, a place created for people to lose their temper, and say whatever the fuck they feel like.  A place for people to hash out differences or just call each other names.  But whether you like it or not, it's all just a BIG JOKE.  It's all in fun.  Kall's sig says it best.  All posts here are a big fucking joke.  If you don't think that, take a spoon and eat his ass.<br>
<br>
Seriously.  I've got plenty of arabian friends, and asians, and blacks.  They understand when one of us calls the other a slang term (Wow, so PC..), that it's just a joke.<br>
<br>
What's really lame is I wrote this post using the words you'd all claim are so incredibly offensive.  It edits them out with that @#$% shit.  That's lame that you can have stuff like cock-sucking cum guzzling lesbian gang-bang slut all over, but not something racially slanderous (Or again, libelous).<br>
<br>
So please.  What the fuck is with you people and your &quot;OMG!  Hilter calling an asian a ch1nk!  How offensive!&quot;  If we can talk about people fucking each other in the ass, or the kind of sexual stuff that's tossed around, then these 2 topics should be open too.<br>
<br>
And Elaylie, you've been gone too long.  I personally want to see YOUR opinion on this, because of the above stickied post. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It does exist. OMFG. People are...RACIST.

<br>
First, you are correct.  Racism does exist.  People will always believe they are better then someone else because they think their race/ethnic background is better.  Calling someone a redneck (it's not a race of people, it's a social class) isn't racism, it's prejudice.  Making fun of someone who wears glasses isn't racism, it's teasing.  Making fun of the way someone talks, walks, the clothes they wear, the music the listen to isn't racism, it's teasing (Understand that you can make it racist, that's easy enough, just add one of Ish's colorful metaphors to the end of the sentance).  Making fun of a person, is limited to that person.  The offence is direct and limited to the indiviual.  There is no need to infer what was meant, you are ugly because you wear glasses.  Ish is gay because he sucks dick.  Direct offence.<br>
<br>
In this instance, it's not the image of the Hitler Hummel that is the issue, it's what is implied.  You look at the picture and say, &quot;hey, a little boy painted that way with his hand up, I am not offended.&quot;  But you can't possibly fathom what that same image may mean to another person, you can't possibly know what is implied by that image unless you look beyond your sphere of infuence and try to put yourself in someone else's shoes.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I also have friends who are from Africa, and China, and other places.  Even if they approved of it, I wouldn't call them a @#%$, or a @#%$, or a @#%$, or whatever.  It's really derrogatory, and shows that I have no respect for them or their heritage.  If they wish to call themselves by these names, so be it.<br>
<br>
By putting things like the Hummel Hitler up, you are saying that not only do you find the whole idea of Hitler and his beliefs funny, but you also have no respect for those people who innocently lost their lives at this hand.  People were put into ovens, buried alive, gassed.  Children watched as parents and other relatives disapeared, parents had to send children to their deaths.  That's not funny.  Jokes about it may make you giggle, but the realty of the situation will make you cry everytime.  That joke isn't so funny when you see the pictures of emaciated children, and mass graves, and the oven where the genocide that Hitler promoted took place.  Not so funny then.<br>
<br>
That little picture may not mean anything to you, but it may be the manifestation of the people who wiped out an entire generation of people, and may represent a lot of pain and suffering.  That is the same thing with the N word.  Means nothing to you, you're white.  Might mean something more to someone with a direct link to the situation.<br>
<br>
What pisses me off, is that a person may have the balls to post that crap in a nameless and faceless environment, but let's put them in a room filled with holocaust survivors and their families.  Now, let's see them take out that picutre of the Hitler Hummel and show it to those people...Think it would happen??  I don't.<br>
<br>
Second,<br>

Once again, I agree with you.  As an American you DO have the right to say what you want, when you want, and to whom you want.  But just because you CAN do a thing, doesn't mean you SHOULD do that thing.<br>
<br>
Posting the Hummel Hitler wasn't a racist move.  It was done in poor taste, and completely tactless.  That's not against the law, just a bad judgement call by the poster.<br>
<br>
If we started editing tactless and tasteless posts, the flame section would be empty.  I am guilty of this offence.<br>
<br>
I don't like the Hummel Hitler, but if you start editing there then you have to begin systematically removing everything that offends a person.  Then no one can say anything, because everything you say and do offends someone.<br>
<br>
Protection from being offended isn't in the Constitution or in the Bill of Rights.  Take the image for what it is.  A picture posted by an immature person who was more interested in a reaction, than intentional offence.<br>

Just goes to show you there's a first time for everything.<br>
<br>
On the topic at hand, however, I could post links to tons of threads that insulted me. Whether it be my religious beliefs, my political views, my racial heritage, whatever... I could search these boards and find people who have posted offensive pictures or words on any personal front. Sorbital's post sums up an important point though, (I can't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>believe</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I just typed that) and that is, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just because a person <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> say something, it doesn't mean that they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>should</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The reverse is also true, however.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just because a person <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>shouldn't</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> say something offensive, it doesn't mean that they are not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>allowed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do so</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Granted, these boards are moderated by people who are doing their best, but censorship is a very difficult thing to be fair about.<br>
<br>
For example, let's say I'm a devout Catholic (I'm not, so it's easy to just say stuff about it in a what-if). We'll pretend that I go to mass every day, believe exclusively in creation over evolution, and I never swear (What I'm doing on the flame boards, I don't know. Just bear with me). Let's also throw in that I'm Oriental (Why not?).<br>
<br>
Okay, so I'm cruising these boards and I see someone who just starts flaming me and calls me a &quot;F$*#ing Stupid Ch%#k&quot;, and goes on about how moronic I am for believing in a worldview that &quot;flies in the face of science&quot; or whatever.<br>
<br>
First of all, this person posting, regardless of his ISP and username, is essentially anonymous. He can post without fear, because his phone number, social security number, address, and real name are not likely to be layed out there in the open. I can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>garuantee</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you that people are much more likely to use a racial slur or a personal attack on the internet than in person. The reason is obvious - The person can't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>kick you in the neck</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> over the internet. Some would say that this is a reason for censorship on the net. People can get away with saying awful things without censorship.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>OF COURSE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they can get away with saying awful things! That's the whole point! That's why people come to this board in the first place... either to post angry messages, or respond to angry messages, or just to read angry messages and be entertained! If I am the person described above and someone walks up to me in a store and calls me something terrible, it's dramatically different than here.<br>
<br>
The person who posts something that is religiously or racially offensive should have the right to do so, if only so that the people who are offended by it have the opportunity to take note. Personally, I would prefer not to group in-game with a person who thinks my race is inferior to theirs (Of course I'm talking about RL race here, not Dwarves vs Gnomes). The people who post offensive things and are immediately censored/edited are being stripped of the consequences of their actions. Sure, we can all usually guess what the content of offensive_photo_01 was, but I didn't come to these boards expecting to be showered with flower petals and asked to share in a cup of tea with Strawberry Shortcake. I came here to read up on the issues that are pissing people off - maybe post an issue of my own. If the issue at hand is a racist signature, I want to see it and decide what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> think.<br>
<br>
In closing, I know this is a touchy subject. There are those who will say that by defending the rights of a racist poster, I am defending their viewpoint. To those people, there is nothing I can say that will convince you otherwise. Just know that by censoring people who say terrible things, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>give</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> them power. If another person can say or post something that offends you so much that it must be deleted for you to enjoy the board, then that person is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>truly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the one who controls the board and all who read it.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.bjmay.com/images/Sinead_sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
