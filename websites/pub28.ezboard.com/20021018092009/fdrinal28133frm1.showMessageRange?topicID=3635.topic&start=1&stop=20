So tonight I'm driving around with 4 other friends in the car, and we decide to go past the movie theatre to see if anyone we know is around.  We go by, no one's there, so I turn around to go back home.  As I'm going past again, my friend, unbeknownst to me, opens the car door and hangs out and screaming jibberish--as a joke I guess but I had no idea he was doing it, he was sitting directly behind me.  Three seconds later a cop (who appeared to be vertical to us and had no idea of our speed) pulls me over and takes my license and registration and says that 'I was reckless driving and that I'm fully responsible for the person hanging out the car'.  He gives me a 300 dollar fine, and I get a citation for reckless driving in which he says I will most likely have my license suspended for 6 months.  On the citation sheet he claims I also ecelerated the speed limit of the parking lot, and yes, he spelled it ecelerated.  I know for a fact I went 28 miles per hour and that the parking lot speed limit is 25--but I also know from his position there was no way he could have calculated that difference as there was no radar or anything.  I was wondering if this was a just move on the cop's part?  I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I just don't know the legality concerning driver's responsibility to the actions of other persons in the car that he was unaware of.  I live in Pennsylvania so the laws may be different, and I'm 16 so maybe he was just targetting me because I was young--but I don't believe a 6 month suspension is necessary.  Oh well, please reply if you have anything concerning the issue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

IE-if a cop pulls you over and your buddy isn't wearing a seat belt, you BOTH get a ticket.../shrug<br>
<br>
Next time a cop wants to give you a speeding ticket and you know you weren't speeding or at least are sure he didn't get you on radar, ask to see the gun reading...if they can't produce it, the ticket won't stick.<br>
<br>
And the advice of bringing a parent and/or lawyer along (preferably both) to your court date was pretty solid...chances are pretty decent you'll get out of the ticket if you show maturity and enough responsibility to show up with at least a parent to argue for you with the judge/DA. Show up in a dress shirt/slacks/dress shows/tie. Consider a sports coat as well. Yeah, it does make a difference...I've sat in traffic court and watched little Timmy in his ripped up Metallica T-shirt and dirty jeans get $150 + driving school while I get a &quot;bad boy, don't do it again&quot; probation, and I was going faster. Attitude and appearance mean alot in traffic court, especially when you're under 20. <p><table border=1>

Reckless Driving means that something reckless was happening with your vehicle while you were driving (sorry dont mean to sound condescending).  Contest the ticket and bring your parent(s), the guys with you in the car and if there are any other reliable witnesses in the area.  Technically if the cop does not show, the ticket should be dismissed.  Be prepared for him to show up.  Also, if he does not show, be prepared for the judge to schedule another date for the hearing.  Speak only when spoken too, be clear, concise and make sure you have your story straight.  No aberrations, exagerations, etc.  Most likely you wont get entirely off the hook, however if this was your first offense the judge will most likey show some mercy and reduce it with no suspension.  The reason I say bring your friends that were with you is that if he shows that he knows what he did was idiotic and you had nothing to do with his actions, it may go better on you.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>

<br>
A couple of tips.<br>
<br>
1) You have the right to question your accuser. Bring a list of<br>
questions to court . Try not to ask questions you don't know the<br>
answer to.<br>
<br>
Samples:<br>
(bring a large diagram of the parking lot and show which way<br>
you were driving at the time)<br>
a) What exactly did the officer see that prompted him to <br>
give you a ticket?<br>
b)Where exactly (and point to your diagram) was he positioned that he could see what happened and what direction was he facing?<br>
<br>
These kinds of questions lay a foundation of what exactly happened.<br>
<br>
2) About the approximate time that this happened, go back to the parking lot and take pictures. Lots of them. Show what the<br>
lighting was like, how dark it was etc..<br>
<br>
3) He claims you were abve the speed limit. How can he prove this? Did he have a radar unit functioning? Was he stationary or pacing you? If not, have that part of the ticket rescinded.<br>
<br>
4) Do not be afraid or nervous if you can. The system of laws is not there to intimidate you. Be brave, polite and look people in the eye.<br>
<br>
5) The suggestion of bringing witnesses is very good, but you have to make sure youi know what they will say if asked any questions. If it doesn't help your case, then don't bring them.<br>
A parent would help as well. Shows you have family support.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats what I can think of off the top of my head.<br>

You broke the law.  You got caught.<br>
<br>
Same thing happened to me when I was a nOOb driver.<br>
<br>
Friend went to grab my nipple (titty twister), and I crossed the double yellow line.  No other traffic, just my car.  Well, and the cop who was at the next light.  He pulled me over, asked for my info, told me what I did wrong, and I gave the &quot;rolling of the eyes&quot; as I turned around.<br>
<br>
He was a nice cop, explained that if I had just given him the info, and not the attitude, I would have gotten the warning.  Instead I got the 10mph over ticket, and the wreckless driving tix for crossing the line.  Told the judge what happened, I could tell he wanted to laugh when I told him about the titty twister, he said pay the speeding ticket and dropped the wreckless driving charge.  No loss of licence, just increased insurance rates.<br>
<br>
If you really hadn't been doing anything wrong, the cop would have let you go with a warning, or wouldn't have pulled you over at all.  Your buddy is a jerk, he broke the law, beat his ass.  I guarantee you mouthed off to the cop when he pulled you over, &quot;I Wasn't Speeding, I was doing 28 in a 25&quot;  or something like that, its a guaranteed ticket everytime.<br>
<br>
Future reference, &quot;Yes Sir, No Sir&quot;, &quot;here is my information Sir&quot;, these are acceptable answers to officers questions.<br>
<br>
When he pulled you over, your first comment should have been an apology for your friends action, and your friend should have apologised for being a moron.  I bet the cop would have issued you a warning and called it a night.<br>
<br>
Pay the fine, lose your licence, and learn your lesson.<br>
<br>
1) A parking lot is no place to screw around.<br>
2) You are responsible for the actions of your passengers.<br>
3) Never give a smart ass answer to a cop.<br>
<br>
Get mom and dad and the family lawyer, go to court, see the judge, pay the fine and ask that your licence not be suspended because it's your first offence.  Be sure to wear a shirt and a tie, and not sneakers.<br>
<br>
(police can issue you a ticket for speeding if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that you were.  If he gave you a ticket for going 30 miles above the limit, then he would need to produce supporting evidence.  His credibilty as a professional law enforcement official will always win out in the &quot;my word against your word&quot; scenario.) <p><img src = "http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/newtag.gif""http://home.maine.rr.com/waassaap/New5.gif'></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujorlenrizzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jorlen Rizzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>no title</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/02 9:33:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3635.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: question about cops/law/driving</span><hr size=1> Take it to court man.

I was prepared to really contest it well in court when I got a ticket, but I decided to not risk losing the case. You can't contest the ticket and then in case you lose, say you want to go to traffic school. You have to plead no contest and then you take the traffic school. However, you can only do it once every 18 months. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukaneesh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kaneesh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>kaneesh capice Cpt.

This is what I'm hoping for, since all of my friends are chipping in for the fine I'm only paying 60 bucks, and I really don't care about that as long as I don't get my license suspended.  Only downside is the points will up my insurance rate which I currently pay for :/<br>

I think it would be very dumb to have it suspended for 6 months, for I know people who have had 3 accidents in a month (one was on my street where she swerved for no reason, hit a parked car and managed to go onto a sidewalk and plow into a shed) and she did not get any suspenson.  I also know of some dumb people who had a DUI and only got a 3 month suspension, so I think the cop was just trying to scare me with the 6 month thing.<br>

Oh and for the record, yes indeed you are responsible for others in your car. Example: I am speeding and your a passenger in my car who has a license. I get pulled over, now it is up to the officer if s/he decides to fine the driver and anyone else in the car who holds a license, at least in several states this is legal. <br>

 Besides the way the display is on radar sets you could point to a number and say thats your speed and the guy would have no idea if that was true or not. Some are labeled Target and Patrol but your not letting the guy get in the car so I doubt he would see the names. <p> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucalistheedehel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CalisTheEdehel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/02 2:38:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3635.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: question about cops/law/driving</span><hr size=1> Puh, dont listen to these fucking meathooks who are telling you to suck it up and pay it.<br>

Get a lawyer. There are always ones who guarantee to get you off, and if they dont its free.  Do everything people mentioned above to do, like take pictures, find out if stationary/moving etc.  Also, request a report on the particular radar they got you with, and when it was last serviced.  These can all help you win your case. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueqwarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQWarlord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/02 3:15:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3635.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: question about cops/law/driving</span><hr size=1> Good advice over all if your as innocent as you say and the officer was as mentally challenged as he would have to have been to act as you described.<br>

 The stuff about radar service wont do you any good though ( in Illinois anyway) because there are no mandatory service schedule. Officers calibrate them before and after every ticket with a tuning fork. So attorney asks did you calibrate before officer says yes....did you calibrate after again yes...end of records. <p> </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3635.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3635.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3635.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3635.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=3635.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3635.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3635.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
