Meneldil you just make &quot;yourself&quot; look ridiculous in this process too. I have had no reason to post other than to reply to the shit you keep stirring up. You Menedil are stirring up crap and then waiting for a response then going &quot;lets ban tat&quot;. People can see what you are doing. I would &quot;never' mark my lips &quot;never&quot; ask one of my friends to come in here and deal with this crap that you (you) have been putting me through particularly now that it has just spiraled in to a lets see how much more shit Menedil and co. can stir up game. Sorry bud, but you need to take one good long hard look in the mirror. <br>
<br>
Like hell if I will go on line tonight and tell people I know oh please go reply to Meneldil and get started in this mud slinging fest with him to humor his boredome because he spends his day hitting refresh on the web server boards to see if he got me to reply yet again (because it apparently gives him a big woody).<br>
<br>
FYI your being a technical genuis and a board jocky -should already know you don't &quot;have&quot; to hit refresh when you can just hit the subscribe button on a forum post. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/29/01 12:28:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/29/01 3:43:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I am Tat's friend<br>

<br>
Well.. I don't know her, but if I had a million people always hounding me every single day, I think I would be exactly like she is. She has tried repeatedly to make people stop and just leave her alone, but someone always has to make a thread/reply to her comments.. people like to get the last word in I guess. It's her life if she wants to play on the boards, or steal orcs in highpass from some person who is on a totally different server now.. who comes here and brings up old news like she believes someone will care and it will make Tatianae disappear... than by all means, let her do it. If you guys really want her to go away, than stop replying and making threads about her.. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is more insulting to be ignored than to be insulted.&quot; - Vdar.  <br>
<br>
So do it. All of these flame threads are childish, anyone who replies and makes a flame is being childish, weather you are 12, or 45. It does not matter. What is it really going to accomplish? Writing out a bunch of obscenities to some avatar on a screen you have never, and will never meet? It only makes YOU look like a fool.. and I am not directly flaming you Meneldil, or Tatianae, I am saying this to anyone who reads this.. so please do not think I am flaming, because that is not my intent. <br>
<br>
When you get online and are able to chat with millions of people from all over the world, there is bound to be disagrements. Personalities conflict, people are bound to argue/fight/stab each other in the back.. but honestly, can anyone give me a good reason how it helps to come here and make a /flame Soandso? Exactly.. it may help you vent.. but I know, I would rather have an argument talked out in person, rather than someone coming here and flaming me. Hell.. I'd rather have the person ignore me and never res/sow/gate/dmf/divineglory/whateverGARspellsthere are.. (etc) and leave it at that.. than have to come deal with conflict.. and I think most of you are that way. <br>
<br>
I know you all hate reading a ton of paragraphs.. but just think about it next time you make a thread saying &quot;Tat!&quot; or &quot;/flame Tat&quot;.. etc. Ask yourself:<br>
<br>
What will it really accomplish?<br>
<br>
<br>
Answer: It will only make you look like a big asshole. <br>
<br>
Meneldil, Tatianae, Boofy.. anyone who replies to this, I am not trying to flame you.. I don't even want to fight, I like you all.. so please do not think of it as that.. I am just telling you guys how I see it. <br>
<br>

Your typing sure is alot a like. So, if I am wrong, sorry. Just thought it was funny how Tatianae mentioned people making anonymous accounts to flame her.. regarding to you, and then just after you guys start fighting, isn't it ironic.. &quot;Tat plays the victim&quot; shows up. Soooooooo... any &quot;smart&quot; person would jump to Ceen as being the anonymous flamer.. which I can also understand since Ceen has a mouth of her own, and doesn't seem afraid to tell Tatianae how she really feels.. why it would would not be her.
