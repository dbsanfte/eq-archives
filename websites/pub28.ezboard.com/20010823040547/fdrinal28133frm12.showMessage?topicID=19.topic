I took a group down to the shroom king on sat sun and mon. Sat, I asked a group to join me for reets juggs. I thought it would be cool! So instead, 2 groups come down. We take 3 groups, get to reets juggs, an d whup, king spawns behind us. Get your freakin minds off king. &quot;Omg phat lewt.&quot; WEe are going to do juggs reets! Then guildmembers on the raid and break down and start arguing about experience! WTF!Of course you try and share, but you do not do so at the cost of letting mobs go down slow, we still need everyone fighting. You don't sit out because you are trying to share experience. Spoiled brats. You need to hit that fearplane wout a cleric or enchanter, and learn what teamwork , or taking it for the team is all about. Where you set your mind to a goal, and you get the job done no matter what. <br>
<br>
The raid degenerated as people clamored and bickered for experience, and for going to get phat lewt off the king. Look kids, he is rare. But not so rare that if you camp him, he will not spawn! Most of you got guilds, if you truly are about helping each other, go frreaking camp it. Instead, the very words I hear from members of guilds are , &quot;my guild won't help me, are you kidding?&quot; or, &quot;I can't with my guild.&quot; Is it because you are all greedy? Sheesh paranoia.<br>
<br>
I tried again on sunday night, with 2 groups. We get to juggs, and king spawns! bah. The raid breaks down as people clamor to go back and hit king. Forget the damn king. &quot;I need an item off him.&quot; &quot;Others could use the tunic too.&quot;<br>
&quot;You are just being selfish because you havee a tunic.&quot; Look kids, I worked for mine. And not one damn person among you would say , &quot;sure shaere come along, we will get you this xxitemxx.&quot; Im selfish? Because I am sticking to our objective? Phat monk lewtz at reets juggs, wtf. <br>
<br>
We had been having problems with experience, when upon entering illis jail I find the enchanter in other group hadn't been ressed at zone, because they wanted a 56 res. So we decide once at zone out, I'll go out and drag it down. Well, as we move deeper, I find the ench is now at zone! Because they got a res and then they leave, saying, &quot;too much trouble to get bck down.&quot; Wtf is that nonsense! So we have a sham come down to replace her. Now experience is one sided. Now because it is dumb to have people not nuking, letting mobs live longer, I try many combinations oif rearranging groups. I ask my druid to nuke a little now. That didnt work, so I switch their wiz and my dru. Well, now it starts to even up, then the dru starts nuking OOM on each pull. Because they want exp for their group? And when I ask for a buff from them, I am told, &quot;get your sham in your group to buff you, I am nuking for exp in mine.&quot; Now experience is all one sided. Wtf is this nonsense. <br>
<br>
This going on the same time people are crying to go do king for phat lewt.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am going to tell you how it is people, something long overdue from me, a rant that will be replied to as peoples insecurity and ignorance fuel their flames.<br>
<br>
Greed underlies everything I see in this game. Some of you talk the talk about sharing, but only to an extent. What i see sickens me with this Me me me me me attitude.<br>
<br>
First off, whose business is it if some guild chooses to allocate loot among guild members in any way they see fit. Granted there are mnany ambiguous systems and fugged up things that happen, but the point system is clear. If you aren't in the guild it may suck if you go, because you have been demoted to a first raid status, despite previous history.<br>
<br>
Part of this is fostered by greed and paranoia. Guilds are cool. The problem with them is that they become exclusive little cliques or societies, cut off from others. Why is this you ask? Well, from MM comes the majority of drinal players. From a guild run server. A guild would own the server, all loot for them, damned to the rest of you. So the only way to fight this &quot;evil&quot; as some call it, is forming your own guild capable of competition. The problem I see is they become the very monster they seek to combat.<br>
<br>
Now there are exceptions to any rule, and all generalizations, including this one are false. But as a rule, I notice this attitude pervading drinal where we are keeping to us and our own and ignoring others. Why? Greed paranoia. Dare let someone not in your little circle in, and they may have the gall to ask or expect loot that could be YOURS. Ask that leader of said raid if there any other mages. Heck, the point system rocks, but I see jealousy and anger fostered around it. &quot;I'm next in line for xxclasxx bp.&quot; &quot;Man, that guy sucks and he gets the next xxlootxx.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, and to set this record straight. I am tired of players telling me they are experienced. When your hate raid consists of a southwest corner farm, when you didn't do planes till you were post 50, when you have 45 days played, you ain't got experience for shit yet so stuff it. Some players can take one raid, and learn fast, and are good to go. Most of you need to learn by rote, so after `50 trains you finally learn what the hell BACK UP and nothing else means. If you were truly experienced, you would know enough that on any given raid you listen to said &quot;leader's&quot; &quot;orders&quot;.  Because not doing so only creates problems.<br>
<br>
&quot;You treat experienced players like newbies.&quot; Well you know what, I don't if you are and you act like it. You act like a newbie, or make a newbie mistake, I tend to let you hear it. But as a general rule I have noticed the majority of players on drinal are from mm. A server where most didn't get the chances to do planes or whatever as much as they may have wanted. I notice in comparison to what I see from tunarians(what a word), underequiiped and inexperienced. Im not saying you're all newbie warriors in crafted. But your 45 played days, post 50, means jack to me. You were spoiled. Grown up in a server that sold trak bp's? wtf. Powerlvled to 50 or beyond. Had all this nifty kunark stuff to make life easier.<br>
<br>
is it your fault ? NO. The game is sposed to be fun, and relaxing to an extent, not some great ordeal. But don't sit there with 50 played days and your quest armor and tell me I am treating experienced players like newbies. Relatively speaking, you ARE. I can tell because when I say, &quot;sit here&quot;, instead of simply sitting there, we get defensive. We say, &quot;Boy he is rude, he thinks he can tell me what to do.&quot; There is a damn reason for sitting there, and especially it boggles me that players who have never seen a  jugg before can refuse or think they know any better than someone who has! If I tell you to move, and to sit here, it is not because I am rude, treating you like a newbie.<br>
<br>
It is because we need to move, and to sit there, for specific reasons. All of your vaunted west wall experience in hate doesn't impress me. Experienced players know what to do, and in absence of being absolutely positive, you listen and follow. In situations you have never been in, you listen to those that have. You do not cop some attitude and not cooperate, because YOU are experienced. I laugh at your experience. You want arrogance? I  place my time logged in one plane, pick it, versus your /played time. Sky plane, maybe you got me beat. But Give it a rest. Some people think they know, with 15 hate raids under their belt, and 10 dragons. <br>
<br>
You have been coddled, spoiled, and some act like it. <br>
<br>
Sharing. Wtf people, share!!! I would rather find some mage that needs call of the hero, then lott it for trade bait or twinks. Because one day you may be in a group and that mage doesn;t have it, and you wish he did. Inviting other people on raids doesn't happen as it should because we are all so damned paranoid about being cheated out of OUR loot. <br>
<br>
Wtf is this refusing to help others crap. Wtf is this Mine mine mine crap. Wtf is this I need crap. Wtf is it about you people. be it players from mm or tunare, we are all on drinal now kids. That means we share this world. We share its adventures and experiences. It means some old dogs have to learn neew tricks, and some young bucks have to learn their place as it were. Players don't go on CiH raids because they get crap. Well, I think it sucks , but it is theur raid, they do it as they see fit. KInda hard to incorporate new players into a point system. Then you have players not wanting to invite CiH people because they won;t invite them, or they get their own loot by points, blah blah.<br>
<br>
Alot of parnaoia and selfishness. Don't let that guy come cuz he may cut into our loot. <br>
<br>
What a load of bunk. Learn MY rule kids, thats the golden rule. You do as you should, you do as expected. You take responsibility for your actions, for your words, for your raids. YOu share. You help others. And you quit being so goddamn selfish.<br>

<br>
But trust me people, it can work, and when it does it can be the best thing for the entire server.  Please excuse the comment, but raid for raid Tunare took advantage of every plane, dragon, and boss mob this side of Veeshan's peak, and we did it together, and everyone learned, and everyone got loot.<br>
<br>
But don't think from Shaere's post that the large guilds don't ever attend other people's raids, either.  Members of other guilds have supported and attended most of our raids.  But in the scheme of things, we could all work together alot more, and to everyone's benefit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usephrana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrana</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#939393>(10/31/00 8:42:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   wow shaere</span><hr size=1> *hands shaere an ice pack for his fingers because she's sure they are tired from typing all that*<br>

I hate these raids because there is always a gripe over experience sharing.  On the one hand this is a very difficult area and requires teamwork and people playing to the best of thier abilities to defeat the mobs - on the other you are urged to back off so that one group or another can get exp.  Question is IS this a raid or an exp camp?  Some very useful items drop there that are more important than exp - I think people are going to have to make this decision before going in.<br>
<br>
On another topic, one of my BIG EQ gripes - MATCHING ARMOR SETS.  If the armor was made to look matching as in other games, instead of having all these funky colors which drove people to have all of the same type things would be much better.  The designers have said you are not meant to have all the loot in the game - there is not supposed to ever be an end of the game when you have everything yet they put in these colored sets which encourage people to collect them.  The only real END GAME in EQ is when someone believes the time it will take to get an item or to advance is no longer worth the effort required, and that is when we lose friends in the game - the worst part.<br>

And I can take one group and do more with them than your two or three. I choose to take more than one because bottom line it makes stuff go faster, and hence more loot. 2 groups doesnt go twice as fast, it is more like 3 times as fast.<br>

Why is it everyone from MM thinks because someone doesnt do it with one group they suck? <br>

Most of your post hit the nail on the head about the way things are on Drinal (and all other servers), but it won't change anything and can only be used as an observation. The Golden rule works well with your friends, but will not hold water most of the time with people who don't give a shiznit about you or yours. But hey if you want to be that rare guy who can pull it off 100% of the time then go for it.  But please don't bitch at others because it only makes you look like a hypocrite.

Lay off the defensive, man.  You were complaining about people whining about exp when you take multiple groups down there.  I offered a suggestion to cut down on that whining by taking only one group to reets and jugs.  Nothing more, nothing less.  No need to read more into it.<br>

<br>
as a druid I know how to kite (barely I am a much better group druid). that is a certain amount of skill. you couple that with knowing a zone or area and my skill increases. for example. was in CZ doing the throne room. we pulled bad. I got the attention of 4 lizzyz snared them and kited them around the court yard while the group dealt with the rest. when they where ready they then started pulling lizzys off me.<br>
<br>
In my opinion it took skill to do that. the knowledge of my spells, the use of kiting as a tactic, and knowledge of the courtyard. It saved the group and made me feel good to have been so successful.<br>
<br>
that is what Skill is the applying of knowledge learned to accomplish some goal. <br>
<br>
Skill as a wood worker I'm sure requires a more hands on type approach but every time he messes up at the lathe he learns something new.<br>
<br>
It is the same in game. as you learn how the mobs respond to you, and how the zone is laid out, and how spells work against those mobs you begin to acquire skill in dealing with them. every time you fail you die and get a free 1 way ticket back to your bind point.<br>
<br>
I will concede the mechanics of the game on the keyboard is extremely simple and is a no brainer. I mean how hard is auto attack 8P. but lets face it if you were to take a 1st lvl druid and put him in a 50th lvl druid body his ability to perform as a druid would be much worse than someone who worked their way up to lvl 50.<br>
<br>
so I saw you are wrong there is skill required to play the game.<br>
<br>
anyway it is my opinion hope I don't get flamed<br>

We are all people and thats basically all you need.<br>
<br>
Everyone screws up, and if you say you don't your are a lying sack of poop. This game is too buggy and boring for you not to die.<br>
<br>
The mechanics of the game are just what I am getting at, everyone can do it unless you lack the physical ability to mash the keys.  I will concede to your dictionary defenition of skill. Knowledge and its aplication are key, but coming by that knowledge is this game is simple. It takes no time at all dismantling a spawn. There is only certain point will where that personal skill will matter. Hell items are more important to the situation than anything you can do to control your avatar(less so for a caster). And BOOOOOOOOOOOOO on verant for making that a truth. The amount of time a lvl 1 druid can learn to preform reasonably well at level 50 is quite short period of time.  All it takes is the mash of a button to get the scope of your ability, and it will always be limited to a mash of a button within a game.  I will abandon my view on no skill, but only to take up that that skill is only about 20% of the game....the rest is just time, time, time and a little more time and most of that time is wasted in EQ.<br>
<br>
*mashes A and goes afk for a few minutes while his avatar beats the smack of yet another frog*<br>
<br>
I wish they had made the melee to be more based on oprotunity rather than time. It only matters whose delay is lower and who has the better damage ratio for that delay. Oh and if your race/class combo is on the high end of the so called &quot;balance&quot;. It would make the game alot more enjoyable too if you had to think about when to press the attack button.<br>
<br>
Everyone has greed and either embraces it or struggles to supress it. little tidbit for you sheare... but something you should be used to by now. So don't be surprised when you ecounter it in other people or yourself.<br>
<br>
oh and if I want to relax I take a nap or take a walk, I don't play everquest.  I bet this game gives people just as much stress as any other social enviroment in their lives.<br>
<br>
I have yet to meet the best. <br>

And I can take one group and do more with them than your two or three. I choose to take more than one because bottom line it makes stuff go faster, and hence more loot. 2 groups doesnt go twice as fast, it is more like 3 times as fast.<br>

<br>
It doesnt take any skills to push buttons repeatedly. <br>
<br>
All the skill you need to pull is knowing which way to run.<br>
All the skill you need to kite is knowing what buttons to push in which order.<br>
All the skill you need to tank is knowing when to taunt<br>
All the skill you need to be a caster is knowing which buttons to push when.<br>
<br>
&quot;Im the best button pusher in this Game!!&quot;  woohoo Im impressed... you know when the lab rat pushes the right button it gets a cheese..what do you got?<br>
<br>
The difference between being l33t and being n00b is who pushed what fuckin button when.<br>
on a keyboard theres alot of buttons really close together, people are bound to hit the wrong one occasionally. (just look at some of the damn typing on this messageboard for a good example.)<br>
Get used to it.<br>
<br>
 If you find someone who cant hit the right damn button in ANY situation...dont play with them. Christ with 300000 fuckin people playing this game im sure as shit someones hitting the right buttons somewhere...go play with them and quit crying.<br>
