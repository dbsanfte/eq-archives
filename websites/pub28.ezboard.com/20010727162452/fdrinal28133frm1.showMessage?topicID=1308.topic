I hate Verant!</span><hr size=1> This aggro &quot;enchancement&quot; or &quot;modification&quot; or whatever they want to call it is the worst thing that Verant could do to this game. I don't know if you guys have tried any of the big Velious monsters, but if things play out half as bad as I expect, they're going to be near impossible... instead of being the most fun encounters in the game that they are now. <br>
<br>
And I don't even care about the Rogue change. I can handle my aggro. I wasn't ever worried about the evade nerf, it was just funny to see it being the subject of the &quot;Rogue Class Talk&quot; (Verant: Ok all you classes, we want to help you so here's a thread about what your class needs... oh and Rogues, big nerf, big nerf... but you can throw daggers from 3 feet away now!) The real problem is the incredible jeopardy that they've put HEALING into. Thats right, they're nerfing healing.<br>
<br>
&quot; Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Say good-bye to any hope of dead Velious mobs if this is as bad as it probably will be. They design mobs with hundreds of thousands of hit points, over five times the hit points of Kunark uber mobs. But ok, thats understandable, with some tactics you can handle this stuff.... but whats this? Clearly the clerics are going to have to HEAL people as these 10 minute fights play out. But now a complete heal is going to taunt more than the person being healed is taunting. (its based on hitpoints healed... and the people tanking have 6000, hmm)<br>
<br>
I swear they did this just because they're upset that people are winning their game... (people meaning Fires of Heaven) I'm not blaming Fires of Heaven or anything, its just Verants stupid philosophy of setting the bar so high that nobody can enjoy their game anymore. I can't believe they would nerf HEALING. The most fundamental aspect of their game... and now they're doing everything they can to shut it down. <br>
<br>
I really really hope that these changes to mob aggro are not drastic, but I have a feeling they will be, and I had to vent. Never been this worried about a nerf, but this is too much... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/uartusnatureboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Artus Natureboy</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=                                                                                 http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#993300>(2/21/01 12:48:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This just in...

i am thinking that it might be more like 1 point of aggro per hp healed and mebbe 4 points of aggro per Dmg dealt?, i really dont see anywhere where they address this yet, but verant cant be that stupid to make it one for one, it would not work that way at all<br>

I hate Verant!</span><hr size=1> Well... a prime example from the time before they took the server down for more nerfing. Wuden was tanking a greeny in Karnor until he got to the point where he needed a Complete Heal. Keep in mind that Wuden is using his 1h Epic Quest weapon, taunting, kicking, and is also level 60.<br>
<br>
Barnak casts Complete Heal. The greeny is now killing Barnak. Wuden is unable to taunt the greeny off of Barnak, and it remains there until it begins to run. Try using this scenario with something that can kill Barnak in 1 round of melee, and you see the problem.<br>
<br>
Fun game now huh? Healing is now prohibited.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ukulalo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulalo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#993300>(2/21/01 1:53:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This just in...

<br>
No thats not a meaningless threat.  I play the game for 2 reasons.  Friends, and challenge.  And I dont find low levels to be a challenge.  If Im only in the game for friends...might as well start a new game with those friends.  Something MUST change, or this game is gonna fail miserably imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub92.ezboard.com/ueuthanasiawarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euth Anasia Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#993300>(2/21/01 1:53:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This just in...

I have about 950 AC buffed with Euth so was taking a lot of hits.  FInally he got down to 1 1/2 bubbles of health and then had my cleric cast Complete Heal.  After I WAS completely healed, not even ONE of those MOB's aggrod my cleric.  I was happy, of course, that this didnt happen, but how realistic was this?  1-3 of the MOBS should have aggrod to my Cleric.  <br>
Now I personally havent tested out the new patch, but if what you say is true, yes, it will suck.  They need to find a happy medium it looks like.

But while doing all this dont forget to pay your credit card with that nice $9.89 charge <br>

I don't think anything could truly be the downfall of EQ, since UO and AC still make decent money and they're both lousy games.<br>
<br>
Also, not sure where the quote originated, but some brilliant soul out there pointed out the obvious when he said the problem with VI seems to be that &quot;people who don't play the game at the high levels are brainstorming.&quot;<br>

    Verants solution?  Make every uber mob harder than before.  I'm sure soon CT will be buffed because risk vs. reward is unbalanced.  I mean after you do yelinak etc, you move onto ST.
