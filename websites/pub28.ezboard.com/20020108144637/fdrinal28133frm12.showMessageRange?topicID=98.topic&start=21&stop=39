Raids, when run poorly, are a total CF anyway.  His group gating out, while frustrating, certainly can't bear the responsibility of the whole raid failure.  I don't see some nasty flame about this druid that was the only one who could trigger that evac.<br>
<br>
The fact is, too, that you mention that Phoenixx shouldn't be a &quot;pussy&quot;...try taking your own advice dude.  You're crying like Mommy took away your Barbie Doll.<br>
<br>
Don't assume facts not in evidence.  He didn't gg himself out, and he was probably taken surprise by the druid's GG.  So he didn't hit the disband button...so he didn't stick around to die without a healer.  <br>
<br>
None of what he SUPPOSEDLY did warrants the tongue-lashing that you gave him.  That was childish and totally pathetic.<br>

<br>
Anyway, addressing you weak ass flame:<br>
<br>
Yes, ONE, and ONLY ONE group can make a serious difference in whether Naggy drops or not.  The last naggy raid I went on, infact....we had 4 groups, and we got killed.  Naggy was still at 50% when I died for the 3rd time and we quit for the night.  But the next day, we did it with 5 groups, and he dropped in 2mins.  I didn't even die that time.  WHAT did make THAT Particular raid (with Phoenixx and his group wussing out) was that his groups's sudden departure put the whole raid in disaray.  When Hunkung yelled GO, and group 5 ported out, 1/2 the raid members didn't know what to do.  Dummy buffs were failing, and people were trying to rebuff, and then Phoenixx and his group (YES...IT WAS PHOENIXX'S GROUP, AND THEREFORE HIS RESPONIBLITY) porting out, it killed the raid.  I died, and spent the next 3 hours begging any necro to come and summon corpses.  Hunkung brought in his cleric and started mass rezing.  All of this could of maybe been avoided if group 5 had not ported out.<br>
<br>

I was in the zone and heard the group was gating out, yes I agree that sucked, points a valid reason to have a solid guild backing you or you get lamers doing that.<br>

I think my enchanter owned phonenixx in a real duel in oasis like a year ago was pretty funny dreaderus took 0 dmg and phoneixx (a ranger?) was pretty much schooled. Guy took exception to a smart coment and /dueled an enchanter with a pet up at like level 20 :)<br>

Im slow, humor me, what relevance does your link serve Tat?  Why did you bump a topic a few months old?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I had to pipe up on this.  I was the druid that gated out. *ducks*<br>
<br>
Yeah, well I shouldnt have gone in the first place.  I'll admit to that straight away.  I've never gone on a raid since (or before that) that I havent seen to the end.  I had to work that night, and shouldnt have gone... but here is my side of the story, from what I can remember:<br>
<br>
First off, I wasnt hop'n onto the raid just a few hours before work.  We had plenty of time to kill FGs and Naggy... twice.  That was, without a doubt, the longest Naggy raid I've ever been on.  I warned several, several times, both in OOC and Shout that my mage partner, and I, were going to have to goto work soon.  I am usually annoyed as hell at people who bitch about &quot;this taking too long&quot; or &quot;can we hurry this up&quot; etc., but this really was ridiculous.  <br>
<br>
We spent --HOURS-- in the prep room.  I remember and understand there were LDs that night, but the raid was stuck in that debuff - dummy buff - buff - &quot;dummies fading&quot; cycle waaay too long.  Its really not that complicated, people just werent listening.  Obviously you werent listening either Boof, because my group stated over and over that we just couldnt stay.<br>
<br>
Win or Loose there is CR/Randoming/GGs afterwards, and it was pretty damn clear we were gonna loose.  I was already an hour late for work, so was the only other person on shift.(my mage friend) We had people waiting on us for a freakin game, staying for TRWO CR woulda meant missing half my shift or more. <br>
<br>
Sorry for ditchin on the raid, had no choice, wont put myself (or others)in that position again.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long post. <br>
