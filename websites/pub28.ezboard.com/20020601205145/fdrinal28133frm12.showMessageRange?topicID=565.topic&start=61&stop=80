Why don't you go put something there instead of screwing up your post. Like I said earlier you don't like it look the other way. I actually got about 30 responses.<br>
<br>
- Basically your an ignorant bitch for your smart ass remark =) since were throwing the word around so casually now a days. I guess some people don't have brains. And if you actually read the question and knew anything about feminism its actually interesting. Your a woman you might want to look into it. I've never seen a women knock a feminist thats pretty funny lol.<br>
<br>
CIH woke up the Sleeper its was selfish its really not that difficult to understand. Lets all get over and stop trying to butter up what happened its over. You represent your guild don't you? So guess what if they do something good then your good and if they do something selfish then you will be looked at that way. Its a guild thats how it goes. One person screws up they can make the entire guild look bad. Its not brain surgery, you all know that, so like I said stop trying to cover it up and just admit it already. It was selfish woopy doo. I've never met such a bunch of baby's that can't even admit when they did something selfish. Others can admit it, but you guys just keep switching stories around or try to take personal jabs to take away from the actual subject matter. Pretty lame.<br>

- regardless its just a stand point from how you see the game really. Some people ( like me) see it as comparable to rl with rl people behind the computers and others see it as just a game. To me its a game, but I have to take into consideration other people, to others its a game and the object is to win.

Yes i'm a female, and no i dont care much for modern day femminists or whatever, back when women were actually fighting for their civil rights, it was a good thing, more power to them, but going around and whining about how men should start having babies and women being construction workers just isnt my thing, sorry! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Nowhere in my post did I start calling you a Bitch either, so to retaliate by calling me names only makes yourself look more childish than before, but by all means, keep on digging, it's getting pretty funny. If you would of actually read my post you would of seen that I was merely pointing out that Nodda was just doing to you, the exact same thing that you've done to him.<br>
<br>
In my post I also said that whether its right or wrong, you stereotyped us. Whether he was right or wrong, he stereotyped you. Did I ever say in my post that what CiH did was indeed right? Did I ever say that what nodda said about you was right? Indeed I did not.<br>
<br>
Before you start jumping onto people like a rabid stuttering animal, think about what they've said, and think about what you're about to say.<br>

With all due respect, I thought I knew a lot more than I actually knew in College. Statements like this do you and/or your cause no good. Things in the real world are a lot more complex than your college lecturers would have you believe. In the real world, truth also matters a little more than it does to many college professors.<br>

Christina Hoff Sommers, &quot;Who stole Feminism?: How Women have betrayed Women&quot;<br>
<br>
Amazon.com Editorial Review:<br>
<br>
Though several women have begun to speak out against the shrill and paranoic &quot;backlash&quot; feminism that has left many feeling slightly alienated from the term itself, it is hard to imagine a critique of that position more devastating than this from philosopher and &quot;equity&quot; feminist Sommers. In essence, it is a patient account of the heavy boots of propaganda crushing truth and stirring the young into a frenzy of anger. It rejects the dangerously totalitarian &quot;gender&quot; feminism of Susan Faludi, (early) Naomi Wolf, Gloria Steinem, Catherine MacKinnon, and the like, in favor of a more classic, &quot;equity&quot; feminism Sommers believes is represented by women as diverse as Betty Friedan, Susan Sontag, and Camille Paglia. Gender feminists, she argues, have an influence well beyond their numbers. They not only control a great many administrative institutions in academia, they have also found ways of manipulating a gullible news media and eager-to-please politicians.<br>
<br>
Most dangerously, they play fast and loose with the truth. Remember those reports about the so-called rise of violence on Superbowl Sunday? A total fabrication. Remember how we were told that teenage girls suffer a humiliating drop in self-esteem? Well, the data from this study is guarded by the American Association of University Women, but if you can get hold of it, you will find that the same data &quot;proves&quot; that African Americans have higher self-esteem than whites! What about the alleged high incidence of depression in women? Distorted data. How about the oft-reported &quot;unequal&quot; treatment of girls in school and the 59 cents women are supposed to earn to every dollar earned by men? Look at the truth and weep at how we're deceived. Time and again, Sommers went beyond the media reports and the press-releases of the advocate-scientists and found that the original data had been controversially interpreted or flat-out turned on its head.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, most of these findings come from a small cabal of like-minded academics who are almost never questioned by a press constitutionally disposed to prefer wild claims over fair ones. These women form the core of a gender-feminist party that proclaims itself bent on ridding the world of logic, science, exact thinking, romance, the concept of beauty, hierarchies, history, art, and all the other chains and opiates that even today blind most women to their brutal subjugation. Sommers' work is a study in totalitarian methodology and self-justification. No wonder women in the street feel uneasy. But maybe everybody will read this book, and the civil transfer of power to women can proceed. Stuart Whitwell --This text refers to the Hardcover edition<br>

Feminism is more than just women "being able to be construction workers". <br>
<br>
Basically our society judges everyone male and female and tells us what to wear, how to act, whats right, whats wrong, whats exceptable ect... Feminism in return critics whats wrong with society and its views. Feminism if you actually looked into it and broadened your horizons is a much more in depth theory rather than just a womens issue although it does have focal points around it. So yes if you find my survey funny its probably because you have no clue about feminism or the purpose of it so thats your ignorance.<br>
<br>
Hax TK- yes what you wrote is One aspect of feminism that I have already learned. Obviously I don't rely or just learn from lecture what I know. I go out and do things such as surveys to get the facts from real life and real people in order to come up with my own assesments. What you wrote is another aspect of feminism dealing with genders. However that is one persons reation to feminism and if you dig deeply it is not the only perspective. My point was most women are supressed, so if you are in Any way against women being supressed in society you are a feminist and shouldn't knock it unless you actually know it. ( Naomi Wolf also wrote "The Beauty Myth" which is very interesting about women being supressed in societies ideas of what are beautiful.. was an excellent peice of work if you have read it.) - for the record Trixx women are still fighting for Civil Rights and if you think Men and Women are equal then you need to get out in society more or read some feminism material, we are far from equal.<br>

<br>
1.) The game is entirely level, item, spell/skill based. <br>
2.) If others didn't play the game then only one person would be having a horible time trying to kill a dragon and getting owned left and right.<br>
3.) We play together to create a flow of the game that is generally acceptable to all.<br>
4.) Verant has designed the game to be a group based game. Which I find to be bullshit. I.E. taking 50/60th level people to go jump an orc pawn if it was red and named.<br>
5.) I don't care about who or what anyone does in the game just as long as they don't fuck around with me or my groups pulls.<br>
6.) If you don't like the game for any of the above reasons except #5 quit EQ you'll be happier watching friends or something equivelent.<br>
P.S.<br>
If I was Verant I wouldn't piss off the customer base, but not a guild that's to blame for anything that happens in the game. They don't own crap in the game it all belongs to Sony inc. That's who owns everything to do with the game.<br>

&quot;The Myth of male power&quot;<br>

&quot;Assertive Black, Puzzled White&quot;<br>
&quot;How to talk so Kids will listen, and listen so kids will talk&quot; Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish<br>
<br>
All awesome books, can't remember every author.<br>
<br>
EDIT: oh this is a kick ass book also &quot;The Morning After : Sex, Fear, and Feminism on Campus&quot;  This book is kind of an account by a feminist about how many colleges make &quot;date rape&quot; and &quot;take back the night programs&quot; and how even though there are legitamite rapes and date rapes, many of these programs begin to focus on &quot;bashing&quot; men.  The author speculates that these programs ultimately weaken feminism because it denies the right of a young woman to go out, have a fun drunken night and wake up saying &quot;damn I shouldn't have slept with him.&quot; Instead she has to assign blame to a half hearted one night stand.<br>

Just because i dont share your views does not make me ignorant, it just means i dont really care. I've created my own &quot;views&quot; on alot of things that i base on my real experience, perhaps they're already written in a book somewhere, and perhaps they're not, but the things in every day life that open your mind are more valuble in my eyes than any professor's theories that you can read in a book. I've never really &quot;conformed&quot; with society, and i doubt I ever will, this is just how I am, sorry if it's not perfect like you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
- Trixx why don't you re- read what you just wrote and then go back a couple of posts to were you originally bashed my views. Practice what you preach pls. What makes you ignorant is the fact that you bashed my opinions when you have no clue what they are about. You may have your opinions, but actual Feminist theory goes way beyond your everyday life as a women. So if you don't know anything about it than you have no reasons to judge something you know nothing about. Like it said on that topic.. if you think this is weird, have any questions at all about it, just email me and I'll explain its purpose. I didn't recieve your email, so then don't worry about it.<br>
<br>
- Skarl- what those counclers did is wrong. Its natural for a woman who has just been raped to have their guard up towards men, but a councler should not at all be "male bashing". That author was right. It doesn't mean however that all people "male bash" and those counclers might not have been feminists which would explain why they taught the way they did. Also for the record.. most feminists dont male bash. It happens to be that many men have opposite views from feminism so they get bashed on their Views Not being Male. <br>
