I felt I needed to add to this forum.  People.  There is one thing about roleplaying and a different thing about roleplaying real life and playing mind games designed to hurt people.  Everything she has said here in this post is true.<br>
<br>
Coldhart/Eldarious plays very different with men then he does with women.  If you don't believe it, try talking to him as a woman.  He is a player.  He enjoys creating this web of lies in which women will eventually fall in love with him.  He preys on emotions and insecurities and is very charismatic.  He just finally got caught in his own game.  Is this man 30 or 40?  Is he the owner of a huge apartment complex or does he just rent?  Does he work?  How does he work with the schedule he keeps?  Is he on medical sick leave or just so rich he doesn't have to work?  Does he live in Beverly Hills or South Central Los Angeles?  Ladies you know your conversations with him, you know what he's told you.  Which is it?  Test the facts.  Stay away from him.  Ask the ladies that you know have been involved with him before.  Compare notes.  He changed his cleric's name in order to hide his identity because this has happened so many times before.  He can't hide any longer.<br>
<br>
I have been around this man long enough to see his true colors.  He should be avoided at all costs to any woman that believes there are real people on the other side of this computer and any woman that forms a bond of friendship and or/love to that other person on the other side of the computer.  I warn you.  You WILL be hurt.  Just best to avoid this type of preditor and consider yourself well informed.  There wouldn't be posts like this if there wasnt' enough concern about his doing this to others.<br>

BTW, this is ME the real Truehart. <br>
<br>
First thing I want to point everyone's attention to is the little fact that everybody in this thread has posted in the same name as the character they play in EQ... with the exception of those that are trying to save the ladies of the world from me.<br>
<br>
It is pretty senseless since I don't even play the chars on my old account any longer, except for a cameo appearance every now and then to say hello to some good friends.<br>
<br>
I will respond to the Countess and her latest post. That I 'begged' your sister to marry me in RL is an outright lie! You never heard that, read that, and you only added that to give your accusations some kind of validity.<br>
<br>
It also amazes me how you paint ladies as being niave, helpless victims waiting to be preyed upon. In my time in EQ, I found the ladies in the game (the 20% that truly ARE ladies) to be very much able to handle themselves. They need no resentful person posting under an alias to be their protector.<br>
<br>
Even though I know who you are, I will not reveal it because you are doing this because somebody you care for was hurt, and your intentions are good. But the fact is, I was with her in a EQ relationship that lasted a full year. Yes I wanted to make her happy, and sometimes I replied to questions about possible RL meeting in a way that gave her hope it *may* someday happen. When I began losing my enjoyment of the game... I became distant and lost interest in both adventuring, and in my EQ relationship with her.      <br>
<br>
Anybody want a testamony on the evils of EQ marraige, here it is. Best thing is to flirt, tease, take a lady friend of to some hidden spot (after making sure she really IS a lady) and make her bite the pillow... then be on your way with no mention of the &quot;R&quot; word (RELATIONSHIP). Long as you stay away from those, I think you will avoid my situation... that of having a line of former EQ wives and girlfriends wanting to tear you limb from limb.<br>
<br>
Dang me. Dang me. They outta take a rope and hang me... up from the highest tree. Woman would ya weep for me? *grins*<br>
<br>
As to Eldarious, who occasionally plays Coldhart... I gave him specific instructions to NEVER log on Truehart. And from now on, I will never log on to the old account again to say hi to old friends. I'll make a 1st level if I ever pop in to take a look. That is if after reading all this, Eldarious does not change the password on my ass.        <br>

This is the account for the character that I play.  Some of you may or may not know me, but I have been in a relationship with Truehart / Coldhart / Propheci aka Eldarious for over a year. Good Bad or indifferent.. whether I have a life or no makes no difference ..and if you want to heckle me fine =)  <br>
 <br>
I’m glad that this post ended up on the Flame board and I hope that the warning is headed, by everyone who happens to PLAY a female character..RL age or sex makes no difference.  I want to answer some of Truehart’s post.<br>
 <br>
No, you never “begged me to marry you IRL”, that is if you are thinking that Conselua is my sister.  Unless you are referring to some other woman you may have had as an EQ wife for the past year who also has a sister.  And if you did, did you coheres and cajole her into promising to be only yours and to forsake all others in game?  Hummmmm<br>
 <br>
The only way to protect people in EQ from predators is through the passing of information.  For this game that avenue is message boards.<br>
 <br>
You say you wanted to make me happy…like you were doing me a favor.  I think it was YOU who pursued me and YOU who pressed the issue of an EQ relationship that mirrored a RL marriage.  My stance was and has always been, just be honest with me..don’t make promises you are not going to keep.  Being buddies in EQ and playing the game is perfectly fine with me   Also, as to the possibility of us meeting IRL, YOU are the one who brought that up and made promises.  I remember telling you distinctly NOT to say it unless you MENT it.  Along with the stories of how awful your RL marriage was, how your wife was a crazed B*&amp;## and you were counting the days until you could MOVE here.  I neither asked or pressured you for those promises and when you gave them, I trusted you.  More the fool I was, but live and learn.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
“Anybody want a testamony on the evils of EQ marraige, here it is. Best thing is to flirt, tease, take a lady friend of to some hidden spot (after making sure she really IS a lady) and make her bite the pillow...”  Ok let me stop and laugh real quick. LOL  This is a game and although chatting with a good vocabulary and many colorful adjectives can be fun….Biting the pillow is a bit much wouldn’t you say?… Most of us who play EQ do so because we enjoy playing EQ not because we are out to find romance...or love…or a one night stand.  This is a game..and the characters are pixels.  You go beyond that and you work your way into a persons feelings…promising them things and making yourself out to be the hurt party in all past relationships.  You deceive and manipulate and I have to say you did a good job.  Good thing, my ex-husband taught me well about such things.<br>
 <br>
Oh, as to the 3 months of EQ I paid for you to play…don’t worry about paying that back I will chalk it up to a FEW nights of fun…even though $30.00 is a bit much for what I received in return.<br>
 <br>
You can go about your game play and do what you choose.  It is when I hear of young girls and boys playing girls being bullied into encounters with you that really upset me.  You try to play women against each other like we are adversaries ..but I don’t play that and never have.  You make up stories and talk behind women’s back to other women…so that they will take pity on you.  What kind of REAL man does that?<br>
 <br>
I don’t hate you...that would allow you too much space in my head. <br>
 <br>
Oh and Truehart…Dear.. you have a bad habit of editing your posts over and over…but this time your first post was captured before you could edit it.  And remember the trick I showed you with the IP addresses?  Well yours shows up under a few different EZ board accounts…. Things that make you say Hummmm.<br>

Oh, and as an afterthought... I just wanted to add.<br>
<br>
Countess Consuela,<br>
Even with these attacks and accusations... all things personal and private<br>
between me and the lady you speak of will still never be mentioned (by me).<br>
I won't post your character's name or hers, I won't post regarding anything<br>
she sent to me... that if I were the evil person you seem to think I am,<br>
would be smeared all over the internet.<br>
<br>
And any lady I have spent time with online knows this to be true. No matter<br>
the bad feelings that may exist when it is over, and whatever names you may<br>
call me in /tell... I never sent tells to your RL husband's char telling him<br>
all about what was going on between us. Ladies who' character was maried to<br>
another in game... your EQ husbands were never told about us. You can ask<br>
the guys that know me, and not a single one will tell you that I have ever<br>
given play-by-play &quot;locker-room&quot; stories about any ladies I have been with.<br>
<br>
All that is personal stuff between me and the lady involved... and I will<br>
always keep it that way. It would be nice if you kept the same measure of<br>
confidentiality, Countess Consuela. You have issues with me, use email.<br>

Seventh Ward is a balls-to-the-walls, hard-core Raid guild. Nobody is saying hello when they log on. You need a ride? You either have a Druid on another account, or you are expected to be rich enough to pay 50-100pp for one over OOC. You WILL attend manditory raids or your ass is OUT. You will get phat lewt, because members are expected to look prosperous. Nobody gives a @#%$ if you're sick, your dog died, or anything else. All that matters is that you know how to play your character, and you don't *F* up on raids...."
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Lol, how do you know this? Are you in SW? Ever been in SW? If so, whats the chars name that was in it? Ive been in SW for a while now and I can tell you that what you said is the biggest load of horse shit Ive ever heard.  Yeah, we do raid things, course many guilds do. I wouldnt call us balls-to-the-wall in the least. As for helping each other, you have no damn clue. Let me fill you in, since I am in the guild. The leaders of SW are very selfless, you have no idea the BS they go through for the guild. Fay gates people around all the time, quite often to the point that she doesnt do much anything else. Yeah, that makes playing EQ fun, nothing like gating people around for 6-7 hours straight.  The guild leaders, especially Fay, have spent thousands and thousands of plat getting jewelry made for people, getting items and armor for people, ect. Its their personal money too, would you do that for a bunch of people? The jewelry is necessary for resists. PEople give each other things they dont need all the time. I cant begin to count the number of times that someone has given another guild member a really nice item for free, just because they didnt need it anymore. Im talking things that the person could sell for 10-20k. We firmly believe that by making a single person more effective, it makes the guild more effective. We help each other get epics, ect. Selfish people dont last long in SW, thats been proven. And dont get me started on the people that joined us, got some good gear, then took off for &quot;greener&quot; pastures because they could get in other guilds because they were better equipped. <br>
<br>
Raid attendance is not mandatory. Quite often a few people dont show up and want to do other things, thats fine. Most people do show up though, because they want to. <br>
<br>
Sure we expect you to know how to play your character, what guild doesnt? People make mistakes, it happens. Its not a big deal unless you keep making the same mistake over and over and over. Eventually it would become a problem, once again any guild would say that. Legio Draconium huh. You wouldnbt happen to be Kilamyan would you? That would certainly explain alot. I know why he was removed from the guild, he deserved it. If that is who this is, then this crap post makes sense.<br>
<br>
Give me one example of what you claim. If we are so bad, give me an example. I want to hear how you know what goes on in our guildchat on a daily basis. I want to hear how you know what goes on in the guild on a daily basis. Back your shit talk up son, dont be a little chicken shit.  Post your characters real name, and give me some examples. Course that might take some time, first you have to grow some balls, then you have to try and make something up.<br>

Dude, I dont know you, but I do know Eldarious in the game.  But this kinda thing is fooked up. Trying to pickup chicks in EQ to cyber? Get a life. Get some play in real life. EQ is about killing shit, not having your cartoons talk dirty to each other while you spank the purple helmeted yogurt slinger. It sounds liek you are bragging about the number of women youve had in EQ? Lord if that isnt sad I dont know what is. <br>
<br>
I dont know the real trueheart but I think its obvious that he and the person who now plays eldarious are not the same people.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uitseabitsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Itsea Bitsy</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(6/8/01 8:40:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> Ellesar, Dude!  that was a quote from Truehart/Coldhart/Eldarious..DOH he is in your guild.<br>

For those of you who do not know who I am, the vast majority I am sure, feel free to ask any long-standing member of Undivided Faith about me and my past actions when we were all guilded together those many moons ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 593<br> <font color=#993300>(6/8/01 10:17:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Must have been a short stint in Jus Divinum because he was a Grey Bear for a long time, but then I am confused anyway sounds like there has been more than one person controlling the char so it depends on which person behind the char you are referring to I suppose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucmoore2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cmoore2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(6/8/01 10:37:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> The same person controls both Trueheart the paladin, Eldarious the Cleric and Coldhart the Warrior (among others).  He would love to have you believe there has been a change of hands, but believe me, they are all one in the same and I don't care if he has two different names registered here on ezboard, they are still the same person.  Talk about psycho?  Writing two different messages as the same person with two different names, should speak for itself.<br>
<br>
It's catching up to you Truehart!<br>
<br>
Perhaps because I choose to remain anonymous, my post is not valid to some of you.  So be it.  I'd rather be safe then sorry, people have killed for less.  I can't even imagine how many other women would love to post here but are too afraid to in fear of enciting his wrath.<br>

The worst period of my EQ life was a time when I had a line of men in game wanting to marry me, all of whom I had come to care about (in my heart, not in pixels on a screen), and one who wouldn't allow me to enjoy playing any characters except the one &quot;engaged&quot; to him, making my RL nights full of anguish and tears while attempting to play what is supposedly a GAME.  I almost quit due to the issues that unfolded as a result of the anonymity of Norrath.  This is a venue that allows us to behave as we dream we could in real life, including flirting, which for us genuinely female players (who have genuine female hormonal feelings, I can't vouch for the male players on this score ;) ), can become a real problem.<br>
<br>
Women...OK, men too, make SURE you know who you are getting involved with and enjoy EQ as a game, not a chatroom.  And find your RL relationships at church or at work.  EQ success stories are rare, and there are many who have quit the game over a failed EQ relationship, men and women alike.  Anyone quit playing Minesweeper because you took the mine explosions personally? ;)<br>
