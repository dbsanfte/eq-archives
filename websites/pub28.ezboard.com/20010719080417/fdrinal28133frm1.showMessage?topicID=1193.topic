Moving right along, as someone who typically is either indifferent or dislikes most members of their class it was rare for me to ever find a Necro that did not make me want to fake a LD.  Fortunately, I finally did and I respect her highly.  Noxlip has always been well above my level, but that's certainly not the only reason I have always admired her.  She always had a very distinguishing presence just by being a well known and powerful lady necro.  More than once I've asked her questions, sought advice on equipment, or just asked to inspect her when I know she's around.  Since I first met her back in Nektulos while I was hunting bears, I would chat quickly with her when we ran into each other.  I was always afraid to bother her too much.  Also, I have always doubted she remembers who I am - I'm still not even sure she does... but I've never asked.  I doubt I ever will either, 'cause I like to pretend she does.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's me and that's who I admire.  I'm glad she moved too Drinal from Tunare too.  Would have been a shame to leave her there along with so many other people.  *sniffle*  Miss you Tunare.  *wave* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushinro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shinro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#993300>(1/31/01 9:07:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who did you look up to as a newbie</span><hr size=1> Definelty Ganudan, he gave me a bow worth 13pp to vendors and I went crazy.

As a trader, Crucial... whenever I finally got a trade that tops his best, he would beat mine. It was a steady competition IMO, that I loved.  He was the only person on the server I respected as a trader higher in rank than myself ;) I miss ya man<br>

Overall, Auvani was my god lol.  I'd have to say she was my closest friend on tunare by the time the switch came around, whom I grew a great liking for.

Ebene was another person I looked up cause I would pester her with all my newbie questions and she would always answer to me sooner or later. The funny part is whenever I went to Neriak 3rd gate she would be sitting in the jewelery and I would always wonder where in hells name she would get all the money to be able to sit there without a break :)<br>

I also remember seeing Jehad in nfp with full darkforge when I was level 18 or so.  I talked with him and figured he was the baddest SK around cause he had full darkforge.

The others, from Tunare that were unbelievable cool and informative were: Kelventari, Xelem, Whitefox, Jujumburrah and lots of others that have most likely left the game by now.  Oh, and much thanks to Debbie who saved my butt the time I fell down the well in Befallen.<br>
