Your right there are two sides to every story, and I for one would trust Amadagu over some dumb fuck who tries to justify walking over another guilds corpses' to kill a mob.

Get your putrescent backside onto this thread</span><hr size=1> Brashnir said to let it go. Well I  originally posted a breif statement of things Narv/Ama WAS guilty on. However, it was Narv/Ama who came in here bringing the history specific events up and names. All I did was answer my oppositions false statements and agree with Trewayn on a few things. In short I had to correct some lies being told there.<br>
<br>
About the guild bank, well if you really want to pay back then sure I'll make a list and give or take some interest I lost on it. You said there wasn't much in the bank? Really, well who sold it to turn a profit then because I had first hand knowledge of what was in the bank and there was quite a bit. So what you're trying to tell me is that this stuff grew legs and just up and walked away on it's own? Riiiiiight.............<br>
<br>
As I said I wasn't going to reply but as much as I dislike what Trewayn did in the past I had to agree with him here. I was not going to sit around letting people shred him up for being honest about a corrupted player who some of you are trying to make a martyr out of. We're all human, we all make mistakes in life and in game BUT at least when I made a mistake I was a man and admited it, Ama/Narv on the other hand couldn't muster the nerve to appologize to Althenax for screwing her over. Rather the man lashes out in tells and threats, false ones at that but reguardless they were threats. A friend of Narva's was talking to Althie last night, even he said how Narv/Ama has changed and he admited dissapointment in the way Ama has been treating people recently over the past few months. <br>
<br>
I've said all I have to say here, you want to carry this on further you come see me in game. That goes for anyone who has a problem with me and you leave Althenax out of this. Obviously Narva/Ama doesn't have that respect. I didn't call out each of his &quot;family&quot; members by name and I don't intend to because I have nothing against them, just narva/Ama. I'll give credit to Jorply, at least he was man enough to send me a tell in game no holds barred. That's more than I can say for some of you out here. Morbeas, he calls me crazy, I think he's right. This case is officially closed, any further comments may be directed towards me in game in a CIVIL manner, I'll be your huckleberry.<br>

And quit just saying 'some old soe people etc' and 'old friends' of mine, just bring it to me.  You don't have to say their names here, that is fine, but nut up and send me the tell with their names and such Balrak.  When I took my hiatus, I gave all that I had to the guild, cataloged by Sorshia and voices, distributed shortly there after.  The second time I deleted, talk to Nikolah *you can still email him even tho he moved to the legends server* and he will tell you my account was restored only with my no drop stuff.  What was in my account, 7k and Air quest items, all twinks were deleted and were restored with ZERO GEAR.<br>

  I was in SoE since Lost Souls merged into it, and have considered Ama a friend for a very long time, I have been in a guild with him since then (except for a little over a month when i made my own). I am by no means trying to make him a martyr, but i do consider him a great player, and friend. <br>
  The guild bank in SoE wasnt big, i dont know if the SoE boards are still up, but go look, there were maybe 10-15 items in it, nothing big...everything else that was given away were from either his character or his families,that they had used. <br>
  Just let things Drop Balrak, if you know how to do that, its old stuff. And believe me you are hated on Drinal, i saw you in GD the other day and was so tempted to just yell at you, the only thing that stopped me was i knew you would just spew off a 20 page long thing, like you do here, repeating yourself and making no sense.

1)  90% of the people who have posted support Ama/Narv<br>
2)  Balrak is an idiot<br>
3)  Balrak knows all these imaginary people that hate Narv and tell him so but he doesn't post any names.<br>
<br>
Balrak you pretty much ruined your rep on this server a long<br>
time ago.  When you first applied to Souls we were told not<br>
to invite you that you were a liar and a thief.  (anyone <br>
remember Balrak Ninja'ing EM in Hate...that's why he was <br>
guildless to begin with).  We, believing in second chances<br>
let you in.  We, regretted that to our dying day.  Ask any <br>
officer of Souls.  You were a cancer.<br>
<br>
So let's clear up the story here.  Being that Sorshia and I were<br>
the ones doing everything when it happened I consider myself<br>
the resident expert (narv aside).  Narv quit twice.  The first <br>
time he had me strip all of his characters down and distribute<br>
it to the guild.  Which I did.  Much to my chagrin.  Close to <br>
40k in stuff went to the guild that time.  All of them agreed <br>
that if he ever came back they would return it.  Did they?<br>
F**k no.  He got back less than 20k in stuff when he returned<br>
I know of one wizard that quit the guild and made off with a <br>
pair of his Effy boots.  And the guild bank?  Bullshit there <br>
wasn't a thing in it when he quit the first time.<br>
<br>
So at this point ama was at least 20k in stuff in the hole.  Not<br>
to mention the sheer time &amp; energy he put into helping people.<br>
That's why he quit in the first place cuz he wasn't playing for<br>
himself anymore.<br>
<br>
A few months later he quits again, completely deleting all of<br>
his accounts....I know I got on Ama's acct and saw it empty<br>
one day.  At this point Naela was in charge of the &quot;Guild Bank.&quot;<br>
Seeing as how she didn't even know he quit til after he did it<br>
I highly doubt she took the time to give him the stuff just so<br>
he could delete it.  The guild bank was laughable.  There were<br>
a few pieces of resist gear and that was about it.  I mean <br>
come on we were a guild that was proud when we did Fear by<br>
ourselves.  Where the hell did all this uber equipment in the <br>
bank come from?  Oh that's right your imagination.  And by the<br>
time he quit the 2nd time, you weren't even in the friggen<br>
guild.  So it wasn't your @#%$.<br>
<br>
So to sum up:<br>
<br>
Seems that the people posting here think two things...<br>
1) Narv's a great guy<br>
2) Balrak is full of @#%$.<br>
You seem to have a lot of people who will back you up on this.<br>
Well I think if you want to retain what small microscopic <br>
respect you think you have you need to produce these <br>
mysterious supporters.<br>
<br>
Will you?  No.  You'll ignore everything I've said.  You'll say <br>
that I'm just Narv's yes man.  You'll say how I helped steal the<br>
stuff.  Go on post it.  I know it's coming.<br>
