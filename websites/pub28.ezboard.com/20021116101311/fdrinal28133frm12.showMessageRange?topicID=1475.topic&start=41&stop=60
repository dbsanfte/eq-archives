<br>
Kutch, you give high praise to FEMAXIB.. yet they are seperate entities that have learned to cooperate with each other so they can continue to grow and doing greater things... 3 guilds (Or is it 4 now). Rated a 9/10...<br>
<br>
However.. CT/WL gets low marks because they choose to work together for higher goals? Rated 06/10 and 7/10? I dont see the differenc between 1 alliance and another. We choose to raid together, we have a damn good time.. and we get our kills. We are progressing at a decent clip... again, does it matter that we have 2 guild tags instead of one? Our Alliance is a permanent thing, not something we have setup just to get past an losses of people, that will dissolve down the road. We currently recruit people into our guilds that help the Alliance, we don't recruit people to make one guild self sufficient so we can terminate our friendship/raidforce.<br>
(BTW, are the lower marks for WL because you where former WL and just feal a little green?). <br>
Additionally, to the best of my knowledge.. CT/WL has a much better Server-Wide reputation then Vice, we work well with guilds, and do not train, steal, ninja, whatever. If your there, and have suitable force, we back the hell out and move on about our buisiness. If our members are out of line, we quickly take action to rectify the situation rather then /ignore problem. Additionally, If we see another guild heading to PoF for an example, because they plan to farm armor or whatnot.. we dont step over them to get to CT... we speak with their raid personnel and ask them to kindly let us know when they have finished up.. or if they would like some assistance clearing. If Vice cant mobolize quickly enough to get there when its time to do CT, that is not justification to push those other people our of the way permaturely or deprive them of their fun.<br>
<br>
Now, you praise CiH loot system... yet you made up a point system for your guild... CiH went away from a point system long ago I believe, its all officer decided.. (CiH.. Comment.. did you go back to a Vicelike point system?)<br>
<br>
Vice - They raided with UC today and kill Yelinak.. better mark them down to about a 4/10 to go with UCs 5/10... OMG, they didnt raid alone. Lol, whats up with that shit.<br>
<br>
I never talked to you when you left WL, didnt know why you left or if it was just some personnal thing between you and Mojoo at the time.. but believe me, WL leadership is strong.. and Mojoo has not faltered one bit in his leadership. He is every bit as strong a leader as Bruuss on the other side of the Alliance and a very motivating factor in our daily raids (Just like Maar was back when he was here... recall how we never did jack shit when Maar took a few days off?... Same shit here). <br>
<br>
Back to the original title of the post... as far as guild who have impacted the server (Not sure how you got into rating guilds)... <br>
Afterlife - For giving CiH a reason to be.. and the motivation to not live under their shadow and strive to be what they are today.<br>
CiH - For waking the Sleeper, for great many tactics which have since been stolen by dozens of different guilds for different encounters, For being what they are... and causing every other guild under them something to strive for.<br>
WL - Version 1 - For Kickin CiH in the butt when CiH was going thru some hards times and needed some new motivation to stay on top. For showing other guilds that they don't always have to breath dirt from the higher teir guilds, with a bit of self determination and teamwork and organization, just about any guild can reach a higher plateu..<br>
FeMax - For showing us that guilds can co-operate and work together to achieve greater things then they can achieve on their own. Later Ugod, CiH/CT alliance, WL/CT alliance, etc.<br>
<br>
Shit, I could go on all night, but i have work to do.<br>
See yah bud.. and good luck. Been a long time since our paths crossed in game, and suppose they never will again.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Flew... to be AoW capable.. you actually have to be able to kill him.<br>

I will give you that FEMAXIB has the art of the quick kill down for the mobs they do. They work very well with each other, many of whom have been working together now for years. WL/CT mobolizes about as fast as they do, but many times we find outselves overly preping/cautious when there is no need to (Guess we learned a while back that its better to spend 10 extra minutes preping then to wipe and spend 30 extra minutes on CR and rebuff, this holds true for the newer mobs we have been doing). <br>
      Now, on occation, we have more people on raids in the evening hours then they do during their raid times.  We have a hard time telling members they cant attend a raid I suppose (We dont). Our numbers at times are actually quite a hinderance, and we would actually have a much quicker/cleaner kill with, less lag..etc if we did it with the bare minimal numbers. CT/WL shines however on the earlier and later raids. We have a much larger daily raid window then many other guilds (03:30pm-05:30pm and 10:00pm-01:30am) where we are still effective and the numbers are nominal, and we can hold our own with FEMAXIB and any of the other bare minimalists (Not even sure you can call them that, saw their 4 guilds on the Deep 2 days ago with 50+ for BP attempt). Our Alliance has done  CT with 30 people at 2:00am on a Thursday morning.. XTC with 34 people at 12:30am on a Monday morning. Tormax with 30 at 03:30 in the afternoon. When we have too, we CAN and do kill with what many would consider low numbers. For mobs we have been doing a while, we can mobolize, prep, kill mobs very quickly.<br>
        With anything, this is a game of tactics and repetition.. mobs just get easier and easier with less people once you learn the tactics. Then its all in the execution.<br>

<br>
[qoute]<br>
CT/WL has a much better Server-Wide reputation then Vice, we work well with guilds, and do not train, steal, ninja, whatever. If your there, and have suitable force, we back the hell out and move on about our buisiness<br>
[/qoute]<br>
<br>
*cough* I remember having to res 20 Vice member after a tormax train, when I was trying to get your representatives to answer. This train was even intentionally.<br>
<br>
Now, to add up. Vice kicked out the ones that trained, the ones that KSed and the ones that ninjaed.<br>
CT/WL and CiH had a huge amount of people demading this to happen, just look at their flames. But when they do it themselves - they don't seem to think it's just as important. I haven't seen a KS/ninj/trainer of CT/WL/CiH ever get kicked out - yet they DO have the skill of complaining like mad. Dunno, it just pull down your average in general.<br>
<br>
Heh, actually I wonder why vice got a bad rep, we kicked out the bad people, and CT/WL/CiH got to keep their bad people - and still vice ended with bad rep. /shrug Guess things ain't that important when it doesn't come to you anymore.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't care really anymore. That list was how *I* see things, and you can't change that.<br>
Btw, have you ever competed with femaxib ?? It's quite more comfortable than competing with CT/WL. <br>
<br>
1) they never train you<br>
2) they dont want you out of zone<br>
3) they offer to cooperate rather than stressing the fact that they should have the spawn.<br>
4) they never closes tormax's door when you pull him *glare at saden*<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wish FEMAXIB all the luck in the world, they are in a perfect timezone and they do great. Their skills have proven to be exceptional and if they have a problem with you or your members, they still give you the trust you deserve in order to fix it. <br>
<br>
If you really care about why I left WL ? It was because Fullav was treated like shit by Mojoo and most other leaders. He's a RL friend and I wanted him to enjoy EQ. Thanks to Mojoo - he was not enjoying it. <br>
So I asked Vice if I could join together with Fullav, because he means more to me than any guild does, and psykoth said &quot;ofcourse!&quot; and welcomed me with Svarte as my main and Kutch as my alt. <br>
<br>
The only thing that matters in EQ is that you get what you pay for - you gotta enjoy it in whatever way suits you..  My way was to have a good time with Fullav, so I did whatever it took and joined a really small guild instead (vice). I don't regret a second - we have had insanely many hours of fun we would never had in WL.  <p><BR>

And if any member of CT trains/ninjaloots/ks's. You tell a officer and we deal with it. I never received a tell from someone saying one of our members did any of those things.

as far as I know that's the definition of training <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I do understand that 35 people is hard to see tho ( whereof 20ish is kos ).<br>
<br>
But don't walk around beliving you are saints - no guild are. What you see as bad things about some guilds - you most likely already got in your own guild. It's just that the incident seems so different from your own point of view, like tormax incident.  If you arrived at the same time as guild 2 and instead of talking to you, they pulled tormax over you, you'd be like &quot;#%&quot;#%#&quot;¤% and posted an insane flame. You would *NOT* think, &quot;oh damn, I was in his pull path - I had that one coming&quot; =)<br>
<br>
all about point of view, but it's not gonna change. There will always be trains, KSing and ninjaing. Every day you will meet a &quot;bad person&quot; that has a different story. Gets tiresome after a while. <p><BR>

TK did the same thing to us in ToV once. We were setting up for Eashen and TK had arrived at about the same time. They setup on the pull path while we tried to discuss it with them. They pulled and killed Eashen after a while of ignoring us. We learned from this and decided not to let someone do this to us again. Vice happened to be that someone. <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>
