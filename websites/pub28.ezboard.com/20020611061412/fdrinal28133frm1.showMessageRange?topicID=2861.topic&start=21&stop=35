<br>
Make Rage in SF ~and~ SolB a one day spawn....remove all loot from SF Rage except the heart container and maybe a 1-5 chance of a piece of blazing armor. Or...ooo..even better...make SF Rage like the druid dude in TD...still a 5 dayish spawn, but also triggerable...that way people can't bitch about his lost loot table, just make the trigger one only drop the heart container, whereas spawned will drop Naggy table + blazing piece + heart container.<br>
<br>
OK...with me so far? Good<br>
<br>
Here's where you get to control the flow of cleric epics into the game (STILL don't get the whole point of that 2 years after release, but hey, we're in your world now, right?)<br>
<br>
Make the Avatar of Water in TD (for those who don't know who that is, he's the guy you turn-in the &quot;Orb of the Triumvirate&quot; to and get the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh back from) a 3-5 day spawn.<br>
<br>
BOOM! No KSing, small guild clerics get a solid shot at their epic, GMs don't spend their time covering petitions anymore, people don't have to expect their entire guild and friend's list to be on 24 hour stand-by. The sun shines, cute lil birdies sing and rainbows fill the sky. And people don't quit your game because you made their life an ungodly hell over one item. <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

<br>
Removing loot from Ragefire only lessens (probably greatly lessens) the chance Ragefire will be flash fried by a MB crew, it does not eliminate the chance 4 MB wiz's will port in with a cleric and 1 more of any class, maybe a pally or 2nd cleric in case some freak accident happens and the cleric dies.  So removing the loot doesnt change anything except that it takes away a small reward that the friends of clerics in smaller alliances and such get when they help.<br>
<br>
Moving the bottleneck to Avatar of Water just moves the pointless camp to another zone, which they already tried and screwed up on.  Then they would still get CS petitions out the wazoo because as it stands now, first cleric hands in orbs and then gets reward and AoW poofs.  Well, as buggy as crap is in EQ... I'll bet money that if a 2nd cleric or in this case if bottleneck is moved to AoW then the 40 clerics all trying to race to turn in orb to AoW someone is gonna get their orb eaten.<br>
<br>
Having a bottleneck on Cleric epic is pretty lame anyway.  It doesnt let anyone do massive damage... ala Rogue epic compared to comperable Kunark release Rogue weapons, and even today, how many rogues do you see with FreeBringer bagged?  Some but not a large percentage.  No, what Watersprinkler does is eliminate downtime and let guilds/groups actually recover from a wipeout/death and get back to having fun.  OMG cant have that, not in a game!! /gasp!    <br>
<br>
Get that into Dev teams head maybe your making progress.  Watersprinkler doesnt let a guild beat an encounter, unless they are 100% gimp and doing battle rez for some dumbass mob like Vindi or Statue.  Dont forget to take into account how many Clerics quit or take long extended breaks from the game because the Cleric class is generally extremely boring to play so that you can let others have lots of fun to play.  <br>
<br>
Make the minimum required level for epic 59 and remove all the bottle necks ENTIRELY.  Guess what, nothing affecting game mechanics will change except there wont be so many pissed off customers and miracle of miracles, the overall goal (or at least they claimed it was the goal) of less /petitions for KS'ing will actually be achieved.<br>
<br>
But thats just my opinion... <p>Grumbles<BR>High Priest of The Kindred<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964"> See my profile </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unightgod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NightGod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy #@!%...I dinged</span><br>  Posts: 591<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/30/02 6:40:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2861.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: rly sry</span><hr size=1> You're not removing all the loot...you're keeping coming into the game at the same rate it currently does, actually (if you use the druid TD dragon idea of him being triggered and a spawn).<br>
<br>
Druid's still get their epic pretty easily, and its nowhere near as crucial to a guild as the cleric epic is...saying a small guild/alliance wouldn't help someone kill Rage because the &lt;koff&gt; only &lt;/koff&gt; loot would be the epic piece is kind of silly.<br>
<br>
And I'm sure for the first couple weeks, Rage would die quickly to a MB crew, but who cares? There are alot of clerics out there who are either not going for their epic at all or who are thinking they're months and months away from even having a shot at him....I bet every single one of those would say &quot;you mean I can get all my friends together and spawn Ragefire whenever I want (with a 3 hour window) and then worry about camping a spawn in TD? SIGN ME UP!!!<br>
<br>
The whole point about moving the spawn to TD is that you are now making it a one person spawn...no cries of KS, no people being trained (its a hell of a long run to get any sort of agro mobs into the Oasis), just a few clerics who have to worry about being the first to hit trade.<br>
<br>
And an orb being eaten, if it happened, would be a HELL of alot easier for a GM to resolve than &quot;but, I had agro first&quot; &quot;no, I did&quot; &quot;no, you had agro after you trained me and got me killed&quot; &quot;But that was an accident, I didn't know I had those 35 bottomless feasters chasing me!!!&quot; crap that is going on now. It would be &quot;/petition I tired to turn in my Orb of the Triumverate but someone beat me to it and he still ate my orb&quot; &lt;GM checks inventory logs, sees cleric had Orb until a minute ago and now has neither orb nor epic&gt; &quot;OK friend, sorry for the inconvenience&quot; &lt;/itemsum 8675309&gt; &quot;here's your orb back, good luck on your camp&quot;<br>
<br>
As for the whole cleric epic not being overpowerful...I agree totally, but VI has stated over and over (and over and over and over and...) that they feel it is and they aren't going to change that view anytime soon. That being the case, I think we need to make the process as painless for the clerics involved and the CS teams until that opinion does change.<br>
<br>
Making the minimum level 59 is just elitist and short-sighted. Do we then make the minimum level for EVERY epic 59? (Sorry Mr. Mage, I know you spent a couple hundred hours camping green con rare spawns and 20K in stones and coffins on your 5 trips to PoA while you learned the zone and finally got your crown...guess you have to wait till you gain 5 more levels to use that baby rattle. Oh, Mr Rogue? Go rot-you get no epic haste till 59...you, too Mrs Monk. Ms. Ranger...knock-knock...who's there? NERF BAT-BUWAHAHAHA-see ya in 6 levels-hope ya had fun going to Hate 50 times) What about clerics (and other classes) like me who worked their ass off and gave up 150+ hours of their life to get the epic at level 52? Should that level 51 monk who had the fortitude to sit in LGuk for 200 hours go rot in hell? <p>Higar Mettlebender <BR>

That same monk as well as rogues and in fact, I think all melee have alternatives that were surpassing epics in Velious and more so in Luclin.  Clerics do to, but how often do you Sprinkler bagged for Blackstar... not very.  <br>
<br>
The Rev spell is vendor purchaseable and can be scribed into the spellbook at Level 56, so the spell is available before 59.<br>
<br>
I dont care how anyone spends their time, it's not elitest to put a level cap on that item.  If you spend your time xp'ing or questing or in druidbabecyber channel doesnt really matter to anyone else but you.  Should other epics have higher level limits on using... maybe.  /shrug   Moving the bottleneck to level though actually makes it completely UNelitest if you really stop to think about it.   Anyone can be a velks lab rat and get 60.  That pretty much make the epic available to anyone that puts in PRODUCTIVE time by actually leveling instead of spending 5 or in some nightmare cases 20 RL complete days camping one stupid mob only to have it KS'd of poofed.<br>

<br>
&quot;But to say it in your own word. &quot;Act like an adult .. &quot; to realize, that this is not going to happen. There is no rotation, that will satisfy the most powerful guilds on drinal and take care about the smaller ones, that for sure want some clickers as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, I have had more trouble with the smaller guilds that want to camp, the clerics in the bigger guilds have been more cooperative. All is not lost <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I personally think a server-wide agreement will not happen, it is up to the clerics at the camp to enforce their own rules. It is highly recommended that we work together, as frustrating as it can be to watch 1,2,3,4+ clerics kill and loot ragefire, but in the end it causes alot less stress. <br>
<br>
However, actually showing up at the ragefire spawn and chatting with the clerics already there is probably a wise idea. Showing up one day and saying you are &quot;next on the list&quot; is hard for us clerics to understand if we've been sitting there for weeks on end. Come by, say hello, rootkill a couple mobs with us. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We're friendly people, honestly! Let us know you are done with all parts of your epic and ready for ragecamp. Put in the effort for us, and we will for you as well.<br>
<br>
As far as guilds helping enforce the spawn cycle that is agreed upon for the clerics, I know members of many guilds that would be there in a flash to help the honorable people. I'm camping rage right now, have been for 2.5 weeks. Worked with people, etc. to get where I am in the line-up, hopefully my excrutiating long quest will be over within the week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would like to thank the clerics that have contacted me in game willing to work something out. I will do everything in my power to make sure we all get our just reward, as an officer of my guild has also said on another ragefire thread, they have also vowed to help, big, small, or otherwise guild who agrees to help out the other clerics.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, there are always going to be disagreements about this camp. Even with the best of intentions there are going to be flared tempers etc. We can only hope that it is kept to a minimum.<br>
<br>
Stay safe out there.<br>

So the 8 jillion clerics waiting in Skyfire can just zerg Rage with uber cleric melee.<br>
<br>
And no, I'm not serious. But it would certainly restrict the rate that cleric epics entered the game :)<br>
<br>
In the absence of this fine solution, go Magada.<br>
