There was a Trakanon BP (singing Steel Bp to be exact) for sale on MM. You know why? Because Trakanon dropped more Singing Steel BP's than the server had level 1-60 bards. I mean, why should you fill your bank account with Singing Steel BP's when everyone and their grandma's twink has one? And 250k for a BP is not bad at all for the guild treasury.<br>
Another thing: Why in god's name do you care about it? MithMarr was the only server who had 2 guilds who could take Trak down. So talk about power...<br>
MithMarr has the most (or second most for you FoH fans) powerful guild in that whole game. So we learned to live with power. It made us strong. MithMarr is one of the oldest servers which just got its first split. So you can imagine the high level population. So it happens that not EVERYONE has a complete plane armor set. Hell, I am 58 and still run around in my funny looking treeweave..Know what, I like it. There are things in life which are more important to me than making stress for some freaking pixels on a server in the States. If I get it, well, that is damn nice, if I don't get it, I will survive it.<br>
But I also have to say that you right on the greed part. Greed is killing friendships. And there is a lot og greed around. It pisses me off when I see people selling things which a guildmate could use. But know what, I keep those people in mind. And once in my mind it is not easy to get out of there. Positive and negative.<br>

MM was a damn old server and pre-kunark we were seriously loaded with bored level 50's who had nothing better to do than play a twink or try something challenging like a 2 group in guild hate or fear raid or whatever..thats how MM came up through the game, a very competitive style. I'm not saying this is right or wrong, but who is anyone else to judge it either? <br>
<br>
You had some very valid points in the original posts about people bailing out of raids because of lack of exp or not getting all the loot, this is the reason why alot of people stick to guild only raids. To sum this up, as long as there are people in this world, there will be idiots and jerks too, they sort of work hand in hand. And although Mith Marr is very proud of our morons */cheer clubber* we have some damn good players *or button pushers as the case may be* out there too<br>

I know this post may be lacking in time, but here's what it boils down to. The game may take a fraction of skill but anyone and I do mean anyone can play any character at any given time IF they are shown, taught, and trained what spell do what, what skills do what.<br>
<br>
In short, it's common sense that runs the machine not skill. I don't care how much skill you may have, if I walk into a room and I see 10 mobs there, am I going to storm it with one group. Even though this group may be made up with the best players who have the most experience?<br>
<br>
No, I'd rather call in backup. Why break your back when all you need to do is say hey folks, you up for a quick *as kilrog would say* smooshfest. Sometimes it just takes a little common sense. I will admit I believe EQ is far to harsh on the death penalty, so why take a chance of losing a full nights worth of exp in a senseless death?<br>
<br>
Common sense tells me I want to play it safe, I want to accomplish my goal with the least amount of trouble and I don't want to get halfway through a raid and have to leave because others ran out of steam. I want to go in there with guns a blazing and a darn army if need be. Personally I could care less if it takes 4 people to take down trak to 40. As long as you accomplish the same task then who gives a rats ass how many it took or how many hours, point is you accomplished your goal.<br>
<br>
I remember AL used to do FGs with what was it, 6 then 4? This was PRE kunark mind you. Very impressive, so other guilds felt they had to follow and failed. Why take the chance? To impress who? No the only reason people want fewer and fewer on raids is one thing, (common sense tells you this) less people = greater odds of getting gear for yourself. There's that damn greed word again.<br>
<br>
Then you hear the excuse given, we wanted to see if you did it. Well thats nice, but guess what, I don't care if I go in there with twice the amount as long as my raids completed then I have just the same satisfaction. Old saying for times like this, I don't have anyone to impress other then myself, if people wish to impress me then they may as well go find someone else, because I'm not impressed by idiocy.<br>
<br>
So to the people who like to gloat it took them X amount of people and hours over X guild. So, what's your point? Am I supposed to be impressed? They did the same thing but did it in their own fashion. So let it be at that.<br>
<br>
If you think I'm flaming those who can do high raids with low downtime and amount of people, I am not, but what I will criticize are those who come out gloating and picking on others who did the same thing, just took them longer. A dead trak is a dead trak, period.<br>
<br>
Its no longer termed Evercamp its now refered to as EverQuestingToA-RatRace.<br>
<br>
Have a good one all and remember, it's not all skill its 95% common sense, 5% skill.<br>

He has it all figured out!!!<br>
<br>
It's easy to read what I just stated and say, here is yet another person Kissing Shaere's Butt.  But thats not the case here.  Shaere likes to read into things becuase he thinks he has it all figured out.  In actuality, he makes more reality for himself, than he ever cares to figure out.<br>
<br>
I can totally agree with the greed part of his argument.  Why do we play EQ?  To see our characters get better and better, that's why we keep going back to the same places time and time again and reach the, pathetic KID played time of 50 hours accordding to Shaere.  We do it to become better.  Verant wants to make money off of this and off peoples fashion sense for that matter.  COMON, that's simple and everyone will understand that.<br>
<br>
I agree with him on the Greed dilly, but calling me a kid 50 times in his post is a little to far.  I don't deserve to be called that, we all make mistakes, even you Shaere.  I personally feel that Variety Is The Spice Of Life.  SO what if there is another mob thrown in, you feel EXTRA special when you kill it, then everyone get's a GJ.  You wanna tell people to chill out Shaere, tell them it's alright if they die, we have rezzes here for it.  You wanna tell people to chill out Shaere, be an example and don't write a flame that includes the text, &quot;I SHOULDA WROTE THIS ALONG TIME AGO!&quot;  Who made you &quot;GOD&quot;?  Was it your 100plus hours of game time you threw up in our faces on your post?  Maybe you have all day to play this game, maybe we don't.  Maybe you started from day one or on beta, maybe we didn't.  Maybe you have played only one character the whole time because it keeps you happy on a game that you bought for happiness, maybe we have several.  Maybe you let that all go to your head.<br>

He has it all figured out for us, just follow him.<br>

Makes me sick.  I encourage anyone that doesn't like to see him bitch to not go on his raids.  Rather, start your own monk, and do what he does, it's not hard, he just does it and doesn't show anyone else how.  It's ok to die in EQ.  Guys (not KIDS), this really is a game.  Don't let loot or dying make you FLAME another char for a mistake in game.  To be honest, we all play this game, we all have a lot more in common than we think.  <br>

Oh well, how's it going getalong, it's been some time since you've shown up here. Now how can I add to your post, well I think it speaks for it's self except for the death part, you must admit, what a pain it is to die sometimes.  <br>
