<br>
Like everyone said the kid had problems and probably was doing like I know a lot of us have at one point or another.  Used EQ to escape the bullshit of real life.  His mom doesnt play, doesnt understand the time investment we put into the game, sees her son lying on the floor with half his head missing with the logon screen of EQ in front of him.  <br>
<br>
Now she realizes oh shit.  I fucked up as a parent, but I cant tell anyone that so I will blame.... (looks around)....EVERQUEST!  Everquest has to be the reason.  I dont understand it, I never play it, I see him playing it all the time, and I know he invests all or most of his time to it.  Forget the fact that I told him that he was a piece of shit all of his life and let his father beat his ass in a drunken fit.  Forget the fact that I didnt let him go outside and play with the other kids.  Forget the fact that I suck as a parent! Lets bring down those communist bastards at Sony.  I KNOW they have deep pockets.  They have to, they make the television I sit my ass in front of every day instead of interacting with my children.  <br>
<br>
You are right.  I could blame the gun manufacturer but lets face it. Thats old news.  These days suing Smith and Wesson for making the device that killed my son just isnt working in court anymore.  Suing Remington for making the bullets so effective doesnt work either.  So lets blame this damn game.  Its a new idea.  In this day of internet media this will work well.  This will get me rich, this will get me attention.  <br>
<br>
This is what is happening.  That poor guy was probably escaping his real life in EQ and when shit went bad, he felt bad.  Hell, I know I have felt extreme pleasure and extreme lows from playing this game.  Who knows.  Everquest probably kept him from killing himself long before this.  And we dont know if this game was the ultimate reason.  He was probably logged in as a last ditch effort to give himself something to live for.   <br>
<br>
People make me sick.  Its like suing Ford Motor company for making the vehicle I killed myself in because I was too tired to drive and ran into a tree.  That was my own damn fault.  Not Ford.  This kid killed himself because he had mental problems, not because he plays a video game.  <br>
<br>
Oh ya, wouldnt you think a fat kid like that would wait until AFTER Thanksgiving dinner to kill himself?  I mean, come on give yourself a last meal.<br>
<br>
And finally, I leave you with this.  Enjoy:<br>

Everyone in this world thinks a little bit differently and acts a little bit differently. Some are not as mentaly stable as others while some need no assurance at all.<br>
<br>
Some parents are oblvious on who their children really are, such as the mother in this story. I believe parents are afraid to intrude on their children's life at an early age but how I see it, you're showing your child that you CARE by taking an interest in what they like. Even if you can't stand watching sesame street, it would be a big honor to them for you to take 10 minutes out of your soap opera watching schedule to come sit next to them and ask them &quot;So what's big bird up to?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if parents attempted to show an interest in what their child likes, it wouldnt seem so akward at the teen-adulescent years to try and make up for the neglegence on your behalf of the past 15+ years.<br>
<br>
From what i could tell, he was using Everquest as an escape from his reality. While working at a video game store during college, I met numerous people who remind me of this guy. Most of them just wanted someone to talk to, nothing more. How do you think this could have turned out had his parents taken the time to talk to him?<br>
<br>
The news article said it all. His mother had no idea who he was talking to on the game, had no idea what was going on in the game. She had no idea, and I'm sure she had no idea of the serious issue she had on her hands until she found his body. I won't go as far as to say she did not love him. I'm sure she did. But the real question is, did he know it? <p><P>

Then there are some that really make sense and are rendered by people with a clue. Here's some food for thought right out of Websters.....<br>
<br>
addiction n. The state of being addicted or given up to a practice; the state of being strongly devoted; habitual, compulsive use of narcotics.<br>
<br>
addicted  a.  Habitually practicing; given to; devoted; habituated<br>
<br>
<br>
So as you can see there is NOTHING here that says it has to have a component that makes you continue to use the product, such as nictotine in cigarettes. Those of you pro-choice people are still addicted, you just choose to be....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So why don't you stop denying it and just come to terms with the fact. You might find it interesting that denial is one of the signs of being addicted by the way. And most anyone will tell you that in order to remove an addiction you need to take the first step and ADMIT (or stop denying) you are addicted.<br>
<br>
As for gun laws and the play that a gun came into this matter, he could have as easily offed himself in many, many other ways. Just because he used a gun, doesn't mean the gun is at fault, or the laws that allow him to have that gun. (Which by the way is his constitutional right)  It was the poor depressed bastard who pulled the trigger, not the gun. Just like it's the low life murderer that pulled the trigger and killed someone who is at fault, NOT the gun. Whatever the reasons were that drove him to suicide probably had very little to do with EQ. I suspect he was a loser in life and probably in EQ and something pushed him over the edge. No one will ever really know, since he left no note behind.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, as a fellow addict to EQ I will of course continue to play until I finally decide enough is enough. As mentioned earlier, it is my choice and I choose to play, even if the fact that I'm ADDICTED to this game is driving me to habitually play.<br>

I was just trying to make a distinction between the people who deny that they are to _blame_ for their so-called addiction/habit, such as non-DT alcoholics and so-called sexaholics, and those who have an actual, physiological addiction to a substance (for example, long term Valium or heroin users) -- course, they had to choose to take the drugs in the first place.<br>

<br>
Rule one of a person who suffers from an an addiction is DENIAL. When someone is on drugs they deny it being a problem and an addiction. The same can be said for alcohol. The fact is, gaming such as MMORPG's are an addiction. I will be the first to come out and admit, I too was addicted to UO, Diablo, EQ, AO, AC, DAOC. If you think about it, WHY would you ever spend days camping an item? You can say consumer responsibility and yes you're right, but that does not sway the facts that games are habbit forming. I've known far to many marriages go sour, many children flunk in school, why the list goes on and on. It's a two part ordeal, one is player responsibility, the other is addiction. To deny either is to deny the fact you have a problem and need to seek help or at least cancel that subsciption for a month or two.<br>

I feel a significant physcial difference if I spend too much time in game (e.g. an 8 hour session), I equate it to being mildly photosensitive. I can't even imagine how it impacts people who are 100% epileptic. <br>
<br>
They are also 100% right on about some of the bullshit associated with the game. Although it isn't Sony's fault there is a total amount of pressure to be dedicated through social conformity and commitment to time spent on line at higher levels. The individuals who give the peer pressure aren't well rounded and hopefully some day will become aware of that. I'd much rather be flogged and delete a character for gating out of a dungeon, then sacrifice RL over the game. Personal time is a higher priority then being stuck in a cr in game.   (oh yah that really happened)  But on line players are kids or emotionally unstable that type of pressure does exist and does hurt them.<br>

Although I don't think he was implying you were addicted lol.<br>
<br>
I have to fully agree with dirra and lewv/luv( whatever=), EQ can be very addictive and it's a choice you make. I think half the people who play this game are addicted( even my own BF /sigh grrrr!). I'll even admit at one time I was addicted but I snapped out of quickly. Thats one of the reasons I stopped playing. It's too damn time consuming. Your expected to make eq your life, especially in most guilds( no offense). ex: Everyone must go to this raid, at this time, and stay this many hours, and you can't leave until we say so to gate you out, and then you have to go on a shit load of these raids to earn points, and then if you win an item you have to stay on all the raids so you don't look like an asshole. WTF! Sometimes I want to reach through the computer and tell people to shut the fuck up because RL>EQ. Just last week we made plans to go to the beach, but NOOOOOO, we had to leave like 2 hours laters because there was a fooking raid and the guild leader wouldn't gate him out because it wasn't a good time. I wanted to take his little eq game and shove it up his ass at that moment. <br>
<br>
Ok sorry rant off. Just showing how EQ can be really addictive and over time consuming. The way I see it, when a fantasy computer game interferes with RL theres a problem. If you skip class, ditch friends, skip meals, break plans, don't start plans till 2 hours after you were suppose to, let the game interfere with family/friends/ companions YOU are freaking addicted. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaktunka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aktunka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Stallion</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 10:54:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3175.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Facts are facts.

However, whenever I read about something like this, I am thankful that it is a person that only takes themself out rather than harming others first.  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229714 target="web">Aktunka Wormflinger</a><BR>

Anytime you wish to go round for round with me you move your posts over to there, I will be more than happy to accommodate you in a flamefest, chappy. You seem to think you're the almighty at a flame but the only thing I ever get from you is how clueless and ignorant you are to the truth. The fact is (and it's been proven) that games of all types ARE addicting. Sometimes the truth hurts, but that's life and that's something you will one day realize. Your petty gestures that you use in trying to insult me are only reflected by your ignorance and complete lack of knowledge on the topic. People like you try to downplay what you do not understand. In your case, you are determined to not see the truth for your own piece of mind, because you yourself are guilty of the same thing. It's apparent that you will try to justify any means to your side, however, in this case, that still won't work in the end.<br>
<br>
I do not recall saying it's entirely the games fault, but it is to an extent. It is quite obvious this person had some issues outside the game. It's also obvious that people need to take control of their own actions. It's very obvious that Verant has intentionally placed insane waiting times on mobs and created serious bottlenecking issues on epics and quests alike. That's where Verant is responsible and I do believe this is what the mother is trying to point out, perhaps I am wrong on my analysis on the mother, however, I know this is something we (the players) have been complaining about and what has Verant done to correct the problem? Create more mobs in expansions with the same type of timer troubles. However, some of you believe that living on EQ is fine, players like Dirra are ignorant to the truth and that's something I, nor any other person can get through to you till you wake up and realize that in the end you cannot derail the truth by comparing apples to oranges. What would you say if I were to tell you that in fact breathing is not addicting but a necessity; without doing it we die. You see that's the difference between addiction and lifes general necessities. <br>
<br>
You're in denial and it's quite obvious you're not only addicted to EQ but obsessed with it. It's quite obvious of this, so much so, that you'd make a mockery out of a persons death to justify your means of playing as not being an addiction (that's geared to anyone who even thinks of talking low on the person who killed themself).  <br>
<br>
If you're in total control of your life then try this Dirra, and any other party who thinks they're not addicted but deep down are curious. Try quiting EQ/games for four-plus months, then write down every time you have the urge or think about playing EQ/games. Once that four month period is up try adding an additional period till you make it to a year. Then look back at your notes on how many times you've thought about EQ/games (that is assuming you're able to go an entire year without EQ/games). Now this will tell you if you were right or wrong. When I say games, what I mean are electronic ones via sega, nintendo, sony, mmorpgs and so on. I'll be the first to admit, I doubt I could go that long. However, I know from experience, games are addicting and you may not realize this till you step away from them for a few months. You can't imagine how much they can control your lifestyle. I see it all the time, I am telling you not lies but facts; facts based on my own experiences and from the experiences of other people. You know you're hooked if you eat meals at your pc. That's the first sign and I caught myself doing that, luckliy I realized what was happening and ceased immediately. How many times have people turned down doing things in RL with family and friends, only to log onto a game? Boofys description is what I am talking about, he's able to walk away at a whim, however, many cannot and that's no longer a fun time, that's an addiction and obsession. . Deny what you wish, but you cannot deny the truth, it will take hold someday. <br>

That's why my main is 53 lol.<br>
<br>
It's a diversion only. Now I suppose you could say that I'm addicted cuz I play when I get the chance (that's kinda weak) but if I were &quot;addicted&quot; I would play to the exclusion of other things like work, family, politics, etc.<br>
<br>
Which gets back to my point before -- obsession is not addiction; discipline is also not addiction. I know many people who have the discipline and will to run 3-5 miles every day; unless it adversely affects (sic) other parts of their lives, you could hardly call that an addiction under regular rules of addiction. Similarly, I know college kids who are getting good grades and holding down jobs to pay for school who nonetheless have the time and will to work their characters up to uberguild status; I wouldn't call them addicted either.<br>
<br>
The idea that denial of addiction = addiction is sophomoric at best -- however, an entire industry has sprung up around the concept. I just prefer the idea that people are responsible for what happens to them -- the good, and the bad. Yes, shit happens, but by and large we make our own destiny. There's a fun little book by Richard Bach that kind of makes the point -- it's called Illusions. <br>
<br>
Oh, and just because you can make a post that's ten miles long doesn't mean that you have sufficient knowledge of a subject. I don't know how old you are; I am 38 years old; have my degree and 15 years in industry and politics and have seen many different people do many things; education is really no substitute for experience. <br>
