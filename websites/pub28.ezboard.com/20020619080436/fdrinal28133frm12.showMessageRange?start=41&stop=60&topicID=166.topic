Tanzy was in that group and another warrior. They are both nice people in my opinion and they weren't happy about how looting was going either and disagreeing with it. Seems to me you are skewing lot's of facts from six months ago to substantiate an empty claim. <br>
<br>
I posted the damned log from the supposed ninja incident - it is time to let that go. Every single accusor and accusee was wrong! Balrak was wrong for looting before they cleared up whatever misunderstanding that caused them to think he wasn't in on the roll - Rezfor got more than one item that evenening it wasn't under the last piece policy - because Tanzy died - and Tanzy is the one who really got screwed that whole night don't see her in here complaining. EoS made the &quot;decision&quot; to make a public statement on it with a bias perspective and not taking in all the facts. And the person  managing the loot rolls was wrong for not taking the time to figure out what was going on...he left Balrak out of the roll..but shit happens it was a confusing raid and quite frankly not well organized. I pointed all of that out. No one was right - no one wins!<br>
<br>
I have pointed fingers at Balrak - I don't like the way he treats/speaks to women doesn't mean that I will support every &quot;bogus&quot; claim against him. It is one thing to lay out a good case - but about 99.9% of the in game events conveyed in here are conveyed inaccurately and not supported with any foundation than the brute force of pulling in random readers to support or not support you based upon a &quot;belief&quot; that what you say is true. <br>
<br>
Atunka I remember you having a holy cow that night that people were dispelling your already slowed mob. Well what type of genius does it take to figure out that they were &quot;told&quot; by shaere in all raids to annull every mob. So slow &quot;after&quot; they are annulled.<br>
<br>
No one is perfect - no one is right - and most of you are wrong for bringing this crap up in here in the first place.<br>

JUDO FLAME!<br>
<br>
As for flaming Sut, I did not flame him, I flamed another and Suts name was brought up. Now you may rest easy dearie. Now Hunnyb, you of all should know darn well better then to come here and believe something posted by, some little reject like Synide or his cronies. Ahh but wait, that's right you were 50 and hanging with the big boys and gals while Synide was still trying to figure out how to con something. So I guess you wouldn't know any better then to not believe anything that knave would say, but now you do. So there you have it, I only flame people who deserve it I do not go about flaming those I've never even met. That I leave for Synide and his gang of flower hustlers to exploit upon.<br>
<br>
Going back to that hate raid, the proof was there, showed I was in every right to loot the piece I did. As Tat said, good freaking grief, don't you people get it already! May I remind you, that the 3 groups that had attempted to go up prior to my group all died and that it was my group and one other that went up cleaning up the mess left behind. So to those who are still hardup about that hate raid, remember if it weren't for myself and a few others, you may of had to of waited a long time before you got your corpses back and may of died many more times trying to recover.<br>
<br>
I am not here making fun of anyone BUT those who have criticized me, you should just be damn lucky you didn't keep dying over and over. Thanks to myself and 11 others we broke in hate with ease, then the other 3 groups came up after we cleaned the mess up. I've broken hate before with just 6 prior to kunark, so don't give me this shit about how I ninja looted anything. Shaere was pissed off at me because I told him the way he was running things and yelling at people was wrong. He knew damn well he was screwing me over because I went on two other raids that Shaere had led prior to that one, may I ALSO add it was Shaere ASKING me to come to them. Gee, now why would he do that? Also Shaere turned to me and was asking me to buff him and keep and eye out. Why would someone ask me, when there were 4 other clerics there? I'll let you ponder over that. But here's a hint, when you need to be assured of getting something done right, you turn the person with the know how and experience. I also remember my group saying how I was being shit on and screwed over in cleric rolls, it's funny how you forget that well I DIDN'T and still have the log. A total of 8+ rolls from other Shaere raids was I left out on, I finally had enought that night, who wouldn't! There comes a time where you need to put your foot down and I put mine down, after I had some oger warrior whining like a baby in my ear all night and bitching to Tat about his lame shrink potions. I being the leader said drop it or else, any good group leader has to know how to take charge and direct traffic, well I see I had to play babysitter that night and I made a choice and its one I will stick by. <br>
Some people just don't get it and will only learn the hard way, so I allow them to learn that way but NOT at the expense of my group.<br>
<br>
So to those who said I ninja looted, then every damn piece of planar armor or high end loot you have you are just as guilty. How you ask? Because you got it the same way I did, you rolled the highest or your group did and you looted, so that makes you just as much of a ninja looter, I did nothing anyone else wouldn't have done, I rolled the highest I mentioned I was in on the roll it was a class specific piece I needed and I won the toss. Earlier that night I remember because of the poor organization several other peices of armor rotted because the organizer wasn't doing his job on the loot as Tat said, so since I won I wasn't waiting around to get the OK, I was not going to see one more piece rot. I had clerics tell me I won and loot, they had no hard feelings and congratulated me, so why must a handful of jealous assholes who aren't even clerics come here whining, could you use that piece? No, so shut your pie hole. I had  the backing of several clerics on that win when some disgruntled player began to claim I ninja looted, to those people I say again, grow the hell up. For a game you truly make me sick as a player because you're such a poor ass sport. Lifes full of challenges mine is this to you, to just move on and grow the hell up already and quit trying to spread gossip about others that isn't true. Not with me but with everyone and many of you do that daily on here.<br>
<br>
Tat thanks for the backing on that, however stop with the I am a female hater crap. Really, you dog men far more then you think and did you think that I only was doing to you what you did around me in game? I'm not your foe nor friend. Consider it a neutral stance. <br>
<br>
Anyhow enough said, I laugh at how people still are bitching 6 months later. Grow up will you.<br>

All I said was that I figured you must have missed it the first few times when the whole situation was going on. I don't have a stake in it from any point seeing as how I don't really know any of you involved. I havent seen Balrak since (and as I said in my first post, I could only relay what I saw based on the 6 hours or so I was with him), haven't seen Tatianae since, and haven't seen whatever the ogre's name was since either. <br>
<br>
Apparently, by the way you have reacted, it must be impossible for you to have missed something going on in group say even when you were as busy as you were. Ok, maybe it was lagged and never came through to you. Whatever. We both have different memories of exactly what went on. I know that I saw him say he needed one or the other, and if ya couldn't keep it up all the time then don't use it at all because he needed one or the other at all times. Perhaps it got lagged out on your screen. I do know it was more than twice because I was the one feeding him the potions as I made them (after he used his first couple that is.). The whole point of what I was trying to say was not that Tatianae is a bitch because she wouldn't keep a stupid ass, unimportant spell on some ogre warrior. My point was that based on what I remember from what was going on in group, I felt Balrak was irrational due to the way he handled himself. <br>
<br>
I suppose if you somehow construe that as being &quot;flamed&quot;, I can't do anything to change that. <br>

He didn't have &quot;his first couple&quot; he had 0 shrink potions to start that is why he needed the buff.

<br>
Go the fuck away, we flame with facts not fiction, other than balrak who seems to be in a god damn world of his own.  He's one of the stupidest pieces of shit on drinal, and he never logs on.  We'll just put a dunce cap on him and call him Drinal's Own EZBoard dunce.<br>

I'm not going to bother typing more.<br>
