Domiel i dont know much about except i never liked him much, the few times i have grouped with him all he could do is try and cyber with driin and do emotes/the grp chat...he comes off as a horny kid to me<br><br><br>when the server first came up driin carran elessara araxen and i were guilded in Avatar along with a druid named troe and kaylum which both no longer play, we always grouped with eachother on tunare, we were all level 60 then and when drinal came up we movelogged over and when we got here what we found was a REALLY gimp server, nobody believed that doing juggs in seb with 1 group was even possible even though driin carran elessara araxen and i did it without even a full grp before *clearing all the way down to reets and camping there for exp without a monk puller* there were only like 2-3 trakanon bp's on server, i had one of them and there were like 8 trak teeth across the whole server, kaylum troe and myself all had one that i can remember, Avatar as a guild kept to itself for the most part except myself, i went on an early cih raid versus trakanon in which they almost wiped out and only like 4 people lived at the end with me getting killing blow after trak had ran down the ramp and begun to gate, solo exp. i didnt join them, even tho i got tells from at least half of the long time cih members to join, only grouping with my guildmembers *avatar* when sebilis and doing juggs got boring we moved onto velious, we mostly did kael because we decided to be on dragon faction, we camped arena area *which again nobody believed it was possible for 1 group to camp it* eventually we did the protectors of zek and the mobs needed for elessara's bracer quest which are tallon and vallon healers i believe *dont think anyone on this server has ever done that with 1 grp besides us* and we camped velketor once or twice, the un nerfed velketors kobolds which at the time were godly mobs but now are weak pussys because verant nerfed them and are now great exp which is why velketors is camped out the ass and we even camped temple of veeshan with our 5 man team with carran playing a monk named crak on his second comp to pull, we camped the zoneline and pulled mobs to there, and we did dragon necropolis so we did basically everything there was to do and were bored so we joined cih because there was no other guild worth joining at the time, they were still starting out, were doing trak wuoshi and lord djorn in velk only, no dain or PoM or western wastes dragons, fast forward a little the guild wants to start doing stuff like dain and west wastes, carran as a druid was always half leading the raids, he was either pulling making grps or leading whole raids, he pulled most of the first dain kills that cih did along with shinro and apoc, i remember carran being the only reason cih  could even think about doing western wastes because he knew the zone so well and nobody else could pull except him and the first raids to tov were made by carran because he had done the zone alot and he could pull the mobs, i remember the first time cih did klandicar carran showed cih where to go to setup for the pull and he pulled, i remember inviting camaan to join the grp to go to arena in kael and it being camped by him every chance he got and the word getting out on how easy it was to camp arena in kael, i remember how much i hated Clan skallagrim..all the newbie cunts and them training/ks'ing..<br><br>so basically i was pretty stunned when i came back and learn carran was actually booted from cih,  there were lots of fights and frequently between the original group of friends but the reason i made this flame is how fucked up the situation had actually become and what happend in guild chat, heres a log..<br><br>[Fri Sep 07

and she used them against him by disbanding from the guild and in this sorta case the guild shouldnt be involved at all except for the officers and definitely not in guild chat or the forums, it was a fight between carran domiel and driin, carran and driin were once upon a time in a RL relationship and they broke up...they hate eachother...so its easy to understand why they would be at eachothers throat when driin wanted to invite a person that makes flirting emotes all the time and is pretty annoying in general  and was always *hanging on driins nut sack* as you see it in the log and driin/domiel pushing it/not discussing it *they had eachother on ignore* to the point where carran threatens kerney *both sides should of been disciplined if any*, i didnt like domiel because of all the flirting he did and i never even knew driin in RL so its easy to understand just how annoyed carran would be by domiel being around and its pretty laughable they used carran threatening kerney as an excuse to boot him laf, CiH as a guild has lost my respect, pretty fucked up in how it went down and how CiH didnt show any respect or understanding to one of its finest members *i bet most of them have never even said more then 2 words to him before besides when they needed him for a port or they were on a raid, they have nooo idea* carran is a guy that does what he thinks is right and nobody tells him what to do or how he should do it. <br><br>neither side was right really and all parties were pretty messed up in what they did and not taking it to tells, especially the officers. a big fuck you to all the people jumping on the lynch carran bandwagon without knowing him or the story behind it and just judging him by what you have heard him say or what people told you.<br><br>*edit*<br><br>im not argruing that he shouldnt of been guild removed BUT i am saying that ALL sides were more then then guilty of doing shitty stuff, mostly the guild itself and its members and what you see in the guild chat and how it looks in general, carran also did some pretty fucked up stuff to but the way it went down made it look like it was him alone to the guild, the officers taking sides in guild chat with him on and starting the whole thing then with people jumping on the bandwagon without really knowing much...it was wrong.<br><br>and i also removed alot of the rambling that really didnt need to be in the post, more to the point.<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A

You say this conflict, internal to CiH and its members, should have been handled in email but you post it on a public board?  Oh well, as you can see form the log there I clearly stated on several occasions that it was the officers fault this whole situation got as out of hand as it did.  I take full responsibility for it and I never tried to pass the buck off.  Despite what I am sure some people think about this whole mess I didnt enjoy it for even one second.  The entire situation was causing a LOT of tension throughout the entire guild and it was manifesting in bad ways.  Ok so you dont agree with what the officers decided fine, I can live with it.  It wouldnt be the first time.  I however dont think that you can say that because someone did something in the past to help this or that person that it gives them a free pass for misbehavior.  Regardless officers fucked up and thats that, I never denied it.

Actually what you are doing here is just as bad if not worse than what you are accusing us of.  You are jumping to conclusions without all the facts that lead to the decision that was made within the guild.  You may not like how it was conducted, but there were good valid reasons for airing this in guild chat for all to read.  You may question that, and its your right, but you do not know the circumstances.  Respect is also a two way street.  And once again you seem to believe that because someone did something great in the past it gives them a free pass for bad behavior in the future.  It doesnt, not in the game and not in real life.

I think this was totally the wrong way to realese it in guildchat people get heated.  People say things they regret.  Words do hurt.  10 mins of yelling can take 10 years to repair.  We all learn this, some slower than others...<br><br>edit: just wanna make a comment about you guys saying we were a bunch of gimps when we came to drinal.  I don't hold any anger etc.  But AL is the reason why none of us had trak bps, trak teeth etc.  We didn't have a chance.  It was HUGE when CiH killed trak for the first time.  People were shouting in every zone.  AL dominated MM in a way no one from tunare will ever understand.  You guys will never understand how hard it is to compete with aruguable one of the best guilds in EQ.  Their core is insanly motivated.  Which is why they swept the past BotB's and why so many of their members had the server award and some of the server wide awards.  <br> <p><b>Meneldil Magnus</b><br>Arch Mage of Crimson Twilight</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeneldil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meneldil</A> at: 1/6/02 11:48:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzzod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zzod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/6/02 11:53:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Old News, New Flame.</span><hr size=1> damn, I am a funny fucker /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubalrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balrak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/7/02 7:49:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Old News, New Flame.</span><hr size=1> Meneldil I will argue one point with you and that would be AL's dominance. Sure they were good but they did not own MM like so many of you like to think. In fact I was part of many times where we did a sharing of mobs. You guys make AL out to be so nasty at times yet they really weren't. Perhaps it's because I knew many there and got along well with most. Sometimes it's easier to criticize someone than to give them credit. <br><br>Not picking on people who say AL was bad, I am sure at times they did toss there weight around, but one way or another it came back to bite them in the buns. I recall a few situations were it did, haha. Anywho, if we want to make a case out of it I could easily say the same about CiH trying to claim zones but I do recall stepping in not and backing down to them either. So you see many are guilty of it not just one guild. Everytime you go to the planes, in a way don't you claim the zone? Sure it's claiming, the difference is that most often you're allowing a diverse number from other guilds to come in as well, that's where there is a difference when you've given a whole slew of other nonmembers of your guild a chance to win some items and gain some exps. <br><br><br>Balrak <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoddaduma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nodda Duma </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/7/02 8:35:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ridgenet.net/~opticman/tincanhead.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Old News, New Flame.</span><hr size=1> Anyone who says AL didn't dominate Mith Marr doesn't know what he's talking about.  They dominated because they could be anywhere in Norrath w/in 15 minutes of deciding to go there.  The only people who ever came close to breaking this monopoly was RF and then CiH, and CiH only killed Trakanon twice there (after AL was pretty much done w/ him FYI).  If AL ever shared mobs with you, it was because they didn't care about the mob to begin with.  It sure as hell wasn't because they were forced to share.<br><br>About CiH wanting to step in and claim a zone and you standing up to it...stop supplying vague references.
