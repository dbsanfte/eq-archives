<br>
1) you KS glyhped, and you pissed some of our members ROYALLY off. We had been waiting 6 straight hours on this opportunity and you gotta try to understand the frustration.<br>
<br>
2) two of our members DID ninjaloot from you, and I was the one that called a GM to me to straight this up. I was even in group with the ninjalooter and I /reported the looter since I got the loot message. Now, you gotta understand that even tho I was quite disappointed on CiH and how you acted with this. We even CR'ed some of your guys earlier and by KSing you show the appreciation.<br>
<br>
3) I straightened the ninjalooting up, but I didn't kick the ninjalooters out of the guild - because people do stupid things when they are pissed off ( or always if they are member of Cats in Hats it seems to me )<br>
<br>
4) I have gotten quite little appreciation from CiH for helping out. In fact, I can tell you a lot of people who straight out called me an asshole because of the incident. WTF ? Thanks for letting me help you guys out. <br>
<br>
5) CiH keeps telling the story where they killed Glyphed and where the nasty Vice ninjalooted. I have yet to see ONE posting where CiH KSed something 40 vice worked with for 6 hours, where 50 CiH hangs over their shoulders, adding insane lag - leaving no room for making tactics, treating Vice like shit and the second something goes against you - you petition, whine, swear and f*ckin cry. Guys... You made your bed, now you are forced to sleep in it. YOU shape your opponents, and they will give you the same respect you give them. <br>
<br>
6) when we were working on summoning glyphed, 1 CiH member sat silently in a corner watching until we moved a bit, then trained a warden up the tube to stop us from getting the spawn. What kind of shit is that ???  I *SERIOUSLY* doubt that 1 ranger is enough to kill glyphed, so don't come here and say you had sufficient force and was in right to do it.<br>
<br>
7) the day before, both vice and CiH meets up to do glyphed, Vice started killing taskmasters and CiH suprizingly (not) started KSing us. Heck, you guys even ninjalooted Altec's pouch that he needed for emperor key. ( I'm pretty sure you remember because I accused you, fattee ) We continue to work through the taskmasters, and gets to the rhoz, whereof he gated and went under the world.  Of course - CiH blames Vice and tells us we were really bad people for letting it gate ? Why would we want that ??? I guess that thought never crossed your mind.<br>
<br>
Who's the real asshole here ? Why do I get to deal with all this CRAP from CiH ?? What give you the right to be a rightful asshole of the server ? <br>
I won't lift a finger to help CiH before I get some appreciation for helping out, otherwise - why would I care ?  You certainly don't seem to care. <br>
<br>
How can I tell my members to be nice to people that treat them like a dick ?   And by &quot;them&quot; I mean me, the leader of vice. The way you treat me - is the way you treat whole Vice. I'm more than willing to straight up people, but not before CiH stop acting like a hurd of assholes when I work to my extent - and at the cost of my members - for nothing but crap.<br>
<br>
If it was a proper guild, like WL/CT/FeMax/IB/Darkmoons... you have my word I'd do something about it. But CiH ?   They don't care, it wouldn't mean anything to you guys. That's my experience anyway. And all of you know me. I don't get upset - even when I use rather harsh words, I am always willing to talk about situations and solve them, I go for the fair deal - even when I loose on it. But I'm being worn down by all this shit, and now I'm so tired I don't know if I wanna lead any guild that shares CiH's server - which would change Vice to a guild into something you don't want. Ever thought about what would happen if we changed leader ? It has proven that agressive officers has done a lot for vice during it's growth.<br>
<br>
CiH said it themselves anyway, there's no rules between guilds for them, now accept it or change attitude. <br>
<br>
lol, yea... throden had a great one &quot;so you train and plan to KS TK's aaryonar ??? oh god you guys are low&quot;.  Heh, checked the mirror yet throden ?? =)  <br>
-No, we didn't train them - but I was playing a char that saw what happened....who also died when -TK's- monk brought eashen and all his friends to camp. When an int caster has time enough to both see people die like mad - AND have time to get 2 gates intterrupted - you ain't the trainee.<br>
-Yes, according to our PREMADE DEAL, we had the right to try aary when they wiped ( since they had 1 or 2 clerics ). <br>
<br>
CiH does it easier.. They don't deal - they just do it. Saves time to not respect others, but as you see - you do risk to piss people off, and that DOES change people and their respect for you.<br>
