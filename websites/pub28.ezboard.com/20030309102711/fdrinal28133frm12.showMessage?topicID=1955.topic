<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Blaze Odead: I don't know what the hell happened to you between the time I went to sleep and the time you posted that shit, but that was totally unneeded.<br>
Blaze Odead: Saying Morbeas orchestrated it?<br>
LaSKo220: I'm sorry, SHE GOT MY PHONE NUMBER<br>
Blaze Odead: Maybe you didn't know I always have all my internet conversations logged<br>
Blaze Odead: And?<br>
Blaze Odead: What was she going to do?<br>
Blaze Odead: You did nothing.<br>
LaSKo220: my mother was awake and said to give in, and I was going to anyways.<br>
Blaze Odead: Well, its too bad you and your mom didn't think about what she had already threatened you to do<br>
Blaze Odead: er, threatened you with<br>
Blaze Odead: I knew you would start giving up whatever it was that was happening, maybe revenge.<br>
Blaze Odead: You could have just stopped<br>
Blaze Odead: She had nothing on you, you even told me that.<br>
LaSKo220: No, but Blaze, I'm the only person she knew in texas<br>
LaSKo220: she called me.<br>
LaSKo220: she got my phone number<br>
LaSKo220: and called me<br>
LaSKo220: at 11:45 PM<br>
Blaze Odead: And?<br>
LaSKo220: she kept me up until 2:30<br>
Blaze Odead: What?  Did she threaten to come and beat you up?<br>
Blaze Odead: How<br>
LaSKo220: no, she had called the cops<br>
Blaze Odead: And what were they going to do?<br>
LaSKo220: the FBI is getting involved in this... there was a three way conversation with her me and a few officials.<br>
Blaze Odead: It's too bad there is nothing to get involved in<br>
LaSKo220: I cannot explain it. :-\ I really am sorry Blaze. I was going to be arrested last night if I did not do what I did.<br>
Blaze Odead: I have a hard time believing that.<br>
Blaze Odead: Arrested at 15 for what?  If they told you no charges<br>
Blaze Odead: They could do nothing.<br>
Blaze Odead: Jesus christ, there wasn't even anything to do<br>
LaSKo220: Blaze, do you know what she was doing?<br>
LaSKo220: she talked to my mother<br>
LaSKo220: and if I wouldn't have given in to my MOTHER<br>
LaSKo220: I would be really fucked.<br>
Blaze Odead: It's too bad your mom didn't understand that the person that called you is crazy<br>
Blaze Odead: and we did nothing wrong<br>
Blaze Odead: and that she is grasping at straws now<br>
Blaze Odead: sweet jesus, what did they charge you with?  Did the cops/FBI come to your house?<br>
LaSKo220: Yes, my mother understood that<br>
Blaze Odead: Did they SHOW YOU their badge?<br>
LaSKo220: no, but I got to have a nice conversation with one of them on the phone.<br>
LaSKo220: my mother has known about all of this<br>
LaSKo220: she said to play it safe<br>
LaSKo220: and I said no<br>
LaSKo220: she said do it. I said no<br>
LaSKo220: she said that I'd be grounded, and I've never been grounded, so I did it.<br>
Blaze Odead: so you talked to someone, who said he was a cop<br>
Blaze Odead: But you never did know if he was for sure<br>
Blaze Odead: he never gave you a badge number or anything<br>
LaSKo220: called ID says Houston Police Department<br>
LaSKo220: and he did, but I didnt bother to write it down<br>
LaSKo220: I was too busy freaking out, sorry.<br>
Blaze Odead: Too bad you gave in.<br>
Blaze Odead: and saying exactly what Tat told you to say<br>
Blaze Odead: Makes you so much worse.<br>
LaSKo220: There's a lot behind the story.<br>
Blaze Odead: Which no one has said anything about.  So I'll imagine the rest<br>
LaSKo220: She got my phone number by calling &quot;information&quot; and asking for ME o.o<br>
Blaze Odead: She told you to implicate Morbeas, didn't she<br>
Blaze Odead: She told you to put &quot;orchestrated by Morbeas&quot;<br>
LaSKo220: she told me what to type.<br>
Blaze Odead: because she has a vendetta against him, and like he has against her<br>
Blaze Odead: Sad.<br>
Blaze Odead: You seemed much more of a free thinker.<br>
LaSKo220: I AM A FUCKING FREE THINKING I CANNOT HELP THAT MY HOUSE WAS CALLED AT 11:45PM BY A VERY UPSET AND PISSED OFF TATIANAE<br>
LaSKo220: THINKER*<br>
LaSKo220: YOU WERE LIED TO, WE ALL WERE.<br>
LaSKo220: THAT CONVERSATION I WAS HAVING?!<br>
LaSKo220: WASNT EVEN HER<br>
Blaze Odead: Sure<br>
Blaze Odead: Did she prove it?<br>
Blaze Odead: I doubt it.<br>
Blaze Odead: She freaked out with her personal pic being posted under his ezboard name Tatianae Fatecaster that was registered since like 2001 on the Drinal boards<br>
Blaze Odead: then i banned that, and she continued to email me<br>
Blaze Odead: Anyways, I have better things to do now.<br>
LaSKo220: okay, since, I guess I'm such a liar.<br>
LaSKo220: the messageboard might be removed.<br>
Blaze Odead: For what?<br>
LaSKo220: Demello is sick of everything that is going on on it.<br>
Blaze Odead: I still haven't heard any charges<br>
Blaze Odead: He's sick of Tat spamming his inbox<br>
Blaze Odead: with her lunatic ravings<br>
LaSKo220: Harassment of Tatianae<br>
LaSKo220: Yes, Blaze, if I could trust you, I'd say that I was fucking pissed and I still am that I gave in to it.<br>
Blaze Odead: harassment, lol<br>
Blaze Odead: Okay<br>
Blaze Odead: In an environment like the flame boards<br>
Blaze Odead: she was being harassed.<br>
LaSKo220: I know, that's what I said<br>
LaSKo220: I laughed at her on the phone when she said that<br>
LaSKo220: and I told her that<br>
LaSKo220: er, when she said that<br>
Blaze Odead: Morbeas is going to ream you for saying that he orchestrated this shit, when he didn't.<br>
LaSKo220: god dammit, Blaze, do you really  think I wanted to do that?<br>
Blaze Odead: You were just as much a part of it as he was<br>
Blaze Odead: You didn't have to.  She had nothing.  appearances in court due to someone elses claims don't go on records<br>
LaSKo220: Yeah, but she promised never to email me, talk to me, call me, or anything unless I contacted her first.<br>
Blaze Odead: heh<br>
Blaze Odead: It's funny<br>
Blaze Odead: I hope she didn't tell you never to tell anyone about this<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hey Briyan, you never had problems before but all that has now changed when you LIED and tried to implicate ME!  Good luck to you, you surely will need it.<br>

She posted my real name and others without permission. WAIT! Isnt' that what she's complaining about?<br>
<br>
She's harassed Elay, Briyan, the admin's at Drinal, the COO of Ezboard and other people on the board.  WAIT!  Isn't harassment what she is complaining about?<br>
<br>
She's spoofed her IP to gain access to a board she was banned from.<br>
<br>
She's coerced a minor to lie.<br>
<br>
She's lied.<br>
<br>
She has a past history of this very same problem.<br>

NOT...<br>
<br>
Either Briyan was making up that whole thing cause he didn't wanna look like a wuss for having the smack down brought on him by his mommy, or he really was stupid enough to believe that some third person on the phone (undoubtedly a friend of Tats if said conversation did exist) was an FBI agent.<br>
<br>
Briyan .... Why do you think she is hassling you in the middle of the night? It's cause it's the only thing she can do.  No law enforcement officer or lawyer probably woudl give two hoots about some deranged person coming in and complaining about teh junk that is being complained about in this instance.<br>
<br>
Other than a good chuckle this week, I gotta say this is old and we need something more interesting to get up on the boards.  I think I will start to terrorize Norrath with one of my chars so folks start to flame me. Might bring some fun back to these boards, lol.<br>

You have now shown not only me, but a mass community of players that come here to the boards, that you lied. I rarely, if ever, will trust a person who lies and I am sure many others feel the same.<br>
<br>
I know all about life’s pressures but you don’t make one more lie to cover another, this is what we call the snowball effect and in the end it’s far worse than had you told the truth to begin with. But now, who’s to say you were ever telling the truth? You've managed to dig yourself quite a hole...<br>
<br>
Your stories don’t add up, and even if they did do you not realize how much fault the other person was in? You cannot tell me the police would have aided them in the harassment of your family at 11 o’clock at night, let alone a minor. I know MANY local and state police, I can tell you right now that in no way would the police or FBI approached this as you described. One quick example of what I am talking about is this, a recap of what you said to Blaze:<br>
“LaSKo220: Yeah, but she promised never to email me, talk to me, call me, or anything unless I contacted her first.”<br>
<br>
You’re a minor, you can’t sign or make any legal agreements WITHOUT your parents/guardians consent. Strike one and I assure you the perpetrator knows this as well. So the point of this is, that even if you did agree it has no meaning legally. <br>
<br>
Doofy had this to add later:<br>
“lets not forget impersonating a federal offical, or a police officer is also a crime”<br>
<br>
Well said Doofy, not only is that a crime, but a mighty Federal one at that. You know what that means…the perpetrator is in deep doo doo. There is no pay a fine and walk, oh no we’re talking you soon become someone’s new lover behind bars. Plus the person you tricked has the right to sue you silly and I can tell you now that the plaintiff will win, and win big. I recently spoke with a lady who’s brother *a doctor* had a guy come into his office and claim he was from OSHA and later it turned out he wasn’t. He was a safety advisor working for an advisement company that has no affiliation with the Federal agency OSHA “Occupational Safety and Health Administration”. Doesn’t matter, he still claimed to be from OSHA, well guess where the impersonator is now? Why he’s sitting pretty behind bars pleasing all the men in his cell block, and in the meantime his bank account was handed over to the plaintiff. <br>
<br>
If people were only more honest they could avoid all of these trivial headaches that plague our society. <br>

<br>
Did you read my earlier post about Bryian?  Notice how close I hit the mark.  <br>
How did I figure that out?  Because that is all Tat can do, call people up, email them and make threats.  <br>
<br>
She won't DARE call you up, you know why, she knows that you would immediately *65 (Is it 65 in your state?) And report harrasment.  65 in my state is logged at the police department as a harrasment call.<br>
<br>
Just a few things to help you in the tat fight, keep your answering machine handy.  If she does leave a message *65 it.  Record the message. (The answering machine does all the beeping you need for legal purposes)  If she calls when you are home, hit the record button on the answering machine.  You will be protected.<br>
<br>
In no way do you CALL HER!  She will use these EXACT methods against you.  Do not email her, telephone her or anything else of that nature (Contacting her direct).  Look at what she made Bryan say, she is trying to get you pissed off enough to do something stupid.<br>
<br>
BTW : Local police deal with threats to property or body.  Not identity, that's the FBI's job.  Especially at 11:45 at night, they do not call you up, they GO TO YOUR HOUSE!  And umm...since when do conference calls show up on Caller id?<br>
