It's people like you, and attitudes like yours, that continue to perpetuate the divide that exists between all races.<br>

If I was a native American and I came on here and made a joke about white people stealing our land, would you be offended? No, unless you are really fucked up.

I guess I will just do like you, and drop stereotypical comments about people of Asian extraction all over the place.<br>
<br>
Methinks you protest a bit much tho.<br>
<br>
As for my racism, since you don't know me, you can't know anything about how I live my life. But I try very hard to judge people on their individual merits, and keep stereotypes out of my thinking.<br>
<br>
My individual judgement of you is that while you may not be a racist, you are a dumb fuck who opens his mouth too quick to drop lines about &quot;blacks&quot; running away with TVs -- and then goes balistic when yer called on it. It's a logical fallacy, btw, to accuse your accusors of your crime as a defence. &quot;Yeah? Well YOU hit someone too!&quot; is kind of a lame excuse for ignorance and bigotry don't you think?<br>
<br>
BTW, is your name &quot;Asian&quot; a character name or is it just another way for someone to be anon on the boards?<br>
<br>
Hey, if you wanna offend people, that's your choice. If I've offended you, then that's cool too. I meant to. It's a flame board.<br>
<br>
I will tell you however, that if you want to make cracker or pie-eye jokes, it wouldn't bother me one damned bit since my ethnic background pretty much owns the world.<br>
<br>
One trait of some other nations is to copy or emulate the nation they look up to. You may want to pick and choose better the things you are looking to steal; best to keep it to cameras, cars, electronics, stuff like that and forget about bigotry, penis envy, and ignorance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/5/02 1:20:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=839.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/mdenny/_images/ez_pic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fibwin is God.</span><hr size=1> Sorry yall that was posted in a fit of pique.

But there is nothing funny about making funny of racial stero types and if your really asian you probably got it worse than most so don't pretend its not.  I am native American, Other than being the smallest minority in the US, I haven't ever really experienced racism.  But I know for a fact growing up in NYC that Asian people (Baring China town) took the most abuse.  I remember seeing chinese kids running home everyday, not cause they were in a rush but to avoid a vicious beating.  And if it never happened to you, then your lucky but if it did, don't tell me that all the racist shit you deal with doesn't bother you cause your BSing.  Truth is you probably got it worse from some of the bro's and thats why you said the TV statement.  Deny it if you like, but I know the truth.  Just like Fib or whatever account he bought from playerauction this week has never been laid without paying for it.  Thats the only reason I can see your so pissed.  your an angry little man, that people shit on, and this game is the only sense of power you have.  You know whats the really sad part Fib/whatever your name.  Your greatest accomplishment in live was asking your mom for a credit card so you can buy an account somebody put real time into.  But seriously Fib, smack your parents around for me, it is obvious the bastards didn't hug you near enough, why else would you be such an ass.  Asian took all the attention from you, you couldn't take it like an angry little kid you had to scream and shout and have everyone look at you.  Wipe the tears sad little boy, I will be the daddy you never had.  <br>
