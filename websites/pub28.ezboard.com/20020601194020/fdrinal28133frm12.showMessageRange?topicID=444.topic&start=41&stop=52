<br>
1)  A chanter that doesn't want the melees to wait before breaking mezz and doesn't want to get hit, has the tools to do so.  Mind wipe line.....<br>
<br>
2) Yes a good puller can spend time pulling just singles to the camp, but it is much more efficient to pull back 3 to 5 and then line them up.  Why run back and forth those extra times if you don't have to.  <br>
<br>
3) Depending on where you are fighitng chanters may not need to med either (I have almost never needed to med in seb).<br>
<br>
4) Bards Rock<br>
<br>
5) Chanters rock<br>
<br>
6) Um....oh yeah all classes rock if the person behind the keyboard is quality.<br>

Lvl 54 enchanter LFG or Lvl 54 bard LFG- I think everyone knows who would get picked.--The enchanter-- For those enchanters that are getting hit so much that they die, its because they don't know what root is and the tanks suck. But luckily usually there is at least 1 good tank in each group. And if an enchanter mezzes one so much that they know they are gonna be beat on, before tanks break mezz, memory blur the mob. And if an enchanter is getting beat on thats what a healer is for. I have a lvl 30 bard as well and I understand that enchanters are always gonna get a group before me. Clarity that you always will have compareed to clarity you get during down time or a permanent 60% haste to a 20% haste and str. I think any tank would much rather take 60% haste compared to 20% and some str Its a simple choice. Verant has to keep making new and better things for bards since they are never getting a group when a enchanter is around. Now I like bards so don't get all pist on my post, but seriously the bard that posted this has to grow up.<br>

It did bring up a couple questions I have regarding bards (I have one but he is only level 22, so for practical purposes I don't know squat about them from a first person stand point).  I can understand the point that the long study on bards was trying to make about the rate of improvement in spells/damage/etc..  across levels not being comprable to other classes; however, I felt that this perhaps was too compartmentalized an arguement.  That is to say, the discussion compares bards to different classes for each of the different comparisons that are done. Doesn't this in itself just reveal an unspoken strength of the bard, i.e. versatility.  It seems that although the abilities are not improving at same rate, perhaps the versatility is increasing. <br>
     From a grouping perspective I find that bards are wonderful to group with because they can augment whatever group in which they find themselves.  Their ability to contribute seems much more dependent on style and need than other classes.  I always had the understanding that grouping was ideal for bards as a group and bard would thrive together.  <br>
     I want to ask about just the graph pertaining to damage.  If the bard is increasing across levels in damage output from a song, and is also increasing across levels as far as melee damage, wouldn't this allow for curves of improvement for damage per second that more closely matched other curves?  Wizards on that graph are only casting, same with druids, well shouldn't we then compare total possible bard damage output for a decent comparison.  Likewise, let's consider the healing done by bards.  During the time that a bard is providing some regen, aren't they also able to melee and/or help the group to take out mobs faster, therefore taking less damage (possible to consider this another form of healing)? <br>
     Seems to me that this link doesn't focus on the good things that bards can do, nor does it provide for fair comparisons.  An obvious point that is missed is that bard songs stack very well.  If the group wants less down time and more fun, seems that having a bard join is a great addition, regardless of level. They can fit in with different group make-ups better than other classes.  As with all classes, seems the only stipulation would be how well the character is played.<br>
<br>
Well, obvisously I am bored at work and thought I would banter for a bit. <br>

<br>
My first reaction is to just say something flippant, but instead I’ll take the time to explain why I think it’s a misleading report.<br>
<br>
While it’s certainly true that bards do not increase in any particular ability at the same rate as the other classes that specialize in that ability, that’s not restricted to bards.  It’s true of EVERY ability shared by a class that specializes in that ability and another class that doesn’t specialize.  At level 1, everybody pretty much has the same ability as far as melee is concerned.  As levels progress, the classes that specialize in it increase in that ability at a much faster rate then classes that don’t.  The less that your class specializes in it, the flatter the growth curve.  The same is true of healing.  At level 1, druids, shaman, &amp; clerics all heal at the same level of efficiency, but as levels increase, it becomes obvious that the curve detailing the increase in that ability is much flatter for druids &amp; shaman then it is for clerics.<br>
<br>
If you want bards to increase along the same curve as enchanters regarding haste &amp; mana regen, then you should be willing to give up all of your other abilities.  If you want to gain melee ability along the same curve as other melee classes, then you should be willing to give up your abilities those classes are restricted from.  A bards value is their versatility, not their specialization.<br>
<br>
It should be just as valid for every other class to complain because their versatility doesn’t increase along the same curve as the bard.  Clerics, enchanters, rogues, warriors, wizards are all classes that focus on specialization.  The higher the level, the more that specialization becomes evident.  Other classes realize this as well, but not to the extent of the specialized classes.  The more versatile your class, the slower your abilities grows, because you are growing in more then one area.<br>
<br>
Another aspect to consider is that, while thott’s graphs do a great job of showing how bards aren’t as efficient as other classes, and that their efficiency in comparison becomes worse as time goes on, he neglects to mention that bards aren’t doing just that one thing he mentioned.  When an enchanter is medding to cast that clarity he talks about, that’s all the enchanter is doing.  When the bard is singing some form of haste &amp; cantana, he’s giving mana regen, healing, stamina, haste, and also dishing out some damage.  Then, when the situation calls for it, he can temporarily sacrifice some effectiveness in those areas and include snaring, crowd control, travel abilities, debuffing, increased resistances, etc.  No other class comes close to the versatility of the bard.  I’m sorry, but saying that you should be able to multi task like that, and be efficient too is just a bit much, don’t you think?<br>

I'm not going to turn this into a class balance issue because that is not why I'm replying.<br>
<br>
To Phaestus and Asanti: I am not denying the versatility of bards at all (song twisting).  On the contrary I would extol it since without it, the bard class would be extremely boring. <br>
<br>
From level's 1 thru...30 the bard class is way too powered.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Quite simply put, it's our songs. They are coded different than caster spells and they give the class it's sense of leniency. In PvP circumstances, it's a complete blowout. No other class from lvl's one to 40 can compensate as much technique as a bard can. <br>
<br>
You can argue and claim otherwise but it's true. Truth is: there is no class that can fear without the use of manna, mez without the use of manna, regen/hp without the use of manna, cast any magic based spells.  (Disregarding right-clicking items of course).  Again allow me to reiterate that I'm solely speaking for levels one thru 30/40<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If the bard is increasing across levels in damage output from a song, and is also increasing across levels as far as melee damage, wouldn't this allow for curves of improvement for damage per second that more closely matched other curves? Wizards on that graph are only casting, same with druids, well shouldn't we then compare total possible bard damage output for a decent comparison. Likewise, let's consider the healing done by bards. During the time that a bard is providing some regen, aren't they also able to melee and/or help the group to take out mobs faster, therefore taking less damage (possible to consider this another form of healing)? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I concur completley.  No one is denying a bard's ability to heal or an enchanter's ability to haste.  The Breath of Harmony's effect Niv's Melody of Preservation can be taken into account as &quot;free&quot; hp regen as well and could possibly shift the graph upwards.  <br>
<br>
When I look at the graph, I don't take into account melee damage.  I see a comparison between, spell and song. A bards best nuke is an AoE nuke at 43.  Sadly it can only be used once, two at the most...that's it.  <br>
<br>
Take a look at the graph closely.  From level's one to seven a bard's nuking skill matches that of a wizard or druid.  As each classes's level increases their power increases.  Same goes for hp/regen ability and manna regen.  The resolution to this was...stacking ability.  Thott put it best:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Bards are marathon runners, casters are sprinters.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
That makes sense.  How about post level 30/40.  <br>
Velious expansion songs were a joke except for Occlusion of Sound. I think every bard still playing agrees with me on this one..including Aftathott.  <br>
<br>
Charm/fear/mez became capped... (Again, excluding pvp circumstances) and the graph once again shifts downwards. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
@ Asanti:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It should be just as valid for every other class to complain because their versatility doesn’t increase along the same curve as the bard. Clerics, enchanters, rogues, warriors, wizards are all classes that focus on specialization. The higher the level, the more that specialization becomes evident.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm going to bite here and assume by versatility you mean stacking ability/song twisting.  From levels 1 to 30 yes, I would agree with you wholeheartedly. After 50, I would disagree. <br>
From Article:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Charm is wonderful at 27, too wonderful in fact, it should in my opinion be gimped, either by reducing its range or by having it require mana. Charm kiting is simply too powerful. It is my hope that the flat power curves are not left as they are as a punishment to the class for the 10 levels of charm kiting glory<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Generally what I found is that power for all classes rises proportional to level squared, except for bards. For bards power rises proportional to level. I did this analysis when after a long period of time playing I began to feel that bard power simply didn't improve equal to other classes. All the songs improved, and higher level ones were a bit better, but it just felt like the class as a whole wasn't improving properly. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now with Luclin release, I'm sure anyone would agree it's a completely different story for not only bards but <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> classes.  Power graphs need to be calculated differently and with Alternate Advance points the story changes entirely. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No other class comes close to the versatility of the bard. I’m sorry, but saying that you should be able to multi task like that, and be efficient too is just a bit much, don’t you think?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What's wrong with being efficient?  Taking efficiency in its literal term...I agree.  Bards are extremly efficient. Than again so is every single class this game has to offer. To be brutally honest, I'm very pleased with the bard class as it stands for now.<br>

P.S. I don't know this for certain, but I don't think Thott's power curves were drawn to plead to VI/Sony for more &quot;efficiency, &quot; on the contrary I look at them as a means of calculation/communication between bards and other races in Everquest. <br>

Similarly, that was my intent behind showing the hyperlink. <br>
