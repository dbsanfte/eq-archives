this is a totally untrue statement. there is a cast time on these items, and all FD spells for SKs. meaning you will die within the few second of casting. no SK has a instant cast item or spell. SKs cannot pull anthing without a insta cast spell/item. (monks FD instantly that is why they pull)&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I never said there was no cast time on Death Peace or BE Greaves. I said there was no REcast time. The worst thing that can happen when a monk pulls is when his FD fails, and believe me, ask around, and ppl will tell ya FD can fail a LOT no matter what level you are, and usually at the worst times.<br>
 And of course, on high end raids, a failed FD by a monk usually means instant death. This is where the advantage of the sk comes in. An sk FD can fail just as often as monk FD, but when an sk fails, unlike a monk he doesn't need to wait for the FD button to refresh, he can just click his Death Peace or BE Greaves. <br>
Yes these items have a cast time, but the cast time is FAR quicker than the time it takes for the monk FD button to refresh. To sum up, an sk can still pull off a failed FD pull, coz he can click his items to FD again, and has enough hp to take the hits while the FD is being cast (only half a second i think on Death Peace). Whereas the only thing a monk can do is shout aloud &quot;aw shit&quot; before that uber mob sends him to that great monk yard in the sky.<br>

P.S. Asking for more info from your brother and friends and asking questions about classes on forum boards is all well and good, but it don't mean crap in the game. I could hand ya a manual on driving a car right now, but that wouldn't make ya an instant expert at driving. Experience &gt; All. In other words, go play the game and learn for yourself, coz no one can teach ya, and quit buggin me, coz i have mobs to camp and pp to make.<br>

I can see where you are coming from on the recast time but the mobs I am talking about if you cannot insta FD then you cannot pull them. a instant recast would be nice. even if you have a instant recast, the mobs would kill you before you could get another off. .5 of a second against most mobs now is too slow. you cannot afford any time on FD. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uteauvian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teauvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 6:27:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hiya</span><hr size=1> thats great for you, tho doesn't change the fact that your a moron <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uyesnomaybeso.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yesnomaybeso</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/02 7:55:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  moron?</span><hr size=1> lol how am I am moron? and why would you say that?

<br>
from personal experience (over 320 days played on sedain the paladin that won the botb on drinal and was in the finals on the test server, lost to the guy that won it) paladins are a great class. they do suck at the lower levels(1-59, lol) but the lower levels dont matter. at higher levels(60) paladins do great damage and are great tanks (with proper gear which is attained thru hard work and doing long camps). when i played i tanked better then 95% of the warriors on the server and did at least 65% of the damage that jorply did and he was always the best or at least in the top 3  best equipped warrior on the server when i played *thogg wuden and jorply were the top 3*. i outdamaged most most if not all non cih warriors level 60 or not and i tanked better then them to.(i killed jorply without using loh or heals a few times in duels, one time in freeport i killed him without using loh or any mana and still had a bubble and a half left, it was toe to toe, no dancing, self buffed.) <br>
<br>
getting to be an effective paladin (non gimp) is alot harder then if you played a warrior,rogue,enc,wiz,shaman. paladins have it bad until level 60 and i think all well informed experienced players would agree to that. because of the fact that its harder to get to the point where your considered effective and carrying your own weight in an exp grp or raid as a paladin compared to other classes, lamers like to label the class gimp when its only partially true, personally i wouldnt grp with a non level 60 paladin unless he was very well equipped but labeling a paladin that is level 60 and has good gear a gimp just because hes a paladin isnt right because it just isnt the case. the difference between a level 59 paladin and a level 60 paladin is huge, its like comparing a level 50 wiz to a level 60 wiz. paladins need high end gear which isnt attainable until high levels to be effective and thats the case because verant content makers are a bunch of idiots and didnt make enough class specific gear and specifically there arent enough weapons for paladins at low levels.<br>
<br>
(personally i was using a ghoulbane from level 35-55 because thats all there was except the fiery avenger when they finally added it, and when they did there were 30+ level 50 paladins on tunare that needed it. kunark opened and i was playing 10+ hours a day and was in sebilis with the first people to enter it and exp'd there all the time,i ended up getting  the 1h sword that proc'd the ae rain of fire from the crypt in sebilis then a few days later i got the 2hb from the crypt that was = to the fiery avenger. and later when i was level 60 i got the fiery avenger and then a little bit after that i finished epic with alot of help from carran and elessara/driin/araxen) <br>
<br>
hunting in sebilis when kunark opened was elite btw, fighting with pre kunark armor. ykesha;s(ghoulbane in my case), plane's armor and the myconids running up to kill you without warning once in awhile because of a weird aggro bug.<br>
<br>
i wouldnt of played any other class then a paladin looking back and knowing what i do now, its a great class. only problem is verant imo, they are to slow to make changes and dont even play their own game so they dont really even know what needs to be fixed.<br>
<br>
as far as pulling i dont think necro fd or sk fd even matters, any well equipped level 60 paladin can pull juggernauts, trakanons lair(with trak up, for a raid), chardok(for exp), basically 99.9% of whats in everquest can be done without split/fd pulling.<br>
<br>
paladins can tank pretty damn good, when i played i was basically always the main tank in the grp i was in. just to name a few things that a "GIMP PALADIN" tanked(alone as the ONLY tank in all of these cases) in a single 6 person grp before any warrior on drinal did. ToV,kael arena,protectors of zek in kael, juggernauts, reets, dragon necropolis in general, the whole zone.<br>
<br>
did ToV in a single grp before anybody did ToV guild wise or not btw, same with dragon necropolis and kael arena/PoZ.<br>

Warriors will blow your tanking ability away just because of that.  Your damage?  Check it now, it won't be up there.. I guarentee that, it *might* be higher than warriors, depends on where about the game you're playing against.  <br>
<br>
Not many people will say they don't want a paladin/sk in their exp group for pulling or other needs, the only thing people have ever complained about paladins/sk is how they get gimped on raids... there is some stuff you can tank no doubt.. but defensive warriors make you look horrible when they tank the same thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
damage wise paladins as far as i can tell are the same if not better off then before i quit compared to the other classes (at level 60 with best gear, not at low levels)<br>
<br>
playing a warrior or rogue would of sucked for me, doing the best damage(rog) or tanking (war)the best out of all the other classes and not being able to do anything more then that sucks. <br>
<br>
i read this in someone elses post forgot who said it but someone else put it best: if you think paladins are gimp its prolly because of the paladins you've played with in the past and they prolly sucked. or your just simple minded and cant see beyond the best tank(war) or best dmg dealing tank(rog) aspect of everquest. <br>
<br>
i cant even remember all the times ive saved exp groups or raids because i can heal and/or res, easily 20+.  i wouldnt of given up heals/buffs and res's to be able to tank as well or do as much dmg as a warrior because imo it isnt worth it and it was/is more fun to play a paladin at level 60 compared to playing a level 60 war ever will be.<br>
<br>
and in response to suli necro, whats over rated is fd pulling, needing a monk sk or necro to pull and needing a warrior to tank. its not NEEDED and in alot of cases a hybrid would be better depending on the players experience.<br>

P<br>
BTW Sedain i would disagree with your comment about FD pulling bein overrated. The whole point is that an FD puller can guarantee no adds, whereas if a non-FD puller got a train, he either dies costing valuable time to get him back up to speed, or else he brings the train back and kills the entire raid. Ok you might say a l33t puller wouldn't get adds, but that's like sayin a l33t dueller never loses. No one is unbeatable all the time, and there's no way you can guarantee a pull is gonna go exactly to plan every time.<br>

P.S. Yesnomaybeso - couplea points:<br>
1. Reason why yer FD aint failin much is coz u aint reached a high enough level to notice when it DOES fail. A failed FD in a group means nuthin, wait till you have actually pulled a few RAIDS, then come back and tell me ya rarely fail yer FD ; )<br>
2. Where did you get in your head that .5 second is too slow to pull a mob? Whoever told you that is talking out of his ass, plain and simple. It's ALMOST instant, and as i said before, an sk can take hits that would kill a monk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/userinalis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serinalis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pantless Boy Wonder!</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 7:50:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Try to ahve that sk pull statue of rallos zek(or other encounters at that end) and fd and live.<br>

two things also<br>
BLOCK, biggy for monks considering that SKs do not get it.<br>
Stone stance. lets monk take 1/3 dmg.<br>
SKs get neither of these. oh and to pull ntov, you must pull flurry drakes. these are faster than sow, and hit insainly fast. meaning you MUST have a monk pulling these.<br>
<br>
summary<br>
-stone stance and block are major factors to monk pulling SKs get neither<br>
-FD is instant, all SKs FD abilitys are not.<br>
<br>
these are major factors, there is no way a SK can pull most of the high lvl mobs that monks can. <br>

I have done my research, now it is time for you to do yours.<br>

Serinalis, at no time did i state that sks could pull ultra-uber mobs like the statue, read my posts and you'll see i only mention high end mobs of the calibre of nameds in NToV and such. I could just leave it at that, but nah fek it u aint gettin off that easy, here's a little sumthin for ya. The following comments are NOT taken from a potentially biased sk site, they are from the best monk site there is, &quot;Monkly Business&quot; in their &quot;Guides and Tactics&quot; section.<br>
 &quot;I dont think anyone is KoS to statue, I know I am not anyway and I am KoS to Tormax. So splitting the the armors isnt an issue really. If I am wrong on the faction here just use someone who is NOT KoS to giants. When he is alone either use a SK to pull him, or a monk with 250 range javelins. You dont want to drop down the big step -)Sk's can have trouble FD'ing since he hits like a train and fast.<br>
Pull him and run to bridge, not too fast since he gets stuck sometimes. He should either follow you to bridge or warp on yer head there.Now have a second monk at icewall ready to chain him with longrange javs. If needed you can heave a third monk/sk pull him the last bit depending where you fight him.Never run past the bridge when you pull him from his spawnpoint since that will make him go back. Just stand on bridge till he either comes runnig or warps on you. FD and chain. Cakewalk.-M&quot; <br>
Sure, it's gonna take a l33t sk to do it, but it IS possible. In yer own words Serinalis, thanks, come again drivethru.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;there is no way a SK can pull most of the high lvl mobs that monks can&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Yesnomaybeso, i agree with that statement entirely. Like Serinalis, you seem to go over my posts with one eye shut. Read what i've posted, and quit lettin it go thru one ear and out the other. The only thing i've said re sk versus monk pulling is that there are SOME mobs (note i didn't even say uber) which an sk can pull better than a monk coz of our unique abilities. At no point have i ever said that sks can pull as well as a monk on most high level mobs.<br>
Oh, and re the 2 monk abilities which sks don't have - block and stone stance, sks need neither of these to pull NToV coz we have our own unique abilities for pulling.<br>
1. Higher HP so we take hits that would kill a monk.<br>
2. Multiple FD abilities like Death Peace and BE Greaves so unlike a monk we don't have to wait before we can hit FD again if (or rather when) it fails.<br>
3. CoS - an awesome pulling toy which monks don't have muhahaha. Grants the puller instant invisibility even when running, this is such a huge pulling weapon, its actally not discussed openly by sks for fear of it being completely nerfed.<br>
4. Snare and Pets, which can be used to split or slow mobs.<br>
All the above abilities make sks great pullers, but instant FD will always make monks better at pulling the really high end stuff. Nuff Said.<br>
