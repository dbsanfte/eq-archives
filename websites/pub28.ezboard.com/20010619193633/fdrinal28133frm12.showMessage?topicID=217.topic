You guys never really did *get it*, even after several novels. In general, the point I was trying to get across, was that there were a lot of CiH people doing all the flaming in here: lhinux, me, frizzy, shaere, thogg, phoenixx, divinus veritas, thraxx (I forget the rest) all essentially nailed in public forum by some baby who couldn't solve problems on their own. <br>
<br>
You guys came up with 10000 ways to switch the topic or focus the attention on me for pointing out that your flames are damaging to peoples enjoyment of the game. Never once did anyone just acknowledge that this board's high visibility flames are for the most part all authored by CiH about other people, and that it impacts their game.<br>
<br>
Reading, dialogue (2 way discussions), and education aren't obviously a requirement to get in to your guild.<br>
<br>
You spent more time pointing fingers at the fact that &quot;individuals in CiH&quot; are responsible for their actions - and then people who didn't know me posting to support them (therefore maybe &quot;individuals&quot; aren't only required to back up their actions).<br>
<br>
Nice diversionary tactics but you guys don't and never will really &quot;get it&quot;. Please do stop posting about me so you can find some new persons game to destroy by flaming em. You haven't persuaded me to think otherwise and only served to prove my point.<br>
<br>
I don't expect you to understand what this post says or how it relates to yours - it is just too complex for you. Go read &quot;Pat the bunny&quot; or something non-interactive in one sentence phrases. I'd strongly urge you against trying to read anything by Thoreau or Emerson.<br>
<br>
The type of response I get for making these statements is &quot;Tat is a man&quot;. I know I am way out of my league here when a grade school response is all I can ascertain. Yes yes yes we all know that you refuse to take accountability for the peoples posts in here (except for Dogguk who apologized, deleted the apology, then left. LOL guess it was a good start better than the crap the flamers are putting in here who don't even know me) *sigh* move along to something new. <br>

Refusing to acknowledge what someone responds to you is easy, especially since they aren't even responding to what you have to say. In fact, I'm sure Tat would make a good politician since she responds to posts with things which are at best, vaguely related to what you post.

The funny thing is that will probably stir up a whole new contreversy. You see the lesson I learned about flaming someone at level 20 was the sister of an afterlife person. I flamed her in public forum and I deeply regretted ever having made the post in and paid for it dearly for a very long time (to the degree that my guild did feel accountabiltiy for what I posted in message boards about other people). I learned my lesson about flaming people and took my knocks as they came and grew to learn how to resolve my issues new ways, unlike you guys. It's all some weird karma that I got flamed in the end in here. <br>
<br>
One thing is for sure Menedil is amazingly good at stirring the pot LOL! Should get interesting now.<br>
<br>
Hence the reason why I felt so passionately that it is wrong to flame people in here. Public forums aren't the place to come and resolve your disputes. If you got a problem figure out how to solve it...and you can hate me all you want for trying to get that message across but you meat heads will never figure that out.<br>
<br>
Brace yourselves I'm pretty sure Meneldil just stirred up a real shit storm:) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/24/01 8:38:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugwenhyfar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwenhyfar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/24/01 10:15:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Karma sucks<br>

<br>
Well bad karma does anyhow. I'm a big believer of karma. EVERYTIME I  bite someones head off or do something bad, it ALWAYS haunts me. Now I have to think about what I do.. &quot;Do I REALLY want someone bitching my head off over this?&quot; Etc. So I try to be everyones friends. <br>
<br>
Like, I was in West Commons and I called some newbie a newbie and she went gung ho on me and came to CT's message board and posted anonymously (Even though we knew who she was) about how we pissed her off and to never ask her cleric for a res. I even apologized and the whiner kept going. Sooooo.... now I can't call an yone a newbie anymore<br>
<br>
and now I can't be mean to anyone.. it sucks. I have to watch my back.. cause I do have a mouth on me =p<br>
<br>
Good karma is where it's all at though. Give give give give give give. I was kinda burnt out on EQ a while back.. I wanted a Jbone bracer BADLY.. I had about the money.. and the person who was going to trade me backed off.. (I bit his head off over it.. and feel bad about it now.. anyhow.. I'm not gonna name him cause I'm not flaming him).. but.. I ended up just being upset and gave 17k to my guild and 1.5k to Inferni Milities.. within like a week, my guild had a jbone bracer they won for me.. I was like 'wow' =).. didn't even care about the money either.. it alll pays off<br>
<br>
soooo imdone riomble rambling =p<br>

When I quit the game (Umm I think it was my first shot) I gave away all of my gear to people who were needy by going to various zones and having them meet some criteria. There were some really really! happy people that night. <br>

When I came back to play the game I was naked. It was strange but I got used to it and some really nice people helped me out by loaning gear to ensure I had enough stats for raids.

I usually just give things away when I have no need for them anymore.. or someone could use moreso than me. Sometimes they are overwhelmed =) Do you still play Tatianae, or have you made a different character? I don't know if I'd be a good enchanter.. heh.. when I first came to Drinal.. I HATED it, so I went back to Tunare and remade another shaman lol.. because it's the only class I know how to play.. lame I know..

The char is cool the spells are awesome you always have to be on your toes. It just becomes an obiligation post 50. People understand far less when an enchanter has to leave a group than a tank or other character. You become contractually bound to any group you agree to for some period of time and if you don't group due to time constraints (e.g. I know I have to log off by 10 because my job pays me better than eq, and someone asks you for a seb group at 9pm. ;-) they get pretty upset about it.<br>
<br>
Monk is my second fave - I have 3 of those too on different servers. They have great travel abilities and there is nothing more liberating than &quot;not needing a weapon or new armor&quot;. You can function very well when starting off a new char as a monk too since they don't require too many material goods.<br>
<br>
I have one of every other class except for mage and necro  - but not for any real reason other than I just haven't tried them.<br>
<br>
I do play but not nearly as much. I discovered new non-pc hobbies when I quit last time ;-) Not to mention lately I have had to work at night to make up for time lost procrastinating all day.<br>
<br>
Other servers are interseting. Each have their problems. There are some much more civilized (but boring) servers out there than Drinal. <br>
<br>
Would be nice if they'd put a new server out more frequently.

Proably too vague and not related to the topic enough for some of the readers in here.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utatianaefatecaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatianae Fatecaster</A> at: 5/25/01 4:15:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/unoxlip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Noxlip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/25/01 3:18:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A call for everyone...</span><hr size=1> Hugs Tat =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uthren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/25/01 7:24:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A call for everyone...</span><hr size=1> OMG Noxxie come back I miss my fellow necro sister:( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucadara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cadara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(5/26/01 2:13:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A call for everyone...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Tatianae &quot;Walks away very content knowing you guys started this flame fest with the *wrong person*&quot; Fatecaster&quot;<br>
<br>
'Wrong person' as in someone who seriously lacks of a social life or any real self esteem?  And dont give me any of this Bull-Shit about how people dont know you in real life.  You post every two minutes to reply to some 10-year old's flames about you on a message board for crying out loud.  If you do have a social life, its a very sad one indeed.  (Most likely consisting of talking to a parrot your Mother bought you for company, eating bon-bon's while listening to the newest Jerry Springer while frantically thumbing through a thesaurus for new and exciting words to impress kids you'll never know or meet on a message board, all the while dreaming about popeye's fried chicken.)<br>
<br>
You've self appointed yourself as some kind of flame queen.  It's not happening really.  Last time I checked the purpose of a flame was to piss the other party off or just let them know in general that you're not happy with something thats going on, not annoy/bore them to the point that they won't even bother reading the novels you direct at them.  Anyway, I just dropped by and felt obligated to post after seeing some of the crap being spewed back and forth about how great you people are at flaming.<br>
<br>
Seriously.  Get out more or go actually work at your job (that is if you even have one).  Oh but then again maybe a kid will flame you while you're away from the computer for three minutes.  Go cry me a fucking river.  <br>
<br>
Anyway get a fucking life Tatinae.  It's okay really if you cannot be amongst the &quot;Elite&quot; social groups in work or everyday life, but don't come here trying to beat up on kids to make yourself feel better about your pathetic existance.  It just shows how truly weak and naive you are to actually think that in a year or two anyone will give a flying rat's ass about you or your weak attempts at flaming. <br>
<br>
Now do me a favor and reply about how I'm totally wrong and you really DO have a life and friends.  And then reply to every other post that appears on these boards with links of past threads that you spent minutes to hours digging up to further prove your point.  Dumbass.<br>
<br>
So i will leave it at this Miss Tatianae &quot;Walks her obese ass back to the computer to flame myself and anyone who has the time to listen&quot; Fatecaster.  And before you spend another 5 minutes of your &quot;valuble&quot; time looking for my profile info to know who i am, this is my first post on the Drinal boards but if you truly feel the need to reply to anything I have said, just try and build up the courage to stop clicking the Refresh button on your web browser for the Drinal: Flame board, and talk to me or anyone else you have these childish issues with one-on-one in this game you seem to have such a passion for.<br>
