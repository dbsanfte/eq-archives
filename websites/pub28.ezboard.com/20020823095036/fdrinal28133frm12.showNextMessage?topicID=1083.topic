In EW i wanted to try my hand at a quick BP or spear from chiefy for a buddy o' mine and I see renlore, quite a nice guy i must admit.<br>
<br>
I run in the fort and decide to take an elite standing right in front of me. Didn't seem engaged because it was standing still and there was no druid in the vicinity and it wasn't doing weird lag crap, so i snared it.<br>
<br>
It ran twoards me, and i ran it outside the fort twoards my pet.....10 seconds...20 seconds.....Nothing. didn't even pop on me or anything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So then i wander inside and find the barbarian warrior named Renlore with two of his buddies killing my elite...it had to be.  At this point renlor proceeded to tell me fort was camped. Bullshit......There IS a play nice policy involved in this game which makes you share camps no matter what they be, iv'e heard this many times and been burned on it myself.  Of course, renlore blatantly rejects taht and kills my mob. I just told him ooc that i'd like to have the next one KS or not to make up for the one he had. And for all i tried i used the mezz and nuke manuever when it was low HP and he still got it. Lmao. This is probably the only event in everquest i've ever petitioned, i figured i'd give him something to read.  Well i hope you enjoy farming that fort Renlor, because i sure as hell will enjoy flaming you, sucessful or not. I dont care who he is affiliated with, if anyone (guildless on that char), and im not saying anyone else should flame him too, but that was just downright rude.  From my experiences one should stay away from the same zone as renlor, thanks man.<br>

<br>
Well Bynox, let's just start by saying you asked for it.<br>
<br>
Myself and 2 of my friends were camped on the inside of the<br>
RyGorr fort for roughly 2 hours before you go there, camping<br>
the elites and the chief/black to get some starting equipment<br>
for a friend who just returned to EQ. We made it clear to the fort<br>
groups we would share with them the lego's and cents but that <br>
the ones inside the building were camped.<br>
<br>
Lo and behold, someone streaks out of the fort with a very slow<br>
elite chasing them. Naturally I repeat in ooc what is camped, <br>
pull the elite to my group (me, PAL, DRU) and kill it. Bynox says<br>
he will KS us!! So I pull the other elite. He goes all out to KS us,<br>
but succeeds only in running himself oom and aiding in our kill.<br>
<br>
Now because of all his tomfoolery I've lost track of whats going<br>
on and what was pulled from where, and i get 3 on my next pull.<br>
Rather than waste all the mana it would take to kill 3, i loop them<br>
out of the fort while my group zones, and then zone myself.<br>
Bynox freaks out once more, starts in with the threats to take it to <br>
drinal flames (wheee) and petitions me.<br>
<br>
This is the amazing part!<br>
<br>
Ater he petitioned me,  ** A GM ACTUALLY SHOWED UP**<br>
My inital reaction was shock and confusion, and I quickly<br>
checked to make sure i didn't /movelog to stormhammer.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, she didn't care and didn't want to listen to any of<br>
my double entendres, so she said &quot;Ok pls just put him on ignore&quot;, <br>
waved, and left. <br>
<br>
Back to the flame!<br>
<br>
Bynox I'm sorry your hate raid got &quot;sniped&quot; and you arent' <br>
getting enough satisfaction from your barnyard love.<br>
<br>
But before you continue this with your own peculiar blend of<br>
tourette's and down syndrome, consider the fact that you still <br>
haven't crawled out from the flaming pile of shit from your last <br>
'escapade' on these boards. <br>
<br>
Be interesting to see who responds to this and why, but <br>
honestly I don't see a whole lot of support coming your way champ.<br>
<br>
So instead, RawRimaPony, why don't you pick your chin up, <br>
pull yourself up by your l33t KC Flayed Skin bootstraps, and get<br>
the hell out of my face before you bump off Tat as biggest<br>
imbecile on this board.<br>

I wonder if you read any of my post. If  i would have been an ass and stayed there rather tahn taking the two/three mobs i wanted, then the GM would ahve told you to step aside and let me alternative pulls. So dont even try to say i &quot;took your camp&quot;....<br>
<br>
but i'd like to make a little correction to Sir renlor of omgimsouberland<br>
<br>
A) The elite I pulled was not in the little room sir, it was outside and no one was engaged it. And when i snared it, i pulled it back, and it didn't come.<br>
<br>
B) Gasp! Renlor has it.....he took the mob that I had already engaged. <br>
<br>
C) I call them as i see them, I dont make a judgement about ANYONE until i see their actions, and atm im leaning twoards &quot;ignore&quot;.......<br>
<br>
You are also lucky that i didn't post what you did to me after i was trying to leave. lol, that was pretty low bud. <br>

An eye for an eye is effective until the world goes blind, and another thing, i had 90 mana left, doesn't take much mana to KS for a necro. If you knew anything about a necromancer you would realize this but you dont so i'll explain. We have a level 24 spell that removes all hit counters from the mob, I casted it when the mob i was supposed to have was low HP, and it removed aggro. then sent my pet on it and nuked it ;P anywho, it didn't work. boo hoo i lost an elite, not THAT big of a problem. Even if it was your &quot;camp&quot; which is NOT allowed by verant, you should have at least let me have the next one you pulled. I told you i wanted one for what you did to the one i pulled.<br>

Flayed skin leggings are good to about 30, then you upgrade........As well, Would you mind not changing the topic? We're talking about you disrespecting a player blatantly in game not about a post on Eqdrinal. Im glad you talked with the GM, you saw how fast that was? I was amazed! DIdn't really expect much though, just a nice talking to with you.. Apparently she didn't even explain the playnice policy that verant has implemented,b ecause that would have shut your mouth up pretty fast eh?

<br>
I do know that when an area is camped it is not very nice to pull mobs especially if you wouldn`t have been able to pull them without having a group clear them so I surely understand the other side of the story as well...<br>
<br>
I don`t care anymore... I pull what I want and let others pull what they want... theres tons of mobs in EQ...<br>
<br>
And as for the items... its weird how some people get so )(*&quot;/(*&quot;/(* upset over crappy gear dropping mobs. I was in the grey the other day and a named rev spawned..... and i was low health and had no mend up....and i tried to kill it....and couldnt so i had to fd it off...i asked for some help and got no response... but then a few seconds later a druid shows up to pull the named spawn... rofl....i woulda given him whatever loot it dropped and it woulda have costed him one heal instead of whatever kiting mana he was gonna use on it... rofl...<br>

<br>
It is your responsibility to find out if a camp is taken before you start pulling mobs from it.  I've made that mistake and had a similar thing happen to me and you know what?   Yeah, I got all pissed about it, but when I took a look back, I was definitely in the wrong.<br>
<br>
Now here's a little advice for you.  When you tried to flame my guild a couple of days ago, you claimed that since you had merrily announced it on the UGoD boards, it should be common knowledge.  People straightened you out pretty quick I think on how the server works (i.e.  there's no signup sheet - you get there first, it's yours).   Grats you on learning lesson number one.<br>
<br>
Here's lesson number two.  I don't know what game you play, but the one I play... yeah Verant doesn't officially recognize camps, but the rest of the server does.   You go to Seb, you do a camp check and you find disco taken, I sure as hell hope you don't go down there, try and get them to share with you and invoke PNP if they don't.   That's about the gimpiest thing I have ever heard, and if you keep that kind of crap up, you're going to be hated pretty fast.   So you know what man?  Sit back, relax, and try and fit in with the server community rather than coming here, making stupid flames, and continuing to piss everyone off. <p><font color="blue" face="arial" size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6667">Veteran Zhemau Zaknaifen</a></font><br>

Dont give a SHIT about the mob. Dont give a shit about the &quot;camp&quot;. There are no CAMPS in this game. petition a gm that someone stole your camp and they will laugh at you. Im not talking about raster etc, they will make you share them, but no way i would take a one mob camp from anyone..however a 7 or 8 mob camp like the elites i would take just a couple that i wanted. Got it? You're missing the point here by a longshot. now stop putting your own damn spin on the rules and find out for yourself!<br>

Where do you get this stuff?<br>
Lodizal? You'll never kill lodizal.<br>
<br>
Vox?? WTF are you talking about?<br>
<br>
Just for the record I have a lvl 30 necro twink, <br>
so i do know how Screaming terror works.<br>
And I would never disgrace him with any piece of flayed skin.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wish I was in a guild that would keep me busy, <br>
and give me some more people to hang out with,<br>
but then other times I see people who are restrained by <br>
the tag they wear, and being unguilded I can come here<br>
and beat you with the ugly stick until not even your Pony<br>
will take you back.<br>
<br>
You ask around, you'll find out im an honorable sort.<br>
I do a lot of MTing for peoples' epics and running strat<br>
for them, setting up groups etc.<br>
<br>
I have a friend in WW, Casadine who is a good guy.<br>
I just feel sorry for him cause he has to share a guildtag<br>
with a clueless jackass like you.<br>
<br>
If you insist on perpetuating this, I will wipe the floor <br>
with you, either in this verbal arena or in the pvp one <br>
of your choosing.<br>
<br>
Get your ass back in the kiddie pool, because you sure <br>
as hell can't touch bottom out here with me.<br>
