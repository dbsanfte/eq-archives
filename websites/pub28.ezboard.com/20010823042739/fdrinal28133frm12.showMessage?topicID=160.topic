<br>
To all the people who flame CiH and people in it.. not everyone is a bad apple, in fact.. I don't think I've met one bad person from CiH. <br>
<br>
But here is my story<br>
<br>
I was running through West Karana with Vdar on the way to Qeynos.. I saw Sutekh and Nila shouting for Tedule to sow them and I said /shout I think he zoned.<br>
and then they said 'Sow GIRL!?!' and I was like &quot;I'm about to zone&quot; and zoned.. not realizing until AFTER I zoned.. that I had just jumped over them<br>
<br>
Man I felt like a complete asshole when I did that<br>
So I zoned back<br>
and sowed them<br>
<br>
Well.. some of you may know<br>
in my past, I've killed a lot of bards<br>
mainly for exp in south karana in my low to mid 40s<br>
<br>
Well.. anyhow.. I was zoning from North Qeynos to South Qeynos<br>
<br>
And as I zoned this bard comes out of no where and thwaps me<br>
300<br>
340<br>
334<br>
308<br>
and I was dead<br>
apparently the bard guild leader wonders<br>
or someone equivelent<br>
I had no time to run<br>
<br>
So I harrassed Sutekh to come and res me, and he was on his way with his lovely wife Nila to Vox raid<br>
but he came out of his way to res me<br>
<br>
<br>
So if CiH and Sutekh are such bad aweful people.. why would he come out of his way to give me a res?<br>
<br>
EXACTLY..<br>
because not everyone is a bad apple<br>
it's somewhat prejudice to go off and judge one person based on their guild vise versa<br>
<br>
That's my story<br>

<br>
     Ive never had a prob with CiH whatsoever.  I dont think its right saying an entire guild sucks just cause someone may have trained you in Black Burrow at level 8. Of course, the bad apple thing is there.  Shinro insists im the ex player known as Prissa.  He cussed at me for like 3 minutes with literally EVERY word in the book(and my 8 year old nephew was watching me play at the time, classy Shinro) when I was level 45.  So when i offered him my phone number to call me to prove im not, he then of course stopped talking to me.  Then I later figured, wtf do i need to prove anything to him?  I know 5 ppl that play on server in real life so i just shrug ol Shinro off now and chuckle at his cynicism.  <br>
     <br>
     Anyway, to the point :)  I dont know a lot of CiH real well, but know quite a few pretty good.  They are always helpful with info, quite a few have helped us do CR's in fear and other places, as well as always lend a hand with porting or stuff liek that.  As my guild Ancient Realm grows larger and stronger, we may be competing over some bosses/dragons or whatever soon, but from everything I have seen and heard of CiH,  they have always been more than willing to reason and share.<br>
     <br>
     My analogy of CiH is they are like the N.Y. Yankees.  No matter what, ya always expect them to win.  After awhile, it even gets boring hearing how they took down Dain or Cazic.  I dont expect anything less :)  Major props to them for doing it, I just expect it from them now heh.  Because the yankees win so much, they are either hated or liked, not many inbetween.  That seems to be the way with CiH.  Rants on them usually hold no water or are TOTALLY blown out of proportion.  <br>

This is just MY opinion, dont try this at home.  k, thx.<br>

<br>
I never met this Sut *whatever your name may be, no offense there, just never met you*. But I know of his wife? Wow, she left Leomund to marry yet another? Wow Nila isn't this your 4th Marriage? Ahh why yes it is, or was it more? So if your such a devoted person why don't you stay with one person, after all the vows of marriage are through thick and thin, but the vows to leach someone are as is, suck'em dry and move on to your next victim, black widow syndrom.  Oh well, classy gal she is indeed, so classy she bites the hand that fed her when she was a newbie, a total true newbie. <br>
<br>
Remember how it was Balrak who saved your hide many times on Mith Marr from KSers, people who were giving you a hard time. I left many a raids to aid you, such as hate, fear, Naggy and so on. I was scolded a few times for leaving in the middle of a raid but when your friends with someone and you hear some high lvls are bullying that person for me at least it had a tendancy to annoy me. Then came the 49th lvl resses *pre kunark*, you must of been the ONLY newbie at the time who had a 50 cleric behind you the entire time ressing/healing/buffing/financially supporting you. I think it's funny, you're back with another cleric...correct me if I am wrong here but there is an obvious pattern here with you. Yes I suppose I played the big brother role there with her though, I just enjoyed helping those who needed it. Only for her to pull the things she did later, with lying, cheating and stealing.  So if that makes her nice, then where have the morales of humanity gone? I give her one thing, she's a good expoiter of people who called her a &quot;friend&quot;. I am quite sure Genvar would agree with me and his GF on this, I still look back at what Leo once said of you when we were together, he was right. You being the liar I was once told you were, but I believed at the time in giving a person a chance. Anyhow I could go on but I won't because that's such a dead issue with me, but I figure I'd make light of it here. It worked out for the best, met bigger better people then her, ones who won't stick a knife in your back when your back is to them. After all it's a pixel and a pixel in a real world means what?<br>
<br>
 So to N's new hubby, really I say this not to sound mean but really, save yourself a headache, she's got a very well established history of using people. I'd just suggest you watch yourself and be aware she has done it before to many others. G'luck to you and have fun, just be mindful what I said. People like that do not change. Happy Ressing...<br>
<br>
Euth, you had a run in with Shinro before? Hmm, I am friends with him, I'll give'em heck when I see him next. Hey Shinro, you putz!  LoL, slick what are you doing going around cussing people out for, didn't you know that's not nice. <br>
/hissyfit<br>
You've learned well from the master shinro, however you need to know WHERE and WHEN to flip on someone, know the facts first. ;-)  I've met Euth and he was quite a gentlemen to myself and to my sweetie. Behave you palsy, or pull out Breldos and lets rumble, I still remember the time you dueled that guy in lguk and had him put his back up against the zonewall then when you dueled him you knocked him into upper guk, giving you the victory, even though he was a few lvl's higher, ahh now that was some funny stuff there.<br>
<br>
One last thing and I must agree, every guild has it's bad apples that doesn't mean the entire guilds rotten. It appears at times some guilds have more bad apples then good ones. Take it for its face value if you will. <br>

I'm really at a loss as to how to defend unwarranted and unjustified personal attacks on the sweetest, most caring person I've met in this game. Really, all I can say is that the crap that Balrak is spewing isn't true. Nila has every one of Balrak's characters on ignore because of the ceaseless badgering and abuse he has given her since they split.<br>
<br>
I suppose this really doesn't matter. People that know Nila, will know this isn't true, and people that believe something Balrak says don't deserve the honor of getting to know her. :) The only thing I ask is that you consider the source before you make any judgements as to its validity. I will not be responding to any more posts in this thread. So if Balrak returns to flame Nila again or me, which somehow I have a feeling that he will, don't think that silence is an indication of guilt. In this case, it's an indication of the worthlessness of the drivel that is dripping from Balrak mouth.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umonlatchdrinal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Monlatch Drinal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#939393>(4/20/01 8:44:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sutekh and Nila you bad people!

A) Shes never asked for anything but someone to hang with and that was 90% of the time comming to hang out and pull for me or playing twinks together.<br>
<br>
B) Has Twinked my necro with the quest stuff she did and even gave me an Idol of the thorned because I helped our old guild camp them but we got about 10 and I didnt win any of the lottos<br>
<br>
C) Its hard as hell for her to take tips for making me my highend JC stuff to the point I eather have to trick her into taking the money which is why she wont group with me when she knows I have plat because I used to try to just split to pay her back.<br>
<br>
D) its been over a year, ya ever think things just didnt work out and maybe now its time to move on and stop bitching an moaning about it and slamming someone that everyone knows is nothing like what you say?<br>
To people that dont know her maybe they will believe you until they meet her but to the people that do know her you just sound bitter over something that didnt work out and lying....<br>
<br>
Thats all just my 2 cents I have a low opinion of you already but I only came here because I heard you were spewing your crap again, just get over it... Welp I'm off from this board again for another few months..<br>

Was just praising Sutekh and Nila for taking their time out of their busy day to come give little old me a res. =) Some people may have had bad run in's with Nila, or even Sutekh.. and that's their problem.. but I was just saying.. I didn't =) And from what I saw, they weren't bad people at all. I don't know either one at all.. but for someone to come out of their way to help out another person, that just shows how friendly they are. Because, admit it.. not many people would do that if they were on their way to a raid.. or 2 different zones away. So if Nila fed you some bad apples, Balrak, keep it in private please =) I was just  trying to bring some cheer to this board, not flames.. despite what this board is named. So can we keep it happy in this thread.<br>

First off, this is a game.  These aren't rl marriages n stuff...<br>
<br>
Secondly, Sutekh and Nila are two of the nicest people I've ever met in EQ.<br>
<br>
Last, I've seen you around in EQ maybe 3 times in 2 years, and every single time you have managed to be a total asshole.  I remember you cussing out newbies in Butcherblock when my cleric was lvling up there. I remember you kill stealing in Cazic.  In fact, I was gonna come help the group you were harrassing as my rl friend was in it, but you left before I got there.  Then there's the scattered idiotic ooc's I've heard with your name in front.<br>
