All they would talk about was EQ this and EQ that. I used to give them a hard time for spending that many hours playing a game.<br><br>Finally Deebo talked me into letting him get it for me for part of my Christmas present. We went to the store bought it and went back to my house and he helped me install it. I read through the manual as the game was loading and decided a druid sounded fun because they were nature lovers, as am I.

So she convinced me that it was a really cool chat program w/ a neat D&D like game added in. So I went out and got it and made a wizard and she was a 20th druid at the time so she came and gave me 10plat and a gossimer robe. I can still remember the first time I saw her change into a wolf. It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen. So, I abandoned the WAR I was playing (had canned the WIZ - they sucked back then) and started a druid. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2863>Tyyche</a> <br><a href=http://www.unconquered.org>Unconquered Monkey</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugojiradyrgesinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gojira Dyrgesinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/images/animate/spike.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/20/02 8:01:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2449.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  good ol days</span><hr size=1> I worked at the PC lab in my old school for a while and a few people at work played EQ and used to talk it about.

About a month later I was at a meeting, and when we broke for lunch a fellow manager and I decided to walk around the local mall for a bit.  I went into EB and saw the game on the shelf and started to talk to the two guys in the store about it.  They acted like I was asking them to describe how beautiful their first-born child was.<br><br>So, I say to myself, if this game can attract this kind of cult following it must be pretty good.
