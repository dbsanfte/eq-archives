I see this word thrown around alot for guilds on Drinal, but I think its undeserved.  But heres what I think are good examples of a &quot;uber guild&quot; :<br>
<br>
Legacy of Steel - went from dragon faction and never killing in North Tov, to clearing North Tov except Vulak, Vyernn in less than 5 days.  They have almost finished North ToV and they never even been there before this.  That is uber, no one on drinal is even close to doing what LoS has done in one weekend.<br>
<br>
Afterlife - Having first hand experince with AL they are strictly buisness.  Very Effecient and fast.  Always does the least with the lowest amout of numbers.  After hearing about one guildmotd for AL, it was Dain, Tormax, Yelinlak, then head to ToV for a raid.  If anyone has ever done raids, they would understand how diffucult it is to do 3 big mobs in one day, then have time to raid ToV.<br>
<br>
FoH - The defination of uber.  Furor with his rants, the only Caster I know who has 1k ac in EQ is in FoH.  ALways there with the first, doing mobs with very little, extremly effienct anti-zerg uber guild.<br>
<br>
just the more publizied ones..<br>
<br>
One thing these guilds has in common is low numbers, effiency and speed.  These I think are the qualites of a uber guild.  Being able to get smoked, and get right back on and try again and win.  I just don't think drinal really has any, and this term is thrown around like we have 10.  Anywayz not a flame, just how I feel.  Is Winter's Light or CiH a uber guild?  Thats not for me to decide.  I know I hope WL can someday be like one of these guilds, effienct killing machines.  <br>

<br>
Not to answer your question--I don't know for myself either, but I am constantly impressed when I read CiH's website at how much they kill and how quickly they rip through insanely difficult encounters.<br>
<br>
But to address another point you raised--&quot;I just don't think drinal really has any [ubers], and this term is thrown around like we have 10.&quot;  Well, my opinion on that, being someone who throws around the term with reckless abandon, is that compared to my guild, compared to my friends in UGoD, etc., etc., there are a lot of guilds who I consider to be uber.  Hell, a guild capable of raiding Trak without outside help is uber to me.  Maybe as someone in WL, you look around the server, and really only a few others like CiH to compare yourselves to, and then look at other servers and you're like...&quot;man AL is so much more uber than we are.&quot;  <br>
<br>
It's all about uberness relative to where you stand.  Probably to some total newbie, the UGoD alliance is uber cause we can take down Vox and Naggy, and we can raid Hate and Fear and Growth.  To you guys, that's old hat, stuff you did aeons ago.  To me, you guys seem uber--you can do Trak, Velks, Warders in Sleepers, VP, etc.  Only way I'll see any of that is by joining an &quot;uber&quot; guild or getting an invite from a friend for a particular raid.<br>
<br>
But to you, perhaps AL or FoH is uber, because they can do the same things you do with ruthless efficiency, less power, &quot;better&quot; tactics, etc.  <br>

My hats off to Immortal Bravery.  They're not outspoken at all, but they are IMO one of the top 5 raiding guilds to come out of Mith Marr.  For their numbers, they have and will continue to pull off some amazing kills.  Latest example I can think of is dropping Hoshkar in VP on their first trip into the zone (Hoshkar is one tough sob, if you didn't know..took CiH a little while to pin him down).  Seriou, their guild leader, won server SK BotB half-dead from lack of sleep because he was in it at 4 or 5 am his time.<br>
I've always been in awe whenever I attended an IB raid, these guys were as efficient and cool-headed as AL ever was...expect to see a few server firsts coming from IB's way when Luclin comes out.<br>
<br>
Pretty sharp and friendly group of people...I have a lot of respect for them.<br>

But you see I was in an &quot;Uber&quot; guild in the past. Let me tell you right now, it's not what it's cracked up to be. Many rumors run around about how they do this and that and how everyone has the best of this and that. I'm here to tell you now that's simply not the case.<br>
<br>
What seperated them from the boys and girls were their skills and abilities to utilize with what gear they had, not what they were thought or expected to have. Most of the time we had a good laugh, most often we were thought to be rude, selfish, just bad guys period. Some of the people within of course were bad apples, but can you name one place, one guild that doesn't have at least one negative impact upon it?<br>
<br>
What question I would ask you, because I remember being guilded with you and how people within that guild would complain how we weren't doing fear as fast or as well as another guild. You see in their eyes they felt that by completing something within a time frame is what made them great. Others think by killing a mob with as few people as possible makes them great. Here's what I think, if you can kill the same mob, do the same zone, then I personally don't care how few people were present. I don't care if it took us 2 hours longer to complete zone X. To me that's just a bunch of petty nonsense to be comparing to and to complain about. If I wanted in a competition I'd still be involved in sports, however I am not looking for that from a game. I'm there to have fun and do it by whatever means needed. <br>
<br>
Others, however feel the need to be competative and try to accomplish such tasks by these manners I went over breifly. But a majority of the gaming population is not out to set such goals or to be &quot;uber&quot;. Uber can only be looked at in each persons own eyes. Really how else can you judge guild X from being better than guild Y. Because they killed a god 1 hour faster? Perhaps guild Y had some connection issues with their players and that managed to tie them up time wise? <br>
<br>
As for the lower numbers of people on a raid to do something. Well as I always said that's fine and dandy but again when I set out to kill something in a game if I can get that extra firepower then common sense tells me to accept the extra help. I don't want to get halfway through and have people leaving or running out of steam. I set out to make sure the goal is completed. With that extra help you are almost handed down a certain victory. I would also like to say that all of us at one time has had to deal with a long CR. As you may know, nobody likes sitting around on a CR, as if we aren't already set for time, the last thing I know most people who are on a tight time line don't really want to waste their playing time on doing that long CR, just to try and do something undermaned to begin with.<br>
<br>
To end it, I would say uber is only as good as the eye of the beholder. Just because you don't have that great dragon armor or sword doesn't mean you're not uber. Back in the day I was often commented as being an uber cleric. Personally I thought I was average in way of gear. To some though they thought the world of what I had. Like I said, Uber is only what YOU as an individual make of it. Forget what the dictionary terms it as being, set your own goals and go from there and don't ever let someone tell you, your not any good because you don't have this or that. If you think you're in good shape then that's what counts. Trust me, first hand I showed it time and time again by whooping those &quot;uber&quot; players with my average gear, it's the know how that makes you great and not the gear. This is just why my old guildies and I were &quot;uber&quot; because we knew what we were doing with what we had, not what we did not have but wished we had. Gear and lvls are only as good as the player behind them. Back in the day if you had banded you were the king. This further goes to prove my point, what's banded now, newbie crap gear as most would say. I prove my point.<br>
<br>
Just remember, AL, LoS, FoH and all the big &quot;uber&quot; guilds all started somewhere, they just didn't rise up from the ashes of greatness in one day, only I can do that! But in fact they made it by trial and error and learned from mistakes and perfected how to take things down, it's trivial now. Of course it would be the same for many if you do it on a daily basis. Skills make the player not the lvl or equiptment.<br>

There is enough high level good players on Drinal to have several uber guilds though, but i dont see it happen, People stay in their smaller guilds as long as there is progression.<br>
<br>
EQ=Progression at high levels, once you stop, and cant move on, EQ is boring.<br>
<br>
but i disagree with you Mene, CiH is capable of doing what LoS and AL do, they got the numbers.<br>

To the Iksar, no, WL havent done VP, i seriously dont see us have a problem flattening that zone soon though<br>

This would suggest that an &quot;uber&quot; guild is somehow better than other guilds. To me, an &quot;uber&quot; guild is one where the majority of the people are happy and they have fun with their freinds. It's not the mobs they can take down as much as the fun they have taking them down or, for that matter, being taken down.<br>
<br>
An &quot;uber&quot; guild has no &quot;cliques&quot; or &quot;elite class&quot; that steers everyone else. An &quot;uber&quot; guild has members that genuinely care about one another and make huge sacrifices without blinking an eye for each other. An &quot;uber&quot; guild is where people respect everyone even if they don't like them.<br>

I think Drinal has many of these.<br>

<br>
anyway, i agree with the first post. AL is what i consider to be a example of a... (im not even gonna type it anymore i hate it so much) ...u*** guild. if CiH can do what AL can do, they lets see it? am i doubting them? nope, i have no idea what it takes to do what AL does. so for all i know or care, until i see it, im not gonna believe it.<br>
<br>
any guild that thinks they are over and beyond other guilds, you are automaically not u***.. modesty makes you the best. not being a cocky prick.<br>
<br>
u*** to me is a combination of a lot of things.... like posted, being quick, effective and organized as well as being modest, friendly, helpful and well liked. its a game ya know, make some friends, help some new people.. show some courtesy.<br>
<br>
if you can do that, then you gain peoples respect and admiration, and THAT is the final touch to being u***.<br>

Don't take the Uber definition too literally.  Calling a small guild Uber just because all its members are delerioiusly happy is kinda silly.   Silly'er than the rest of this game I mean <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We are raiding now 3 months the guild is maybe 4 month old. We have this days 47 actice members, for raids we have max. 32 sometimes up to 36 players online. We can only kill the velious mobs with team work and tactics and we learned to work as a team in that short time and this is uber too. There are a lot of things what can mean that you are uber its not only to kill the Boss mob number 1. <br>
<br>
I have to say great work to all our members. <p><b>Carathien Tabinization</b><br>

<br>
Yes, “Uber” is a German word for above or over. Germans have no word for Super. German translations for Superman would be Uberman. Uber guild = Super guild.<br>

<br>
having &quot;uber&quot; guilds isn't a bad thing either... kinda gives other players something to look upto.. or maybe even something to aim for   but  /shrug what do I know..

CiH might be. <br>
<br>
AL is the only guild who boasts approx60-70 members a raid if needed &lt;---Zerg, FoH and LoS are constantly using outside help on raids, especially FoH, los not as much. <br>
<br>
DA'kor in the early stages of velious was neck n neck if had not surpased FoH.<br>
<br>
Paradigm another guild that is right up there with LoS etc.<br>
<br>
CiH for the mobs killed in comparison to all these other guilds, we are approx in the range of 7th overall to about 10th with about 10 other guilds in this general range. The only stuff we havent killed is North wing tov, Ventani, AoW, Tunare.<br>
<br>
Now from inside CiH standpoint, we are about having fun with the highend game, about killing loads of &quot;uber&quot; mobs each day, and having a blast while doing so.<br>
