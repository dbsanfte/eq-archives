This forum was started as a service to the Drinal Cleric Community so that a current listing of clerics on the Ragefire list could always be publicly displayed. <br><br>Panamah posted this thread from Morell Thule's forum for the Ragefire list.  While there are several out there, this one is pretty well outlined and is a fair method for handling the list.  I posted the link below so that you can see how the communication flow works and how everyone seems to be doing a great job of keeping the list going and how it's working as intended.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub63.ezboard.com/fmorellthulecommunityforumsfrm60.showMessage?topicID=28.topic">pub63.ezboard.com/fmorell...D=28.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>For our purposes, I did a small bit of editing.<br><br>The short version is:<br><br>-  Have all steps of your epic completed, except RF.<br>-  Sign up here and send in screenshot of pearl, along with your e-mail addy, guild name, back-ups;<br>-  Always have someone in the RF camp;<br>-  Kill RF within 3 hours of the time it spawns;<br>-  Post here immediately after you kill RF.<br><br>The long version is:<br><br>1. The list is by Cleric, not by guild. This means if 2 clerics from the same guild are on the list, they still must complete their epic in the order they are on this list. I.E. The Flintstones have clerics at numbers 1 and 17, Betty who is number 1 is not online when Ragefire spawns, Wilma at number 17 cannot take her place in the rotation and kill Ragefire.<br><br>2. To have your name added to the list, you must have completed all other steps towards obtaining your epic and you must send a screenshot of you with the pearl to saela@eqdrinal.com prior to being added. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Along with the pearl screenshot, you should also send in (1) your e-mail address, (2) your guild's name, and (3) a list of persons who may be contacted if you are not online.  The clerics who are currently on the list must send in this information to maintain their position on the list.<br><br>3. Always have someone in the RF camp, whether it be you or your representative.  Anyone in the RF camp should refer clerics seeking to be added to the list to this forum.<br><br>4. There is a 3 hour time limit from the moment Ragefire spawns for the first cleric on the list to kill him, during which time other forces are welcome to gather and prepare, but not engage Ragefire. If the first cleric on the list does not kill Ragefire in this time, the list's integrity should continue to be maintained by going through the list in order until a cleric who is online is in the zone and ready.  Ragefire is never FFA -- after three hours, that spawn belongs to the highest listed cleric prepared for an engagement.<br><br>5. Post here immediately after you have killed RF so that the next person on the list is notified.<br><br>6. Those clerics with * in front of their name have sent in their screenshots showing them with the pearl from Sol B.<br><br><br>This list was created to maintain civility among the guilds of Drinal.

This is how it's fairly done on many other servers.  The list is just starting, and while it is highly unlikely that everyone will absolutely agree with every detail, I think we can all agree on what we're trying to accomplish here.  <br><br>A link to this forum has been posted on UGoD, CiH, CT, TK, UC, WL, KC, FE, Max, and will be posted on as many guild's forums as we can find to make people aware of its existence.  In addition, the clerics who are on the list are well aware of this board's existence, and should pass that information along to any cleric who visits Skyfire and inquires about the Ragefire camp.  <br><br>Hard feelings about the list has already arisen.  If a cleric goes to Skyfire and finds a cleric on the list camping the spawn and takes the time to inquire, that cleric will be directed here, but will ultimately be the person responsible for getting his/her own name added to the list by sending in a simple e-mail.<br><br>No cleric is ready to camp Ragefire if they do not have the Swirling Pearl.  Taking the screen shot confirms that they are ready for the next step. <br><br>I don't think there's anything prejudicial about the methods for getting your name onto the list.  You can come here first, or go to Skyfire first and be told to come here.  Either way, you'll make your way to the list.  The ultimate aim is a civilized way of camping Ragefire that avoids hostility and bickering among people who would otherwise be friendly towards each other.<br><br>We are just trying to support each other and try to get all the clerics who are ready a spot.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uluvyen666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvyen666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/30/02 11:47:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cleric Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> The funny thing is Saela that Softly ALREADY has her Ragefire completed!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   She was one of the individuals who were &quot;listed&quot; on the unposted list. The list is being refined and it is being made fair to all the clerics who want on the list. The reason for showing that you are ready for Ragefire by giving a screen shot is very simple Softly. It's not fair to some cleric who has the quest done to this point and needs Ragefire to complete their quest if another cleric who might not even have started the quest yet gets listed. That cleric gets the container and stuffs it in the bank, then takes 2 months more to complete the quest while the cleric who has his/her pearl gets screwed waiting for 2 or 3 other clerics just like the one with the box in the bank. Since you have your piece and your epic Softly, let those of us who still need the piece and are ready for it deal with this matter.

When we created the list in the first place we had certain things in mind. Some might agree with this, some might not, but perhaps it will put some insight into why we started this.<br><br>Heldenhammer, Emlen and I all came into skyfire at the same time to camp ragefire. (Actually, although I was ready for epic, I was actually there to support another cleric in my guild, Density, who was not online atm.) Seeing as Heldenhammer was from a former guild of mine, and I had heard about him through discussions with Density and that he had camped there with her I knew he was a good guy. Emlen helped me track the solb rage the day before, I also knew he was a good guy. Problem was, who had the rights to the camp? What did we do, we did the oldest trick in the book and rolled on it. At the time, I was rolling for my guildmate Density as she had completed all parts of her epic before me. After the worst roll ever (I believe it was a 200 500 roll and we all got under 250) I won first spawn for Density, HH won the second and Emlen the third, I would camp rage for myself after Emlen. <br><br>This was the start of the list. I hardly knew these other clerics, it wasn't me picking and choosing of my friends.<br><br>HH, Emlen and I spent about 3 weeks in skyfire together. I couldnt' ask for better cleric friends or comrades in that horrible land. As expected, clerics came and went, all wanting to camp, some more determined than others. I knew and I know there are probably hundreds of clerics on this server that are ready for this camp. Well actually every cleric is ready for this camp because it does not require a turn-in piece, but that is a separate subject all together.<br><br>My group of clerics and I talked to every single cleric that came by looking to camp. We told them how we were working it and they would have our full support if they decided to work with us and join the "list" persay. Some that weren't sure, or had thought they had been on and off camping for ragefire too long to join a list that was already 4 clerics long were not added. I understand the frustration, in retrospect I wish I had added them anyway, but there are many ways to view the situation. I'm sorry for any hard feelings that might have resulted from it.<br><br>This list of clerics for ragefire started as a private discussion between clerics that really put forth the effort in the true spirit of clericism and went to skyfire and checked with people there and actually made some very good friends out of it. This may sound mushy and girly, but I think more than half of the reason it has been successful thus far is becuase it was between the clerics that actually put forth the effort to be in skyfire for weeks on end to help others and to get the spawn for themselves. At the end of that much time you will have gotton to know some really great clerics, as an added plus, I earned the respect of the camp from other clerics mulling around and even recieved their help from their guilds when it was my turn. I even recieved the help of a guild whom I have assumed had an extreme distaste for me, that was amazing.<br><br>I would like to see the list continued, and I agree to the dismay of others I'm sure, that all parts of the epic must be done, including ixi, king note, shimmering pearl, before they will be considered for the list. I know my heart dropped to the floor when I let a cleric go ahead of me in line (none of the original three mind you) and he hadn't even done ixiblat fir yet. Those of you that have attempted the ragefire camp I think can relate to the kind of disapointment one must feel, waiting that much longer for someone not even close to done. I wouldn't ask for people to take pictures of the shimmering pearl, but that is up to the cleric currently camping ragefire in my opinion. It is their camp as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>I do want to emphasize that in order for this list to work, it cannot be impersonal. I did not want this list to be public in the first place. I thought it should be an agreement between the ones who actually came to skyfire. I see the benefits of how it could be if the one actually camping ragefire <B>tells the moderator of this board at the end of their camp </B> of the others that have stopped by showing interest and ready for ragefire.<br><br>I know I have shown alot of interest in this subject especially when I am done and over with this camp. The cleric epic is a symbol of honor among clerics and I for one know what a heartbreak it can be to fail numerous times at one or more parts of the epic. I am determined to help with whatever way I can to make this terrible camp easier for everyone involved.<br><br>-One of the original three <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/magada/option.jpg"><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=211882><B>My profile   </a> --- <a href=http://www.crimsontwilight.org><B>Crimson Twilight</a></B><BR> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uluvyen666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvyen666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 6:21:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cleric Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> Just want to say that's a great post Magada, and the input here is valuable to the understanding of how all this came to pass.<br><br>From Magada's post....<br><br>&quot; I would like to see the list continued, and I agree to the dismay of others I'm sure, that all parts of the epic must be done, including ixi, king note, shimmering pearl, before they will be considered for the list.

It is their camp as far as I'm concerned. &quot;<br><br>The idea of having this list in the end looks to be a great idea and it will greatly alleviate the stress that many clerics have been experiencing when they come to this camp. Although I was at first against this idea, due to a misunderstanding of how it was working and that there was actually guilds available to assist the cleric on watch, I now fully support this idea. I was one of the clerics who wanted the list posted, so there is a black and white hard copy that all can see, and will be hard to change by accident or misunderstanding. <br><br>I also was one of the clerics, of which there are many, that want the list to be open to people who are ready for Ragefire, and not someone who will stuff the box in the bank for several months because they have not expended the time and effort to get to the point in the quest where they are ready for Ragefire. I really don't htink this list is any more &quot;impersonal&quot; then a word of mouth list being maintained by the clerics in SF, and it leaves no room &quot;mistakes&quot; as the list is passed down.<br><br>There is a set of rules established here, and a fixed list that is open to the public and all clerics concerned with this camp. There is support for the &quot;little guy&quot; who belongs to smaller guilds who are unable to mobilize the forces needed to take down this mob, before larger more established guilds move in and take the mob from the cleric. And the list eliminates the need for a cleric to sit with 3 or 4 other clerics at the SF camp for weeks on end, hoping and waiting for the mob to spawn. This list is a godsend to those of us still waiting to do this mob, and to those who will come later, ready to do ragefire and receive their epic. Many thanks to those &quot;original&quot; clerics who spawned this idea, and to the people who are now involved in trying to make this list a working, organized, and public information site.<br><br>It's been stated by several that the list and the way the list is being run will not be to the liking of all. You can't please all the people all of the time. However, this list is modeled after working lists on other servers, where this has worked for some time now, and I believe it will also work here.<br><br>Feelsgood Rezzman<br>60 High Priest of Dark Family  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ueqdorgoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQDorgoth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>1st post by this guy</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/02 6:55:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cleric Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> <br>Although I haven't even started on my epic yet (if I ever do) I think this list is a great idea.
