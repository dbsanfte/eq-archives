<br>
Absor responded to this statement on the Rangers Glade regarding a debate over the new enhancemenets to the Cleric, Druid and Shaman classes:<br>
<br>
Actually, you can and should &quot;blame&quot; us for anything that goes into the game. While we certainly listen to player input, in the end the decision about what goes in and what doesn't is ours. We get credit and blame for the whole thing. <br>
<br>
And I disagree about the whole 'zero sum' idea. In fact, I think that such thoughts are a huge hinderance. If we add something to one class we immediately get called upon to 'even things up' by giving something to a bunch of other classes. The truth is, if we're adding an ability to one class it's usually because it needed a boost incomparison to other classes. 'Throwing a bone' to the other classes after such a change defeats the purpose of the change. <br>
<br>
When it comes to this particular change, I think Rich explained it pretty well. The changes to Druid and Shaman healing are needed to remove a problem in the end game where some things just can't be done if there aren't enough clerics. It's a problem for gameplay when something like that exists. <br>
<br>
But the fix itself creates a problem for Clerics, not in the raid situation - where the fix should have the desired effect of actually reducing the absolute need for clerics - but in other portions of the game. We certainly are not planning to make it so that clerics are unwanted in exp groups and similar situations. So we're adding a fix for that issue. <br>
<br>
So, in this one case it turned out that giving something to Druids and Shamans also meant giving something to Clerics. But there is no zero sum. <br>

<br>
Hmmm<br>
<br>
If my memory serves me correctly clerics have rarely, if at all whined significantly about our "jealous" needs for our class before this point in time. Rangers, Wizards, Druids have preiously spoken out... clerics, not much comes to mind. We were the most specified healers, and our effect in parts of the game other than major raids had been compromised with the future addition of shaman/druid heals. I personally believe the new heals are a good thing. But calling clerics whiners for being logically concerned that one of their two most important spells being less effective is a bit harsh. I also believe that the new cleric pet and spells etc don't do us justice in comparison to the power that shaman's and druids have. I do not want to be a soloer, but I would like to see what is up verant's sleeve to "equal" us out. Perhaps I'm whining, or perhaps I'm just interested on how the programers are going to finally work on one of the most specified roles in the game that has had little change since EQ started. I do not want a zero-sum outcome, I want my class to be as distinctive as it was meant to be. Heck, that is why I played a cleric.<br>
<br>
All in all, change equals progress and though we may be raising our voices the fact that our voices are heard can be considered positive progress. I for one encourage all classes to speak their mind.<br>

The test clerics are already experiencing it and seeing groups in CT without a cleric.  Clerics already experience this in the &quot;easy dark-blue zones&quot; like FG, Akeheve, Sebilis, Velks, etc.  Giving clerics a hammer and self-buff and saying go kill light blues, very, very slowly using lots of mana instead of grouping, doesn't give them a warm, comfy feeling. <br>
<br>
Has it changed raiding on test?  Well, no.  Clerics are still nailed to the cheal rotation, which they mostly hate, while druids get to dot, heal, nuke and perform a variety of tasks.  No one is trusting the druid heal enough, or perhaps their druids, to put them in the cheal chain.  So that means that everyone is just as dependent on clerics logging in to raid as they always were.<br>
<br>
Is that whining or is that raising a legitimate concern?  I guess it depends on whether you play a cleric or not or whether you have the empathy capacity of a froglok.<br>
<br>
But I can guarantee you that a greater percentage of clerics you see in the near future will be bots if Sony screws this up.  <br>
<br>
Do druids have playability issues? You betcha.  They've needed changes so they're more groupable and more necessary on raids for ages.  But to give them the raiding benefits at the expense of clerics getting groups is just going to hurt everyone.  If clerics aren't happy, they won't play clerics any longer.  I can't tell you how many ex-clerics I know.  If clerics don't play they don't come to raids.  Do guilds have so many clerics available that this isn't a problem?  I think not.<br>
<br>
Rather than calling clerics whiners and cry babies why not take a stroll around the block in their shoes and look at a slightly larger picture than out of class jealousy or whatever seems to fuel people's resentment of them.  Is it the rez you didn't get at level 11 in Oasis?  <br>
<br>
I think most clerics won't resent giving big heals to other classes as long as their viability in groups isn't diminished.  I don't think that's unreasonable.  Maybe there's some wonderful surprise that Sony hasn't revealed yet that will ease clerics fear, but it's really hard to trust them with that given their track record, especially with clerics.  Clerics have had a long history of having things taken away from them and being told to &quot;deal with it&quot;.<br>

I can understand the people on Test server quite well. Remember it is a &quot;Test&quot; Server, so they should find out in what aspects those new &quot;CH&quot; spells work or don't. So they have to make groups with just druid as healer in harder zones .. places where you normally take a cleric as main healer.<br>
<br>
On the other side I realise that those new &quot;CH&quot; spells don't accomplish the job they are meant to do. But thats why they are on Test in the first place. I hope that Verant sees it the same way.<br>

When they first went in his was really happy and very enthusiastic.   But lately his tone has changed dramatically.  The test server isn't much different from the Live servers in that they have guilds and even uber guilds (sort of) and they get exp and do all the stuff we do.  It's player just like us.  They just get to have a little feedback to the developers. <br>
<br>
Here's what he posted<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
My thoughts after a week+ <br>
Warning, severe negativity inside. <br>
<br>
I have tried hard to come here; and speak of the things that are coming. I have tried my best to bite my tongue to all those who would argue with me or flame me for finding use in our new spells. I have largely ignored being a doomsayer and have taken Rich's side alot, and I realize its more comforting to hear it direct as I do than third hand; but I do my best to make sure you guys hear as much as I can give. <br>
<br>
Things have started to settle down this week. Druid CH has become a way of life now, not a novelty test spell. I'm going to clarify that I am going to call this the &quot;Druid CH&quot; and not the &quot;Druid/Shaman CH&quot; because well, largely, this change means nothing to Shamans, for reasons already covered in numerous threads. <br>
<br>
I believe the Druid spell is both wildly unbalancing to their class; and a hugely damaging blow to our class. I have taken my chances to voice that opinion to Rich W; however I don't believe its entirely his decision, and he is a nice guy who is trying to help us, and I don't want to start a &quot;Burn Rich at the Stake&quot; crusade. <br>
<br>
I could go over a list of everything druids have on us; or everything shamans have on us for that matter -- But I'd get no where. We know the differences. The druid community has always been famous for being the community that can Whine in unison and there with recieve everything -- Squeakiest Wheel if you will. <br>
<br>
Instead, all I am going to say is a very concise point of venting, almost laundry list style. After a week+; now that its all settled in, I feel the Druid CH is more of a Cleric change than any of our new spells, and I'm going to comment on that too. <br>
<br>
My tells for groups has dropped to almost zero. My ability to get a group at all depends entirely on me either making the group; or the mercy of my closest friends. The soloing is only useful to me as a tradeskill farming thing; and believe me its gotten alot of use since every druid bot or solo druid got dusted off and given the primary healer spot in the group. CT is not the haven that some think it will be -- Groups are already there every day who are not using a cleric at all. I don't care what you throw out about the numbers, and the caps, and percentages, and efficiency; its all statistics. Statistics don't mean jack sh*t compared to what really happens in the world, and that is that all statistics aside, the heal is working well enough that either class can now be primary healer and still offer their full array of abilities. <br>
<br>
On the flipside; the intention of the spell, raid usage, has not occured. Druids and Shamans are not being put in CH chains. They're not being used to cut down the amount of clerics needed/wanted for a raid; that was largely determined by the size of the chain needed already. We &quot;know our role&quot; on a raid; in that chain we hate so much. That chain is a tried and true method that has been perfected over time and works. No one wants to fool with trying to rework timing and using casting offsets to work a druid into the chain and pray that the cap on the heal doesn't hit at the same time a boss spikes in damage and you lose the MT. You just don't want to waste everyone's time with that kind of a risk, so its still all cleric, all the time. I'm not talking about Avatar of War here either; In fact I've never even seen the AoW. <br>
<br>
I don't pretend to have an answer, either, short of the one I already know will never happen. All I wanted to do was vent minorly this morning. I have said in the past that I believed we were still useful in some groups, and that there were groups where nothing but a GenuineCleric would do. In alot of ways, thats still true, but the areas are already more rare than CT; and they are dwindling further still as comfort level in all players increases with the Druid CH.<br>

<br>
I hope Verant realizes the complications that will arise from a change of this sort.<br>
<br>
I played a cleric for a reason. Sounds as if we can't solo and we aren't groupable anymore from someone who does play on the test server.<br>
<br>
If it goes live I will have to seriously consider the importance of my role in the game, with respect to my guild of course. I've never been a "press the button" monkey before and don't intend to now. We already have enough problems with those stupid peridots, constantly poor and expected to run across the world to rez a friend at any time. (Which I don't mind doing but there is really only so much someone can give give give and recieve well... this in return?)<br>

I'm guessing that would be the bone they throw the cleric community to improve our groupability.<br>

Ah well, should see more of these:<br>
Tank_01 tells you, &quot;Hello, good cleric, could I possibly talk you into coming to CT to rez my friends and I? We'll provide transportation and a donation, of course.&quot;<br>
You tell Tank_01, &quot;Why doesn't your group's cleric just rez you? They stuck somewhere nasty or LD or something?&quot;<br>
Tank_01 tells you, &quot;We don't have a cleric in our group =/&quot;<br>
You tell Tank_01, &quot;OOooo...bad call!&quot;<br>

People will get sick of eatting 90% pally rezzes or paying a necro for an EE to get a 93% rez...guess its about the only thing we'll have left unless VI really pulls something out of their collective asses on this one... <p><table border=1>

now a group can be started (just a little bit) easier w/o depending on one single class.  omg they better not put this live.  haha<br>
<br>
everything jing said was 100% correct.  groups are still gonna want a cleric over any other healer (if anything just for rez).  the only reason that guy started having trouble finding groups is because people are now finally starting to say, &quot;well let's get the druid&quot; instead of waiting, sitting, hours for their usual cleric to log on.  maybe this will teach clerics to work for a group for once in their game lifetimes like everyone else.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umagadi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>magadi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/02 5:51:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3631.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: true dat</span><hr size=1> ...<br>

This is one of those time where you write a long post and then erase it. <br>
<br>
Jing. I agree with you, in the end game, having to bot clerics suck. As I said before, those new heals in game will be a good thing. <br>
<br>
<br>
To the rest that have to comment on whatever. I challenge you to play a cleric as a main. (no, not a bot) Try earning money, try soloing, try camping something like an fbss or stormfeather by yourself, try competing with the bots in FG and many other places where the xp is as thick as the soloers. Read the post by the test server cleric 5 times.<br>
<br>
Then you may comment in well thought-out sentances. <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/magada/option.jpg"><BR>

<br>
This guy had some great ideas that would make the druid CH meaningful enough that they could actually participate on the cheal chain (no complaining now druids, you wanted to be more wanted on raids) plus there are things that would make clerics more valuable in groups. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
After much thought and deliberation, I feel this Druid/Shaman CH will be a positive change for everquest as a whole. The complete overdependence on clerics in the high level game is something that MUST be changed. When you need 10 of 1 class to do an encounter, there is something wrong. I was a little apprehensive at the magnitude of the change, but between the experience modifier, and the potential for positive changes that clerics are long overdue for, I think this could greatly increase the happiness and harmony between the classes. <br>
<br>
Notation Disclaimer: <br>
Notation is given in HP:mana; i.e., 4 HP per 1 mana used. <br>
<br>
Balancing Druid/Shaman Healing: <br>
======================= <br>
-Superior healing down to 44. It's just cruelty to make them wait longer. Cheals at this level becomes efficient with Symbol of Naltron; we won't be losing our &quot;healing superiority&quot;. This is a left over from the 50-cap era when clerics needed superior healing to be better at single target healing. This day is LONG past, and needs to be changed. <br>
<br>
-Chloroblast down to 53. Clerics have divine light, it's not a threat. <br>
<br>
-Up Druid CH to 55. It should heal the lesser 55% of a person's maximum HP, or 5.5k. If you're going to give them a raid-quality heal to help offset some of the weight on clerics, make it GOOD! I am comfortable with the fact that 2 druids could take my place in a cheal cycle. 3k is not enough when tanks can get have 8k buffed. With a higher cap but lower percentage, it helps raids significantly more, but experience groups slightly less. However, at the level that they get it, in experience groups, Druids will still be healing at over 4:1 with this change, which is easily enough to assure they can function enough as a group's healer. At level 60, they will be healing at over 5.5:1 on your average warrior, which is more than enough to function as a healer at that level. <br>
<br>
-Leave shaman CH alone, just move it to 55. Lesser of 75% of max HP heal, or 2k. This adds some diversity of roles between Shaman and Druid CH so Shaman don't feel &quot;1 upped&quot; by druids. <br>
<br>
-Move Nature's touch down to 58. <br>
<br>
-Make Nature's Recovery GOOD! Make it heal a total of 1250 over 3 minutes for 250 mana, and remove the recycle time. The way it is now is almost insulting, and will be moreso after druid CH is added. <br>
<br>
Balancing Clerics: <br>
======================== <br>
-Level 19 and 29 are the worst level for clerics, because druids and shaman heal just as well - and bring a lot of other nifty tricks to a group. Give these clerics something to compete with. Give level 19 clerics a new spell, Mark of Retribution-lite. 40 mana, 5 point DS that increases to 8 over time. Give level 29 clerics a new spell, Mark of Karn-lite. It should heal 2.5:1 on a single target on an average length fight. I'm not up on lower level DPS, but 50 mana for for 1 point healed / 7 delay (rounded up) sounds right. <br>
<br>
-Drop Divine Barrier's cast time to 1.0, with a 10% heal, and put mana cost to 150. Make it better than the level 1 version. <br>
<br>
-Change ONLY Turning of the Unnatural to include a 40% snare component, keep the total damage the same, but up the duration to 2 minutes. <br>
<br>
-Put united resolve back in, level 49. <br>
<br>
-Drop heroism to level 51. No one EVER cast it at the level we got it, due the heroic bond mix up. <br>
<br>
-Yaulp V is a FANTASTIC idea. But if I have to cast Yaulp V every 24 seconds, I'm going to go insane. Double the duration and mana cost, and make sure it works with focus effects, and increase the mana returned per tick to 12 at level 60. <br>
<br>
-Up weapon caps of clerics and druids to 200, and shaman to 210. We don't have double attack, it's not going to hurt to allow us to hit something. <br>
<br>
-Move Celestial Elixer to 55 to counterbalance Druid CH. Keep the heal rate the same. Make it work with the shawl; it already works with spell casting reinforcement, it's not unbalancing to let it work with enhanced buff duration too. It will still be worth casting, even at level 60, if it works with enhanced buff duration. <br>
<br>
-Reagent reduction AA. 4 points, reduces reagent cost by 50%, rounded up. Stackable with focus item effects. This means Aegolism will take 0 Peridots, Blessing of Aegolism will take 2, Divine Intervention will take 1. Change the effect on Donal's pants to Mark of Retribution to prevent exploitation. <br>
<br>
-Buff duration foci should work with group buffs. <br>
<br>
-Ethereal Elixer is a fantastic idea, but will be way overpowered. I could keep an entire raid healed against zlexak by myself. Up the mana cost to 1500. This is way too powerful. Nerf it before it goes live to prevent the &quot;you took from us&quot; syndrome. <br>
<br>
-Decrease the proc rate on the new summoned hammer, and add a spell that adds the same proc to any weapon you have to make up the difference. If the dev team can only make imbue-proc spells like the paladins get at a fixed rate (let's say 5%), and the proc rate of the current hammer is 20%, change the new hammer to 15% and add a spell that stacks a proc (the same proc) at the fixed 5% rate. It's not a perfect solution, but it would stop us from completely banking those uber weapons we've obtained for something we can summon. <br>
<br>
-Change the new direct heals to make them worth casting. Clerics are the wizards of healing, make us so. Ethereal light (Sunstrike) should be 450 mana for 1600 healing, and Ethereal Remedy (Ice Spear) should be 1200 mana for 300 healing. At 525 mana, Ethereal light is going to rot in the back of my spell book. In 70% of cases of experience groups, I cast complete heal on casters anyway, because it's so much more efficient than divine light (and yes, I hunt in difficult places - Ssra, CT, et cetera). If the horrible ratios of our direct heals were better, I would probably use them instead. <br>
<br>
-Put Blessed Armor of the Risen at a higher priority level than Focus of Spirit and Khura's Focusing. I can think of VERY few situations where ANY cleric would ever want an extra 150 or so hit points over 6 mana/tick. Having to recast this extremely annoying. <br>
<br>
-Level 59 curse spell, like Curse of Zebuxorok, that makes heals have only 1/3 of their potential effect. An even better solution would be diety-specific curses at this level; but that would be a lot of extra work balancing them so that no one is much better than another; I suggest the former. Make it 350 mana to cast. <br>
<br>
-Level 59 group AC buff, in the Bulwark of Faith line. Bulwark of Faith level AC to the group, for 1000 mana. <br>
<br>
-Drop Aegolism to level 59. Most guilds that have been in luclin have many copies of Blessing of Aegolism banked already, getting it when you turn 60 is a freebie. Blessing of Aegolism and Aegolism drop like water, give clerics a chance to cast the single target before they get the benefit of the group buff. <br>
<br>
-Upgrade Mark of Retribution slightly. Remember, we have to cast this on every mob, and it can be resisted, which already greatly lowers its effectiveness compared to DS. At level 60 it should do 19 per hit. This would also take care of most soloability issues by increasing our net DPS. <br>
<br>
-Make Mark of Karn better. This is an old wound for most clerics. If it doesn't heal 5:1 on a single target in 1 minute, it won't be worth casting. Considering Complete Heal heals at 8:1 or greater at this level, and other melee _rarely_ get hit by incomming pulls, this turns Mark of Karn into little more than a DS-stripping device. Remember, this can be resisted, which GREATLY lowers its effectiveness compared to standard heals. In its current incarnation, I don't even cast it off my BP unless the mob has a damage shield. Leave it main hand only, and delay based (so as not to favor one class over another), but increase the amount it heals. I did a quick test with a level 51 warrior, and they hit 35 times in 1 minute with a 20 delay weapon, FBSS haste, and no speed buffs. With an off-the-cuff calculation, 1 point healed per 2 delay of a weapon. With speed buffs, this would be about 700 healed in 1 minute (average life expectancy of an experience group mob). We have to cast this on every single mob, and it still has a chance of being resisted. It will not be over powering by any stretch. Drop the duration to 2.5 minutes to prevent abuse. <br>
<br>
-Drop Divine Ressurection down to 1 real-world day recycle time. Three days is a stretch. <br>
<br>
-Drop Divine intervention down to 1 Emerald, and increase success rate to 50% with no charisma check. Most guilds don't even bother with this spell. A better solution might be to drop the component (or up the duration to an hour), drop the heal to 25% of max HP, and make it work 90% of the time. The latter would be preferrable to most, I think, but either would make this spell a lot more useable. <br>
<br>
-Clerics are supposed to be the bane of undead. We are not. Leave exile undead at level 55, but upgrade it to 800 damage, scaling to 900 at level 60. Make target-specific lines like the cleric/necro undead series, and the mage/druid banishment series lure resist, due to their very very limited application. <br>
<br>
-Change Banishment of the Shadows to 1 opal, and make it work with the above mentioned reagent reduction AA. With the extremely limited uses this spell has (only currently used in a few luclin uber fights), I don't think it is unreasonable. <br>
<br>
-Make the mask in 4c in Cazic Thule Cleric useable. Come on, give us a HOPE of obtaining a safer method of travel; Vex Thal is a bit out of reach for most. Every single class has some sort of infinite-cast invis but clerics and paladins. Warriors have two. The sky will not fall. The price of these will skyrocket, so the GVD will still remain an attractive choice. <br>
<br>
-Get rid of Abundant Food and Drink on Velious armor. Either make it Cornicopia and Everfount, or change them to low-end focus effects, like extended range 3 and reagent reduction 3. At least then we might use them.<br>

<br>
And I can say with most certainty, that druids solo much better than we can in the grey. As you play a warrior main it seems, I thought you might understand where clerics are coming from. Both of our classes are at times are thought of as one trick ponys. (Which we aren't, but we are thought of that way.)<br>
<br>
I don't understand what is so hard to grasp about our situation here. We agree the new heals in the game are going to be a good thing. We never said they weren't. I would like to state right now that clerics as a whole generally PROMOTE the new heals in game. <br>
<br>
What we would like to know is... now what makes clerics distinctive. Some of the ideas posted above might be good ones. We originally were just posting under the original topic and I responded to the fact that we were referred to as whiners. I personally don't really want to be a soloer. I mentioned soloing because the druid was complaining he couldn't find a group earlier... <B>Druids, Wizards, Mages, Necros and sometimes monks, shadowknights paladins, etc. </B>it seems are soloers by nature. Sad, but true, if they can't find a group they go out and solo and do quite well at it. In fact, a wizard near and dear to me would rather solo. Clerics, and I'm sorry if you consider root dotting in the grey as good xp, but we are not soloers, we were never meant to be soloers, and I didn't play a cleric so I could solo. If I wanted to solo, I would have started a (see list above). <br>
<br>
Generally speaking, clerics really like to group. One of the best summers of my EQ experience was when I was working through my earlier levels with a tight knit group of friends in OT and DL. We are worried about losing that is all. Our options are more limited than a shaman and a druid to equal the same amount of xp. <br>
<br>
Is it that you don't believe us? Or you honestly don't see how our role in the regular game is logically a little bit more threatened than before? Hey, if I'm wrong when this goes live I will be the first one to admit it and rejoice it and you can expect to see my full apology on here. But is it so strange to you that these should be concerns in the first place? <br>
<br>
I'm yammering! :) stopping now :-p <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/magada/option.jpg"><BR>

The high end game is dependent on one class above all else, clerics.  Anything to reduce that dependency is welcome and I don't see the big deal with it.  I find it hard to imagine clerics would begrudge druids anything, especially since druids are 1/5th as useful in my opinion. <br>
<br>
I also don't understand the crap about group desirability.  If you don't get invited to groups, make them. It's not that hard. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A> at: 9/1/02 1:02:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/1/02 6:55:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3631.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: true dat</span><hr size=1> . <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A> at: 9/1/02 12:59:47 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3631.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=3631.topic&start=41&stop=44>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3631.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3631.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3631.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.threadControl?topicID=3631.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3631.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3631.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
