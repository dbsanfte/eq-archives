Somethings rotten in Denmark folks. If there is ANY truth behind your story Lotozek, get a clue and join the rest of the world making an honest buck to help out your financial strain. If VI catches you selling junk (and this post certainly isn't gonna help you in that regard) you may just lose your account, then you won't even be able to make the occassional buck doing what you were doing. <br>
<br>
I can only assume by your discussions with another poster that perhaps you are the real Lotozek. If so don't scam someone else because you got burned doing something that you knew was against the rules and therefore offered little recourse. <br>
<br>
Just as a suggestion here is what I would do if I were you and wanted to sell goods and/or money.  Buy some cds with basic eq for ten dollars. Put the money on that account with the free month and put their money on that account. Give them the password and id after you get the money via pay pal, then send them the cds registered mail, once they have signed for delivery of the disks you have evidence of the completed transaction. If they don't sign for the disks, they should be returned to you and you can get your account back and claim it was hacked and probably get their accounts banned (as I can only assume the money woudl get transferred to their accounts).  <br>
<br>
I havent' a clue as to whether or not something like the above would work, but this it just an example of showing there are methods of breaking the rules intelligently.  I think it is lame as hell if this guy is scamming you outta the agreed on deal, but seems like you are in the midst of another deal gone poorly. You plead financial strain, yet you talk about having a new car. You say you have 500 dollars in your paypal account in one post, in another you say it's in the negative. You have the legs that you sold someone else, yet you refuse to give those over as either collateral or as completion of the sale. Man I am smelling something....<br>
<br>
One other thing I just don't think I fully get, and maybe I am wrong here and misinformed. I find it very hard to believe that if someone pays for something via paypal, that paypal will jump in and reverse the charges right away based on a claim that then there was no delivery. <br>
<br>
At any rate.... I CALL A PAGE EIGHT HERE!!!!!!<br>

<br>

<br>
Anyways, onto other questions. <br>
<br>
The money I had in my paypal account was froze, so I cant access shit. And as to my car, so the fuck what? I drive around a decent little thing.<br>
<br>
Denton, I think you used to know Me as Megolian, not sure. As to your topic... bleh I might get centered around alot of fights but its due more to my..... unliked views more so than it is in game deals or item transactions.<br>
<br>
I dont MIND that some people dont like me, I kinda like it that way. I mean what the fuck is fun about everyone being your friend? Anyways, rallos I just got back from a movie, and have to re-read this thread, will try to answer some of yoru questions then.<br>
<br>
And Briyan, get that faggot ass picture out of your sig. And go get some fucking help dude. Any 17 year old kid who wants it in the ass has issues.<br>

I go from 15 to 16 to 17.<br>
<br>
You have financial problems at home, yet drive around a nice little car, now, that's just stupid. I mena, it's like &quot;Hmm, rent is about to go under, better go drive for a while in my nice car *car gleams*&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with being gay. Obviously it's you that has the problem for saying that shit. So, what happened Megolian, have a bad gay experience or something? Or are you just a homophobe because *gasp* HETEROSEXUALITY IS NOT &quot;NORMAL&quot; IT IS JUST MORE COMMON.<br>
<br>
You know, Lotozek, and actually some of the other people on these boards, and everyone in the world needs to open their fucking eye to what is going on in the world. Do you know that several things are happening for the gay community? Technically, soon, hittinga gay person is technically going to be like hitting a woman (shut the fuck up, I know that sounds like a putdown to myself, but it isn't.) Y'all should keep up on the world, and grow a fucking brain.<br>
<br>
And actually, Lotozek, I knew you when I played Tobyn/Tyyke and Baraccus/Briyan because I tried to ruin your guild on purpose, because I knew you were a scammer from the start. I remember you tried to sell a guildie a polar bear cloak for 300pp and you were &quot;cutting them a deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then I &quot;bought my epic&quot; I knew that I was going to be quitting the game to get away from something that was adding even more stress in my life. I just wanted to see how upholding of a scammer you still were. yeah, 25k I handed to you. (Bynox if your reading this, sorry, talk to me on AIm about this) And then I found out that you don't even HAVE YOUR epic. I knew this from the start. I knew that you'd tried to scam other people into the &quot;oops, I messed up on the turnin! I just got my epic&quot; trick.<br>
<br>
What happened when I asked you for the cash back as a decent human being? You tell me I'ma  sack of shit for not going through on the deal, etc. And you give me 9k and items worth about 5k also. Ooooh.<br>
<br>
This, my friends, is how Lotozek makes his money. And I've also SOLD him money before on playerauctions. So there is NO fucking way he has &quot;problems at home&quot; or his dad had a stroke or whatnot. Lotozek is one of the biggets sacks of shit I've ever met. He Lies, he SCAMS, he CHEATS, HE BUYS PLAT, HE HAS HACKED (he used to talk about it in guild (I dont even remember which guild it was, long times past... I broke them up anyways.) He has bought items also...<br>
<br>
Believe me Lotozek, I talk to a  lot of people that sell things. So. Ha.<br>
<br>
Now, let's see here. I knew that I was doing something wrong when I was selling platinum, But I made a nice $2000 off of it. What hapened? I got like 10 warnings. Only got suspended once, and that was because I told Valindor to suck my cock because I hated him. I was always in contact with VI, and never got banned. Why? Because I was nice to all of the CS.<br>
<br>
However, calling a GM a shithead because of a bug, is not a cool thing, Lotozek.<br>
<br>
And you make fun of me because I'm gay? How fucking petty and stupid can you get? You are a liar, scammer, cheater, slammer, bitch, etc. YOU can't even stay in a guild anymore because of the fact that YOU HAVE TRIED TO SUCK SO MANY GUILD BANKS DRY AND THEN YOU JUST REMOVE YOURSELF. <br>
<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
And yes, this is a side portion of my post. I knew that I was breaking up guilds, and I would do it intentionally, for kicks. I got tired of EQ back in about June of '01, after playing Tobyn/Tyyke and Beginning Baraccus. EVEN THOUGH I had many other chars all 40+. I had nothing to do with the Inferni Millites breakups though, that was all other people and I just said my 2 cents and people left because it started a discussion. I broke up a lot of guilds, and then I cooled down, quit for about 3 months, came back, and was like &quot;Wow, White Wind, I remember playing wth a lot of them&quot; So I joined. With PURE intentions, mind all of you. I kept good, and then I decided to quit. So I sold all my stuff. What are the GM's gonna do now? Ban my account that is cancelled? Ha.<br>
________________________________________<br>
<br>
Back to Lotozek. You said that you wanna quit the game or whatever. I don't believe you should quit the game, I believe you should put a motherfucking gun in your mouth and end THIS game. Bitch.<br>

<br>
What I find comical about you is your idiotic statments and claims.<br>
<br>
You GAVE me 25k for my Robe Of The Whistling Fists MQ, I never claimed to have my epic, I was planning on quitting lotozek, therefore had no reason to keep his Robe. THAT was what I agreed on with you, wasnt it you who said you would do your epic fights alone? Thats what I thought.<br>
<br>
And how the fuck does it speak volumes about you, that you have to go on and on about how your gay? Cant you just fucking be gay? Do you have to portray it, and always talk about? You can have your opinion that your fucking dandy and shit, and I can think your a fucking pathetic little kid looking for an answer. Which when you talk about how you like to be on top to make out with your boyfriend? And I do remember you saying your 17, thats FUCKD Up. And I hope you get aids and die a long slow death you pathetic fuck.<br>
<br>
As far as your claims about sucking guild banks dry, what the hell are you talking about? I've been involved in VERY VERY few guilds. And never ONCE requested anything out of a guild bank. And yea, awhile back I bought plat online, -AWHILE- ago, so who the fuck really cares? <br>
<br>
And if you want my home phone number Briyan, I'd be glad to have yout alk to my mother and see if my dad had a stroke or not, or maybe youd like to talk to him yourself? You little bitch you can talk about me as much as you want cause i dont give a fuck but if you bring my father, who I love very much, and literally is living in borrowed time, badly, I'll fucking kill you.<br>
<br>
As far as the whole scamming shit you like to talk about. Yea, I've fucked up a few times. Were they intentional? Some. But I've always TRIED to be a decent person to my friends. You know nothing about me but your own biased opinion, and what you like to believe. You want to tell me you've never fucked up in life?<br>
<br>
When people get desperate they do desperate things, its how the world runs. I'm in that stage where I'm not sure what to do with life, or what to make of it, but does that matter? Fuck no.<br>
<br>
Your blind Briyan, completley and utterly blind. You like tot alk about how we all dont know whats happening in the gay community, and how alot of people on this board have all these problems. <br>
<br>
Your still the one who fucking is 17 and having sex with other guys? Are you even aware how fucked up that is? You disguise your own issues with rants on others, how pathetic can you get?<br>
<br>
Bottom line is you dont know shit about me, other than what you WANT to believe. And as far as my family not having financial problems, again, you dont know jack shit about me or my family.<br>
<br>
And as far as me ending &quot;the game of life&quot; Who the fuck hasnt thought about that? But its people like you Briyan that make me keep playing, and never /qing on real life. Because maybe someday I can catch you and beat the shit out of you with a baseball bat, and grin to myself as I watch blood trickle from your fucking head into the sewers.<br>
<br>
You dont know -shit- about who your fucking with.<br>

And I find it HILARIOUS that you have to keep starting new characters because your reputation gets worse than Baraccus' ever was. <br>
<br>
I'm not even going to really comment on this Lotozek, I'm just going to laugh heartily because you, my friend, are a fucking idiot.<br>
<br>
Bue I do have one comment to make, the whole fact that you had to say /q life. Now. Excuse me, fucking sad? I do believe so. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oooh ooh, look at me, I can /q life by /emoting this gun into my mouth and /emoting pull the trigger! WHEEE!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just remember Lotozek, some 15 year olds are more mature than you.
