<br>
you are selling something that you do not own. and that is illegal. however, as a buyer, you have never signed the EULA, and therefore are not under contract with verant until you log in. its like buying something illegal without knowing it (though granted most buyers know what they are doing is wrong; heck, most people that buy stolen property arent stupid enough to not realize it, they just look the other way)<br>
<br>
the fact remains, it would cost sony more money to pursue legal action against these people than they could ever hope to recover by sueing for breach of contract. since they are not losing money through the sales, they could not ask for much money for the breach. thus, the only thing they bother to do is enforce their right to deny you the service and hence: ban the account<br>
<br>
but, since the sale and transfer of items and money in game does not actually cost sony money (like theft would or the illegal sale of a ride in an amusement park etc) why than does sony care? they dont want to<br>
<br>
whats really the problem is the amount of customer service time that is wasted dealing with the &quot;he said, she said&quot; crap that goes on, and the childish item thefts, supposed account thefts, and he took back my account and i paid for it, yadda yadda yadda. all of those little childish crap incidents that people try to get sony to deal with for them wastes so much time (and time is money when you have to pay your investigators(GMs) an hourly wage higher than the monthly subscription cost of that one account)<br>
<br>
thus it is more cost efficient for them to ban a $10 a month account, than it is for them to waste $10+ an hour trying to figure out who is lieing and who is telling the truth<br>
<br>
the bottom line is sony would look the other way and not give a dam about account sales, or item sales, if they never had to be involved with the customer service end of it<br>
<br>
that EULA is there to protect them, and allow them to cut off their monetary responsibilty. if you didnt cost them the time and money involved in calling up and bothering them, they really wouldnt give a rats ass which end of the contract you broke as long as they keep getting paid<br>
<br>
i really dont feel like explaining it in any more depth, you either get it, or you dont <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ualealthewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aleal the Wiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~fuellg/tz.gif height=20 width=20" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 724<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/8/02 9:24:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2517.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: well</span><hr size=1> Wouldn't verant stand to make alot of money if they officially sold it through them and took say 10% - 50% of all sales on items?

<br>
as it is they have a hard enough time policing their own staff from abusing the game with /creation tools and character copy/move tools. imagine if they were to endorse character sales and item sales, the abuse potential and risks are too high<br>
<br>
the moment they start adding RL monetary value to virtual items, they become finacially responsible for loss to bugs, loss to corpse decay, and so on<br>
<br>
maybe if there wasnt such a history of item destroying and/or duping bugs, and little brothers that delete items/characters, it could work (you have any idea how many times a day i used to hear that excuse?)<br>
<br>
i can hear it now though, my little brother deleted this sword i paid $500 for, and you need to replace it, i even PAID you to give it to me, so you know i had it.. right, how bout the 4 differant IP locations logged into your account this week , and the fact you dropped it on the ground and this other account picked it up.. etc...<br>
<br>
it may work in the future with a less buggy more secure game, but eq would have a hard time dealing with it<br>

<br>
Verant profits off of a purchased account. AN account that might have been stopped is paid for by a new person. Transfer of Responsiblity seems viable, its allowed in most other forms of ownership. I guess you are &quot;renting&quot; your character stoired  on their servers but own your box and manuals?<br>
<br>
In game scams are one thing but if someone sells something out of the game to someone else. IE: my next door neighbor loves eq, I have two accounts I sell him one for 50 bux for him to have fun with me, its not legal, why the fuk not lol it seems so silly. <br>
<br>
If someone WANTS to purchase an account and someone is willing to sell it, I in the end do not see it right for a company to claim &quot;ownership&quot; of a product that was bought and paid for claiming the virtual pixels of this said product as &quot;theirs&quot; <br>
<br>
If I go to an amusement park, and win some stuffed animals, by paying a vendor to play a game do they have rights to say who I sell or not sell the stuffed animal to because of the service access they provided me to their amusement park after I leave it?<br>
<br>
Theres many arguements either way, however in this case, the purchaser should have taken more precaution, and has the right to pursue legal action against the guity party. Those posting here citing &quot;hes an idiot he deserved what he got&quot; have their opinons but no one looking at this with any competent legal sense would see it that way.<br>

<br>
Most stores do a 100% markup or more, but let's go with that for the sake of numbers:<br>
<br>
So, that's $30.<br>
<br>
Manufacturin/storage/shipping probably easily runs $10 per box (CD + Manual + inserts + box itself + color printing + storage (HUGE money sink for companies) + bulk shipping), if not more.<br>
<br>
So they lose, what? $10 on the outside, I'm guessing the profit margin is ALOT slimmer than that, though.<br>

<br>
Now the guy who did the scamming is a complete scumbag, and I feel bad for the guy he sold to.  It totally sucks, but no one can get scammed, you can only let yourself get scammed.  And in this case, buying something from someone who does not have the right to sell it, who does not own it, is letting yourself get scammed.<br>
<br>
Taking the account back is immoral and unethical, no shit.  But the situation should never have come to that because the account should not have been sold.  I did not sell my account when I quit, Senni did not sell hers.  I deleted Shada and she cancelled, no one was buying us and no one else was going to play us.<br>
<br>
I got scammed once for $800.  That was 18 years ago, I learned my lesson, and it will never happen again.  Like I said, sucks for the guy who bought it but you put yourself in situations like that and with the majority of assholes in this world what can you expect?  Listen to Fox Mulder: trust no one.<br>
