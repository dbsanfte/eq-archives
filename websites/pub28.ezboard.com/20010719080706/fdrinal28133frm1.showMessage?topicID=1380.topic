<br>
Just thought I would drop in and stir some shit, lol. Ok here is the question(s):<br>
<br>
I have seen in the 19 months I have been in this game several people who looked down to you when you played a female character although being a male in Real Life. They would ignore you or even sometimes call you names.<br>
<br>
What do you think about people playing a female char although being male or vice versa (although I doubt females do that...kinda)<br>
<br>
<br>
Personal View:<br>
<br>
It is a frigging MMORPG and when someone decides to play a female char being a male iRL then power to them. I think thanks to people doing this we actually get to see female chars in the game. I will shamelessly guess that about 80% (if not more) of the Everquest population is formed by males, and if everyone played their own gender iRL in the game as well, it would look just like the town I live in *shudders*.<br>
<br>
Oh btw, for the ones who wonder now, I myself am a male iRL too *gasp*<br>
<br>
Anyhow..I am off, gotto study for a silly exam some more :) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushaiela.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaiela</A> at: 3/11/01 8:05:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udoofyrainbowfloatar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doofy Rainbowfloatar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 455<br> <font color=#993300>(3/11/01 8:13:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion - Topic X !</span><hr size=1> you like to stir shit?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boto</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#993300>(3/11/01 8:22:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion - Topic X !</span><hr size=1> Who cares, unless your looking for more than &quot;online&quot; interaction.

She liked the druid class and kept playing him, mine is still level 6.  Seems strange that folks would be hung up about the RL sex of of an online toon unless it ruins their RL fantasies.<br>

While we are on the subject... in-game mariages are silly unless your married in RL. I say silly because most people would get offended if I said BS. And as for RPing... most people don't after the first month of playing the game. Why? Because EQ is not an RPG 8 )p<br>

<br>
The reason I took a female (Dark Elf) Char was cause I was fascinated that the female DE skin looked so kewl :) When I started the game I didnt know shit about loot neither that the female chars got items for free from people :)<br>
<br>
Not to mention nowadays I almost daily head to West Commons and dish out items to random people which I have looted on raids and noone wanted it cause they were junk for us (iE Berserkers Sword, Giant Warrior Helm etc.) so Call me , Shaiela Charity De'Vir :P<br>
<br>
But back to the point, I find it only unacceptable when people give out to be a female in RL although they are not and keep acting as if Everquest was some Cybersex IRC channel (*gasp* did I say that?).<br>

from my experience the majority of people who play eq are over 18. I think some people who made female chars did do it because they know how people are. If your a 19year old male and a female asks you for some change for a phone call, and you have it... you're gona give it to her. If a guy asks you, you might think about giving it to him... but most likely not. Everyone knows how things like this go and if someone made a female char in the game to take advantage of it id say they are prety damn smart for using it to their advantage.<br>
<br>
I dont look down on anyone because of the sex they play whether they are male or female playing either. It realy doesnt make a diffrence... even if they are some wierd perverted freak, if they can play their class i realy dont care. they can even try to hit on me, if they are doing what needs to be done as far as their class goes i can just put them on ignore and we can still kill the dragons, raid the dungons and all i would have to say about the perv is i know he / she knows how to play his/ her class.

Mad, thats unfortunately very true...But still you shouldnt forget the minority of people who kinda build up their own world in Everquest and dont care for the loot. They still go to , iE , to Oasis and kill Orcs for them being evil, or just sitting for hours and hours in towns, doing their trading with Roleplaying (that rocks) etc. etc. <br>

Yes Everquest is most definitely not a perfect game for roleplaying when considered to Ultima Online which was and still is the best MMORPG imho where you can roleplay but as long as you want to it is possible :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ucarathienf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathien F</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(3/11/01 4:21:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Discussion - Topic X !</span><hr size=1> I am in RL a male but playing a female char in eq.

The only kind of roleplaying that &quot;works&quot; in EQ is the silly stuff (ogre-speak etc) since the tool just isnt good enough to get some depth on the roleplayer aspect.<br>
