Lets stop pointing fingers.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Center for Disease Control says.....<br>
Of new infections among men in the United States, CDC estimates that approximately 60 percent of men were infected through homosexual sex, 25 percent through injection drug use, and 15 percent through heterosexual sex. Of newly infected men, approximately 50 percent are black, 30 percent are white, 20 percent are Hispanic, and a small percentage are members of other racial/ethnic groups.(4)<br>

Of newly infected women, approximately 64 percent are black, 18 percent are white, 18 percent are Hispanic, and a small percentage are members of other racial/ethnic groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
International Statistics<br>
<br>
According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, as of the end of 2001, the following trends of the worldwide epidemic (or pandemic) of HIV are evident:<br>
<br>
Women are becoming increasingly affected by HIV. Approximately 48%, or 17.6 million, of the 37.2 million adults living with HIV or AIDS worldwide are women. <br>
<br>
<br>
Today, 40 million people are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS. Of these, 37.2 million are adults. 17.6 million are women, and 2.7 million are children under 15. <br>
<br>
During 2001, AIDS caused the deaths of an estimated 3 million people, including 1.1 million women and 580,000 children under 15.<br>
<br>
<br>
The overwhelming majority of people with HIV - approximately 95% of the global total - now live in the developing world.<br>

<br>
Yes the majority are gay men, straight men don't tend to end up with bodily fluids leftover from sex floating around inside them where they can enter the bloodstream.  However to go back to the point of this particular argument, to hate gays merely because they spread AIDS is absolutely preposterous. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

<br>
As for the other comment, no the site didn't say what I said -- but I can read between the lines of their spin.<br>
<br>
&quot;International travel&quot; as a main cause of HIV invection is wrong. People who travel internationally buttfucking in bathhouses or under bridges or whatever without a raincoat on IS or WAS a primary means of transmission. The site blames the travel, when it's the BEHAVIOR that causes the infection.<br>
<br>
This disease is by and large caused by BEHAVIOR DECISIONS of HUMANS. Not by needles, not by travel, not by poverty, but by fucking and doing drugs with people you don't know enough about.<br>
<br>
If you are stupid enough to come to conclusions about your life and the issues in it based on the spin of a website, you are fucked in the head, and no amount of education will cure it.<br>
<br>
And, as an aside, I have a BS from a top five school in my field (accounting) and have been knocking around the school of hard knocks for 38 years -- so bite my ass about education, you ignorant fuck. At least I can read between the lines on what is pretty obviously an agitprop site.<br>

<br>
How many of these women who got it from straight sex did it with someone who was bisexual, an IV drug user, etc? Prolly most of em, either 1st hand or 2nd.<br>
<br>
Again, it's behavior.<br>
<br>
There's very little chance my wife or I will ever contract HIV -- because we don't practice sex outside of our relationship, and niether of us shares needles. <br>
<br>
And those women wouldn't have contracted HIV either if they hadn't been having sex with carriers. Which was a choice.<br>
<br>
And I for one haven't said anything about hating gays. I have a couple of friends, gay, who have died of AIDS; I didn't hate them in the least -- but I was sad about their choices. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.fast.net/~mikem/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No Life</span><br>  Posts: 1048<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 10:27:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame guys and gals that play other races in EQ</span><hr size=1> I believe there was a quote by dirra that goes along the lines of this &quot;LOL i was in velk and ooc'd 'homophobe 53 ranger looking for group' that was the fastest i've ever been invited to a group'<br>

Yes, I did say that. Now read closely. Get your face right up in the monitor, so you don't miss these questions:<br>
<br>
Ever hear of a JOKE? Ever take something in context? (Oh, you've already answered that last one, nm)<br>
<br>
BTW, if you had any bona fide education, you'd know that homophobe means &quot;afraid of gays&quot;, not &quot;hates gays&quot;; and therefore, even if I was a homophobe in reality (which I'm not, except I suppose if I was in a jail shower or locked in a room with Fibbie), it still wouldn't fit your argument. I have Democrat friends as well, but I am a demophobe -- and that's not an oxy-moron either.<br>

However one thing about Homophobes....phobe = fear correct, but as most know, fear usually leads to hate.<br>
<br>
So homophobe and homo-hater (sorry my Latin is non existent) are pretty much synonymous. <p><img src="http://scarecrow.clickhere2.net/images/oaksiggy_new1.gif" border=0></a><br><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=253834">Saurakk Rex</a>

Dirra Dirra Dirra... :)<br>
<br>
My point in all of this was not against you my strangely deffensive non-aquaintance.  It goes back to Fibblefuck and LLaramanaana or some shit who started the gays = aids = evil crap in what was once an amusing thread.  My point is that yes gays have aids, but so do a hell of a lot of straight people, and that Gays did not create nor start this epidemic (although they were the hardest hit right up front).<br>
<br>
You see I too am a child of the 60's who spent the 80's actually learning about HIV and AIDS and how it was spread, not by some choice, but because it was everywhere in the culture of the South Bay Area (50 miles from San Francisco for those of you who don't know CA geography well).  Remeber when 'Wet Kissing' was on the taboo list?  It amazes me how far we managed to come in understanding the problem and yet we still have so many clueless hatemongers who can't see past the sexuality of a large portion of those afflicted.  Yes their sexual practices helped the disease spread, and maybe that's a good reason for folks to chose not to live that lifestyle, but they are not the only ones who needed to change.  It's not sex that really is the killer here... it's ignorance.<br>
<br>
As to your point of chosing your drug... errr sex partner wisely, you and I know that but there's still a lot of heterosexual folks out there who seem to think their immune to HIV by being straight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udirrabey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dirra Bey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Chanter's Pet</span><br>  Posts: 659<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/19/02 11:10:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=858.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame guys and gals that play other races in EQ</span><hr size=1> Well, you can say it's synonymous (sic), and I suppose it's used that way, but it was a joke -- and I did get a group in Velks lab right away with that line lol.<br>

And there are PLENTY of people who are afraid of Democrats. You may not be, cuz you might be young, or sucking at the tit of government, or whatever, but believe me when I say there are prolly around 35% of the voting population who would vote for a yellow dog before they'd vote Democrat.

I've been playing D&amp;D and related games since 8th grade -- that's 25 years, yes the original white box and Chainmail -- and people who don't roleplay think that roleplayers are nuts -- so people who roleplay calling other roleplayers crazy is crazy. <br>
<br>

<br>
I was accused of &quot;being afraid&quot; of gays, and still having them as friends, and somehow this wasn't compatible.<br>
<br>
While I am not afraid of gays, if you assume that I am, I can still have them as friends, in the same way that I can be afraid of Democrats and their actions, and still be their friends.<br>
<br>
Why doesn't that work? I know most gay Americans are Democrats, so it works even better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
