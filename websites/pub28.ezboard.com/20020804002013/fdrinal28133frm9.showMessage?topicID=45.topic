You must find Malka Rale at +380, -210.  If she is not there, her placeholder is a courier.  This courier does not need to be killed.  It will despawn at 8 pm and then Malka will spawn at 10pm, game time.  Talk to her and say I will help.  She will get you Stanos' Pack.<br><br>Now travel to North Kaladim and find Founy Jestands at about +520, +307.  He is a Rogue guildmaster at the bank (or close to).  If he is not there wait until 10 am for him to respawn.  Then pickpocket from him stained parchment top.  He does not always have the piece so just wait another full day for him to despawn and then respawn again.  If you are caught and he attacks you just run to the zone.<br><br>Now you need to get the bottom of the stained parchment.  This is pickpocketed from Tani N'Mar in Neriak 3rd Gate at +650, -1300.  Like Founy, she does not always have the piece and spawns at 10 am.<br><br>Now go to Highpass Hold.  Go to the secret smugglers cave.  To get there, jump into the water close to the inn with the deck.  swim to +10, +325 and walk up the narrow passage.  Find Stanos in the camp.  If he is not there then you must make him spawn.  You can do this two ways:<br><br>Give Anson McBale Stanos' Pack.  Stand behind Anson so that you will not be standing on Stanos' spawn point.  This is the easiest way to do it. <br><br>If you have high faction with Anson then you can tell him &quot;I need to see Stanos.&quot;  If you are able to do this then you do not need to find Malka Rale in the Qeynos Aqueducts. <br><br>If Anson isn't in the camp, then you must kill his placeholder which is a smuggler.  Get a group of level 50+ and kill all the smugglers.  They are fairly high and backstab very hard.  This should cause Anson to spawn.  Once Stanos has spawned, give him the two pieces of parchment and he will give you the combined parchment.  <br><br>Travel to Lake Rathe and locate Eldreth at +2600, -550.  He is a random spawn.  He may be there, it may take a couple hours, or it may take a couple real life days.  Once you have found him.  Turn in the Combined Parchment, 100 platinum, and 2 unstacked bottles of milk.  He will reward you with a scribbled note.  You must have atleast indifferent faction when turning in the items.  If your faction is lower than that then use the sneak technique when turning in the items.<br><br>This next part is very tedious and somewhat difficult.  You have to go to Plane of Hate and find the Book of Souls.  This books spawn time is 10 hours and is located -60, +320.  This is on the night stand on the top floor of Maestro of Rancor's house.  There are wandering mobs.  You will want to do this with a bunch of friends because there are wandering mobs.  If the book spawns and no one picks it up, wandering creatures will.  To get people to come along and wait with you for 10 hours, try having a Maestro of Rancor raid or a Hate Raid.  This way there will be people around you for a long time and you won't get killed by wandering NPCs.<br><br>Next, go to Steamfont Mountains and find Yendar Starpyre.  He runs across the zone and is easily spotted because he is wearing an SMR.  To stop him from running say &quot;book&quot;.  Give him the Scribbled Parchment and he will despawn.  Wait for him to respawn again and then give him the Tattered Parchment and the Book of Souls.  He will despawn and in his place will be Renux, a level 50 human rogue.  She quad hits for 200 and can backstab for 200+.  She casts clockwork poison which is a spinning stun spell.  She does not attack pets.  She can be feared and snared.  Do not melee her if she is not feared.  The best way to kill her is pet kiting.  Have one melee class attack her as soon as she spawns.  Make sure he and everyone else have SoW and the cleric/shaman needed buffs such as hitpoints and AC.  Run around in circles.  Have all pets attack her.  Make sure they are equipped with weapons.  The best kind are magician summoned.  While the pets are attacking and the melee is kiting, have people casting fear on her.  If she gets feared send all melee in on her and have all casters nuke.  When fear breaks, all meleers except for the kiter must back away.  She will die very quickly this way with not very many casualties.  If the melee person dies, do not panic.  Just have more melee people ready to kite her.  To do this, you must have 3 or preferably more, necromancers that are 53+, 3 or preferably more, druids that are 57+, and lots and lots of pet casters.  Loot from her the Jagged Diamond Dagger and Translated Parchment.<br><br>Go back to Highpass Hold and find Stanos.  If he is not there use the method above.  Give Stanos the Translated Parchment for a sealed box.<br><br>Go to Kithicor, which is one zone off of Highpass.  Find the Dark Elf House at +800, +2400.  Give the box to any of the night spawns, causing General V'Ghera to spawn.  Take him to a safe spot in the zone, preferably a zone and kill him.  He is a very hard level 60 being.  He is equal or better than any god.  He quad attacks for 275 quite quickly, has a 1500pt harm touch and casts soul devour. He can also summon mobs from the zone to assist him.  He is weak to Wizard Lure Line, Poison Spells, Scent Line, and Fire Based Spells.  He is extremely strong against magic based spells so do not use it, it will just waist mana.  The following strategy was found at the Safehouse.  Here are what is recommended as groups:<br><br>Gather together at min 36 players (6 full groups - more if they are split up) or up to about 50 if needed (it is reccomended that you do NOT get more then 50 or the zone may crash or too many will go LD and you will loose because of this) <br><br>PULL TEAM: Quest Rogue with the &quot;sealed box&quot;, 56+ Shadow Knight OR Monk, and at least 2-3 56+ TANKS, and a 55+ Magi with CoH to summon the rogue after the hand off (total = 4-6 people) <br><br>TANK TEAM: 56+ Cleric, 56+ Enchanter, 56+ Shaman, and 3 high level TANKS <br><br>UNDEAD CONTROL DETAIL TEAM: All enchanters (as high lvl as possible) <br><br>NUKE TEAM (there may be more then 1 nuke team): As many LURE available Wizards as possible!, Magi and Necros w/pets <br><br>OTHERS: the best teams are composed of 4 tanks and 2 clerics to keep them alive, all the casters should be grouped into their own groups - no nukers with the tanks.<br><br>Get the highest level players as possible - if you haven't got at least 2 teams of 56+ chars it is NOT recommended you do this battle.<br><br>And here is how you kill him:<br><br>1) Set up forces at the crossroads - +800, +3200. <br><br>2) 3pm game time: Everyone Buffs Fully - Get all pets buffed. <br><br>3) 4pm: Pull Team and Tank Team move to the ridge west of the DE cabin at location +800, +2400. <br><br>4) Kill ALL Placeholderss in the cabin by 7pm (Except the Chaplain - if he aggros mesmerize and memory blur him) (note: this is done by only the pull and tank teams). <br><br>5) Kill ALL nearby undead by 8pm, Everything. <br><br>6) All pull team members get an invis to undead from the cleric (except for rogue) - may want to have spare invis to undead potions. <br><br>7) Tank Team moves back to crossroads. <br><br>8) 9pm: Chaplain will despawn - Begin speed buffing and DS buffs. <br><br>9) Feign Death Puller (whether it be the Shadowknight or Monk) moves into cabin (near where the chaplain despawns but not on his spawn point) and Feign Deaths - NO NPCs should be in the cabin at this time, if one spawns other then the Coercer, KILL IT. <br><br>10) Rogue moves to opposite side of cabin where the Feign Death puller will pull the coming Coercer to (this location needs to be far enough away from the cabin so that anyone walking into the cabin will not agro her but far enough away from all undead).<br><br>11) 11pm: The Coercer spawns, FD puller pulls to the waiting Rogue (who is hidden and sneaking).<br><br>12) Rogue gives box to the Coercer from behind while sneaking then rehides, General V'Ghera spawns a few seconds later (hand off needs to be fast so the Coercer does not return to the cabin) If the Rogue agros her just sit and die, DO NOT PULL TO GROUP, the cleric will get you later (make sure you get LOC) If the hand off is successful then have the Magi - who is still located at the base camp - Call of the Hero the Rogue back to camp and get ready for the incoming General. <br><br>13) Highest level tank on the pull team pulls the General to the waiting forces at the crossroads - make sure you do not get too far away from the General or he will go back to the cabin (if the first tank dies while pulling then the second highest tank on the pull team will take over and so on until the General is at the camp) NOTE: Call of Hero can be used to bring the Feign Death puller and Rogue back to camp safely - use this only when you have a magician in pull team that stays in camp during pull.<br><br>14) All forces at crossroads engage - EXCEPT the Enchanters... ALL (or at min 2) the Enchanters will have the sole responsibility of keeping the undead that arrive mesmerized (Mainly the healers) Since the General is level 63 his corpse will not rot for 30 minutes - the Rogue should loot first, make sure to get the &quot;General's Pouch&quot; and IF it drops the &quot;Cazic Quill.&quot; You will be very lucky if it drops the Cazic Quill.  If he doesn't then you must do the sub-quest.  All other loot from the General is NOT needed for the quest and SHOULD be given out to the helping forces - distribute however you see fit.<br><br>Go back to Stanos in Highpass Hold and turn in the Jagged Diamond Dagger, Cazic's Quill, and the General's Pouch for the Ragebringer.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uchaidduskwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chaid Duskwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 10:40:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ROGUE EPIC SPOILER!</span><hr size=1> This spoiler is crap.
