Usually it is form of the howler or scale of wolf. If I get into trouble and have neither up, tap jboots (yes, I am an evil druid who took the time to camp the AC so she could run mobs in Fear if needed) and off I go. I don't even answer people anymore if they ask for a buff and are either not standing right in front of me or I am busy doing something else. Once I was in loio waiting for Raladdar to pop his epic guys so we could fight them and got a tell asking for sow at the FM zone. I felt bad (my first mistake) and told the guy that I was waiting for the hardest mob in the zone to be pulled and if he wanted, he could run to the lake where we all were and I would sow him. I figured he would say forget it and look for sow somewhere else. No, instead he called me a greedy selfish bitch. Yeah, I suck because I was in a lowbie zone for the sole reason of helping my friend get his epic done.<br>
<br>
I remember being level 7 and running to Qeynos from Gfay. A ranger I had been grouping with wanted to go play in blackburrow and we were going to run there. Not once did we pester a druid for sow. Not once did we beg for a gg to wk.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, when I go to fp to look for items I want, I mem sow before I even get to town. I figure I will be standing there with nothing to do except read auctions and won't &quot;need&quot; my mana for anything more then sowing passers-by. I happily sow anyone who finds me to ask me. But I will not run all around nfp trying to find someone just to sow them. I also will not even respond to port requests unless I am getting ready to leave the zone. I am there for a reason, not as stand-by until some tank needs a ride somewhere.<br>
<br>
My favorite is when I am all the way down in Disco and some tank at the zone in ramp in Seb sends a tell asking for a port out. Do these people have problems? Seb isn't a zone most people can just wander around in looking for a group. If I am not at the zone in ramp with you, chances are I have a group and won't be leaving them. How long does it take to turn a 360 and see if any druids are near you?<br>
<br>
Now Boofy, I don't know the situation that prompted you to even start this thread. So please don't take this as a flame towards you. I'm just saying that a lot of times druids are not in a spot where they can just up and help anyone who asks. Personally I resent the fact that most people think that being a druid means you help everyone who asks for it. If that were the case, then I should be able to send a tell to any warrior I want and request they tank a mob so I don't get hurt. Because that is what a warrior does. If they didn't want to be my meat shield, they shouldn't have picked a warrior to play...<br>

I love when they get greedy.  Ie, /tell random druid_0231, can u gate me ill pay 40p.  Reply, sure.  10 seconds later,  Someone else wants to gate and is paying 50p, can you beat that? Meneldil tells you, fuck off.<br>

Or... who druid... druid_43728 level 52.  /tell druid can u gate me to sro, ill pay 50p.  reply, sorry druids don't have that spell. meneldil replys, wtf<br>
<br>
Or... /tell druid_4398  can you gate me ill pay 50p.  Druid replys no sorry.  Meneldil says np.  Druid replys for the next 5 mins, explaining exactly why they can't gate me.  I say great, I don't care, k thx bye!<br>
<br>
Or my favorite... /ooc Im in a hurry need a gate to DL asap,  paying 200p.  druid tells you, ill take you.  I meet him group up.  Im like ready.  Druid says, I got 3 more people coming, I don't like to gate without a full group.  I say wtf. cya<br>

Being a tank who still doesnt have jboots at lvl 57 I ask for sows all the time, I always say please and always make sure I have the druid/shaman/ranger in sight. It they dont respond or say no I say np take care friend. Your right Druids dont owe us anything. As a tank their is really nothing I can do for you but pay or just happen to be around when some mob you tried to kite is kickin your ass. I do always help when that happens btw.<br>

If you're that attached to SoW, go buy a stack of SoW potions from a shaman or get JBoots.  Or (*gasp*) try being polite to the folks who have the spell: Shamen, Druids, and Rangers.<br>

<br>
Personally, based on your responce to my post that was obviously not a flame, I think you demanded sow. And based on the fact that &quot;you have a 52 druid,&quot; you feel it somehow makes you better then all the other idiots who beg for sow every 10 seconds.<br>

I will second the best advice given to you in this thread:<br>
<br>
Go pound sand, assmunch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukalanapowa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalana Powa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/01 10:55:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Favor, not JOB...</span><hr size=1> Boofy,<br>
<br>
I am a ranger that will 99.9 stop and SoW someone if asked.  Sometimes I will even throw my full buff package on someone.  You know what makes me do that fast?  If someone is polite and ASKS for it, says please and thank you.  Please, and Thank You.  Not, SoW me beech.  <br>
<br>
Heck, I have even been known to head to youngling areas with backpacks full of banded and plat in hand to give quests to younglings.  Even then, the key is ask for the quest, and be polite.  Its not asking too much, and really, if you dont feel like being a polite human being, then do NOT be angry when you are told to go jack off.<br>
<br>
Now all that said, if I was being TOLD to do these things, I would more than likely NOT do it.  BTW, being in a group situation is a whole different world than asking someone on the side for some buffs.  I know my job in groups, and adore doing it.  From what I can see, you were not in a group situation, you were rude, crude and socially unacceptable.  Boofy, as far as I can tell, you got off easy.  <br>
<br>
Now, if I were you, I would close your mouth now, you are just making it worse for yourself.  Making a name for yourself is a great thing, but not this type of name.<br>
