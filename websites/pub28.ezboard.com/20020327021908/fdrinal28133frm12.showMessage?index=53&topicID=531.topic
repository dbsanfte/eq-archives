<br>
Just for arguments sake, let's say Ashram logs off pissed off and writes a message on our member board about him being harassed by Adaster.  More than likely, Adaster would have been talked to and it would have stopped, maybe even an apology would have followed.  Adaster speaks his mind very freely and I'm sure has /r STFU hotkeyed.  When people take him very seriously however, he tends to back off.<br>
<br>
This action would have shown that you were really looking for a solution to the problem.<br>
<br>
However, /guildremoving in anger and then writing a bash on the member board is something exactly like what was described with the coach analogy.  Getting pissy and removing is the quick way out, as if it will be a punishment to us for not having you, or as if it will cause a lemming rush out of the guild.<br>
<br>
I personally believe this was a poor execution of a rant.  It has been said that if you leave the guild in anger, your posting rights will be removed, so what did you expect?<br>
<br>
As for how I feel about you leaving, it's sad to see anyone cause such a stirring of the bullshit, especially when it's underlying intent could be argued as being to intentionally harm the guild, by putting assumptions in possible members heads and planting the seed of discontent among members.<br>
<br>
As a person, I never had any problems with you except you seemed to be more of an individual than a team member.<br>
<br>
Jarak and Kilamyan- both of you guys were great players and never had any problems with either of you to really speak of.  As far as I'm concerned, you are both missed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uklariaminimagi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klaria Minimagi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#33cc33>Drinalite</font></span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 1:34:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /sigh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Adaster has spoken, now STFU<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
First things  First.. Aanilye.. tell them why you don't like me..  and tell the truth.. We had planned to marry our characters when we were in Lost souls of Drinal. However because i didn't have the time to be on and because i was moving to Inferni Millites.. i told you and i do beleive it was KINDLY that we should call it off because i won't be around LSoD as much as would have hoped.  So yes you are bitter... and i am sorry if that hurt you.. but the circumstances sucked and the situation didn't work out.. If you still harbor feelings for me then i suggest dropping them cause i am involved ^_~ i know this may be hard for you but please.. try to forget the bad.. and cherish the good... teehee &gt;_&lt;<br>
<br>
ahem.. Nidabu.. you've always been a kind person and when i heard how completely in trouble you were anyone with a heart would help you. My experience with CiH hasn't been golden but i do have a new found respect for the skill they show in how they run their ship. And with people like you in the guild they can't be too bad.. not too bad at all. So i thank you for mentioning that in my support.<br>
<br>
Now... In regards to taking Adaster Seriously... On 2 pervious occasions i Emailed Kaldrani himself asking him to settle the situation with Adaster... NOT ONCE DID I GET A RESPONCE. which shows how much he fookin cared. On more than a number of ocasions i have told Adaster please stop givin me a hard time i don't need this nor do i deserve this... it never stopped so Jareck i beleive you are incorrect in your assumption of Adaster.<br>
<br>
IT never stopped so my guild removing that day was not just one time it was MANY times and one LASt time..<br>
<br>
This cloak of piety.. what do i need with it exactly? <br>
<br>
and no adaster you weren't even ON the first day i was in CS... AND NEVER did i ask that the entire frigin guild go out of their way to get my epic.. i asked on a non raiding day if anyone who had nothing to do want to come to the hole with me... That is not demanding everyone do my epic, that is asking for support for something that could potentially be fun and exp for a group. <br>
<br>
You wonder why my posts are so long that is becasue my statements come  with proof to support them. NO ONE who has attacked me yet has supported their insane accusations with proo just vague inferences and assumptions on what i might have been thinking at a certain time.. UNLESS YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WAS THINKING YOU DON'T KNOW. so please.. unless you have a screenshot of my thoughts SHUSHHHHHHHH.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uantaran77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>antaran77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/02 10:41:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: info</span><hr size=1> Ashrahm, your telling other people to forget the bad and cherish the good and yet you are the person who started this flame.<br>

-he is ruthless, steals and talks trash from rl friends / online friends (wheres my lodizal shield again? it got up and gated away on its own eh? cool thanks phil)<br>
-he sold ashrahm at lvl 54 with pof gear and STOLE him back at lvl 59.9 with all his good gear (minus maul, which he just zoned into tov to loot it his first day owning ashrahm again)<br>
-his excuse for wanted to get his epic even though he already has 23/23 maul, 'Im more of a swords man and im the best sk so i should get it'<br>
-he drives his RL best friend into quiting eq (seen hooshier/silenka around? nope)<br>
-he doesn't realise im gonna beat his ass so hardcore next time he's back in town.<br>

just keep that in mind when the words and stories from ashrahm's mouth seem to be a longshot, long winded, twisted and defensive.<br>

cya later phil, give me a call next time your back in town.<br>

<br>
You and Joe both left to play Dark Ages of Camelot... Joe told me WEEKS before he left he was gonna do it.. this being your influence since you already left...<br>
<br>
I never took yer damn shield... i even let joe search my account.. and he admittted to finding nothing... why you can't accept that is beyond me...<br>
<br>
Maybe if you weren't so doped out of yer brain on K tranqs Ecstacy cocaine and whatever the hell else yer into now you wouln't be so paranoid...<br>
<br>
Yer are not one to talk about loyalty... you make up this crap because your bitter about somethign i had nothing to do with. But because you see this open chance to attack me you take it.  I was yer best friend when you needed money to buy drugs a the club... yer a liar... and a hypocrit.<br>
<br>
let's not even go into what would happen in a fight.. you don't frighten me... you idle threats don't frighten me and to be honest you don't have the balls ( due to the fact they have been shriveled up from drug usage)<br>
<br>
your little attack on my account situation was cute... but let's face facts.... you were never even Ananael to begin with.. you bought that account.. along with wilrowe...hell reinas probably wasn't yours either... <br>
<br>
you bringing my past relatinships into this was underhanded and flat out cruel... but if you want to play that game fine.... excuse me for not having a girlfriend who dosn't snort cocaine and run to florida with other guys to @#%$ them while you know about it... oh i'm sorry didn't mean to bring up your whore Ex.... how is she by the way? in re-hab yet?<br>
<br>
why don't you go back to DAoC and mind your own business.. we haven't spoken in over a year and now you try to post as if you have known me your whole life? yer a liar and a thief and a drug head and you need professional help....<br>
<br>
Do not post again.. you know nothing about me.. you never did... Very few people bother to because they listen to asses like you... those that know me personaly and that are my friends know i am not a bad person.. i am not a loot whore... <br>
<br>
This goes for everyone.... Patrick (Ananael, Reinas, Wilrowe, Waylinn) doesn't know me... he never did apparently... we were aquaintences through mutual friends... The most he knew about me was my name...<br>
<br>
His entire post is a ridiculous lie in a vain attempt to get revenge for something i didn't even do. <br>
<br>
By the way Pat.... yer lodi shield yer missing? I spoke to joe about it.. and guess what.. oh wait you might not have talked to him see he and i both are in a real college not some po dunk school for retards in south D.C. you see... i told him since he was getting an extra 200 bucks from this guy on Hooshier now... for that shield which is missing.. you should ask the Original owner of hooshier about that... that i would scrap some stuff and buy him one simply because you guys appear to be screwed... For all i know you STILL HAVE the shield are simply trying to make me pay for it so you don't have to give it up...<br>
<br>
either way i bought a lodi shield... with the money i was saving for a CoCW.....  the new hooshier can have it when his check comes through.. <br>
<br>
Joe begged me to do this in PERSON 2 weeks ago.. and i have been busting my ass to get one because i still consider joe my friend.... But it's apparent all you care about is your drugs and your ridiculous DAoC.<br>
<br>
Don't ever cross my path again Patrick... never again... i consider our ties cut.... and if Joe is in on this and i find out.....  it will not be pretty...<br>
<br>
This is Separate and goes for everyone Readin this...<br>
<br>
You think i'm loot whore... you think i am a prick.... You don't know me.. never have you taken the time to know me... You go by word of mouth or what some person who feels they need to hurt me  has babbled in a hallucinated state. <br>
<br>
I rememebr someone before accused me of being an individual and not a team player.... There is a difference between a team player.. and a pawn... <br>
<br>
What happens to me in the future i don't care... <br>
<br>
Just please... think for yourselves... if you hear someone is a @#%$.. why don't you find out for yourself.. talk to them... group with them... <br>
<br>
BE a team player but don't be a pawn... Think for yourself.. and become better and just enjoy this game.. i have tried to.. <br>
<br>
My entire reasoning for this post has been lost in the confusion and the flinging of insults...  just stop..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry.... I openly admit and agree i was harsh and out of line with the attack on ALL of Clan.. my words were not chosen well.. It was an attack on the way Clan was run... you cannot for any reason punish someone for having a mind of their own... This leads to intolerance and pain... And right now there is nothing anyone could flame to make me hurt more than what i read from a person i once considered a friend...<br>
<br>
I will continue to play.. to adventure with friends and make this game an experience for myself and those around me to enjoy...<br>
<br>
Group with me sometime.. actually send me a tell that doesn't involve the words loot or whore..... get to know me and i am positive you will see that these accusations are unfounded and incorrect.. <br>
<br>
Jarak... know this.. i do remember those time... And to you i apologize.. i am not that same person.. i was younger in high school.. full of rage and full of contempt and to eb honest i was not the best person to be around.<br>
<br>
In the last 2 years i have become someone else... MY days in college and with people close to me have made me find that the person i was.. even I HATED... i am not that boy anymore... And i ask you not to judge me on things that happened so long ago... Give me a tell sometime i would actually like to talk to you..<br>
<br>
I am sorry to everyone that i have caused disruption in their lives. This was not the best way to go about things.It just angered me that my reason for leaving clan was completely fabircated and being spread..<br>
<br>
i left Clan Skallagrim because i  feel that Certain individuals in the roles of leadership and  a few individuals who were close to the leadership, were both disrespectful and uncaring.<br>
<br>
I /guildremoved myself on that day because of the harsh things Adaster said to me then and in the past... none of any of this has anything to do with loot, the lance, or my epic. It never did.<br>
<br>

Kald, tell Maar the slacker to deliver your CD, gave it to him like 3 weeks ago to give to you at work, tho that Beer comment sure qualifies for a trip to your place, just dont lie sleeping on the couch for 4 hours this time hehe<br>

<br>
If this is the original Ashrahm I used to get along with him before he quit.  Considered him a friend.<br>
<br>
Never had a problem with CS either.  <br>
<br>
So I guess that puts me neutral...this is a damn funny flame thread though.<br>

<br>
I got to know you as a friend in GOTK. After you left I heard you took the account back because you got lvl 60.. .<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if this is even the Ashrahm I know from GOTK like you said it was. All I know it's alot of banter and useless flaming here. Clan Skallagrim is a great guild. If you have problems with a few no reason to bash the guild that took you in and you consider friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
I spoke to you after you left and sorry you left.  However it's very dissapointing to see you post something like this. <br>
<br>
I Do not think you are the same Ashrahm I grew to know in GOTK.<br>
