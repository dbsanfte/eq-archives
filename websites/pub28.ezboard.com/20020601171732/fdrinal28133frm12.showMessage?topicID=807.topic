I realize posting here won't really solve anything, but it will start a chain of snide comments I'd have rather avoided.  However, now that it has been started let me just offer what happened from the most objective viewpoint I can afford.  You won't see a whole lot of comments from CT members here because we discouraged it, but I can assure you that everyone would if they could.<br><br>NTOV began to pop on Friday night and some mobs are still popping as we speak. On friday night, all that was up was Iktiar, so we killed him.  On saturday night, all that was up was Aaryonar, the gatekeeper of ntov.  On Saturday night we killed aaryonar and camped a coh in ntov for today (Sunday).  Here I point out that on all servers that I know of, and, I thought, on our own, killing Aaryonar effectively lays claim to the rest of ntov.<br><br>Sunday morning we filed into ntov.  We were already in the pit behind Aaryonar (jumped off the ledge from where Eashen spawns), so we figured we would clear the mobs up down below and coh back to kill Eashen.  This would be the most effective series to clear what was up.<br><br>We proceeded to kill Zlexak, Sevalak, and Dagarn and then we set up coh to go kill Eashen.  Here I point out that at any time between those mobs, we could have easily coh'd back to eashan and knocked him out.  We did not do this because we did not assume for a second that any guild would have the audacity to enter ntov during that time and snipe eashan.<br><br>However, it appears we were wrong.  We began to coh, killing hatchlings and coh spot and finished coh.  Here we found TK also coh'ing into ntov.  We continued coh'ing, amounting a sizable force first.  We had close to 60 compared with 31 from TK.  At this point Bruuss and Hador attempted to discuss what would happen, as both parties supposedly sought to avoid a true confrontation.  Bruuss and Hador reached an impasse and I began talking with Hador.<br><br>I attempted to explain to Hador that we had the claim to Eashen because:<br><br>A) common courtesy would dictate that if a guild killed Aaryonar they should have the right to kill all other ntov mobs without fear of being sniped.  While Hador argued that Eashan does not count as a ntov mob because it is in front of Aaryonar, I reminded him that it was his choice to argue a technicality but that either way it would be disgustingly rude to try to poach a larger force already in ntov.  <br><br>B) even if one conceded that killing aaryonar did not grant instant claim to eashan, the fact alone that ntov is regarded by most honorable people as a &quot;camp&quot; in the broad sense in a term should be enough to give us claim.  Let me show you a similar example.  A group is camping dead tower in lower guk.  Another group is camping ghoul lord.  2 Named spawn in DT.  The group in DT moves past the first named in DT to kill the second because it is easier that way and then heads back to kill the first only to find that the ghoul lord group has killed it because &quot;it was up and you weren't killing it.&quot;<br><br>C)  Unlike what hador argued, we had not &quot;passed eashen up.&quot;  Eashan actually has better drops than most ntov dragons.  We simply took the most effective route towards killing him, assuming that guilds would honor our presence in ntov and not attempt to poach it from under our nose.  We would have killed him friday or saturday had he been up.<br><br>D) Even discounting all these things, we pulled the hatchlings guarding Eashan and we amounted (by cohing from another point IN NTOV) a sizable force first.<br><br>Despite these sound arguments, Hador informed me that they had the right to kill him because we &quot;passed him up&quot; and he &quot;was up.&quot;  While one could possibly argue this by discounting common courtesies and being disgustingly rude, I nor the other CT officers could not stomach that as a sufficient reason for forcing a /random for a mob we had worked hard to be able to kill and that we had all the intentions in the world to kill.<br><br>Needless to say, the discussion reached an impasse.  Due to members feeling extremely adamant for all the reasons I mentioned, many agitated for us to go ahead and pull the mob and kill it anyway, since we obviously had claim, a much larger force, and all the ability in the world to pull him right away and kick his ass.  I told them however to wait and let me finish discussing things with Hador.<br><br>After giving up hope of winning by simple debate, Hador told me he wished things could be &quot;resolved civilly&quot; in this game.  I regret to say that I do not consider being screwed over a necessary requirement to &quot;being civil.&quot;<br><br>At this point silence prevailed for 1 minute or so, and then TK decided to totally ignore us and pull Eashan in front of us while 60 people watched on.  <br><br>According to Verant and play nice policies, the first person who pulls a mob has the right to kill it, so I'm not going to sit here and tell you that TK needs to be petitioned or warned by GMs for their actions.<br><br>I can say however, that I am totally disgusted by their reaction, attitudes, and choice of path to resolve the conflict. I've always been one to try to forgive and forget.  But after being screwed over by TK on Myga twice months earlier and now this, I have all lost respect.  I find it laughable that Hador could whine about people not being civil (which basically consisted of giving them the mob for no reason), and yet take a course of action that is anything but civil.<br><br>I can tell you for sure however that similar encounters in the future will not entail any attempt at diplomacy from CT.  TK chose to play hardball with a much larger force who showed clemency, and this is the result.  We'll move on and kill Eashan next week, but as they say, karma is a bitch, and I can promise no kindness will be found from us towards TK in the near future.  <br><br>I'd like to point out that we don't think everyone in TK is bad person or that Hador is necessarily a bad person.  But that doesn't change the fact that a horrible decision was made today on TK's part that certainly reflects badly on them in my own opinion.<br><br>I'd also ask that people who aren't aware of how ntov works or who have never ventured into the wing refrain from jumping to conclusions.  Killing one mob in ntov and going back to another cannot be compared to say, going to kill Yelinak and getting mad when another guild gets to Tormax the same time you do.  Ntov is regarded by courteous people as a camp of it's own (on all servers), and to poach Eashan (especially with bush league tactics like pulling right in front of us with a smaller claim, if any claim at all) from ntov in front of our faces seems to me like very bad form.<br><br>-Azureblade Avalanche<br>Crimson Twilight Officer<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udomoguul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Domoguul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Du Hast?</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 6:26:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://planetquake.gcpro.de/news/icons//standard_w.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clear Things Up</span><hr size=1> NOTE: there is nowhere a RULE that when ya kill aary ya get whole NTOV...this rule was maked between few guilds but not all...<br>only coz CiH, WL, CT etc follow this rule TK dont have to follow it.<br><br>well i self follow this rule too and its bad what happen to ya ´<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br>DoMo <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.iol.it/okandrea/moe.gif"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ussarloktnayn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ssarlok Tnayn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 6:26:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clear Things Up</span><hr size=1> This thread looks promising for entertainment purposes,too bad  CT cant comment here.<br> P.S. got to love our flame boards...<br><br> Holcroft <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 7:52:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clear Things Up</span><hr size=1> The point of the thread wasn't to entertain you ) just to explain the topic which was posted here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/udensitydown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DensityDown</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/26/02 10:26:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Clear Things Up</span><hr size=1> . <p><img src="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload\density\density3.gif"boarder="0"></a><Br><ahref="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217300">Density Seol`Revar</a><Br> 60 Healer<Br>Crimson Twilight</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwarrikthewarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warrik The Warlord</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.truepath.com/imagenetic/usflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 12:12:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> It is usually regarded by most guilds that if a guild kills Aary they have &quot;rights&quot; to ntov.

Only facts.  For pointing out what so far some of the posters have missed.  In addition to the &quot;aary rule&quot; (which we can completely disregard for the sake of argument), we also had #s in ToV prior to TK even showed up.  We had been there for longer than 3 hours gathering to finish clearing ToV dragons before the first TK flagged character even showed up in the zone.<br><br>At the time when our CoHers got to the CoH spot, TK had one person there.  At the time when 30 was CoHed, TK had 6 there.  At the time when all of us were CoHed (57 or so), TK had less than 30 (believe 27 was the exact number).  As the discussion carried on, CT/WL combined for 61 while TK had 31.<br><br>I am not saying that we had the right to it because we had more.

But even if one were to discard that courtesy, the fact remains that we were IN  ntov for hours before TK even entered the zone.  Even if you argued a technicality to say that killing roy doesn't lay claim to eashan, you can't argue that eashan is not an ntov mob, and we were in the camp first and had been &quot;camping&quot; it for 5x longer than TK was even in the zone.<br><br>I'd like to point out that the CT members who posted here before me weren't reprimanded for their posts or anything of the sort.  They personally offered to edit their own posts to keep the flames in control.  I'd also like to apologize for going off on Hador there near the end, but I think anyone would be about ready to break their monitor when they see a guild with no claim to a mob just pull right in front of their faces anyway.<br>There are a lot of nice people in TK, and maybe this happened just because Hador and TK were completely ignorant of the way ntov works, but there is no excuse for the type of actions persued yesterday.<br><br>It boils down to a matter of respect and honor and TK proved disgustingly lacking.  Not only did they attempt to lay claim to a mob with a smaller force acquired slower, but they attempted to lay claim to a mob in ntov when a guild was *in* the wing itself, had been for days, had killed aary, had killed the new pops in a logical order before returning to coh back to eashan.  Next time we'll learn for our mistakes and take the inconvenience of coh'ing back to eashan first because I guess honor and respect can't be counted on.  However, the most blatant disrespect and lack of honor came in just going ahead and pulling in front of us.  Hador informed me &quot;I'm sorry but we've just been screwed over too many different times in the past.&quot;  Well I'd like to see him rationalize his own behavior.  Just as it is disgustingly rude to come in and cherry pick myga after another guild cleared to pop him,  poaching eashan from the guild in ntov about to kill him by pulling in front of their faces is an unhonorable as it gets.<br><br>-Azureblade Avalanche<br>Crimson Twilight Officer<br><br>Edited to add that if it were up to me this wouldn't have even been brought here in the first place. We'll move on and finish what repops pop and go after Eashan next week.  We've just lost a lot of respect, if not all respect, for TK in the process. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uazurect.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azure CT</A> at: 5/27/02 6:10:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.fast.net/~mikem/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><HR><font color=#660066><CENTER>Drinal Ally<BR>******</CENTER></font><HR></span><br>  Posts: 865<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 6:21:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Something that was kinda missed.</span><hr size=1> why didn't you zerg eashen with your force of 60 lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ?<br> <p><a href="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/ppgquiz.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://valvigirl.net/quizzes/bubbles.gif" border=0 alt="Which PPG are you?"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/urahan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rahan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Human Paladin God</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 7:02:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/kc/data/rahan_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Something that was kinda missed.</span><hr size=1> TK moved between us and eashan, we was not able to pull it, and there is 4 guard in the room, not able to rush down. <p><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/colsen/rahan.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9035">Rahan Trueknight</a> ~ 60th Paladin<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49205">Mentor</a> ~ 54th Enchanter<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uvernander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vernander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S&M Barbie</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 9:26:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Something that was kinda missed.</span><hr size=1> Maybe im wrong but havnt guilds on drinal been leap frogging each other for a long time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usobgyer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sob gyer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Saber</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 9:36:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Something that was kinda missed.</span><hr size=1> This is all just a massive conspiracy by Verant to make ppl join Legends, where they will now reserve spawns for ya for $40 a month.<br>P<br>Vengyr Soulstorm 58 sk<br>Gyer Ogunstorm 54 druid<br>NINE CLOUDS <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uwarrikthewarlord.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warrik The Warlord</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.truepath.com/imagenetic/usflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font> Pig<font color=#FF0000>?</font></span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/27/02 10:48:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=807.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> I play on Legends.
