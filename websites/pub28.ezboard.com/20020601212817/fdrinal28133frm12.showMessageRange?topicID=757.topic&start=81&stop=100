What I am saying is that you can’t expect people not to judge you by your actions, in this case flaming women.  You only get one chance to make a first impression Nolan and you blew it.  People’s opinions can change, but you have yet to give us any reason to do so.<br>
<br>
And if your intent with this post truly was to role-play, then why wasn’t it posted in the role-playing forum?  Seems to me your underlying purpose was to get a reaction out of people.  And not that you got what you wanted you are trying to backpedal your way out of it.<br>

Before my little commentary, here's some of my favorite quotes from this whole thing:<br>
<br>
&quot;From women, then to women's sexual harassment and then to child's molestation? Do you guys realize that those are very serious charges? That just because you made those charges, I can slap you both with slander and it will be an easy victory for me because of the criminal activity you accuse me of? Especially in front of everyone here. &quot;<br>
<br>
Heil, Zandalay v2.0<br>
<br>
&quot;So, men grab your whips and show the sluts who's the beastmaster. &quot;<br>
<br>
It's like the Man Show gone wrong<br>
<br>
&quot;cause we have figured out what u girls need a long fuking time ago. A whip and a phat dick. So u girls stfu and stop bitching and get down and lick ur masters...Yeaaaaa!!! I love being in charge. &quot;<br>
<br>
Someone watches a bit too much porno.  Hey you can grow up to be a plumber and walk into a woman's house and fuck her just like in a porno...and spend the rest of your life in jail.  Hookers wouldn't even fuck you with the attitude you have towards women.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm more of a man than you can possibly dream of, then again not many are privileged to get to know me, only as far as I let them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Credit card maxed out from 1-900-FAT-CHIX 8(<br>
<br>
&quot;I put tests for them and so far everyone failed.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can't test love<br>
<br>
&quot;Adaster, <br>
Anyone asked your opinion? stfu and go there yourself. Do I know you? addressed you? So fuking leave me alone.&quot;  goes with &quot;Guys, feel free to rant about women/girls here and put your favorite quotes that slam those lying, double-face byyttchhess :-) &quot;<br>
<br>
Way to contradict yourself dickless.<br>
<br>
Every legendary flamer we've had here has seemed to contradict him/herself at one point or another.  This guy is well on his way to being a legend.  The thing that gets me tho is he started a flame about his real life, then tells people not to bring his real life into it.  He brought up a very sensitive topic and said some harsh things that make him seem less like a flamer and more like a stalker.<br>
<br>
Star, you have to be the ugliest motherfucker I've ever seen. Those huge glasses, that hair that looks like it's about to eat your face. I've never seen a forward comb over, but you sure pulled it off!  A shower goes a long way now and then.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of things I want to say to point out how exactly wrong you are about what women want, but I'm going to restrain myself.  Later in life, when you're 40+ living alone, wishing you had a soulmate, you'll understand just how wrong you are.  You're going to grow up to be that 40 year old guy that sits in bars trying to pick up college chicks with promises of your &quot;l33t 87 honda civic&quot; and &quot;phat dick&quot; with a big gold necklace around his neck and brass knuckles that spell out &quot;STAR...PWNZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
You claim to be roleplaying in this thread...but roleplaying is fueled by what a person feels inside. Your contempt for women as a sex is apparent...you expect them just to be dogs that obey your every command rather than human beings. Keep telling yourself that these aren't your real feelings because it's pretty obvious to every reader here that they are. Keep telling yourself that you know everything...then try to reassure yourself of that when you're 50, sitting at home alone watching porno, wishing you had a soulmate. <br>
<br>
You type like a 10 year old, you act like a 10 year old.  You assume you know everything about women cause you can pay a transvestite to sleep with you, but in reality you know nothing.  As far as I can tell you got all your knowledge about women from pornos, the man show, and howard stern.  Welcome to real life brother, plumbers don't get laid for fixing a chick's pipes. Fixing an air conditioner will get you paid...and that's about it. Women deserve to be cherished, to be understood, and to be respected. You do none of these things, but expect to be successful with women. How you justify this to yourself is beyond me...<br>
<br>
You sir are the shit of America.  You are what disgraces this fine country into being the social asshole of the world.  You are a pathetic excuse for a man that will live out his life lonely and afraid, only to die a pathetic death and be buried in a commoners grave. Will anybody show up to your funeral? I think not... <br>
<br>
Here's something to remember, man to man: Go fuck yourself for giving men a bad name.<br>

But, luckily there's help for people like you. In the yellow pages, look under &quot;Euthanasia&quot;. Barring that, plug a toaster or hair dryer into an outlet close to the bath tub, fill up the tub with warm water, put in your favorite bubble bath. Now, get in and bring that plugged in appliance into the tub with you.<br>
<br>
And maybe, just like Mel Gibson in &quot;What women want&quot;, you too will be able to read women's minds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;You start this flame because you can't get RL pics of women over the internet for you to get your rocks off to...poor guy&quot; <br>
<br>
Who said I can't? Umm tell me that you've never masturbated in your entire life and i'll laugh. Poor guy? Don't need your parental approval that's for sure. <br>
<br>
&quot;So, men grab your whips and show the sluts who's the beastmaster&quot; <br>
<br>
Some like it rough. Tell me that you think that entire alternative lifestyle population should become branded as sexual molestors and harrassers. They would laugh in your face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Someone watches a bit too much porno. Hey you can grow up to be a plumber and walk into a woman's house and fuck her just like in a porno...and spend the rest of your life in jail. Hookers wouldn't even fuck you with the attitude you have towards women&quot;<br>
<br>
Well well well, you're obviously more of an expert on this topic than me, pray, what else did those hookers told you?<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't test love&quot;<br>
<br>
Hello? what century we live in? 17th? 18th? If you don't test your love, your mate is sure gonna test herself. <br>
<br>
&quot;The thing that gets me tho is he started a flame about his real life, then tells people not to bring his real life into it&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly did I say about me real life? Unless i'm mistaken someone else did that favor for me first by posting my private conversation and then my pic, both without my consent. I sure didn't do that myself. I don't mind though because i have nothing to hide. <br>
<br>
&quot;Star, you have to be the ugliest motherfucker I've ever seen. Those huge glasses, that hair that looks like it's about to eat your face. I've never seen a forward comb over, but you sure pulled it off! A shower goes a long way now and then.&quot;<br>
<br>
You obviously judge by your own standards. Remember to each his own preferences. Some girls like people like that. If you spend a week with no access to water. I wanna see how you look like bud.<br>
<br>
&quot; Later in life, when you're 40+ living alone, wishing you had a soulmate, you'll understand just how wrong you are. You're going to grow up to be that 40 year old guy that sits in bars trying to pick up college chicks with promises of your &quot;l33t 87 honda civic&quot; and &quot;phat dick&quot; with a big gold necklace around his neck and brass knuckles that spell out &quot;STAR...PWNZ.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, how do you know it's not gonna work and didn't work already. Wake up buddy. You too don't know women all that well. <br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
You sir are the shit of America. You are what disgraces this fine country into being the social asshole of the world. You are a pathetic excuse for a man that will live out his life lonely and afraid, only to die a pathetic death and be buried in a commoners grave. Will anybody show up to your funeral? I think not...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sir, thank you for the compliment. I knew i'm a *hot shit*<br>
and about the rest of it, you really must know this all from first perspective no? Well, I sure am not going to end up like you, Sir. <br>
<br>
&quot;Predicted death date: August 9th, 2005, stabbed to death by a hooker after asking her to &quot;sux0r my ph4t dick lamo &quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, i'm going to die sometime in the Fall of 2010, watching the sunset on top of the Himalayas, enjoying the last moments with my significant other.<br>
Conclusion. You didnt add anything significantly new that wasn't said by other folks. Might have saved yourself time and played EQ.  <br>

<br>
You cant make me nor anyone else who is reading this (anyone in their right mind anyway) think that what you said in your original posts is morally right (the ones whom sparked controversy). Speaking for myself, when you originally apologized, aside from the fact that you called me -a person you've never met nor will meet- a bitch and that i should &quot;know my place&quot; and call you master..anyway after you apologized i was willing to put it all behind me and just forget about the atrocities i had read. And now i see just how Naive i really am. The more you try and justify what you said about women, about me, the more evident it is how you really are.<br>
<br>
If you really want to say youre sorry, then just drop it, and let it die. If you crave the attention you're getting, then by all means, knock yourself out.<br>

Of course you called me something too, don't remember now hehe. I'm just following the old adage. Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth. If everyone is willing to drop this and accept my apologies yeah. If someone keeps flaming me, then they cross the line themselves and i'm quite right to flame them back. Ok? Suli, u're prolly the most fair judge here, so I respect ya. As to being a five year old, hell sometimes i wish i was back a child, and i still act like yes five year old :-) Don't see anything wrong with that hehe, apart from certain BS i say.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=757.topic&start=121&stop=130>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=757.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=757.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=757.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=757.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=757.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=757.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm25">Deleted / Closed posts / Bannings<option value="drinal28133frm27">Old Topics of the Day<option value="drinal28133frm31">Title Requests<option value="drinal28133frm35">Cleric Ragefire List</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
