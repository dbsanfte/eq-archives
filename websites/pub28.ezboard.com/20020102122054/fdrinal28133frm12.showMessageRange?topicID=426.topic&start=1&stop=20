to post  about me selling it..everyone will see it then return the lance and have them post that i returned it!!!<br>
i do not like being marked as a thief .... It was said it was a free for all .... and i do stand behind my word..<br>
I told trevise and Vladamir i was returning it and i will but wanted to post about this topic..<br>
<br>
after the lance is returned i hops they put a post saying it was... all i want is my name cleared..<br>
this is honestly the only way i thought possible to clear my name... to make all aware of topic then aware<br>
that the  lance was returned when i see vlladamir my monk carries it on him for when i do see him but<br>
like i said before want to clear name is all everyone... alot know me and not as a thief until this situation<br>
I HOPE THIS WILL CLEAR UP  FOR THE MOST PART...yes it is easy to change servers or start over on new<br>
characters but no i want what is right to happen!!!<br>
<br>
Vlladamir i told you i will give the lance to you and it is urs...i stand behind my word!!<br>
for those who dont believe me you will see<br>
<br>
i have been offered alot by alot of people and  some that have posted bad about me that's what makes<br>
me laugh....i tell them no not right now  now post bad against me think its funny<br>
<br>
as far as AA they have been getting heat about this topic and want to clear all up please dont knock AA<br>
for somethiung that is in the process of being handled...<br>
<br>
<br>
TREVISE I SENT YOU TELLS TELLIN YOU WHAT I WAS GONNA DO AND I STILL STAND BEHIND WHAT I TOLD YOU BUT LIKE I ALSO TOLD YOU I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO CLEAR MY NAME FIRST!! <br>

<br>
Attention Potential Buyers<br>
<br>
While I do not know the FULL specefics of the events that have happened, as I was not there, I have heard from many sources (and now numerous post below, and not one coming to your defense) that that item was Ninja looted at the end of the 10th ring quest<br>
<br>
Currently there are 4 lances that I Know of, One owned by Draccir, One owned by Thangorim (may have name misspelled) and one owned by Dendil/Ralf, and this one that was  rewarded/rolled to Vlladamir in the 10th ring battle in question, for partipation in the battle. So if anonther person suddenly springs up wielding the lance it wont be *hard* to guess where they got it.<br>
<br>
Srail dont be a fool give back the lance while you have ANY chance of not completly f**king your reputation, (and  unforuntatly by association your guild, who are a great bunch of people)  Don't hide behind a quote taken out of context, and what a GM *may* have said, its common sense that a item of Narandis lance caliber is not to be included with &quot;loot all corpse&quot; order, and I hope for your sake that you possess that sense<br>
<br>
DONT BUY THIS ITEM <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umadronedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MadroneDorf</A> at: 12/3/01 10:45:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#006699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/us22wizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S22WIZARD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF66>(12/3/01 8:07:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: selling or trading narandis lance</span><hr size=1> For the person/persons who so call it ninja looting..... yes it was recieved off the 10th ring quest <br>
and was ooc'd by the person doing the quest...exact wording  &quot; All i want is to finish the ring quest all the rest is free for all &quot;  EXACT WORDING  and was told by others that was said to get as many as they could to help.<br>
And for further info i was reported to gm and GM came out and read all log's and said that was said and i was NOT wrong for lootinging it !!!!!!<br>
<br>
wanna call it ninja looting then go for it but was said to loot all the corpses in ooc also<br>
 and for  as far as creating a monk please know all facts before writing.. i already have<br>
A monk he was the one that looted it lol..wanna create a monk thats cute..<br>
<br>
think what you want but the lance is for sale and Gm said they are not getting involved cause it was said by the person handing in the quest without him quest never happen so his word stands!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ubaelarempyrean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baelar Empyrean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF66>(12/3/01 8:11:45 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: selling or trading narandis lance</span><hr size=1> I was there, I was a participant, and the lance was ninja looted.

<br>
<br>
CIH as a guild only does 1 event where we award items/treasure  to non cih people and that is &quot; 10th ring War &quot; <br>
in the past all has gone great and officers award people they feel deserve or need  the item <br>
<br>
this past 10th ring war  Vlladdmry  &quot; sp&quot;  was awarded the lance by cih officers <br>
<br>
i think we had 40+ people working togther fighting off the giants all having a good time. <br>
<br>
Well once  the final BIg boss nrandia the giant dropped all was great in zone because tedule got his &quot; ring of dain &quot;  and we where getting ready to award items to those who helped  <br>
BUT !!!!<br>
(Srail the monk of Arcane asylum )<br>
took the lance off the giants corpse and then logged <br>
many people &quot; tried&quot; to talk to him the next few days asking him please give back the lance you &quot; did not win it &quot;  but you looted it off corpse. <br>
<br>
Almost 99% of every one who plays Everquest 40+ level wise knows that when you raid big raids with 30 + people  loot dropped is done  3 ways <br>
<br>
/random  to who ever wants it  *example* /random 1 100 highest wins!<br>
<br>
/points &quot; who ever has most points win item &quot; ( done in guilds alot)<br>
<br>
/guild leader/raid leader&quot;officers&quot; choose who wins what item.<br>
<br>
I talked to srail about 1 day after the event and he said something along the lines of <br>
<br>
 &quot; ill prob give back lance to vllad  but im gonna keep it right now so i can clear every thing up &quot; <br>
<br>
then about  4 days later  i asked him again  DO you plan to give lance back ????<br>
<br>
 Srail tells you , &quot; gm said i did nothing wrong with looting the lance  &quot;   Then he logged out  and did not log on for a few days <br>
<br>
Now thats just BS  you did not help  with the 10th ring war you just walked around like a VULTURE waiting to loot stuff that you did not work for or belong to you !<br>
<br>
The gm is wrong  and you are wrong  here is another example of ninja looting just like you did &quot; srail &quot; <br>
<br>
bard_02 loots lord nagafen Red scale and logs off before the raid can /random between the other people !<br>
<br>
newbie_level_56_ loots plate breastplate in kael before the raid can chose who wins point value wise !<br>
<br>
Group of 6 in  frenzy in lower guk kill frenzied ghoul and Fbss is on corpse.  * group of 6 talk in  group chat about what lotto rules are and if its need before greed * but wait !<br>
Random  level 20 monk iksar walks in room and loots the Fbss then logs out in safe hall la~<br>
<br>
those Are all  same things Srail did on the 10th war he  NINJA LOOTED an item  that some one else won ! plain and simple then hides behind  it saying &quot; O but a gm said i was ok to loot it cause he found no evidence of ninjaing&quot; <br>
<br>
I hope your Guild Arcane asylum does something about you because they got some good members and i would hate to see thier name Trashed by some one like you.<br>

<br>
endquote.<br>
<br>
now, being that I figured you were pro'lly full of it, I went back through my logs and never found this exact wording which you claim was ooc'd.  In fact, what I did find was that after the fight was over, Ubar in shout asking for tells from who all wanted in on it, Vlladamir winning the lance, and then everyone realizing that you ninja'd and logged.  I clipped the log for your convenience and even have a handy-dandy link: <br>

As it is, CIH has never had a &quot;free-for-all&quot; loot for anything except twink crap, which this definitely wasn't.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usophiempryean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sophi Empryean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF66>(12/3/01 10:25:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: selling or trading narandis lance</span><hr size=1> Srails, you shame yourself and your guild. My condolences go to Arcane Asylum, who will suffer the consequences for your actions unfortunately, I know that I will personally never help another AA person until you are either booted from AA or brought to justice by your peers. It is a pity that you have gotten this far with this situation and I guarantee that it will not go unpunished.<br>
<br>
Why doesn't someone contact Nikolah personally in regards to this? I am sure that Nikolah would not look through logs and do nothing unless he was not fully informed of the situation, Ninja looting is a bannable offense.<br>
<br>
I know when the servers come back up, I personally will be contacting anyone I can who will listen from Verant and I suggest every person involved with the 10th ring war that witnessed this unfortunate event, petition as well and speak to Nikolah, the only way to combat people like this is to alert Verant of their actions and get them banned.<br>

FFA loot, right.  Even if someone made a comment like that in /ooc officers including myself involved at that war were telling you to give it up right after we found out you looted it off the corpse.  You are a thief plain and simple. It would be the smartest thing you've ever done in your life to return it to someone in Cats or CT to return to Vllad who rightfully won the item. <p><a href="http://www.crimsontwilight.org/">

I can confirm the lance was ninja looted (I have logs spanning from the formation of the group to the discussion which followed his actions if anyone is interested, but have no way to post them (very long)).  I didn't really think too much of it at the time as I assumed he would give it back.  Reputation is everything in this game, and it just never occurred to me someone could be so stupid.<br>
<br>
I guess what really bothers me is that the GMs appear to be unwilling to fix the problem.  Since Verant does not give players the ability to police themselves (beyond taking actions which are against the rules), Verant is obligated to do so.<br>
<br>
Here, however, it appears that the GMs would rather protect the right of a single person to steal than the rights of many.  There really should be some sort of trial system set up to review incidents such as this (a tribunal comprised of players, randomly selected (optional service, of course), the decisions of which would be enforced by the GMs).  The reason I say 'comprised of players' is because it is clear the GMs have neither the time nor willingness to deal with these problems properly.  Obviously the actionable offenses/general scope of such a system would have to be very limited.<br>
<br>
I know the people petitioning this passed my name along to a GM (I did a /report Srails with the text of him ninja looting the lance also - 20 lines of text were in my chat screen, but I think I got the wrong 10 lines), yet I was never contacted by a GM and as far as I know the other members in the group weren't contacted.<br>
<br>
I have trouble believing that the same GMs who have had every scam in the book attempted on them would believe the rather pitiful rationalization offered by Srail/Srails.  What purpose could be served by not fixing this problem?  Surely this is not the kind of behavior Verant would like to promote in their game?<br>

Ninja looting and then defending yourself on the basis that a gm said it was OK to do it is about as low as you can go. Perhaps if you had explained the situration as it occured rather then your warped story you likely told the GM, he would have had a different response.<br>

<br>
I'm pretty well known around the server and have some good friends in AA. Srails in hurtings AA's reputation right now and even if he returns the lance he will still be looked at as a Ninja Looter. My advice to you guys would be to remove him. That would end anything to do with AA.<br>

My first reaction was to pass the news along to an officer, who stated I wasn't the first one to /tell him...  At this time he was the only officer online, it just so happens that this particular officer is having major ISP problems for the last week or so and can't log on.  I'm not even sure the other officers got a chance to hear from him what happened and who he talked with about this from other guilds.  What I can assure you all of is that I will post it directly on the guild site so that none of the officers will miss it.  Knowing our guild and the officers, there WILL be a reconciliation here with the right thing being done.  Arcane Asylum is an up and coming guild on our server, the last thing we want is our name to be trashed by the behavior of one person.<br>
<br>
Srails, dude I'd love to give you the benefit of the doubt on this one, but with the number of posts and the people involved AND the rarity of such an item as you cannot use...  I have no choice but to fall on the other side of the fence, seriously trashing our guild's name because of a THING is not worth it, no matter how much cash you could make off it.  The fact that GMs won't do anything about it doesn't really say much, since the GMs are gimps anyway and never do much good other than grabbing bugged corpses and changing surnames when ur bored with ur old one =P<br>
<br>
This is sad occurence, and I can't really see our guild supporting someone who does things like this...  Do the right thing man, even if you believe you are in the right if just for the sake of reputation of all your friends in Arcane Asylum who will suffer because of your actions.  <br>
<br>
That is all, I'm sorry this is even a question right now and saddened you are showing such low character by trying to keep it or even sell it.  Everyone else out there reading this post, please trust that the leadership of Arcane Asylum will do whatever they can to fix this.  Be well.<br>
