    ks'ed/ninja/trained/pulled-a-Carlon<br>

<br>
Oddly enough, the blunt ask-them-directly approach works quite well.  Usually it's just a simple misunderstanding.  Haven't had anyone ks/loot/train/pull-a-carlon in a long time, though, although I heard monk legs were ninja'ed in PoG.  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, was with a bard and a chanter other night, and this pick-up trak raid at entrance couldn't ks our pulls, although everyone there was beating on em.  Was kinda cool =) Thx powerlvl.<br>

LOL in his eyes that was not against the rules.  Funny how someone would rather be known as a loot whore ninja over lvl 30 gear, rather than act like a human.<br>
<br>
In all my time in Cazic Thule as a younging questing for Decaying armour, not a single SK ever had a disagreement over who should loot what.  Never did any ninja or even dispute, we always fairly worked out who should get what, one guy only needed his decay BP so I defered, one time I only needed a visor so I was defered too etc...<br>
Only time I had to argue over it was this one time this Paladin was insisting he should get a shot to loot any decayed since anyone can do the quest.

No tangible outcome was yielded through this medium. Good place to vent if you really have your heart set on ruining a players rep for life though.<br>
<br>
Never ventured to calling in GM's, I learned they were useless the first time I met one.<br>
<br>
I've told one or two people what I &quot;really&quot; thought about their actions in tells before;-P <br>
<br>
OOC has never been my cup of tea.<br>
<br>
Something that really annoys me is the direct sabatage occuring a lot lately. <br>
<br>
Example: People took the incident with the ranger and looting as a simple opportunity to /target /flame phoenixx for the sake of doing so.<br>
<br>
Phoenixx will forever and a day be held under a microscope for some gating thingy and rangers can't gate. Every action will dominoe and add up to the next reaction. <br>
<br>
I could formulate an opinion on the Lodizal incident - but it is the person who knelt down and actually clicked loot this no drop item who should reflect on their conscience. Does it mean he must leave the server now to run from the permanent branding you guys have given him? Is he also going to experience the permanent dominoe effect?<br>
<br>
Other thing that just slays me is I saw a good friend of mines posts followed up on several times (in other forums) about kill stealing some door spawns...no sorry I think it was &quot;a&quot; door spawn..for like months. How freaking long can you be mad that a frog was killed? I mean some dude really did take my fire beetle at level 1 but doesn't mean I hold a grudge against him at level 50. <br>
<br>
Saw another very nice persons forum postings being kind of lurked with cryptic followups as if they have an outstanding grudge. &lt;--kinda like stalking but at least it isn't the outright intent to remove someone from the server by a public rock throwing fest.<br>
<br>
I'd go in to my own issues but I don't even see any point when there are so many other examples.<br>
<br>
And well I must say this, it is blunt, and I mean no offense because I HAVE done stupid things too.  This forum began as flame CiH...but lately there has been a higher percentage of CiH here to flame other individuals - an interesting turnaround. You guys have moved on from defensive to offensive.<br>
<br>
I am QUITE certain that there is at minimum 1 player on the server or in CiH who hasn't made headlines, but &quot;has&quot; done things either unethical, taboo, out of a bad reaction, or understanding....whatever. I actually &quot;know&quot; they have. Some situations are walked away from rather than published...I have witnessed some of them. <br>
<br>
What's up with this recent trend though, kind of weird huh? <br>

If on the off side the person is not answering tells or says, I find out if they are in a guild, if they are, I check their guild see if I know anyone.  If I do, and the person is still acting up, and not answering, I send a /tell to someone in their guild explaining situation as I see it and would they please talk to said person.
