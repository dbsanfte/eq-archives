Well alright because I am not going to sit back watching someone jump on the flame bandwagon on this Matona person. I personally wasn't there, never met the person in game either. So I'm certainly not here defending her, I think what that person did was uncalled for, plain and simple and till he/she pays back everyone she owes to then he/she is exactly what you all say of this person to be.<br>
<br>
*Story time begins, sit back, pop open a cold one because Balraks gonna get nasty from here on out, you've been warned.*<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I said all I will about that, next we move to Trewayn or whatever your name is, I remember you. I remember you being the bard who allowed yourself to roll on a CoF and won it. When MANY other tanks were there that needed it. I was there only as a backup since I couldn't fight naggy I was the buffing cleric since I was bored. Now as I made a post before I didnt mention your name but now I have, so darn the cats out of the bag. I barely play eq anymore, one reason is I am to busy in RL to play, another may be the fact that there's someone more important in my life that consumes my time more so than a game, besides if I do play anymore it's Anarchy.  I can't stand players like yourself to allow your character to roll on an item you can't use well. I even sent you a tell saying you are wrong. I don't play like that nor have I ever supported such greedy ways.<br>
<br>
Now you come here flaming Matona on something, yet you yourself are guilty of screwing a ton of melees out of an item on your raid. Bait and switch? Cat calling the kettle black. <br>
<br>
Yeah I saw some bard *I forget the name* saying you can use a CoF effectively, you can also kiss my/every other tanks ass effectively to! You're also effective at making yourself look greedy, clueless, being a knave, tasteless, pointless, boring as hell, tacky, without any sense of morales, lack of respect towards others and undoubtly very effective at being the second biggest bard jackass that the RAK has ever seen! We of course all know who the RAK thinks takes the top seed.<br>
<br>
You can try to retort that but seeing as of how many were there and pissed, I don't think you'll be gaining any sympathy from me or those others who were present that you screwed. <br>

<br>
At the current time there where 2 people leading vox/naggy raids Trewayn and Aquist<br>
<br>
If the same drop with 2 CoF's had dropped on an aquist raid guess what he claims all doubles!  so there wouldnt have even been a roll on it...he would have taken it.<br>
<br>
Now you can debate wiether or not bard can use CoF effectivly or not all day, but the fact is he won in a ROLL and USES it, he did not sell it as i have seen many people do with ALOT of dragon loot, he uses it.<br>
<br>
Trewayn won the roll fair, he got lucky, where as Aquist would have taken it and the other people would not have had a SHOT at 2 CoF's just 1...<br>
<br>
Regardless i hear all this whinning about trewayn winning a CoF...yet he makes his loot rules VERY clear...and gives you an option to leave.<br>
<br>
If ya dont like the loot rules please leave the raid DO NOT go then whine about it later.<br>

To saw the least it wasn't quite well. As I recall trewayn was having problems with a cleric who thought he should be in on a CoF roll if one dropped, I said absolutely not. It is a melee only item and it has been that way since the days of the first naggy kill.<br>
<br>
Now, if it's ok to let a bard in then why not a cleric, don't tell me a cleric can't melee, because I've actually out damaged many warriors in melee at the start of a fight, now if your new age rules are you say they are then you best let clerics roll on these. But now you will say but they cannot use them, so if this is so, then why a bard?   Now you backed yourselves into a wall, now your pulling the old do as I say not as I do trick.  A cof in the hands of a pure melee will advance their attacking far more than it would a bard or a cleric. If you believe otherwise than perhaps you need to lay off that happy weed your smoking and realize truth from fantasy. Facts to pure speculation. Show me right now how a cof benefits a bard more so than a monk or a warrior. As I recall a bards role in a group is not to be a tanker. <br>
<br>
As far as that paladin, yes I heard he did stuff like that and I wouldn't of gone on a single one of his raids, that's about the most pathetic selfish act I've ever heard of, well perhaps not the CoF was just as bad. Coming from EXP and speaking with many elder players such as myself we all agree'd on one thing, that a bard getting a cof is like giving a pure caster a haste item, sure they can use it, but is it going to be as effective as intended for the propper class weilding this item? Absolutely not, but then the mentality of the game has gone straight to the shitter, as I said its all me me me in this game, why do I even bother arguing over an item I can't use anyhow, I will tell you why, because I saw a hypocrite citing and flaming someone else who did something just as bad. <br>
<br>
Now on to Mren, I know that name. Ok mr big shot, tell me what's really on your mind. Are you still pissed I was going to let you die, your mouth just keeps getting you in more and more trouble. You see assmunch I was trying to actually be a nice guy, but you underestimated me now didn't you? You thought your intimidation tactics would scare me, hell boy I don't give a fuck who you know or what you know, one thing I don't back down to is some nature boy, like yourself. Oh yes I remember your threat, it went a little something like this, dude I will have my bud Shaere kick you off the raid if you don't heal me. I recall saying oh whats the matter big boy, worried I am going to hold up to my word since you wouldn't shut up and were to causing a scene and were warned repeatedly. <br>
<br>
Ahh but you whined and moaned some more as I recall, your threats grew all the more simplistic and quite enteraining. You see you couldn't do anything to me so you thought having your friend kick me from a raid would scare me, well guess what buttmunch, I came from Mith Marr, damn proud of it. Did you see me flinch when you mentioned the word Shaere? I heard at the time of people afraid to piss him off because they didn't want to end up being booted from raids. Well guess what I don't care who you are, you abuse something and I will tell you thats just the way it is. <br>
<br>
 I came up in the school of hard knocks, spent long hours perfecting my skill to make me the best damn cleric also the most original. I have accomplished both of these goals. Can you say that about yourself Mren? Were you the one to invent a tactic now used by all other warriors in the game? You see that Reso heal so many clerics use, guess who started that? Yeah thats right you clueless fucking asshole. I did, at the time most thought I was crazy it wasn't as good of a heal as superior heal and people would say I was wasting mana. Well it turns out I knew something they didn't, why because I know my class and when it's all said and done it comes down to that. <br>
<br>
You can run that mouth of yours all you want, simple truth of it is. You met your match, no no you met a greater power that night. You met someone whom you never encountered before, someone with no sense of fear from being threatened rather thrived off the challenge.You met someone more crazy than yourself and with that said it scares you . You know  I often refer to you as that little boy who would stir up trouble then run and get big brother to do your dirty work, well son where's your big brother now. Your not man enough to hang with the big boys, the big dogs. I owned your ass that night and I will continue to do so. I know it just tears you up inside that you failed to take me down, you couldn't even if you wanted to, no one can because what was it Synide said, oh yes he misses my flames because they had so much heart and emotion put into them. You can't stop someone like that. <br>
<br>
So ending this flame towards Mren, I've offered my invitation to hand you a person eq ass whooping and you've managed to always ignore the challenge, so now if you've moved onto AO, create a guy named Mren and when I see you, I let you know who I am. If you weren't man enough to take me on EQ, how about trying it on AO, afterall you're such a great player, time to put up or shut up. Right now I am located around Omni HQ, oh and I guess this time you won't have your buds around either to threaten me with, guess you'll have to finally be a man and face your problems. What a pitty, you have to go in solo. Sucks when you can't gang bang people with groups doesn't it, bullies of your likes always bow out when it comes to a good one on one, simply not as tough in game as you are out here. <br>

You are so elementary :).   Jeesh, where to start.<br>
<br>
Ok, first off you were trying to say Mren was from Tunare by him flinching at the fact that he was on Shaere's raid and 'flinching'.   Ok, first off Mren isn't from Tunare, you dumb-shit.  He's been on Mithaniel Marr a *long* time, just as different characters :).  But I gotta love you.  You make such an ass out of yourself it's amazing.  God, you're more hated than myself :).<br>
<br>
Bards and CoF.  Let's see, should they go there for that pos taunting orb?  It's red scale and cof.  Last I checked bards used fucking weapons, and they don't do a shabby job in the damage area.  A lot of time they can out damage paladins, they dual weild.  Which can put out a decent enough damage output to be benefitted by haste.  <br>
<br>
I doubt you're sorry ass could beat Mren in a duel.  By the way, wrestling is for kids, you silly rabbit :).   Most highschoolers have given up watching it too.  <br>
<br>
You were by far the biggest jack ass to stroll across these boards.  Tat... I just don't know, at least what you speel out makes half sense.  I can't get too deep into this flame until we start spewing personal attacks.  <br>

He must be like you Synide some little bitch who strolled to your local game store one day and bought the game expecting greatness yet the dark side of this all came out to be you became the biggest blunder of EQ. <br>
<br>
You see Synide, last I recall you were kissing my ass, eating out of the palm of my hand. Now you want to bring it on with the greatest of greats. Well just bring your redneck ass on over and lets just get it on. I'll be more than happy to show you what death looks like in AO,  over and over and over again till your eyes fall out.<br>
<br>
As to Mren, once again, another redneck pimp who thought he developed a name, the only name you two jackasses made for yourself were the biggest ass kissing morons that I've laid eyes on. You two candy asses have truely made a new double standard in game, one minute your kissing asses to be liked the next you act like the two biggest most single handedly spoiled pissants that I've yet to see on a board. You talk the shit but you end it at that, not once did you accept my invitation for a royal ass kicking as well. So pucker up son, bend over and the only ass you'll be kissing tonight is your own. <br>
<br>
Synide, do you think for a minute that by you or someone else coming out here saying I am the most hated offends me? Because if your kind is the most liked then I'll be damned if I want to be liked. If being a greedy pecker, who's to much of a puss to go head to head with someone is being liked, then again I am glad I am hated by your kind. Unlike most people, I'm not here to appease ANYONE but myself. So if you don't like me, well ask yourself this, maybe, just maybe the reason you don't like me is because you envy me, your jealous of me. Maybe you can't stand the fact I'm just a nice guy but you obviously did something to cross the lines in the sands with me. Funny, how you were such a big bad boy out here but when in game when I would enter the same zone as you and give you shit in ooc and warned you I was here and you better behave you were such a little pussycat. <br>
<br>
Oh and I realized something, you two twits weren't around in the good ole days of EQ, you're not aware of how loot was handled then so I can sympathize on one thing, your total lack of comprehending the loot tables and how it's handled. Because afterall, I'm old school and your pre-school so that explains your piss poor attempts at trying to make an honest yet pathetic attempt at justifying a seriously fucked up and greedy looting rights. Oh and about bards meleeing, I never said they couldn't. However they sure as hell can't melee like a warrior now can they? I know your to young to understand the ramifications behind all this, that's why I made the post explaining how it is to be, not how it currently works. Most people were not aware of these *OLD SCHOOL RULES*till I told them, now that they know, perhaps they'll think twice about undergoing such BS loot policies that I hear about anymore. Oh and wasn't it Jorply that said Synide why do you still come here, you did quit, rather had a ban invoked upon you. Kid tell mommy to go buy you a life, you've worn out your present one, except this new life, how about it be one with a little more sense.<br>

God god, ole balrak, you seem to be so ignorant of the fact that we're twinks.    Mren, was Dayna(sp mren)  human cleric back in the day, I was Tuyan.  I was sort of low level, but I *do* know how loot was handled, I talked a lot with Bugazi back then.    <br>
<br>
I guarentee, that you're the epidimy of the drinal community.  How you got in any guild baffles me.  They must be desperate for some greedy ass hot headed clerics.  I don't kiss too much ass, sorry to dissapoint.  I stick up for friends, that's all k thx :).  If you had more than 2 friends who really don't give a flying fuck about you, you might understand :).<br>
<br>
God, remember what I told you?  When you make up stuff you look like quite the ass.  Here you go doing it again.  :&quot;Maybe you can't stand the fact I'm just a nice guy but you obviously did something to cross the lines in the sands with me. Funny, how you were such a big bad boy out here but when in game when I would enter the same zone as you and give you shit in ooc and warned you I was here and you better behave you were such a little pussycat.&quot;:<br>
<br>
A.) You're not a nice guy, considering you ninja loot, what nice guy would do that.  What nice guy would consider being a cleric and not heal his own group-mate.  Notice I said consider because you *made* that little episode up dumbshit. <br>
<br>
B.) I can assure you, I've never seen you OOC in the same zone as me.  I would remember such a hot-headed arrogant fool trying to tell me to stfu, when he himself needs to.<br>
<br>
Gosh, you enjoy making a complete FUCKING ass out of yourself don't you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Because afterall, I'm old school and your pre-school so that explains your piss poor attempts at trying to make an honest yet pathetic attempt at justifying a seriously fucked up and greedy looting rights.&quot;  <br>
<br>
You're not old school, sorry to dissapoint hun.  You were always a poor ass sad fucker who has to ninja loot in hate.  That's greed, right?  Nice looting rights dumb-fuck.  Ninja'ing your own planar, not once, but wait was it two times?  Maybe even more?   You were always a n00b in hate, I guess you always will be :).   That's where you 've seemed to have made your rep.  <br>
<br>
Oh the ban didn't invoke me :).   I wasn't *active* at all, need I say it again.  I was going to trade account to MM which had a more active market, which means more ebays $$$.  <br>
<br>
Sigh, you sore piece of dumb shit you don't get it do you?  You keep going on and on about how you're the great cock sucker of all.  How you'd like to ride your dad's dick etc etc.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Kid tell mommy to go buy you a life, you've worn out your present one, except this new life, how about it be one with a little more sense.&quot;<br>
<br>
Make a little sense?  Try your fucking posts.  You make up shit left and right, not my fault you have to make up facts to flame.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Heh...If I wanted to make a 9 paragraph flame that doesn't make any fucking sense or amount to anything, I would.<br>
<br>
As for your stupid ass "wrestling" remarks.  Who the fuck still watches wrestling?  Haha.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oh and about bards meleeing, I never said they couldn't. However they sure as hell can't melee like a warrior now can they?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Based on your &quot;old-school&quot; logic, what your basically saying is that the best melee should recieve any high-end item that drops.  Okay, then lets say we go on a naggy raid, and I'm there, as my rogue.  And I outdamage every damn warrior(And cleric, in your case) there, that means I should go in on the CoF and warriors shouldn't right?  Wrong, as long as you can USE the item and as long as the item stats fit your class, then you should be able to roll on it.<br>

o and balrak, thinking you're the worlds biggest badass is the worst angle you could possibly play for yourself.  it makes you even more pathetic looking than you truly are.<br>
