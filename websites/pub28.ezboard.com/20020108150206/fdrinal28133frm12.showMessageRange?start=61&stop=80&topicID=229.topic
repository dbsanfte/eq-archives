<br>
Well.. so happy I stumbled across this little thread.. actually was pointed here by a wonderful Barbarian friend on Mith Marr who will remain nameless *grin*<br>
<br>
I have no axe to grind.. seems everyone else has done that.. although I wouldn't mind kicking the pile of shit that is left after you finishing hacking Truefart to pieces.<br>
<br>
Chalk me up as one of the idiots stupid enough to get involved (although only briefly), however I paid the price over and over. I could care less about the crap between me and True (with my druid Bluskye).. but when he pitted me and Merianne against each other... that is when I got pissed.<br>
<br>
It is in the past.. and I am glad someone had the balls to start this post.. it is about time folks see the snake for what he is. <br>
<br>
Meri.. if you ever EVER want to come back to MM.. I have 18K in the bank and will take my entire summer to PL you if you want.. I am here for you :)<br>

She will be the first to tell you that Saevan's account of everybody getting killed while I zoned out is a complete lie. Saevan grouped with me because I was always able to form a good group in KC, and I knew how to pull there. 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody&quot; consisted of Meri and I, and sadly at the time Meri was *very* subjective on anything truehart.  But as I mentioned even if you dont believe that recounting (why would I make something so small up?) ignore it, toss it out as heresay, and still look at all the other offenses<br>
<br>
[quote]
Gulmer had been playing his Shaman exclusively since I joined the guild. His Pally was not a good group companion for Silia, who he enjoyed grouping with daily. So when I went on a Fear raid and saw him playing Gulmer, I was quite surprised... but assumed he was there to get some Pally armor for his char and maybe start playing him again.

[/quote]<br>
<br>
<br>
Here it is again, you judging when and why people should play what chars.  This is the root of what people dont like about you, always jugding others coloring their motivations.<br>
<br>
<br>
[quote]
Saevan posted factless emotion filled dribble to endear himself to Silia. 

[/quote]<br>
<br>
Yeah everything I do is to &quot;endear myself to silia&quot; puh leaze.  YOU posted first and I responded to how I thought your post was coming off.  You said that you refrained from using names because you thought you would get a more fair &quot;ruling&quot; if it was hypothetical.<br>
<br>
<br>
[quote]
Once again Saevan posts a epitath of factless exaggerations and even out-right lies in the hope that nobody will dispute what he says... 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Hey I post what I know, the facts as I remember them, go ahead and discount all of my facts if you dont like them, I am sure there are countless others who can step in with their own stories<br>
<br>
<br>
since he feels Merianne is upset enough with me to not correct his made up history of past events. Merianne just might suprise you, Saevan. <br>
<br>
<br>
[quote]
. Merianne just might suprise you, Saevan. She was there too, and we did not die hardly ever. I remember ONE occasion that we got trained and at Right Moat by some adds... and YOU died there... and me and Meri ran and she got killed before making zone. So you take that one evant and try to say it was a regular occurrance. What are you smoking?
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Here is where you are right, Meri did suprise me, and she mentioned to me &quot;I never die this much when Truehart leads a raid&quot; one time after a bad City of Mist raid.  WHen I heard that my draw dropped and I bit my toungue again.  She was infatuated and I guess she didnt see things the way I did.  So yes you are right, Meri might disagree.<br>
<br>
However the 1 occurance you remember was long long after the events I am referrring too, in fact it was before I was in JD and just a recruit when these events occured, The point being that you REFUSED to listen to anyone else over such a small thing and causing multiple deaths.<br>
<br>
<br>
[quote]
?

And the Efreeti Raid that we got wiped on ... you were FD pulling and I was pulling off you. You got hit hard with a couple failed attempts to FD and died. I was *trying* to get close enough to /corpse pull you out and I got aggroed. And I had Meri pick me up and take me back to Lava and I took ANOTHER death to pull your sorry ass close enough to LBugs for us to get our corpses. So I don't know WTF you are remembering. Once again, 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
again this is AFTER the stuff I mentioned.  When I was FD I got a bad agro but I was actually yelling HOLD HOLD HOLD and you came up to agro the mobs.  My FD failed But i wasnt dead yet and was trying to get off another FD which is why I was YELLING HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD.<br>
<br>
Guess what happend? I got off a succesful FD with barely any life left.  But you had already refused to listen to  me and hold, just like yuou refused to listen to me before just like you refused to listen to Beckman etc....<br>
<br>
Also you did pull my corpse out , EVEN THOUGH WE ASKED YOU NOT TO .  Kania I think was there and we were going to summon corpses out to save everyone time.  BUT YOU WOULDNT LISTEN and insisted on doing CR yourself to show everyone what a brave lad you are.  Costing us much more time than was necessary.  Being in Lava getting a coffin from Neriak is pretty short work.  I thanked you for getting my corpse and never said a word about it aftewards, til now.<br>
<br>
I wasnt the only one thinking &quot;why is he so hell bent on running the show and wont listen to anyone else&quot;<br>
<br>
[quote]
You have a bad habit of trying to see which side is winning in a debate, and jumping on the side that is on top 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
actually no.  I am not jumping on any side of a debate, I am simply posting my opinions and the events that I remember which made me shy away from grouping with you.<br>
<br>
I was gung ho at first, but I couldnt figure out why no one else but Meri from your own guild would group with you, I was like &quot;oh well maybe they are busy with something else&quot; But they had already learned.<br>
<br>
Again at the time Meri did not see things that way, from her side of the fence you were the greatest paladin ever, I guess the other 40 of us in Jus Divinum were wrong and I just make stuff up to jump on the &quot;winning&quot; side of the debate.<br>
<br>
Despite what you think True NO ONE WINS in this situation,  by recounting the events that happend, I dont &quot;win&quot; anything.  By stating that Meri and I saw things very differently back then, you think that gets me in anyone's good g4races?<br>
<br>
You really think I responded to your hypothetical troll on the JD boards to get in good with Silia?  Puh LEaze Truehart.  Unlike you I didnt focus my time trying to make women in EQ fall in love with me.<br>
<br>
unlike you I have a girlfriend in real life who I respect,  I played EQ to hang out with friends and have a good time that was my agenda.  I was friends with Silia, Meri and many other women in game but never did I try and make sweethearts with any of them.  i have no hidden agenda of trying to make them &quot;bite the pillow&quot; i GAIN NOTHING from posting this. <br>
<br>
Unlike you not every move I make in game or every post is some calculated action trying to pursuade people to believe me.  I dont care who believes me and I know you are right that Meri sees things very differently from what I do, in fact there were times where she asked me about how people were perceiving you and her together etc... I told her that I try not to think too much about other people's relationships.<br>
<br>
So you see, I actually am posting stuff that would not raise my faction with people.  But I dont care, because it is exactly how I see things.  <br>
<br>
Try and shift things how you will calling me a liar and such, but even if you discount everthing I posted, well less controversial folk than I have other things to say.<br>
<br>
bottom line is no one wins with this type of situation, saying that someone is posting their accounts of this info to &quot;win&quot; or be on the &quot;winning team&quot; shows exactly where you are coming from and how you see things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/utruehartsundown.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Truehart Sundown</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/10/01 9:56:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> Ok, I had to return and reply one final thing to this thread and this is important to any here in Drinal that want to pass judgement upon me.<br>
<br>
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MERIANNE, EVERY SINGLE PERSON MAKING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME ARE EITHER FROM MITH MARR, OR ARE SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED ON MITH MARR!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Since moving here to Drinal, the only thing that can be said against me is that I ended my relationship with Merianne... one that this thread and the thread Tat started agree was a mistake to begin with, and should never have taken place. <br>
<br>
So my decision to continue with cleaning my house and ending the last vestage of improper behavior... which is my online romance with Merianne... is my only wrondoing here on Drinal Server. <br>

Needless to say, after emailing the entire situation to the JD officers, who then ignored the whole situation, I left JD forever, with much lost respect for those 'officers' at the time. No skin off my back tho, I made new EQ friends, moved on from the situation, and had fun again :)<br>

I always loved reading Truefart posts. All ass-kissing suck-up crap. Or of course him defending himself, always coming up with creative excuses to point the finger at everyone else, heh. Good old Truefart. Love ya bro :) Keep on entertaining :)<br>

<br>
Anyway just thought i'd post my 2 cents on the whole meri and truehart thing, i was guilded with them shortly before i left, and they both seemed to be very caring and honorable people. True would always brag about how great meri was and visa versa, honestly i had always thought they were married IRL until i read this thread that said different. I wish only the best for both of you as you head your separate ways and just try and keep in mind that we all make mistakes, the only thing we can do is learn from them.<br>
 I dunno i kinda related to what truehart said....you finally realize that you start making promises that you dont think you can live up to, get in over your head, and you realize it has to end before things just get worse, cus thats all that will happen in the out-come. Just play the game and keep in mind its a game and have fun with it and all the wonderful people you meet along the way :)<br>

There is no proof. How do I know that you arent making that up? What proof do you have other than the fact that you claim he said that? How many times do I have to say this before people get it? Where is the proof that there is really only 1 person and always has been the same person? You;d think that if he was really the same person, he would continue doing the things that he has been accussed of, yet he doesnt. <br>
<br>
Who are these &quot;many&quot; people, where are they? Why dont they post? <br>
<br>
EQ relationships suck, period. Been there, done that. Kill shit, its more fun. Relationships involve risks, risks that both people know going in. Sounds like things didnt work out for Tru and Mer, that sucks but it happens. He realized that he was being a schmuck and cheatong on his wife. Look, I loathe cheating, its the cardinal sin in my book when it comes to relationships. Its something Ive personally never done and something I almost cannot forgive when its done to me. Getting involved with a person in EQ while being married is so very wrong that it make my teeth itch. What he did wsa beyond stupid, beyond low, and believe me says something about his character. The things he has admitted to are enough to make me think that he is a low life shit licker. He is the kind of person that I personally wouldnbt want to have a damn thing to do with.  Tru likes to talk, that much is obvious, and I dont doubt that he is lying in regards to certain things. He is a schmuck.<br>
<br>
However I dont believe that the person who currently plays Eldarious is the same person who used to play Tru. Im trying to remain objective here, but I just dont see anything that proves to me that they are the same person. Their actions are different, the tone of their posts are different, ect. The only thing people say are things like &quot;many people know&quot;, and Im sorry but that proves nothing. You think I havent asked him about this? He is my guildmate and Ive never seen any behavior that made me think anything bad about the guy. If some of the accounts given here are to be believed (specifically the things Saevan mentioned) Tru has an ego when it comes to EQ, he thinks he knows alot. Well Eldarious has never acted that way, and believe me ego is very hard to hold in check. Its extremely difficult to hide all of the little things that make us who we are, and I see none of these things in Eldarious.<br>
<br>
Then there are the morons that choose to attack Seventh Ward in this thread, or make generally synide comments, pun intended. People who know nothing about us or what we do. You people are just sad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usilia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silia </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/01 9:08:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> Ell,<br>
you ask me how I know, and all I can tell you, is Merianne is my RL sister. She has sent me copies of emails, and I know what was going on before I moved away from my sister.  I respect your point of view, but what proof do you want?  How do you know I'm telling you the truth?  well if you knew me you'd know.<br>

<br>
In my opinion if this was the same person (and i believe it is) He would do anything he could to make his reputation better, seeing as how on MM eventually the vast majority came to dislike/distrust him. He told my sister recently &quot; I bet I could even get into UF now with my cleric&quot;.  (he tried to get in as Trueheart and got pissy when they were slow in accepting him and threw a fit)  Again, believe it or not.....<br>
<br>
Ell i respect you for trying to stay objective, I tried to stay objective when my sister got mixed up with Trueheart but soon found it impossible. I do understand how you feel.<br>
<br>
As to people talking about Seventh Ward. I think you misread what some people are saying.  Some of the posts here were direct posts or quotes from LD's own board. Posts made by Tru/Cold and i am going to say Eld (you can disagree if you'd like)  I do not think anyone was flaming your guild, I think people were showing you what this person posted.  Again, my opinion on the posts.<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm going back to MM now :) I'll leave ya alone.  I do pop on Drinal occasionally so if you see me on and wish to talk of this further, I'm also Silia on Drinal.<br>
<br>
Thank you for being civil Ell...<br>

You know I find it funny most people are out gunning for Truefart. If it is ALL everyone elses fault how come so many don't like him?<br>
<br>
He used to say, when he was in Jus Divnium, that it was always the &quot;Guys&quot; who hated him. Hmm might be that &quot;People&quot; just hated him. <br>
<br>

Pay attention, the person who posted that is the original owner of the truehart account, NOT the person who plays Eldarious. Therefore he is NOT in my guild, nor has he ever been. Only the current person who plays eldarious is in SW. So no, he is not in my guild, and I dont know him.

God, this is confusing.... 
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Yes it is, which is why the whole &quot;someone else playing the account did the horrible things&quot; is such a bad way to go.  A reputation is attached to the account, doesnt matter if Mother Theresa is playing the account from her grave now, the account has the rep since its to much work to figure out who is playing the char when.<br>
<br>
Also Truehart is very good at convincing people re: many things personally I have never heard of this Eldras character maybe that char didnt exist on Mith Marr. <br>
<br>
yeah its way too easy to point fingers at me and claim I have all these secret agendas and post all these &quot;half truths&quot;.<br>
<br>
Why would I post half truths about grouping with TH and trying to get to know him?  I stated what my motivation was, I was friends with people in JD, wanted to be in JD, and part of the recommendation was to get to know JD folk, pretty straight forward.  I saw Meri and TH in KC and asked if they had use for me in their group.  Not much of a secret motivation.  Also it was well established from the get go that they were a couple.  I was simply grouping with them to get to know them more.  Since I knew nothing about TH and based my opinion on what the events were, what is my secret agenda again?<br>
<br>
You can see plainly from Andraxx's post that Andraxx was ANGRY with the JD officers for smoothing over his tracks and not kicking TH out of the guild immediately.  This should tell you how much the officers bent over backwards for this TH guy , so much that a solid member like Andraxx would get pissed off and leave the guild because of it.<br>
<br>
That alone should show you how much slack TH was given, how much crap was kept quiet...<br>
<br>
honestly I have no idea who is playing the TH account now nor does it matter.    Imagine if say Clubber was let into your guild because someone else was playing the account... you could talk all day about who the &quot;clubber&quot; person is no longer playing &quot;clubber&quot; but this is part of the reason why the EULA prohibits account transfers.<br>
<br>
It sounds like Eld is a cleric char so it is obviously very valuable to a guild.  <br>
<br>
Again I have nothing to gain from any of my opinions on this matter, so there is no agenda other than getting this crap off my chest finally since someone else broke the silence regarding this whole deal.  I posted what I saw and how I perceived things... its MY OPINION on the matter, I didnt have any knowledge of TH going into  JD and learned from first hand experience....disregard my opinions if you like....none of it matters any more <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh by the way I commited 10 murders in Brazil but havent done any of that here in the USA so I am not a criminal! ;)<br>

I have never had anything but good experiences with your guild.  The copies of message board posts were the opinions of one person..  The posts were quoted to show some proof. But then, people could say that since it was cut and paste that is not real proof, that the quoter could have composed the quote and just claimed it was proof. <br>
<br>
The one post that was copied on this board was a post under Eldarious's account and then edited shortly after because it was written as Truehart not as Eldarious.  Again the cut and paste is no hard proof..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for any choas this issue has caused you or your guild, it was never ment to be derogitory(sp) towards Seventh Ward.<br>
<br>
Your trust in your guildmembers is a great asset and shows that you are a good guildmate/friend.  From experience I can tell you not to trust blindly, listen and remember what people say...Ask yourself what does the sayer have to gain by what they say.  Trusting blindly can hurt in the end.<br>
<br>
Ell, Dont just ask &quot;How do i know he said it?, but also ask &quot;How do you know he has not said that?&quot;<br>
<br>
You are correct Ego is hard to hide...it can be sugar coated but in the end it all comes out.  You can cover it up but sooner or later it will begin to show through.<br>
<br>
A rose by any other name is still a rose...<br>

I guess if I had seen examples of the trueheart ego in Eld I might be more inclined to believe that there really is only 1 person. But Ive not seen any examples of that. And I do believe that kinda thing is close to impossible to hide forever. He has never acted up on a  raid, nothing like the examples Saev gave. If I saw Eldarious doing things like those, I might be inclined to think that there really is only 1 person. But the truth is, Eldarious doesnt act like that. He listens to the raid leaders, he does what he is told. You can trust that he knows what he is doing. He isnt one of those clerics that you have to constantly ask for heals, ect. I cant but believe that if it was the same person, the attitude Saevan talks about would have reared its head on occasion. There have been times when we have had raids that didnt go as smoothly as we might have liked. During those times, peoples attitudes really shine through, and yet even in those stressful times I saw no evidence that would make me think that Tru and Eld are the same person.<br>
<br>
I guess for me it boils down to this, I dont think there is anyway it will be proved conclusively that it is or isnt the same person. I can see the points many people have made, and will admit they are persuasive to some varying degree, yet I feel that I have some persuasive arguements as well, adn that ultimately for those of us outside the immediate situation, there are good arguements on all sides. That being the case, I feel that I should give my guildmate the benefit of the doubt, I know that if the roles were reversed I would hope that my guildmates would give me the benefit of the doubt. So I hope that you all understand where it is that I am coming from here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/usynide3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synide3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/11/01 1:00:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /flame Truehart, Coldhart, Eldarious aka Propheci </span><hr size=1> This just in, Truehart is a vengeful Lesbian.<br>
