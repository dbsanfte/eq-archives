<br>
About 72 pages back in this thread and again about 36 pages back in this thread I suggested we just build a giant wall around Israel and the Palastenian lands and not even bother looking in for another hundred years or so...<br>
<br>
Well since that time I've really stopped following this whole circus as it's obvious it's just the same shit different century and nothing is really being done about it.  Yesterday though I read this article, or maybe heard it on NPR about building a wall around the West Bank, twelve and half feet tall.  Finally someone's talking sense, but they got it wrong.  I don't want to shut the Palestinians out, I want to lock them all in there together to either work the shit out or wipe each other out.<br>
<br>
Actually at one time I did have sympathy toward the Palastenian struggle, that time has passed, and even this rather conservative-liberal (yes I find myself to be rather conservative for a liberal) has lost paitience.  Not just with the PLO (or whoever they are), but also with the US and our pussy-foot around the real issues policy.<br>
<br>
Right now there are two serious threats to peace in the Arabic regions of the world.  Both are very similar in my eyes, and yet there's a world of difference.  <br>
<br>
In Israel the US has an ally, in fact we give them money and then sell them weapons.  This ally is currently involved in a strugle with the displaced palestinian population that has been displaced since displaced first got put in a dictionary.  Until September 11, 2001 Palestine or the PLO were in no way considered US allies, I'd rather imagine they were on all of the terrorist lists instead.  Since that date suddenly we're the great friend of the Palastenian people ::pussy-footing:: however, we don't send them money or arms, so this tells us something quite contrary.<br>
<br>
In India the US has an ally, they've done a few things that have pissed us off in the past (nuclear development) but all in all they're a lot like family to us, both being civilized by the great British Empire.  Across their boarder lies Pakistan, a country the US currently counts as an ally, but in the past has had mixed relations with.  These two countries, which did not exist as separate entities until the British got involved, are now on the verge of war, and some fear pushers would like us to believe it's the verge of nuclear war.  In this case the US seems to be vacating both countries... very strange and very wrong.<br>
<br>
I see one thing that needs to be done in both cases and I do not see our government even approaching the subject.  Both situations are being escalated primarily by terrorist activity that is aimed at undermining the current political boundries and stability of the borders of the Muslim World(tm).  Funny, this sounds alot like why we went in and dropped bombs all over Afganistan, except it's happening over there, and not here.<br>
<br>
Ok.  Get to the point Meienea....  Why the hell are we running away from these fights.  Both of these scenarios look like the same terror we were fighting in Afghanistan rearing it's ugly head elsewhere.  <br>
<br>
Rather than air lifting the 64000 troops (this number is probably wrong as my local newspaper is rarely correct) out of the region, put them to frickin' work.  Talk to Pakistan and India, I'm sure India would love the US to help them get rid of these terrorist camps in Kashmir, and if Pakistan is serious about their vows against terrorism, then they too will agree to routing out the terrorist camps in their own country.  I'm not saying the US should be the lead, but let's face it.... Can you name one country better equiped to bomb the shit out of a terrorist organization and send them running back to their mommies for fresh diapers?<br>
<br>
In Palestine we should approach Arafat and Sharon and not ask (asking these two just gets political double speak), rather tell them that we're fed up with it and WE are going in to clear out your terrorist population.  I know this in itself will not end the conflict between Israel and Palestine, but I'm positive that until these whacked out bomb wearing extremists stop there is no chance for real change in the region.<br>
<br>
I do not believe the US has to be the Lone Ranger of the Free World(tm).  However we said we were going to war against terror.  We said we would not stop.  We said the road would be long.... Is that just a lot of wind blowing out someone's ass or does the current administration really believe those words?  So far all I've seen is knee jerk reactions that are designed to intimidate those who would intimdate us, I have not seen anything that resembles a sustained war on terror.  Hell so far all we've realy done is repeat the Soviet-Afghan war... <br>

<br>
I don't think you can compare our action in Afghanistan tho to the Russian experience; they got their asses kicked and so far it's been the other way around.<br>
<br>
But I do think that we ought to not be bashful about going after terrorism wherever it pops up; or allowing others to do it as well.<br>
<br>
For example, the current Indo-Paki crisis-- India should go in there and clean up that mess just as the Israelis did, if Musharef sic doesn't clean it up mucho pronto. I mean, whats the good of being a dictator if all you can accomplish is being a dick?<br>

When the Soviets and US finally withdrew they left behind them a country governed by might and fear, littered with mines (not all theirs), unexploded ordinance and countless bodies.  We (the US) washed our hands in the end... the Red Threat(tm) had been put down and we were done with it.<br>
<br>
This time it's going to be different though they told us.  This time we're going to put an 'International Peace Keeping Force' into place.  To date that IPKF consists of?  You might be holding it.  The current administration feels it's a waste of US Military Resources to put them on peace keeping missions.  Well the rest of the world isn't in this fight, they're just backing us, so why the hell should they pay to clean up our playground?<br>

<br>
The only difference now is that there are some land mines -- but having no roads, regional warlords, etc is nothing new and is not our fault.<br>
<br>
Bringing civilisation to a region that has never known it isn't our job.<br>
<br>
And if the so-called UN is going to really do it's job, it should go for it. Starting with a partitioning of the country into realistic tribal areas; Pashtun, Persian, etc.<br>
<br>
A lot of the messes we are currently seeing are the direct result of the pinheads of the British Empire imposing artificial borders on peoples; witness India/Pakistan/Kasamir, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, etc.<br>
<br>
Damned limeys should never have gone there in the first place with their mission of &quot;civilising&quot; the WOGs; it's the height of hubris -- unfortunately it only took them 300 years to figure it out.<br>

I watched a documentary on Afghanistan maybe a month ago in college and before the Talibon took over it was not a harsh ruled country. Maybe it would have been uncomfortable for you to live in, but the Alfghan people were much happier and were ruled in a way they felt more appropriate before the Talibon took over. Just because a country isn't run in a democratic order doesn't mean the people in that country are unhappy with their government.<br>
<br>
- however I still agree with your point that it isn't our place to correct the government of Alfghanistan, but the only reason we are intervening is because they are terrorizing the US. If they weren't the US wouldn't even be concerned with the Alfghan people. Thats the U.S's way of trying to look like the nice humane hero's.

<br>
But regardless, the fact remains that it's not our job to build civilization in that country -- we can certainly help support the growth of infrastructure, and provide financial and consultative assistance -- but Bush is right to avoid putting American ground troops in long term to &quot;keep the peace&quot; or &quot;nation-build&quot; or any other horse-shit Clintonian misuse of the military. Perhaps instead of constantly just bitching about the US, and passing gas at headquarters, the UN could get off it's ass and do something in that country -- like provide peacekeeping. Hell, the god damned French love peace so much I bet they'd make GREAT peacekeepers.<br>
<br>
The military has two jobs: break things and kill people. Ours do it very well.

They offered security in a very violent environment.  It wasn't until after they rose to power that they really became the corrupt PoS we had to put to sleep.  <br>
<br>
Much of this corruption came out of the general poverty through out the country.  The Taliban had the men, some weapons, but a serious lack of funds.  In order to secure the necessary funding they made their bed with the devil in sheeps wool (aka Yomama Beenhidden) and in doing so took the first step in the long downward spiral from fundementalism to fanaticism.<br>
