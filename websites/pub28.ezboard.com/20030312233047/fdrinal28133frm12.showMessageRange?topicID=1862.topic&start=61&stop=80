Consider this timeline.<br>
<br>
11/06/60 Lincoln elected president.<br>
<br>
03/04/61 Lincoln's Inaugural Address: &quot;I declare that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
August of 61: Fremont subdues Missouri and frees all slaves within the state. He is ordered to revoke his emancipation and is relieved of command.<br>
<br>
1862: Lincoln devises a gradual plan of emancipation, beginning with the District of Columbia wherein a slave owner will be recompensed at $300 per slave. It is hoped that the freeing of slaves will then trickle down..errr, I mean radiate from there.<br>
<br>
06/18/62 First draft of the Emancipation Proclamation is written.<br>
<br>
07/22/62 Draft shown to Cabinet. Thumbs down. It is &quot;put aside&quot;.<br>
<br>
01/01/63 Emancipation Proc is signed. Has the effect of freeing only those slaves in rebellious States now under Union control.<br>
<br>
December of 65 13th Amendment ratified. True emancipation achieved.<br>
<br>

<br>
What bullshit.<br>
<br>
Oooh yeah, boy, it took 4 years and half a million lives to free the slaves. /flame the GOP. Slackers.<br>
<br>
Lincoln's primary priority was the preservation of the Union, or did you miss that in school? To him, that was far more important than the eventual abolition of slavery. Duh. Oh, that's right, the principles of the party are to be implemented at once by it's elected officials. LOL. There is a little thing called the Constitution, friend, that can get in the way of instant implementation of the wishes of political parties. Add in a @#%$ civil war, and who knows, perhaps things might slow down even more? Frankly, I'm @#%$ amazed that they accomplished all that they did in a mere 4 years. After all, in 8 years in office, during peacetime, Clinton could barely manage to boff a couple of interns, totally fail at socializing medicine, and cave in to welfare reform -- @#%$, it took him three years just to pass the largest tax increase in history and his party owned the @#%$ Congress at the time.<br>
<br>
But back to your original assertion that the Party wasn't founded as an abolitionist party, which is utter bullshit. Lincoln didn't found the Party, hell, Fremont was it's first candidate. The fact remains, as posted above in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>literal platform of the party</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that it was founded as an abolitionist party -- and you squirming and flopping isn't gonna change that. Red herring all you like, yer wrong.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>

Note the k is now a kkk, whether jokingly or serious accusation the implication is that the Republican party is racist. <br>
<br>
Pindk said: &quot;At the time of the American Civil war Republicans were pushing for the abolishment of slavery and the Southern Democraps refused and felt it was a worthy cause to go to war over. &quot;<br>
<br>
Since we are all into the timeline note the reference to abolishment at the time of the American Civil war. <br>
<br>
Timeline from the US Library of Congress website:<br>
<br>
January 1861 -- The South Secedes.<br>
When Abraham Lincoln, a known opponent of slavery, was elected president, the South Carolina legislature perceived a threat. Calling a state convention, the delegates voted to remove the state of South Carolina from the union known as the United States of America. The secession of South Carolina was followed by the secession of six more states -- Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas -- and the threat of secession by four more -- Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. These eleven states eventually formed the Confederate States of America. <br>
<br>
<br>
February 1861 -- The South Creates a Government.<br>
At a convention in Montgomery, Alabama, the seven seceding states created the Confederate Constitution, a document similar to the United States Constitution, but with greater stress on the autonomy of each state. Jefferson Davis was named provisional president of the Confederacy until elections could be held. <br>
<br>
<br>
February 1861 -- The South Seizes Federal Forts.<br>
When President Buchanan -- Lincoln's predecessor -- refused to surrender southern federal forts to the seceding states, southern state troops seized them. At Fort Sumter, South Carolina troops repulsed a supply ship trying to reach federal forces based in the fort. The ship was forced to return to New York, its supplies undelivered. <br>
<br>
<br>
March 1861 -- Lincoln's Inauguration.<br>
At Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, the new president said he had no plans to end slavery in those states where it already existed, but he also said he would not accept secession. He hoped to resolve the national crisis without warfare. <br>
<br>
<br>
Considering the the secession occurred prior to the inauguration of Lincoln it is very likely the statement was made to calm the masses as he is coming into power in a government that is crumbling around him because of  the perceived threat of abolishment of slavery. I think its pretty clear all along and the reaction of the south supports it was Lincoln's intention of abolishing slavery not just limit it or the south &quot;existing slave states&quot; wouldn't have acted so radically. <br>
<br>
January 1862 -- Abraham Lincoln Takes Action.<br>
On January 27, President Lincoln issued a war order authorizing the Union to launch a unified aggressive action against the Confederacy. General McClellan ignored the order.<br>
<br>
<br>
April-May 1865 -- Final Surrenders among Remaining Confederate Troops.<br>
Remaining Confederate troops were defeated between the end of April and the end of May. Jefferson Davis was captured in Georgia on May 10. <br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that it took four years is no surprise considering a war is underway and knowing the rate in which our government changes. Abolishment of slavery is a radical change for the time and likely very upsetting to local economies.<br>
<br>
So knomh it was you not I that &quot;unloaded a broadside....fair is fair.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dude you're pwning yourself in this debate at least put up somewhat of a fight. <br>
<br>
To Dirra I am as conservative as they come. I am not going to defend southern republicans as there is a strong case of racism against them. Their voting records in some cases bear this out. I am also very disappointed that the Reps are for the most part the white boys club and allow this perception to fester going unchallenged for the most part. It hurts us every election cycle especially in states with high concentrations of minorities and will only get worse. The democraps know this and one of the reason they are so lax with regards to immigration and border security. Knomh is partially right. Knowing this and admitting isn't condoning it but by no means is reason enough to abandon your party. Us conservatives that aren't racist are in a better position to force change than Knomh ever could. Admitting our party's shortcomings is a start. Now if the democraps could only do so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The obvious fact that a war for secession was on-going isn't relevant to the the point.....that being whether or not the GOP is teh party of abolition or not. Which of course it was, technically.
