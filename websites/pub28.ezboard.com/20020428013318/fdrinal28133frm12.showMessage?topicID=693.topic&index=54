2  years ago israel PM was Mr barak who was willing to give almost everything to the palastinian for peace, including relocation of 150,000 israeli from west bank to israel, full palastinian control over the west bank and gaza strip, joint custady over east jaruslem, palastinian state etc.., the  result was that Mr arafat asked for more, including bringing back 400,000 palastinian rafuge to israel teritory(inside the 1948 borders) and full control over east jeruslem. that is the reason that Mr barak is not PM anymore. <br>
This days everyone in israel except the die hard left wings simply don't belive that Mr arafat want peace, that is also the rason that USA are willing to back israel activity since they also stoped beliving in Mr arafat. for example the weapon ship that was cought 4 months ago, when asked directly by Mr bush Mr arafat told him Israel lie when they say he is directly involved in this, well imagine how happy Mr bush was to learn from his CIA that Mr Arafat was directly involved in the planing.<br>
<br>
I don't want to go into to much details (this is after all a flame board<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but you all need to remember one thing this war is not only a religuis war it is also a culture war, between a westran culture  (israel) and middle east culture<br>
(they don't think like most westran people think, i will not go into more detail if u really care go read about the arab calture)<br>
I hope that one day soon Mr arafat will be gone(not killed), the man is after all very old, and that his succesor will be willing to take the hand most israeli willing to offer in peace<br>
And 1 more thing kaldrani the falanguht where not led by Mr sharon and there reason to masscure all those people where revenge for a messacre done by PLO 7 years before on there people, what can i say welcome to the middle east where people killed each other over things that happen 200 years ago(trust me it happen)<br>
<br>

He was born in Pakistan and grew up Muslim like most people there. His relatives were all Muslim, too. He thinks the Muslims just refuse to live in peace with anyone that isn't Muslim. <br>
<br>
His father asked a simple question about the Koran and his teacher (not sure what teachers of the Koran are called) slapped him hard in the face and told him "you do not question the Koran, you can only study it". After that he decided to stop being a Muslim. This caused all sorts of persecution. His own friends told him he can no longer drink from the same water fountain as Muslims or eat in the same restaurants as Muslims, etc. At the time, he had no religion, he was persecuted simply for not being Muslim.. He later became a Christian. His own uncle told him he can not return to his home village, or he will be killed by the villagers. All this because they don't like non-Muslims, even their own family. His father told him if he does not become a Muslim again, then he can never see him again, and they never saw each other the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
My roommate (who is also Christian now) is now afraid to get an American passport and fly back to Pakistan to visit his family. He says he thinks someone will find out he is coming from America and kidnap him and demand the release of terrorists in exchange for his life.<br>
<br>
His family in Pakistan lives in a small compound with several other Christian families. They have a huge wall around it and an armed guard.<br>
<br>
He says that Jerusalem never belonged to the Muslims. My Dad (who has a few Muslim friends) told me that Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the 3 holiest cities to the Muslims for various reasons. My roommate said that Jerusalem is not a holy city to Muslims and it never belonged to the Muslims, so I don't know which to believe there. <br>
<br>
Anyway, my roommate says that Muslims are extremely intolerant of non-Muslims (which I think is a large part of the conflict in Kashmir with the Hindus of India). This is just the testimonial of a former Muslim. I don't claim that all Muslims are terrorists, or that they all hate non-Muslims. This is just what a former Muslim from Pakistan tells me. <p><B><I><FONT FACE="verdana"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="880020">Ji<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ng</FONT><BR>60 Or<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="770560">ac</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="700980">le </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="661290">of</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="6115a0"> Dr</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="5519c1">in</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="4824d8">al</FONT></FONT><BR></B></I><BR>

<br>
I find that sad. Our culture is vastly superior, and I for one am damned glad to have been born and raised in it.<br>
<br>
Do I wanna impose it on anyone else? No. But that doesn't mean it isn't superior.<br>
<br>
There is not one liberal republic in the Middle East. Turkey comes close, but well we better not go there. There is no freedom of speech, relatively little freedom of religion (although this is a recent development), there is a rampant culture of death that glorifies suicide, murder, and torture of people that are not culturally compatible. Lying comes so easily to middle easterners that you normally just have to assume they are lying when their lips move. They have no modern literature other than that produced by exiles in England, France, and the US; they are bringing anti-Jewish propaganda to new heights over the past decades. Trillions of dollars in oil wealth, instead of helping their countries, has been squirreled away for the benefit of a VERY small number of oligarchs.<br>
<br>
The most exciting food they can come up with is hummus. Not that I am knocking hummus, I love it. But that and jerked goat are about it.<br>

About the only thing you said that had any bearing in fact was the bit about all the money going to the very few, but that in itself is very similar to life in the states, or anywhere in the globe where 90% of the money is held by less than 10% of the people.<br>
<br>
As far as art, literature and music is concerned, don't think for a moment that just because they're not on the Billboard 100 or the Barnes and Nobles best seller list that none come from the middle east.  The fact is that if you are a muslim writer you are probably writing in arabic or some other language not likely to be well received by western culture.<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree many middle east regimes are repressive, particularly of women and freedom of religion.  However it's only in recent history that western culture has advanced in these issues (I consider the last 200 years to be recent history just for the record, after all we're dealing with a planet that has been around for billions).<br>
<br>
Even though you are free to say what you like Dirra, I'd suggest thinking before opening your mouth, and don't be so quick to judge an entire region and many different types of people before you actually aquire your own understanding of their world. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

That is just so much horseflop.<br>
<br>
The question wasn't whether they had literature or whatnot but rather whether it was ok to think that Western culture was &quot;better&quot; than Mideast culture.<br>
<br>
Clearly, in my mind, it's A-OK to be proud of our culture and prefer it to that of the middle east.<br>
<br>
We make judgements every day about all sorts of things. We discriminate among all sorts of people, things, actions and the like every day. I am so sick of the liberal pukes who run around calling everything morally equivelent and saying that we &quot;shouldn't judge&quot; -- that's bullshit. <br>
<br>
That's the same logic that says, after 9-11, that we need to &quot;understand&quot; why these assholes hate us so much. We don't have to understand anything -- we just need to blow their barbaric asses off the planet.<br>

Beastmaze, thank you for your facts. They were informative and it's all I was looking for =) You can't eat up Everything your teachers say sometimes.<br>
<br>
Jing, the only reason I'm addressing this to you is because I'm from Morocco, North Africa. My entire mothers side of the Family is Muslim. I can tell you that they are wonderful people who are open to everyone Muslim or not.I am not Muslim and they have not rejected me or made an issue about religion at all. I am asking that you and everyone else please not lable all Muslims because of one particular group of them. Arabs and Muslim are all different. Some places like Pakistan and Afghanistan are very strict and prejudice against un-Muslims. However other countries such as mine, Morocco are less strict, have a constitution of equal rights and are not prejudice against anyone for not being Muslim. It's different where ever you go and individuals are different so its not fair to categorize and say All.<br>

Dirra- I usually like your comments, but that was not just lame, but totally wrong. The Arab Culture has donated so much more than just Hummus. Thats such a crappy comment. <br>
Look at all the artist who incorporate Arab music into their own such as Sting and Shakira, look how popular Belly Dancing has become( my gym just held a class on it), how about the popularity of couscous and lamb, What about the Mehndi kids are wearing which is actually Henna in Arab countries. America wouldn't be such a wonderful place if we didn't combine all the wonderful things we get from other countries. Half of the things us Americans do are traditions we picked up from other countries. For example Africans began piercing, scarification and tattoos way before Americans did and the reasons women wear white veils at our weddings is actually a Jewish tradition, not an American.<br>
<br>
It's also funny how you can't open your mind to understand why we got bombed and don't realize that America is not an angel. We've blown up tons of people and we got bit back in the ass when we least expected it. We do the same to them all the time. It's called having a double standard or just being completely blinded by everything the government tries to portray to you. Of course the government will sugar coat their actions. And I'm sure if you were a Muslim and in the United States and had to deal with everyone hating you, even though you love America and have lived here your entire life, you would be singing a different tune. Your the type that will never get a clue until you have lived in opression and have been through what others have. <p><img src="http://www.archeryclub.com/personal/arrora1.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uarrora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arrora</A> at: 4/4/02 12:55:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/umeienea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meienea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Master</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/4/02 3:54:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=693.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: middle east in flames</span><hr size=1> Egypt is the first one to come to mind. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

<br>
Let's digest what you said shall we?<br>
<br>
&quot;There is not one liberal republic in the Middle East. Turkey comes close, but well we better not go there.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you want liberal republics, but liberal thought should be shat on.... or at least that's the opinion you spewed forth one post later.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no freedom of speech, relatively little freedom of religion (although this is a recent development), there is a rampant culture of death that glorifies suicide, murder, and torture of people that are not culturally compatible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not going to argue this, although again I feel you are being to general for there are countries that are no where near as hardline as others.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lying comes so easily to middle easterners that you normally just have to assume they are lying when their lips move.&quot;<br>
<br>
And this would come from your personal experience, or are you judging all middle eastern people by the more visible bad apples?  Remember 'Read my lips....'?  How about slick willy?  I guess lying just comes so easy to Western culture that one must assume we are lying as well....<br>
<br>
&quot;They have no modern literature other than that produced by exiles in England, France, and the US; they are bringing anti-Jewish propaganda to new heights over the past decades.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first half of this is rediculous and unfounded.  The later half, again you are condeming a whole people because of the actions of some (mostly fanatic hardline islamic fundamentalists aka whacko's).<br>
<br>
&quot;Be Western and Be Proud!&quot;<br>
<br>
I am.  I'm very pleased that fortune smiled upon me at birth.  However that does not make any of your babble any less of propoganda than what you accuse them of.  I am not on their side, don't get me wrong.  My personal feeling is that Islam, at its core, is an evil religion and that millions and millions of people have been duped by the greedy and the power hungry.  I detest whackos regardless of color creed or cause.  However I refuse to condemn a people or a culture as a whole based on the actions of the most publicised. <p>Meinea Cloudstalker

<br>
It's a flame board for Chrissakes. <br>
<br>
Peace.<br>
<br>
I do want to apologize for using the word liberal in two different contexts, which somehow confuses some.<br>
<br>
Liberal democracy is a common term for the general form of government in Western Europe and the US. It doesn't mean liberal in the sense of liberal v conservative; it has to do with liberal in the sense of freedom. Sort of like a &quot;liberal arts education&quot; doesn't mean you just study the works of Roosevelt and Keynes. Hehe.<br>
<br>
The other use of liberal that I made was &quot;liberal pukes&quot;; in that case, I meant the touchy feely socialist leaning dingbats who generally vote Labour or Democrat and frankly, usually don't have a clue about how the real world works.<br>
<br>
Sorry for mixing them into the same message; figured yall would understand.<br>
<br>
Again, peace.<br>

Yes they send out press releases and hold press conferences. IT is &quot;fed&quot; to us by the free press run by for profit companies who have the freedom to comment on what our government says anyway they see fit. <br>
<br>
This is unlike the middle eastern countries you are comparing us to whos newspapers television and radio stations are owned and operated by the government. These countries &quot;Feed&quot; their people what they want them to believe.  Like text books in grade school with no maps of Israel or that claim the USA is Evil and we are Infidels.<br>
<br>
You are in fact a byproduct of our &quot;free society&quot; and you seem to have heard somewhere down the line that we deserved what we got on 9/11.  Im gonna assume you got that info from the college your so proud of or the american press. Please forgive me if you got that from a morocan newspaper. If our government was &quot;feeding&quot; us only what they wanted us to hear you would never have been bamboozeled in to such assanine thinking. <br>
<br>
Im not saying that our government has never done anything wrong or that it never will. I am saying there is no other government on this planet now nor has there ever been that has had the ideals of the USA. There is not and never has been a country that has tried so hard to do what was right and just as the USA. <br>
<br>
Please tell me just what we have done in Modern history to deserve being attacked on 9/11? Was it when we helped free kuwait from their peace loving neighbors in Iraq? Was it when we sent Billions of dollars of foriegn aid to every single one of those countries to save their children? Was it when we started buying the oil that runs their economies? Was it when we tried over and over again to broker a peace between Israel and its neighbors over the last 50 years?<br>
<br>
You mean the Egypt that Assasinated anwar sadat and the egypt that is sytematicly persecuting christians today and forcing them to convert to Islam under threat of death? Thats a great comparison of &quot;free societys&quot; M. (sorry couldnt remember how to spell your name )<br>

<br>
On the subjest of the mid-east crisis.  Israel is the oppressor, but has taken a chunk of land that no one wanted and turned it into a nation.  They have legitimate claim to this land as does the Palestinian people but the Zionists made something of it, not the Palestinians.  The Jordanians and the Syrians do not want the Palestinian people in their borders, but would rather let them be an issue they can rally around because no Arabic nation surrounding the Israeli land wants them there.  PM Barok and Slick Willy had an agreement on the table for Yasser Arafat which would give him about 90% of what the Palestinian people wanted (really only the leaders), but Arafat turned it down then went back to Palestine and told his people in his native tongue to continue what they were doing, terrorism.<br>
<br>
Now lets see who is backing who.  The Palestinian extremists whacko groups all get their funding from Arafat's people, who in turn get funding from Syria and Iraq.  The Israeli government gets most of it's funding from the US.  How about our friend Saddam Husein?  Why is he offering $25,000 per child for any family willing to let their children become suicide bombers?  Answer: to keep the war going.  Why else would he?  Because he hates Israel too, wants them out.  None of this shit that is being done is to get the Palestinian people any land.  It's to provoke a war.  Why aren't other countries offering the Palestinian people refuge at all, or safe haven till maybe some deal can be worked out till they make a peace agreement to get a Palestinian State?  Simply put, no other Arabic/Islamic nation wants them.<br>
<br>
I agree that some sort of peace effort needs to be made so that Israel gives up the West Bank and Gazza Strip and let there be formed a Palestinian nation.  Oh, by the way, for those of you that say Palestine was there before Israel if you look on older maps, you are wrong.  The area was called Palestine, it wasn't a nation.  That's how the old maps were made up.  That chunk of desert was nothing till the Zion people made it what it is today.  Please read up on your history.  If any Palestinian peoples were there in that region that used to be a desert, it was as nomads.  They took it and made it a nation much like the US did from Great Britian.  The Americans did not like the rule and non representation they were getting from their Parliament.  If Palestine thinks it's getting the same deal, in todays more civilized world, they can work something out rather than send in suicide bombers to prove a point.  What does that prove anyways.  Sooner or later, you won't have anyone left to blow up. <p><img src=http://members.cox.net/ysanne/sigs/highlanderrsignew.gif

here are some more facts.<br>
1) To Jing your friend is wrong, heruslem was under mulsiam occupation between 900AC-11?? (until the crusade) and ten from the 13??(the fall of jeruslem) untill 1917 when the Genral alenbi took it from the torkish empire.<br>
2) When u look for the reason that the war in the middle east is still going on after 50 years you need to look at the countries around us and look for the reason behind it, no one fight for s long unless they have something to gain.<br>
a)syria this is a country where a 5% minority (alouy) control the majorty so israel is a good place to direct all the hatered that is building there.<br>
b)Iraq- well we all know about sadam problems and he find it very conveniant to put the blame for his poeple hunger and suffring on israel shoulders.<br>
c) Jourden-they have had no problem with israel hance we have peace with them<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
d) Ejypt - got what they wanted from israel and are stending by the peace accord they singed with israel despit very hard pressure from fandumndlist groups <br>
e) lebenon - well since lebenon is controled by syria go look at a <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
f)Iran - this is at the root of the current trubles, over the last 15 years (since the end of -iraq-iran war) Iran is trying to gain dominance in the arab/muslaim world (not the same thing by the way mulsiam world != arab world) Since there main rival for the arab world dominance is Ejypt they find the issue of jeruslem and israel to be a very powerful tool, if you will look at the Main flash points over the last 15 years you will see Iran finger prints, from the hizbala to the hamas, from the weapons to arafat to the radical forces in Ejypt that call to break the peace.<br>
3) Dirra one of the main reasons for the current stat of affirs in the middle east is.... You guessed right the loveley modern westran culture you are so prude of, it was britain with there devide and control policy that actualy help starting the palastnian-jews in fighting in the middle 20s, it was there policy that kept the fire hot for the next 15 years, after that point well it was kind of to late to mend things but they didnt even try. Now again this is very deep and long subject but in short a culture is something the evolve over a long period of time, looking at the arab world current status, that is in big part result of westran cutlre meddling due to oil/politcal strugles in the west, and saying they SUCKS, is not the right way to judge a culture. By that tokan in the 30s you could have said Far east culture sucks since at the time almost all where monerchy.<br>
You need to remember most of the none westren countries are suffering from the indastrail revoultion in a period of about 50 years those countries where forced thrugh changes that took the westran world 100  years to observe and grow past (changes that couse 1 WW and a few local wars) and they didn't go from the agricalture  to old age indestry, they go from agriclture to space indestry the shock is much much harder<br>
4) for those of you that think the USA,europe can come in and by use of force resolve this /rofl wake up and start smelling the fire in the balkan, the fact that you don't read about it doesn't mean that there is peace in kosovo, the fire is still going, it's just don't hit the news pages anymore. people are still daying, people are still been raped only now it's side B doing it to side A instead of the other way around. over the last 20 years UN forces had failed to bring peace by force in money places, only way a peace can be echive in anyplace of the world is when the poeple that are at war ready for it.<br>
<br>
So far for facts<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I am sorry that i am acting so high and mighty, but i hate to see people argue over the wrong facts, this fight is so complicated: it is belive by many that it is actualy the anger valuve of the middle east for all the hardship and calture change force upon them by the changing world. some think this is a fight based only on political reasons, some think this is in big part a $ fight westren countries have made 100s of billions from this war, and no i am not blowing the numbers, middle east countries are buying from the west milletry equipment in about 6 billion this year, in the middle 90s it was more. <br>
So when i see poeple that come and say things that show a lack of knowladge i can't help myself.<br>
<br>
As for me like i said i think at this point in time it's all revolve around Mr arafat if he decide he want peace then there is a chance (at this point it will not be easy he kind of lost control over some of the iranian baacked groups) if he don't we will just have to keep enduring the war until someone else come to replace him.<br>
