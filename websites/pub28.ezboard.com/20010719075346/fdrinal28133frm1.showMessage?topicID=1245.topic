<br>
Telling a crouded zone after a patch that /e now lists all mobs by there level. then like half the zone goes LD.<br>
<br>
or when some n00b asks if giants in oasis attack and you tell them no and they run up to a SG and get smooshed.<br>
<br>
guiding someone into a known bug then playing stupid :)<br>
<br>
telling someone with sow that none of the mobs in that dungeon sees invis. then before he knows it he has like the entire zone agrod on him.<br>
<br>
Now dont get all high and mighty on me. you know you have gotten someone killed or sat and watched while someone else did and you just sat there laughing about it.<br>
<br>
so what are some of yours? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ukerneytinkertrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerney Tinkertrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#993300>(2/10/01 2:56:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the funniest way you got someone killed?</span><hr size=1> i liked telling newbies that ice giants sold banded armor and gave away free lightstones.<br>

<br>
i asked, you want a bind, right here?  he said yes, here is fine.  mkay i said, and i bound him right in the middle of the orc grounds in highpass.<br>
<br>
next day i log on to look for a group, but no one was camping orcs that day.  The grounds were desolate except for one naked barbarian that was getting pounded on by half a dozen orcs.  I sit there invisible, thinking there is no way i can help..<br>
<br>
lo and behold the barbarian dies and repops back in the middle of the orc grounds, only to be pummeled by the same orcs that had just killed him.  It wasn't till then I realized it was the same barbarian i had bound there the day before..<br>
<br>
before i could feel the slightest bit of guilt i just laughed my ass off as the poor guy kept dying and repopping in the same place, each time trying to make his way to zone, and each time kicking the bucket only paces away from safety.  Eventually, the poor guy gave up trying to make it to the zone, and would just sit there on repop and get killed.. over and over.. he must've went afk, cuz eventually someone trained the guards and all the orcs were killed off.. well the poor bum stayed away too long, cuz by the time he got back.. 2 orcs were already on him <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uaakla2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aakla2</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=ttp://www.geocities.com/aakla2/EQ000014.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#993300>(2/10/01 3:13:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the funniest way you got someone kille</span><hr size=1> oh hehe Meeyagi was dueling Jorply in freeport at the tunnel and I split like 400,000 copper with meeyagi hehe :) that was funny <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uzandalay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zandalay</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#993300>(2/10/01 3:50:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the funniest way you got someone killed?</span><hr size=1> I HT'd myself ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ujanin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Janin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#993300>(2/10/01 4:00:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the funniest way you got someone killed?</span><hr size=1> the other night this enchanter had charmed a HG in west commons, I went about to buff him with every buff i could find.

i'd always say 1 or 2 HAGS!!!<br>
<br>
then there would be 4 or so<br>
<br>
but i think the best way i killed someone as of late was when i was transferring pp to my friends account and i handed her all the pp and teleported her to misty and when she zoned into misty she died by falling cause she was over weight,  by no means was it on purpose but  i laughed my ass off as i was gating back to get her from our bind point  =)<br>

He gets done zoning to his bind sight, and first thing he says is for us damn sk's to wipe those smirks off our faces cause it wasn't damn funny.  my sides were hurting i was laughing so hard and voroth sends me a tell that he can't stop laughing.<br>
<br>
an hour or so later vor and i are trying to figure out what to do with a couple of swirlspine guardians that had parked outside of our camp.  Erza comes up the chute in elemental form and immediately starts getting pummeled cause he didn't put invis up.  he runs around the room until he dies, and somehow split the 2 guardians with one on one side of the room and one on the other.  me and voroth were in awe at this perfect split.  had me laughing for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
I stood at entrance to tower/tae with Dachande one time looking at the full spawn. i was pulling tower and had to wait on him to pull tae.  I sent him a tell asking why he wasn't pulling.  he said his group was having an argument.  i told him to pull and they'd stop arguing.  he said ok and ran in.  a few moments later he comes out with a million lizards chasing him and pauses. right then i get the line: Dachande tells you, 'bastard'  and he runs on by and dies.  i fell out of my chair laughing at that one.<br>
