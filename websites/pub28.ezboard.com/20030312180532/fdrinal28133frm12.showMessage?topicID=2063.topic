enclosed in this message are the full /logs of the event, basically showing how IC failed to KS the assembled AoH/SotS raid and out of immature spite proceeded ninjaed some of the loot. <br>

i expected that these events would cause someone to post a flame, and i was quite upset when there was none.  despite zilertaler urging me to contain this information in an attempt to maintain inept conspirators outstanding reputation, i feel that i have a duty to those AoH/SotS'ers who got put thru such an ordeal to expose these scoundrels for what they are.  Thank you and God Bless<br>

I hereby deny any wrong-doing on Inept's (and especially my) part. You see, this all depends on what you would consider &quot;train&quot; and &quot;KS&quot; and &quot;ninja loot&quot; to be defined as.<br>
<br>
Clearly, this logfile raises certain doubts as to the credibility of my scrupulous reputation. However, I intend to address each of these questions one by one.<br>
<br>
First off, as my presentation shows, I had the full, undivided support of the denizens of Iceclad Ocean. Once they realized AoH was disputing our claim on lodizal, they became angered and attacked them in my defense, despite my urges to find a peaceful resolution.....<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.hawaii.rr.com/freeware/images/AoH2.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
My thanks goes to these courageous blizzard-people who gave their lives so that Inept would not be bullied out of our camp by AoH.<br>
<br>
But AoH did not stop there. After being attacked by the snow blizzards, they proceeded to steal pull after pull of my snow blizzards, even after I asked them nicely to stop, as can be seen in this screenshot:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.hawaii.rr.com/freeware/images/AoH3.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Still, I remained vigilant to find a peaceful solution as I attempted to strike up a peace accord with our mediator, Erable.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.hawaii.rr.com/freeware/images/AoH5.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Secondly, as far as this so called &quot;ninja looting&quot; goes...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Wed Jan 08 11:49:55 2003] --Zilertaler has looted a Knotted Turtlebone Ring.--<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I simply assumed that AoH regarded the map and ring as &quot;vendor trash&quot; because they had not looted it. Please keep in mind that when I did...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Wed Jan 08 11:57:23 2003] Zilertaler auctions, 'WTS Knotted Turtlebone Ring'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I was standing right next to snottius and erable at the time. Neither one of them objected.<br>
<br>
If anything, I feel violated! I'm amazed that my good name and reputation is being slandered in such a rude and obtrusive manner! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=2063.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=2063.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2063.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=2063.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/fr/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2063.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2063.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General Discussion<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames / Rants<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm29">POLLS<option value="drinal28133frm30">Testing forum<option value="drinal28133frm32">Quests & Raids<option value="drinal28133frm36">Drinal Chat Room<option value="drinal28133frm37">Archived Posts<option value="drinal28133frm38">Doofy's Detention Corner<option value="drinal28133frm39">Admin/Storage</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames / Rants</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.eqdrinal.com">www.eqdrinal.com</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
