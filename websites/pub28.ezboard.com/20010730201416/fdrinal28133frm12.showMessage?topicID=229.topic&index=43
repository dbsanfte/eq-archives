I don't even know where to start or why I am posting here, but I feel I need to chime in (God help me, against my better judgement!)<br>
<br>
Truehart/Coldhart/Propheci/Eldarious...<br>
My experience with you has never been anything but positive.  I can say honestly that you have always been a good player, an amiable guy and never offended me in any way.  I do not have any reason to NOT like you at all, but I do feel the need to relay a couple opinions.  When it comes to EQ relationships, the essence of each relationship is the bond between friends/lovers/spouses (depending on your RL situations and/or your desires in gameplay).  The fact that such relationships occur is natural in any &quot;human&quot; environment where this much time is devoted.  People will naturally gravitate toward certain others, and eventually those people become friends/lovers/whatever.  The setting may be vastly different than real life because we are &quot;pixels&quot; really while we play, but the essence is much the same as real life (personal interaction between people)  And thus, the approach to the these &quot;friends&quot; should be identical to that which occurs in the &quot;real&quot; world.  I would venture to say that not many who play EQ are out to spite people, or &quot;prey&quot; on them to make themselves feel better (although we all know there are those 12 year old kids that just bug the HELL out of us =P) but there are bound to be some who in fact, do these sort of things.  <br>
<br>
*pause*<br>
<br>
I'm going off in a direction I hadn't intended...  To the point, the relationship you had with Merianne is and has been your own.  When it comes to dealing with emotions that, by your own admission ran both ways, you above anyone here aside from Merianne herself should realize that your choice (be it fair or not, it is your own and you have every right to choose freely) to end this relationship would hurt her and/or you.  Friendships in any form are hard to end in any &quot;world&quot; and hurt is generally the result from that end to one or both of the parties involved.  The part that I do not understand is this:<br>
<br>
About your history with women from EQ and the relationships you have had with them...  Why would a man with a wife and children EVER involve himself so thoroughly with another woman, even if it is online?  I ask you that not in an accusatory manner, but in genuine curiosity. You seem to have taken on a stance above making yourself out to be the victim of a campaign of slander, when in fact you have as much fault for letting things go as far as they did, and hold the blame for your &quot;reputation&quot; amongst EQ women in your own hands, shaped by your own actions.  The fact that you have shaped this reputation in the manner you have, while having a wife in real life simply stuns me, but then again there goes my false hope in the moral fiber of mankind.  We, as men have a certain role and responsibility in our relationships with women, be it online or not, that you seem to have forgotten about somewhere along the line.  That responsibility is honesty, trust, support and any number of things we as men have an obligation to uphold when we invest our time and ourself with a woman, and ask her to do the same with us.  I don't understand how or why you would let this world spill over into RL.  Yes I have and will continue to speak to my online friends about my RL issues/concerns, no I would never lead anyone to believe in something about me that was not truthful.  That fact in and of itself, completely boggles me.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;emotions&quot; involved here, Merianne's post, although somewhat sharp at certain points, did not sound vindictive at all, and in no way did she attack you as you have her.  I doubt very much that someone who cared as much as you say you did/do/whatever, would rip into someone like that and bully them into a corner by revealing things that were shared between you during your relationship privately.  To me, that is just childish and flat out rude.  Did she originate this post?  Did she ask for anything from you when things ended?  Did she ever threaten to reveal to anyone the things you have said to her in privacy in a public forum?  Did she ever do anything during your relationship to warrant anything but your kindness and companionship?  Even with the rumors that were flying around before the final &quot;straw&quot; was drawn, she stood by you and had faith in you when many others were saying bad things about you and how you conduct yourself around female players.  As a man who has been through relationships (with a wife and a family no less) I would expect you to understand the emotional upheaval she is feeling at this moment, whether she wears a proud face or not.  As someone who cares I would have hoped that you could let her mourn in her own way, who cares if she warns women about you?  You don't want to do this AGAIN anyway you said, so why should that matter if your only concern is game play and not the relational side of the EQ world?  I understand you wanting to defend yourself, but the facts are the facts my friend.  You have made your own bed, and sometimes you just have to lie in it.<br>
<br>
As for you and your friend and sharing accounts...  Nobody will ever know for certain who plays, or who they are dealing with when they come across your characters.  I very seriously doubt there are 2 of you, based on opinion, experience with all 3 of the characters personally, and just plain common sense.  Let's be honest for a moment, anyone who has 3 characters past level 50 in this game would not just up and quit because of this.  You have as much of an &quot;addiction&quot; (gah, I hate saying that word to myself even) as the rest of us to this game.  Saying that you have very many alternatives to retain your anonymity is a lot closer to the truth, but if we stop to think for a moment and think of the time invested, we all would come up with a solution most likely similair to your own.  Say you &quot;gave&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; your account to someone else and don't play EQ anymore, that way you erase the bad name you have unfortunately earned, while retaining the ability to play your high level characters for the fun/loot/adventure that a lower level character even twinked to the gills cannot hope to achieve without more arduous time invested.  I guess none of us will really ever know when we come across these characters...  /shrug<br>
<br>
I realize now that I have chosen which side of the fence I stand on, and I regret that we have to be on opposing sides because I have learned from and respected you as a player and a groupmate/guildmate.  But I for one, will not stand to see a lady as sweet and giving as Merianne (no matter what her alleged &quot;cyber-sex&quot; fascinations may or may not be) dragged through the mud by a man who cannot come to grips with the reality he has created for himself through his poor judgement and questionable actions.  As I have said in another way above, sometimes as a man you just have to take your lumps and wait for tomorrow to come.  Respect your history with her and the false hopes you led her to, if not yourself, enough to let it rest.<br>

Your points are well thought out and very accurate. I accept the admonishment willingly. Yes, getting involved in such online romances is not morally upright. I along with many others who are in RL relationships are guilty of this. We look at it innitially as just a game, and the romance as make-believe. Eventually real feelings develop and the ante is raised. If you take a look at every couple sharing a last surname in EQ, I guarentee you will find the majority of them are married in RL to somebody other than their EQ marraige partner.<br>
<br>
As to my unleashing of information about Merianne, that was a loss of temper resulting from her deliberate aims at trying to simply cause problems for the characters on this account. If it were simply warning others to beware of getting involved romantically with chars on this account, my response would have been...as it was...measured. She went the added length of posting on the guild board of my friend Eldarious' guild. Her objectives here were only to inflict harm and cause trouble, not just issue her warning. Since Eldarious has no plans or aims at getting involved with females online, I don't think warning females to avoid him would really be any trouble for him. She took my post and applied it to him with the intent of trying to make Seventh Ward be offended by him. It was a malicious cheap shot that was not called for simply because I asked Merianne if we could just be friends, and end our online romantic involvement.<br>

If you read my post more carefully, you would see that the relationship I spoke of in it was not Merianne but I was speaking of my first online relationship. There were many... including the one with you, I assume... that happened between that one and Merianne. And why do you always replace &quot;ended the relationship&quot; with the term &quot;hurt me/her/them&quot;? You always say &quot;Truehart hurt me ... Truehart hurt them... Truehart hurt her&quot; when the truth is, there was a reason my ending the relationship hurt you. That reason was that you did not want it to end. Otherwise, it would not have hurt you. So the truth is, I was a good partner... fun to be with, and I met your emotional needs at that time. The only thing that I did to &quot;Hurt You&quot; was to bring the relationship to an end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=110.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.threadControl?topicID=229.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=229.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=229.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub28.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="drinal28133frm1">General<option value="drinal28133frm2">Trading<option value="drinal28133frm9">Quests<option value="drinal28133frm10">Screenshots<option value="drinal28133frm11">Role-playing<option value="drinal28133frm12">Flames<option value="drinal28133frm17">Guild Information<option value="drinal28133frm4">Hate Raids<option value="drinal28133frm5">Fear Raids<option value="drinal28133frm6">Sky Raids<option value="drinal28133frm21">Growth Raids<option value="drinal28133frm22">Mischief Raids<option value="drinal28133frm20">Dragon Raids<option value="drinal28133frm16">Suggestions - Forums & Webpage<option value="drinal28133frm23">Epic Quest Raids<option value="drinal28133frm24">MISC Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133>Drinal</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12>Flames</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.drinal.com">www.Drinal.com</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
