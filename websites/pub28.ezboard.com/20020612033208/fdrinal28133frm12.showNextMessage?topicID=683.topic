<br>
When someone ask me &quot;Why you do not have your epic?&quot;<br>
If Im playing my Enchanter (Siusiu) I will say &quot;Yeh because I screw'd it up, GM not helping me so I can do nothing, but Im not going to redo it because it is boring, end of story&quot; Simple enough? so you understand what I mean? I have to warn you too, Im an Asian player, my english is so poor, so if you have any problem I suggest you to learn cantonese and try to translate the words you cannot understand.<br>
<br>
The how if im playing my Necromancer? (Jonartz) Soemone tells you &quot;Why you are level 60 and you hav no epic weapon?&quot;<br>
So I can make a very simple answer &quot;Because my necromancer is a corpse summoning machine, I do not play this character I have some other 60s as well, end of story&quot; Yeah, how true that when I have other level 60 characters so Im not spending my life playing a &quot;Not so uber&quot; character Necromancer. Up to here now you understand yet? ok, lets continue.<br>
<br>
So when Im playing my cleric (Didida), its only level 58, not quite high so someone ask me again &quot;Oh Didida you are in CiH why do you have no epic weapon?&quot;<br>
My answer will be like this &quot;Oh yeh because Didida is ranked as a Twink / Secondary character, I do not want to bother someone else to help with my epic since Im not a main and not always attend to guild raids with this character, end of story&quot; You understand? yeh, go no.<br>
<br>
So when Im playing my main character my Bard (Felldine), what if someone tells me &quot;Why you are 60 and you do not have your epic?&quot;<br>
I can only say this &quot;Oh yeh im missing my white and red dragonscales then I have to fight trakanon too, Im lazy or something but I can get it soon I think, end of story&quot; Hehe it is good to know Im getting it soon? But the truth is &quot;some officer says: Oh we do not have to fight Gorenaire or Talendor because no one in the guild needs anything from those dragons, or we dont need Trak too everyone got BPs already.&quot;<br>
<br>
No one needs anything from Gorenaire and Talendor : Good point, but they are the mobs which gives good haste loot and Shields, also paladin books for FAs, when some paladins in guild needs one to complete their FAs and Bard in guild who need scales for FAs, we do not do them, hehe. And the shields, &quot;many shields in the guild bank&quot; No one knows, and if not someone post a flame to awake the officers I belive the shield will stayed in the bank like forever until EverQuest is gone. <br>
<br>
No one ever need BP from trak in the guild, everyone got their BP: Well, At least I do not have my BP but I do not really care with, but when I posted something in their private board and point out something truth they do not even care. And saying I wanted loot because Im a loot whore and why I have to attack the guild and argue with loot? I do not attack the guild that is the first thing I have to explain, when the guild has something going wrong or the goal for the guild is actually going to a wrong way Im going to point it out and flame it, officers think that Im wrong and saying I attacking the guild, Ok. So how about loot? Officers showed them off, some officer telling me he got the 6th or 7th Belt of Dwarf Slaying so he is not greedy enough and they really did some discussion before they determine the loots, haha but why you have to tell me this I do not even care with or It is something related to my post either =). Then the same officer telling me another officer got the 7th Cleric Halo from Cazic Thule, and some other officer got the first drop Shroud of Veeshan and then the Staff from VP and some other loots (Pixels in game), cool and thanks for letting me know, although I know that already but thanks for reapeating the loot report anyway, something that is not focus onto my post and you pulled them out trying to turn my views to the loots and trying to attack me with greedy/loot whores and something bad, trying to kill my post because Im gonna affect the guild so you having no where to stand. <br>
&quot;Still understand? If you dont, please point out which word you need me to explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then back to the level and my characters, I always do my best to help the guild out, see my story:<br>
Ok when I wake up and I am free to play EQ again I log into my Cleric because Cleric is the only character that I need'ed to level, ok so this is always the same thing like you guys do, when you have a guild you will say GU-Hi or morning, and like the same thing some members replies and saying Hi to you then you will going to think about what you are going to do. But some officers send you a direct tell or maybe GU, whatever it is, saying :Hey Siusiu can you bring Didida to Dain we need clerics&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah right, sure I will help the guild out, It is not my main too but I do not care, heh not getting loot? I dont need them, I am not too eager to get loots, So I bring my Cleric to Dain and started to ruin my faction, oh yeh because the guild need us to kill Coldains and Dragons we are going to Ally with Kael, no problem!See If Im a loot whore Im not going to bring my character who cannot even enter the lotto because Im a twink and not a main =)<br>
<br>
Then someone in the guild are so jealous and wanted to flame me directly, the reason is Im having too many level 60 characters? Yeah ok, this is all my fault right? I told ya, because I work for a PC Game magazine in my place, Hong Kong ok? And I have to write EQ related roleplaying stories, ok? And I have to introduce the new zones and make guides as best as I can, ok? And I have the chance to have interview about the gamers in my place and I have to answer something that other players wanted to ask me, ok? So im like a Star? EQ-Star? lol ok Im not, Im most likely a casual player, I tried to not to online too much as I can but I cannot, because I have this job on me, I paid to Play EQ, woo so you are going to be Envy? This is not easy btw, besides EQ I still have some reviews previews and some other Game Guides so I cannot always sleep, hehe. Ok, so you got the idea why I have the level 60 characters? Ok.<br>
<br>
I can log on 3 of my characters at once, seperate accounts, I level myself fast, I know why I need 60, so I do not sleep and work on it over-night until I can reach the highest level then I can take a few days break, when you see Didida and Felldine is online at the same time, usually I have some really good Real Life friends playing my character, and Im focusing on Felldine, this is my fault again? Im not going to use my accounts to power level myself, I always look for guild peeps and ask whoever is LFG, many of you know that, why you have to flame me? Im power level? nah, I do not sleep, this is the answer and end of story. I play EQ, I have fun playing it, I do not sleep to make my level 60, I spent and I gained this, so please do not pull the level 60 characters crap to flame me ^^ =)<br>
<br>
Then again, talk about the members and friends in guild, and their epics. I grouped everyone enough in the guild, some of them are not though, but just ignore them here. I always have fun to chat with different peeps, because I do not power level myself in Wakening or Sebilis zone out =) Everything I heard from different members I will remember them and try to think about something to help them out. So now I know some of them need to get their epics done, and missing a few last steps ect. But officers always say that they will plan to do Chardok or Gorenaire or Sky ect Thursday Sunday Wednesday blah blah or the coming year, the plans are always getting delayed or being cancel'ed, hehe, I do not see anything wrong with it, but yes CiH is very weak to organize things, especially epics, whenever you going to join a raid you need to have at least 2 hours to wait for everyone to get online, get a port, CR, died ect, lots of problems hehehe. Lucky some members in guild can always provide gates, Me myself always logon a friend's account to do the pickups too, seeing some lazy wizards or druids in the guild not responding to ports/GGs Id better do it myself, see the point?<br>
<br>
What if your epic got delayed more than a month or longer? I will try to post something flaming officers and stuffs, you know they need to get their epics done but you are not helping them, Always telling them to do custom raids because officers cannot always taking care with everything of you, not like a father and son so you better do custom raids to get the stuff you wanted. This is not easy, as CiH members are always not willing to help with a raid that they do not have any loot, they refused if someone not an officer asked to form a raid, that is why we have to let you officers to organize a raid going. Like me If I can get my Hate piece easy just by a custom raid telling people I need to get my epic piece and crap, If I have the Influence to everyone in guild I wont need to ask Driztalin to help me getting a Hate raid going. Special thanks to Driztalin again, but too bad all the revs are not dropping the piece I need, but later I did another pickup raid and I got what I want, lucky though. This happened a long time ago, but Im just gonna explain why sometimes the in-guild members wanted to let an officer helping them to organize something because no one in the guild will hear a non-officer.<br>
<br>
So you are now telling me you are getting more epics now a days? I do not think so if not the flame post I made, you removed it though, but all happened after the post I made, in a very rude way, posted it with anger, but I got the points, you can just pull loots to defend yourself. Saying CiH is the Top 10 guild in EQ? Do not make me laugh, maybe it is true? but you are getting too proud right? Why you have to compare with other guilds? Guild wars? I dont see a point to compare the guild with other guilds in game, why you have to do this? =( The post on Emarr board listing the Top 100 Score guilds in EverQuest is a crap, do not even trust them, the list is gay, I belive the person made the list was just typing who all 60 to get the idea, haha.<br>
<br>
Go look at the CIH website www.catsinhats.net, someone who got the 6th or 7th Belt just got some new toy, Grats you. Getting sleepers key that fast so you can go in and loot something you do not even have to roll with someone else, smart one! everyone is planned? =)<br>
<br>
More to go, but Im gonna login and continue camping something, Im getting bored when everything is PH, so I made this post. thanks for your time! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uboofy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Boofy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/01 1:25:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   yeah...</span><hr size=1> I realize that I probably couldn't join CiH if I wanted to, but I'd rather not take that kinda rep hit.

You saying all the officers have 10 dain belts, and a buncha CT cleric halos.. First off they are both lore items, secondly not ONE officer has a dain belt except for Terok (who plays for every raid, and is on every day), And Barnak took his CT clerioc halo last in line, so that others would have a chance first.  I still do not understand... And when you said the part about the person just winning a new toy and then winning a dain belt, then a sleepers key (most likely me). Why are you so concerned if not 6 lines before you said that you did not care about loot? I spend an extraordindary amount of time playing EQ (been busy with testing past few days and last week) and I attend a big majority of the raids, why shouldnt I be entitled to the loot?<br>

Same with my epic, I waited bout 6 months for the guild to go to chardok, and yes it was my last piece, and yes we needed warrior FAs. SO I waited. Yes I bitched in /gu and got into arguements frequently, and even thought about removing myself, but I thought that removing myself will only do what? It will only push me farther and farther from friends and even having a remote chance of completing it, and I almost removed myself during a sky raid because I got so angry at something that was said towards me. But as I look back at it nearly 5 or 6 months later, I am thankful I chose not to cause we have accomplished so much and I have been introduced into so many more new great people, and have had the priviledge to become friends with them.<br>
<br>
I really dont know the exact reason why you lef the guild, whether it be members ignoring your needs (yes it happens to everyone), or you not getting help for epics (has happened to everyone at one time or another), or you just getting hassled about your many characters like Drexen did. I dont find leaving the guild a solution, it would just worsen the issues.<br>
<br>
Whatever, you're gone and I know most of the ppl in the guild miss you (me too), but it's kinda bad coming on a public board and falsifying so much information about the guild, and the way it's run.<br>

<br>
The thing you gotta realize is that most people in CiH have real jobs where we don't get to play EQ for a living, eating our bon bons and watching soap operas.  We have lives.  Whenever you went on about why soandso wasn't level 60 yet, and that its so easy to get 60, it really made me angry.<br>
<br>
Now, if you think you're the only person who is asked to play other characters for raids, you're wrong.  Remember our first PD kill?  I played Aakla.  I was in a really crappy robe, and guess what dropped...ding ding!  2 Azure Sky robes, an automatic win for me if I was there, but I was playin Aakla so we could win, and I don't regret it at all.  Also, I don't think you were asked to play your cleric hardly at all, but whatever.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm glad you left Siusiu because its opened the door for others to join.  Most recently we added Domiel and Gojira, most excelent players, much better then your powerleveled dumbass.  Yes they actually have skill because they played that class soley without being powerleveled.<br>
<br>
its kinda funny.  I almost did believe you got your account hacked.  In actuallity it was just a large ploy to make people feel sorry for your geeky 4-eyed fat ass.<br>
<br>
So, here is to you Siusiu - Lord of the Siusiuian Hordes..*holds up a beer*..may you enjoy your Ebay camping and your endless nights of experience camping.  I hope it makes for great writing for your magazine...if you're not lying about that as well.  Cheers!<br>

Phara dar's claw (very good weapon) and last night I got some pauldrons from Fear. and look howlong sov has been out. thats 2 good items in what? 6 month If i just played the game for ph4t l3wts i would have quit alont time ago. I play cause I have made frends in EQ and I just like playing EQ. the only difference between CiH and almost everyother guild on drinal is the mobs we fight. I was in a Dark Alliance, United Front. and the DD dynasty (like 5 guilds) and the people in those guilds where the same, we had the good the bad and the ugly. the only difference is the mobs we killed. <br>
<br>
CiH is not about about greed. we want to kill the tougher stuff, but in order to do that we need better equipment. we cant fight Yelinka with crafted armor and yak's. <br>

They're actually one of the better uber guilds out there though now.  Ya, and to tell you the truth siusiu.<br>
<br>
I agree with seniority, and people just bitch.  You deck out 1 warrior in your guild pretty well then move on to the next, etc.  Point systems can work just as well. I've just liked seniority, and saw no problems with it.  I'm kinda bias because I lead like 15 nag/vox raids and came out with some left over drums worth 10k ;) and watched 48 rangers go out with cof's, hehe.  Yes, there was an element of greed :). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ugwenhyfar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gwenhyfar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/16/01 8:09:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flame is like this long, come on read!</span><hr size=1> Jorply,<br>

I think all you guilds should just work together rather than compete for everything.  Imagine how much fun you could have if you could walk into Sleepers and take down Avatar of Veshun? (sp)  That would be so cool.  But you guys fight like this is more than a game on a computer (OMG!  Another &quot;this is just a game&quot; asshole).  <br>
<br>
Cats in Hats: Go guys.  Even though everyone hates you, I think you guys are awesome...just shear size and levels...you guys rock<br>
<br>
Clan S:  I'm a huge fan of you guys.  Ever since your ressurection, you guys have great players in your guild, including my best friend Doofy<br>
<br>
Crimson Twilight: You guys are awesome.  Gell...I promised not to tell anyone what you did for me, so I'll keep it like that, but just wanna say thanks again. =)  And last night at Naggy was great...  It was hard to keep up with all the rezzes you guys were giving me!<br>
<br>
Masters Of Puppets: Small, but Marias.. yer funny.<br>
<br>
Drinkers Of Ale: Funniest time I remember is when I asked the guild leader if I could talk during a guild meeting, and 2 secs before I got the floor, I downed 5 blackburrow stouts! &quot;Boofy, you now have the floor&quot;... &quot;I think Boofy just HIT the floor!&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone else:  You all rocked.  EoS was great...Kini and I had some differences, but she was still cool.<br>
<br>
I just think you all would have more fun (and less sniping raids if you all worked together).  Just my opinion.<br>

Not because they farm the suckers like AL, but basically no guild is anywhere close to competiting with them.  Only guild that I could see close to Cih is the Kindred.  I could almost see this as a downfall, greycloud once mentioned he was bored cuz he didn't have cih/tp/rf to compete with to spawns anymore, makes you unmotivated.  ALso i don't see why ur liking cih would matter about you getting into cs... ive always liked cih and i was a member of cs for quite awhile until just recently.<br>
