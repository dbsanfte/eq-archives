http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showMessage?topicID=747.topic<br>
<br>
Anyway I decided to post seperate as I think there is a bigger non flame issue at hand. And that is the eq drinal market in general. I am not crazy on the drinal market, frankly even as a n00b i enjoyed the MM market much better, sure the times where different, but on MM when naggy/vox was still a pretty respectable accomplishment youwould still see CoF and RBB's and white scale cloaks for sell lin nfp, and only hte people in the very high end uber guilds could afford them. On drinal you dont see too much high end game (by today's standards) being sold. How often have you seen a swift blade of zek for sell? How often have you seen a Yelnak earring for sell? These are just 2 examples of some high end gear (by today's standards) you dont see for sale on our server. <br>
<br>
Now this isnt a flame on the server or anything like that. What I do want to stress to the server and to the peopel who frequent these boards is that the cunsomer sets a value of a item. Not too many days ago I saw someone offering to pay 200k for a mana robe. Now granted a mana robe is a extremely rare drop of a tough mob or whateber, but this person will get his mana robe and the next person seling a mana robe will prolly want to 200k-ish for his/her robe. Another example is a fungi. Before the drop nerf they where going for what? 30-35 on average? Now what they go for 40ish? Peopel are paying 5-10more k for  a item that has been aruond for about as long as kunark has? Regardless of how rare it maybe now (i never camped it so i cant say on the rariety pre/post nerf) the fact has not been changed that this item ahs been around and there are a gazillion on the server. By paying 40k for one YOU are responsible for jacking with the market value. If no one is willing to pay insane amounts of money for the item what can a seller do? Nothing, but keep it and use it or let it rot. If they are hard up for cash they will let it go. Do not give in to overpriced items, you are not only screwing yourself but screwing over the market in general. <br>
<br>
Spells. Ok spells is a touchy issue. I play a melee (war) on main pc, and i bot a wiz-ho on my 2nd pc. I have a 55 mage, 51 rogue beside these too chars so i been around. I can say that I know first hand what spells mean to casters and what weapons/haste items mean to melee. Let me tell you THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. Similar yes, but not the same its like apples and oranges imo.<br>
<br>
I paid 3kish for CoTH for my mage back in the day and I regretted it but i needed teh damn spell what could i do ya know?. Well I didnt realize something then,  Patience > all. WIth eq evolving as it is and a expansion being released every 15months or so the prices will drop. There are very few items in the game that are truely unique. The fungi is prolly one of them (now before you say I am contradicting myself, the reason I think the fungi price should not go up is b/c there are already a gazallion out there, unlike lets say a manarobe which there is prolly less then three thousand {wild guess no numbers to back this up}). Let us remeber the times when Kunark BP/legs where the most uber items in the game for melee and, if you are really patient and bored can check allakzahem's boards on the individual kunark bp/legs and check for people's posts from long ago that said "you will never see a mylro/cobalt/be/dw bp for sale b/c they are priceless". Well low and behold, even on our gimp arsed server you see most kunark bp's for sell (cept cobalt/donal's it seems). <br>
<br>
When buying spells I personally will never pay more then 1k for a spell. EVER. I have a wiz so i realize that spells like sunstrike are rare, however I will not budge. Maybe I will never scribe the stupid spell, but so be it. I refuse to buy it for more then 1k. <br>
<br>
In conculssion of my rant, eq has is a consumer's market. The buyer has the power, the seller is subject to the needs of the market. If somoene is not selling something ot you at a reasonableprice then somoene else wil come along and do it. If you give in to the seller's wishes, the next seller of that item will ask the same if not for more. <br>
<br>
That is all.  <p><center> <img src=http://www.crimsontwilight.org/upload/xylor/expirement.jpg></center> <BR>

Patience &gt; all may be the case, but I'm impulsive, hehe.  Just because one person paid a ton doesn't mean another will.  The seller will realize that eventually.  There are those folks that have one rare item and hold on to it for dear life trying to get everything they can out of it.  There's nothing wrong with that I suppose.  The other side of the coin is the person who farms a zone and usually has a lot of something to sell which often goes for a cheaper price.<br>
<br>
Now when it comes to spells... that's a subject that touches home a little, hehe.  Since the first time I made Warlord was in Skyfire, as I had been there for 5 levels, I had a few hundred spells and half of which were some of the more rare ones.  A lot of them were given to friends or if i was generous, given in exchange for a gate/haste/clarity, etc.  When I see a caster selling a melee item for an arm and a leg, I have no problem jacking up the price of a spell he/she wants.  Usually for a little added bonus, I'll give Teir'Dal a discount, hehe.  Glad a lot of the spells I had were for druids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think Tedule got a couple of free ones for a gate, but that was the exception. <p>Valekrin Z'eimisra

How good are you when you don't have the group versions of the single target spells? C3, group Focus, Group Aego...Mass buff is a useless skill for you although it would save your guild tons of downtime.<br>
How good are you without the very essential debuff spells like Malo and such? Nukes don't land full time although they could, other debuffs don't land and so on and so on.<br>
How good are you without torpor when you cannot keep the cleric group alive which is eating modrods Mk2 all the time to have enough mana to keep the MT alive?<br>
How good are you without the Modrod Mk2 version? You are delaying heals as clerics always have to pick up a new modrod and cannot use the same one  times.<br>
How good are you without CotH when all your tanks are banished to jail and have no way to get out?<br>
It is up to you how much you spend on your spells of course, but spells are most important to casters. Do you expect your melees to also wait till their armor upgrade goes for 1k? This way you will NEVER reach anything in EQ but always be behind. Maybe that is not important to you, but to have access to certain guilds it is important. I doubt that CiH is interested in warriors with full indicolite or even better crafted. I doubt that CiH wants to recruit rangers with a Lamentation and a Dragon Horn Yak. I doubt that CiH wants to recruit wizards with ice comet as their best spell. Think about it. If the highend game is not your goal though, then nothing is wrong with your theory. Some people on the other hand play this game to get further and not want to wait all day long... <p><center>

I have been patient and finally got me sunstrike and I didnt pay 1cp for it as a matter of fact we camped juggs for a long secion on sunday and got some rare spells for others as well, so it is all about a bit of patience and in the meantime do the best you can with what you have and most importantly be there for others when they are in need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ulernz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LernZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sissy Wizzy</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 9:46:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2831.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: prices and the drinal market in general</span><hr size=1> supply and demand and ability to get it on your own.<br>

For people in lesser guilds or that freelance, these mobs are going to be out of there reach for many months to come.  Once you hit 60, platinum becomes worthless other then for horses, peridots, coffins, pearls, food, drink and twinking.  There is no armor at 60 that you can buy to upgrade yourself, its all mostly no drop or quested.  So why not spend all your plat on a spell you otherwise wouldnt see for many months?<br>
<br>
Being the &quot;spell guy&quot; in cih, I have people coming to me hourly, begging me to sell them group aego, kei, greater familar, and a few other semi rare SoL spells.  These spells arent rare if you can kill the uber mobs of SoL.  When I tell people 50k for kei, there response is OK!  They ask to be put on a waiting list.<br>
<br>
Likewise, greater remove curse drops off one mob in the game (rhag 1 in ssra).  This is not a mob that so far, cih has put much effort into farming/camping because other then this spell, his loot sucks for us.  We would rather camp other mobs and buy the spell from some other guilds that find him attractive to kill.  Our offer is a green scale (value 120k).  I'd even pay 100k+ plat for the spell directly.  To us, this spell is worth it.  100k is nothing for the guild to spend, for a spell that will greatly help us take down mobs.<br>

Some people in EQ prefer the high end game to the low end game. Some are completely opposite and have no wishes of joining a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
Trying to blame people for playing the market is like blaming the level 60's for killing the dragons. Someone out there WANTS to do it, someone out there WILL do it.<br>

Real life works the same way.. You can either use what you have to advance yourself, or sit at your house and fuss about other people out there making money.<br>

I am one of those people that *LIKE* to buy and sell on the Drinal Market, and would post more thoughts if I don't have a midterm in an hour and 30 minutes that I still have to study for! : )<br>
<br>
About spells.  I disagree with waiting for spells.  The sooner you get an useful spell the sooner you are a benefit to your friends and your guild.  I paid 50k for a package of spells including Blessing of Aegolism and in the one week that I've had it, I feel that I had been able to benefit far more than this 50k sitting in my bank would have gotten me.  Spells are a casters' life (even more so than mana).  Spells traditionally has been a case by case situation of what the seller wants to sell it for complementing how much the buyer wants to buy it for.<br>
<br>
I do, however, wonder why some of these high-end tradable loot that other servers frequently auction are non-existent on our server.  Is it because we are relatively newer or we are just not as market-intensive as other guilds in which the top guilds have lots of loot sitting on twinks and such?  Would love to save up $ to buy some of those really nice things =)<br>
<br>
More thoughts later, this post probably doesn't make sense.<br>

Now dont get me wrong, I loathe people who have the "my guild needs to put this into my hand mentality". In CT people who are farming ssra temple with the guild are the ones who are getting their spell book filled up, so I am happy with hhow we are handling it. Let me asky ou somethign tho, does group aego really help a cleric as much as single aego? Same for shamans and group fos? <br>
<br>
For recruiting and spells/gear usually most guilds take is that the better equipped he/she is teh better,but if they are underequipped it usually does not take away form that person. In otherwords superior gear canonly help you it cannothurt you. Same goes for spells and AA pointsfor that matter. <br>

To Xilith Tvyn: <I>"because I can't stand being in nfp for more than a few minutes at a time, and it's worth the loss to go and have fun playing instead of haggling" </I><br>
This would have been a very valid argument 2 months ago when /join market was not avilable, but now that it is avilable is this really still applicable? Dont get me wrong im not saying you are wrong, just imo that argument doesnt hold true, how many times are you bored during your xp group's down time or while your guild is gathering for x raid? Obviousely no one has any kind of a obligation to deal with the market if they so choose not to tho. As someone else stated this is Everquest not Venderquest. <br>
<br>
To Yaladan Windsong, gratz on sunstrike. Honestly from what you described that is the way I *like* to see things turned out. You put in some time and got your scroll, instead of just handing out 10k for it or whatever. <br>

CiH doesnt often sell loot that is dropable, it gets passed around the guild, eventually being sold internally to guild twinks for half the market value.  That BP that sells for 80k on the drinal market would sell to a guild member twink for 40k.  This helps keep teh guild fund up, while at the same time keeping our hard earned loot within the guild.  Other guilds are just starting to farm these encounters, so all the loot they get is going directly to their players.  Many servers have been farming ntov for 8 months now.  Drinal has only been doing so for about 4. (Cats lost a lot of momentum when daoc came out, along with September 11th, and didnt return to ntov enforce until the new year). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/uyaladanwindsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yaladan Windsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Emrok's Daddy</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/23/02 3:17:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2831.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: prices and the drinal market in general</span><hr size=1> Very valid point Lern, I also keep items for twinks that i eventually upgrade so as time goes by the old gear loses a lot of the value and many lower lvl people are able to get such items at a much lower price.

When we prepare for AoW there are always mass buffs incoming. Not to mention that group aego and group FoS give you 50 more hp over the single target version. A MT enjoys the 100hp gained just by groupbuffs.<br>
Furthermore keep in mind that a heavy raiding guild burns through TONS of peridots, so a mass buff group aego saves resources, for example: You have to buff 60 people with aego: Mass group buff costs you 4 peridots (or is it 8? I am not sure if the use of mass buffs only doubles the needed amount of mana or also the needed amount of components). Single target aego costs 60 peridots. 42 (84)pp compared to 630pp. I don't know how much you raid but we try to take down every single mob that looks worthy. Furthermore your raid force is prepared way faster. One cleric burns all his/her mana while all others are fm. On a high competition server like AB this can really make a difference between getting one more mob a day or not. Time is valuable, not only in RL but also in EQ.<br>
Also keep in mind that not EVERY dedicated player is in the fortunate situation to be in a guild that gets him/her the needed spells. So this person has no other chance than to either wait till the guild is ready or buy the spell. You are right when you say that the guild shall support you getting the spell, but keep in mind that some spells are just freaking rare and you can camp your ass off and never be lucky while another group gets your needed spells twice in an hour. What would you do? Buy torpor or don't be useful? That is the question here! <p><center>

Supply and demand.  Also, after luclin came out, the market went into havoc because people were selling their stuff and trying to outbid each other to buy horses.  This of course applies to the high end stuff, like Tranquil staffs, fungies, all sort of high-end goodies.  Prices are starting to normalize now, and as for fungi since the nerf, they are sky high because there are so many people who want them, and sellers can get them to bid higher and higher... and then becomes the norm.  It sucks, but it's the way of the market, no one sets these prices, they make themselves in a way.  Dunno about you, but if I hear that So_and_so gets 60k for a fungi, and I'm camping it, it drops, and I don't need it, I'll probably try and get 60k for it as well.  /shrug<br>
