<br>
1)  A chanter that doesn't want the melees to wait before breaking mezz and doesn't want to get hit, has the tools to do so.  Mind wipe line.....<br>
<br>
2) Yes a good puller can spend time pulling just singles to the camp, but it is much more efficient to pull back 3 to 5 and then line them up.  Why run back and forth those extra times if you don't have to.  <br>
<br>
3) Depending on where you are fighitng chanters may not need to med either (I have almost never needed to med in seb).<br>
<br>
4) Bards Rock<br>
<br>
5) Chanters rock<br>
<br>
6) Um....oh yeah all classes rock if the person behind the keyboard is quality.<br>

Lvl 54 enchanter LFG or Lvl 54 bard LFG- I think everyone knows who would get picked.--The enchanter-- For those enchanters that are getting hit so much that they die, its because they don't know what root is and the tanks suck. But luckily usually there is at least 1 good tank in each group. And if an enchanter mezzes one so much that they know they are gonna be beat on, before tanks break mezz, memory blur the mob. And if an enchanter is getting beat on thats what a healer is for. I have a lvl 30 bard as well and I understand that enchanters are always gonna get a group before me. Clarity that you always will have compareed to clarity you get during down time or a permanent 60% haste to a 20% haste and str. I think any tank would much rather take 60% haste compared to 20% and some str Its a simple choice. Verant has to keep making new and better things for bards since they are never getting a group when a enchanter is around. Now I like bards so don't get all pist on my post, but seriously the bard that posted this has to grow up.<br>

It did bring up a couple questions I have regarding bards (I have one but he is only level 22, so for practical purposes I don't know squat about them from a first person stand point).  I can understand the point that the long study on bards was trying to make about the rate of improvement in spells/damage/etc..  across levels not being comprable to other classes; however, I felt that this perhaps was too compartmentalized an arguement.  That is to say, the discussion compares bards to different classes for each of the different comparisons that are done. Doesn't this in itself just reveal an unspoken strength of the bard, i.e. versatility.  It seems that although the abilities are not improving at same rate, perhaps the versatility is increasing. <br>
     From a grouping perspective I find that bards are wonderful to group with because they can augment whatever group in which they find themselves.  Their ability to contribute seems much more dependent on style and need than other classes.  I always had the understanding that grouping was ideal for bards as a group and bard would thrive together.  <br>
     I want to ask about just the graph pertaining to damage.  If the bard is increasing across levels in damage output from a song, and is also increasing across levels as far as melee damage, wouldn't this allow for curves of improvement for damage per second that more closely matched other curves?  Wizards on that graph are only casting, same with druids, well shouldn't we then compare total possible bard damage output for a decent comparison.  Likewise, let's consider the healing done by bards.  During the time that a bard is providing some regen, aren't they also able to melee and/or help the group to take out mobs faster, therefore taking less damage (possible to consider this another form of healing)? <br>
     Seems to me that this link doesn't focus on the good things that bards can do, nor does it provide for fair comparisons.  An obvious point that is missed is that bard songs stack very well.  If the group wants less down time and more fun, seems that having a bard join is a great addition, regardless of level. They can fit in with different group make-ups better than other classes.  As with all classes, seems the only stipulation would be how well the character is played.<br>
<br>
Well, obvisously I am bored at work and thought I would banter for a bit. <br>

<br>
My first reaction is to just say something flippant, but instead I’ll take the time to explain why I think it’s a misleading report.<br>
<br>
While it’s certainly true that bards do not increase in any particular ability at the same rate as the other classes that specialize in that ability, that’s not restricted to bards.  It’s true of EVERY ability shared by a class that specializes in that ability and another class that doesn’t specialize.  At level 1, everybody pretty much has the same ability as far as melee is concerned.  As levels progress, the classes that specialize in it increase in that ability at a much faster rate then classes that don’t.  The less that your class specializes in it, the flatter the growth curve.  The same is true of healing.  At level 1, druids, shaman, &amp; clerics all heal at the same level of efficiency, but as levels increase, it becomes obvious that the curve detailing the increase in that ability is much flatter for druids &amp; shaman then it is for clerics.<br>
<br>
If you want bards to increase along the same curve as enchanters regarding haste &amp; mana regen, then you should be willing to give up all of your other abilities.  If you want to gain melee ability along the same curve as other melee classes, then you should be willing to give up your abilities those classes are restricted from.  A bards value is their versatility, not their specialization.<br>
<br>
It should be just as valid for every other class to complain because their versatility doesn’t increase along the same curve as the bard.  Clerics, enchanters, rogues, warriors, wizards are all classes that focus on specialization.  The higher the level, the more that specialization becomes evident.  Other classes realize this as well, but not to the extent of the specialized classes.  The more versatile your class, the slower your abilities grows, because you are growing in more then one area.<br>
<br>
Another aspect to consider is that, while thott’s graphs do a great job of showing how bards aren’t as efficient as other classes, and that their efficiency in comparison becomes worse as time goes on, he neglects to mention that bards aren’t doing just that one thing he mentioned.  When an enchanter is medding to cast that clarity he talks about, that’s all the enchanter is doing.  When the bard is singing some form of haste &amp; cantana, he’s giving mana regen, healing, stamina, haste, and also dishing out some damage.  Then, when the situation calls for it, he can temporarily sacrifice some effectiveness in those areas and include snaring, crowd control, travel abilities, debuffing, increased resistances, etc.  No other class comes close to the versatility of the bard.  I’m sorry, but saying that you should be able to multi task like that, and be efficient too is just a bit much, don’t you think?<br>
