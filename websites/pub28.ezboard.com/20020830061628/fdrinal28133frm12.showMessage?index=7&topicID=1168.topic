<br>
You should have emailed Kutch or Morbeas about it and talked to them privately first, -then- if they refused to settle this you would bring it here.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they decided to delete my post and lock the thread in which it was in&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't play anymore but ... umm, Kutch usually does what is right. My guess (Remember, I am a genius, so this is probably true <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is that Kutch locked it to keep the flames out of private to keep the morale up for Vice as a whole. He probably wanted you to email him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I rarely get very upset about this game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oops, mistype ... delete delete.<br>
<br>
&quot;But this actions which happened in Vice in the past week are beyond civil or any kind of loyalty for any of its members.&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost every guild has people like this in it (not saying the people in question are like this). It is just human nature to want to be at the top and some people will want it so bad that they will do anything, betray, or whatever to get it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, if I was you Meneldil I would email Elaylie and try to get this post removed and talk to Kutch and Morbeas via email.<br>
<br>
You always said flames were bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You werent there to see it.<br>
<br>
 I was the one the has done all the vital decitions so far in the new Vice, I was the one to tell morbeas to go away while I fix the guild - he didn't leave for cats - he was asked to leave and he did leave with the best intentions for vice, I was the one that got olik his officer-tag. I made people come back from the log-offs, I made people come back to vice. <br>
 Psykoth quit EQ because of Olik's issues. That was really hard to let go, I adore Psykoth - hes an amazing person, and I would give up all my chars to see him play again.<br>
<br>
 However,  it's a bad idea to talk out of assumptions, because you most definetly didn't know what went on in officerchats where you could clearly see that Olik needed a rest from officering. Heck you werent even in the guild, nor playing EQ! If you seriously think that getting a big guild like Vice up from the ashes of what it was - does not change you, then you might start think twice about what you say/write. I even notice on myself that I have changed a lot, nothing is the same anymore - but nevertheless I do whatever I can to make things work out.<br>
<br>
-Anyway... I asked him to tell the guild that he needed a rest and demote himself so he could do this in a proper manner without anyone know that he was demoted for lets say - making the life as an officer really hard. I've always said Olik is smart and madly skilled - and I still stand by my words. But he might not be officer material anymore. I'm not going into detail, because I still see a hope for him - but people like yourself makes it hard for me to work with this, because you think I rolled a dice and went just &quot;ya, we gotta demote olik&quot;.  <br>
 You know me, man... I don't get upset for anything people tell straight to my face, I rather learn of it. I have yet to do anything hasted in Vice either, and demoting olik is something that I worked 2 weeks with - to find reasons enough to demote. <br>
<br>
 My work for vice has never been for my own sake, and it's disturbing that it's questionned.  I've never done anything for myself in vice so far... I've never asked for anything, I've just worked as hard as I could to make things straight. And now...I'm questionned by someone who don't even know the story =)  Heck, I get tells quite often that people are impressed with what I've done with vice. I turned from ashes to a proper fireplace.<br>
<br>
As far as for morbeas in Vice, I had a lot of tells lately from a whole lot of people in Vice, that confirmed that morbeas should get a chance to prove that he is what we need at this point. Because once he told me that he was gonna do whatever in his power to help vice - no matter what it would be, or when it would be. And by demoting when I asked him to, and by coming back when I asked him to do so - he has, imho, proven that he really IS willing to do whatever in his power for vice. And that might be what Vice needs now.  We will see how things works out, I'm not gonna judge something I haven't seen yet.<br>
<br>
I agree that I haven't had the possiblillity to log a lot in the last days (but at least I was online to see what happened), but that's because I've gotten a mad project that has to be done within the next monday (19th) that is probably the most serious thing I've ever created ; a flightlog system for f-16 that stores all the movement of the plane into a storage device that the pilot can easily bring with him without having to disassemble the plane - this was a project given to me by the only guy in norway that is equal to the king in the norwegian army. Combined with this, my wife has a birthday today (18th). and ofcourse - yes - all this _does_ disturb my playing, but I'm never away for long. I even log in when I have a 5-minute moment.<br>
<br>
Everyone know that my job is to create stuff'n'devices for NATO and the Norwegian Battle Lab Experiment (NOBLE), and some times it just demands more of me - without giving me the possibillity to question it, nor reason it with my leading of vice. I'm no kid, I don't do things without a good reason, and I always take a good look on the options before I do something.  Now Lee, maybe you should do the same perhaps ?  Or at least - stop judging people from what you hear - and start judging from what you see youself ?<br>
<br>
What makes you think Oliks intentions were pure, and mine wasnt - without even asking me?  <br>
<br>
no dude... you are on your own on this. If you were a court judge, we'd have people executed for *might* have been stealing the neighbours apples, just because the neighbour was someone you thought was nice a few years ago.<br>

So I posted it on the private forum.  A couple hours later, it was deleted, the thread locked.  I am now banned from the Vice community.<br>
<br>
Vale:  My main reason for leaving EQ and Vice was Morbeas.  I'm not proud that I left Vice in shambles, but eq was becoming unplayable because of Morbeas.  As for Olik 'leading thirsty people to water', not to say your not a smart guy, but you have no idea how hard it is to lead a guild.  VK I have no problem with you, but if we aren't friends for whatever reason, so be it.<br>
<br>
Kutch:  I didn't make up these accusations.  I speak to Olik quite a bit and I speak to other vice members who still play.  I would've posted the first day I heard from Olik.  But I figured you guys would work it out.  I see after the posts by you and the Poll by Chitos you guys haven't and won't.  You act as i'm alone, but  before I was banned the poll was dead even on who people wanted as an officer.  Your a nice guy, but nice guys don't lead guilds, hell Morbeas was against you to becoming an officer.  Said you were a great guy, but you weren't a leader.  Zabban was the one who said we needed nice guys in the officer core.  It wasn't Olik who told me you don't log on at all, it was another officer.  <br>
<br>
I guess what pisses me off the most is you guys went behind his back to demote him after he had done so much for the guild.  How would you feel if the other officers went behind your back and demoted you as guild leader?<br>

This is not directed right at this one, because I know of a few other instances in other guilds as well where people try to hold up the flag and say &quot;Yeah, we know this person is ultra-abusive to other members, has stolen from others in game and out, acts like a complete and utter ass, but that doesnt matter because they helped us to beat mob_01 and they were always a good class_01&quot;. IMO no amount of skill at your class or whatever can justify your actions when you act like that. Yes, you may have made contributions to the guild or to encounters that were great, but that doesn't then give you the right to treat others like shit. Being a good player doesn't make you super-human and those around you sub-human that you can treat as dogs or worse. <br>
<br>
IF the way this person is said to have treated fellow officers and members is true, then it sounds like they made a wise decision. IF what is said is true about Morbeas being even worse, than perhaps they did not choose wisely on that account. Any of us not directly involved to know what actually happened in there though, are just operating on half truths and conjecture. Let them sort it out. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=229714 target="web">Aktunka Wormflinger</a><BR>

I'd point out first that I'm *in no way impressed* with the way Vice or Vice officers have handled and conducted themselves in all my or my guild's experiences with them so I would in no way want to defend their actions which I strongly disagree with...<br>
<br>
That said, while I'm not sure if he's a great leader or not, I really wouldn't know, I was literally shocked at what a good guy Kutch came off as when I talked with him regarding a recent incident of vice leapfrogging ntov.  He was really a stand-up guy and told me things about his job and leading vice that I honestly can't believe someone would admit to another officer in a rival guild. While I believe he had more power to correct wrongs than he attributed to himself, I was really impressed by his honesty and character.  I really doubt he'd demote Olik for no reason.  <br>
<br>
In contrast, I remember dealing with Olik over another ntov leapfrogging issue regarding Vice 2-3 months earlier.  While I have respect for him as a player and have nothing to judge his character by on a personal level (since he's always friendly with me), I was somewhat disgusted by the way he handled the event.  He was an officer and his method for dealing with the situation was to make nonstop verbally abusive comments on a personal level to 1-2 of our members in say, and trash talk our guild in ooc.  It has always been a CT tenant that any member doing this gets the boot, so personally I was appalled that an *officer* in a guild would do something like this.  Officers represent the people, and the people in a guild are responsible for the actions of their officers any way you look at it.  The issue was not handled responsibly and for Mene's part he didn't seem to step up as an officer to handle the situation himself.<br>
<br>
Meneldil, I had a great respect for you while you were in CT which totally turned the opinion of you I had previously had while you posted here on these message boards.  While you may or may not be right in accusing the Vice officers or being critical of Morbeas (whose temper, behavior, and actions especially wouldn't impress me as a vice member, although don't know the issues), it seems pretty low for you to come here and post this.  First of all, you quit 2 months ago didn't you?  You left the guild and the game, and it wasn't for the first time either.  How the hell do you know what happened in these issues?  Coming here after you've quit and racking on someone like Kutch using only *secondhand information* seems pathetic to me.  Also, why is this your business? If Olik didn't seem to have a problem with it (or more likely he knew how to handle it instead of bringing his problems to a soap opera board like this), why do you think it's your position to come here and make this post.  It seems to me Mene that you, and if your accusation are true you aren't the only vice officer who this applies to, couldn't handle the daily pressures and politics being an officer entails (as a friend says, it's twice the work and half the fun being an officer), and you decided to bring it here.   <br>
<br>
It sickens me when people think officers in high end guilds just get away with things easier and get more loot than average members.  Being an *involved* officer in a high end guild is more stressful and difficult than anyone would guess, so I don't hold it against you or vice officers personally if you make mistakes, but any way you look at it you should be ashamed for bringing this here Mene.  Politics is something officers have to deal with constantly, and it's not your place to bring them here if you can't handle them or don't like the way things go down.  It shows that you no longer have ANY respect for ANY vice member or you wouldn't do this.<br>
<br>
In anticipation of responses, I don't pretend to know who was right or wrong as far as the issues themselves here go, Olik might have been a good leader after all and Kutch may be wrong, I just thought I'd add my 2 cents and throw some defense out for Kutch by saying that it's pretty low-down for you to be posting this here Mene.  I know you keep searching to find (or in the case of vice, make) another guild that gives you the same satisfaction old WL did. All guilds are different mene and have good and bad traits, don't compare them all to old WL.... it's easy to remember just the good and not the bad you know.<br>

(as a side note about good officers being mean:  To quote Ecclesiastics, there is a time for everything.  Good officers know when to get serious with members, or if you want to call it that, mean.  However, you don't need need to be mean or rough or offensive to be forceful leader people listen to, and  even if you do need to lay down the law at times, there are plenty of other times (most of the time) to be friendly honest open and unassuming.  9 times out of 10 officers that are mean or attacking people when they don't need to are just jackasses who like to hear themselves issue commands and think they are in ctonrol). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/bdrinal28133.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=desiraey>Desiraey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>THogg's Lubba</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/23/02 7:52:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Vice Officers</span><hr size=1> Move over and hand me the bowl of popcorn this is getting good!!..i think ill just keep my 2cp to myself tho *) silence is golden!!!<img src="http://www.invidiato.net/images/des.gif"><br>

Trevize you need to stfu.  Cuz we're on a 2ndhand server.. nothing on this server would be original strats and shit as it'll all have been done.  So stfu and stop trying to act so elite.
