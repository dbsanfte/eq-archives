Seems nigh unlikely that many people (at least 10 I spoke too) would simply &quot;lie&quot; for the sake of dissing anyone.<br>
<br>
And FYI a screenshoted threat of &quot;ruining someones 10th ring quest&quot; was aqquired, and if that person has the TK name on it, why would you not have reason to worry about it from you? <br>

Umm, alright, but I have screenshots and the GMS are aware of the threats that were made. I have never done anything to the Kindred other than be nice to them, so this really is sad stuff.<br>
<br>
Being trained by newbies is a different story than being trained by a someone who specifically interfered and admitted interfering with fabels war a few days ago, as this is a REAL threat, as well as those who can simply log on newbies to ruin this. <br>

<br>
A few days ago, there was a dispute over the sea dragon in CS.  CT &amp; CiH had made an attempt on the dragon and wiped out.  In the middle of CR, Kald began marshaling his forces to come and give it a try.  I sent him a tell asking him to allow us to CR and try again.  His original reply was that we didn't have enough in the zone the first time to possibly win, which may or may not have been true.  It is certainly true that they didn't win, even though they felt that 1 or 2 more people would have made the difference.  I wasn't there for the first attempt, so I don't know the facts.  It doesn't really matter though, regardless of whether or not there were enough people there, Kald's next comment to me is what you need to know.<br>
<br>
Kald made it perfectly clear that in his opinion CT does not deserve any consideration and that as long as it's being done to CT it doesn't matter what the circumstances, he feels justified in doing whatever he feels like.  <br>
<br>
This isn't a quote, but it is a pretty accurate paraphrase.  If he decides to post something to the contrary, I'll take the time when I get home tonight to post the actual quote. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub28.ezboard.com/ushadowsting.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowsting</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/23/01 9:51:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub28.ezboard.com/fdrinal28133frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cgtcollege.org/billsasp/shad.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Sslithissik</span><hr size=1> I was not involved in what happened out in WW.

Onto the TK, Cih/CT thing, guys come on already. The mob will be back so stop crying over spilled milk. Just redo it, how hard is it to accomplish this goal? This is like watching two kids bitching and moaning over who gets 2 pieces of candy. There's MORE to go around so stop your bitching and trying to ruin others names.<br>
<br>
 I can honestly say I only had one bad run in with TK. It was long ago and we straightened things out, here it was all a big mistake someone got me mixed up with a barlak. Understandable mistake and I didn't take it to heart. In fact I've had many great friends join TK over the past and not ONE of them have I ever heard bitch about the guild being greedy, not ONCE have I had an encounter with TK KSing mobs. However I have had numerous encounters with CiH members who were intentionally KSing mobs, claiming zones and so on. You say it's in the past to let it go and I did, now what are the hell gives you any right to come here flaming out such a great group as TK? You have only one right, the right to shut the fuck up and remember just what shit you've done in the past and realize now just how it felt when you did the SAME thing to other guilds. You know it's true, so get over it and move on and redo the damn mob and shut the hell up already. How many peeps you have in your guilds and you mean to tell me you can't redo this? Think about it and let that sit in real good today. <br>
<br>
Now anyone who has a flame to this post all I can say is this, kiss my rosey red fucking American ass. Have a nice mother fucking good day and go fucking blow some shit up in EQ or Halo or fucking Metal Gear Solid or go kill Baal for the 15th million fuckin' time or go PKing on UO or go waste more money on AC. Either way, shut the fuck up about this lame, dickwad, gayass, fucking event and let TK alone, there's some superb folks there and I am sure CT and CiH have some real nice folks to now. So get over your damn high kicks your shits gone fowl now.<br>
<br>
Son of a bitch that felt good to lay down some lines on this board  again, now get the hell off reading this shit and go do something constructive. <br>
/JUDO FUCKING EH!<br>
<br>
Now I'm off to defend myself against those damned holiday shoppers. Take care, get over this event you few bitching Cih and CT people and move on, it's that simple!<br>

I know people from CiH, one is a good RL friend so i get a good chance to watch their guild chat a fair amount of the time.  All of them are good persons, that have a damn good sence of humor. Nodda and Shinro crack me up non-stop. <br>
<br>
I've also ran into a few Kindred members that have been some of the most polite and kind souls i've meet on EQ in a long long time. I believe the two guilds should work together more and stop the fighting.<br>
<br>
From my understanding, and correct me if i'm wrong. CiH had trouble on MM because of AL, but they seem to have taken an AL like hold on Drinal. Just a thought.  To the victor goes the spoils. Just make sure you don't spoil the game for others.<br>
<br>
To Throden, Word has it your one of the best necro's to come along in a long time. Hopefully I can get a hold of ya on-line sometime. <br>
<br>
Thats my 2cp, shred if you like i dont mind, gives me something to do on the weekends.<br>
