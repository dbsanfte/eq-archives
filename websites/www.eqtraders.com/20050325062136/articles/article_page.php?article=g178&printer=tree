<span class="headers">Geerloks and +Trade Skill Items</span>
<p>
<p>The original text for this post was written by Mewkus, with updates from various members of the message board community.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: What are geerlok tools?</b></p>

<p>A: Geerlok tools are items that can be equipped in your primary slot that increase one of your tradeskills by 5%. There is a different tool for each of the general trade skills. There are no geerlok tools for the race/class specific skills (alchemy, tinkering, poisons).</p><br>

<p><b>Q: What does 5 percent mean? </b></p>

<p>A: That means your current skill is increased by 5% with regards to success rates. For instance, if your tailoring skill is 60 and you equip a geerlok sewing contraption in your primary slot, any combines you attempt will have the success rate as if your tailoring skill were 63 (60 + 60* 5%). Do not confuse this with increasing your success rate by 5%.</p><br>

<p>Note that the use of tradeskill enhancing items does NOT change the trivial information for an item. If you are making something at skill 100, the item trivials at 102, and you are using a geerlok to modify your skill to 105, the skill check will go against the modified 105 skill (meaning the item is trivial), BUT you will not receive a trivial message. This confuses a lot of people who mistakenly ADD 5% to the trivial number when they're reporting it. Trivial listings for this site are reported off your RAW skill, not any modified skill.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: Does the final number get rounded up or down?</b></p>
<p>A: Guessing that since these numbers range from 0 to 255 which is coincidentally the same range of numbers allowed in a byte which is usually associated with truncating numbers, I would say that the resulting number gets truncated down.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: If my skill is 250, would one of these geerlok tools make my skill 262?</b></p>

<p>A: No, modified skills are capped at 252. In fact, once your skill reaches 240, any skill ups that you get would be meaningless since your skill will be capped at 252.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: If I get one of these geerlok tools, what do I do with it?</b></p>

<p>A: You would need to equip it in your primary slot. It is one handed and you can still keep your secondary slot item equipped. But, you do have to take off what was in your primary slot. It only needs to be equiped while you are doing your combines.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: I equipped it, but my skills listing still shows my old skill. Am I bugged?</b></p>

<p>A: No. The skill increase is only a "virtual" one with regards to the skill check, and does not display on your skill listing.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: Is it better to use a geerlok tool or an Int/Wis buffing item in my primary slot?</b></p>

<p>A: That depends on which is more important to you, successful combines or getting skill ups. If you’re more interested in successful combines, use the geerlok tool, if you’re trying to get skill ups, use the Int/Wis item. If you’re attempting something that is already trivial (ie you wont get a skill up), you should equip your geerlok tool. If you’re attempting something that is trivial way over your current skill (ie trying velious tailoring at 158 skill), your success rate is already pegged at the minimum chance with or without the geerlok tool, that you should have your Int/Wis item equipped.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: Where can I get one of these geerlok tools?</b></p>

<p>A: Geerlok tools are made by tinkerers. They are trivial at 215, so you’d need to have a good tinkering skill to have a reasonable success rate at them. Each combine requires a dropped item off a luclin mob and some parts that are only sold by one of the gnome vendors in Katta Castellum and Shadow Haven. The newer tools (alchemy, spell research, make poison, tinkering), require drops from Gunthak as well as a no-drop component sold only in the lighthouse in Gunthak.</p><br> 

<p><b>Q: Where do I find a tinkerer on my server who can make/sell me one?</b></p>

<p>A: Check the message boards for your particular server or <a href="http://www.tinkering.org/gps/viewgps.php">Gnome Positioning System (GPS)</a></p><br>

<p><b>Q: What are the recipes for the geerlok tools?</b></p>

<p>A: The <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com//recipes/recipe_page.php?article=141&rsa=Tinkering&sub=other&sb=item&menustr=080120060000">Geerlok Recipes</a> are available.</p><br>

<p><b>Q: If one of my skills is already over 200, will one of these devices allow a second skill to effectively be over 200 also? </b></p>

<p>A: Yes. According to Sony these were added to allow characters who had already specialized in one tradeskill to get a higher effective skill level in other tradeskills.</p><br> 

<p><b>Q: Will using the skill modifying items reduce my chance for getting skill ups?</b></p> 
<p>A: No, your chances of getting a skill up are not affected by your modified skill level. </p><br>

<p><b>Q: If I have multiple enhancing items, does their effect stack or does it use the highest percentage one only?</b></p>

<p>A: According to the most recent communication with Sony, the effects do NOT stack. Only the highest-bonus item of those you are wearing/wielding will apply.</p><br> 

<p><b>Q: What other skill enhancing items are there?</b></p>

<p>A: There are player-made tradeskill trophies, with recipes located at the primary recipe level for each tradeskill.</b></i></p><br>

<p>Additionally, there are many vendor-sold and mob-dropped +tradeskill items in the game. Known items with a +tradeskill modifier are listed below.</p><br>
