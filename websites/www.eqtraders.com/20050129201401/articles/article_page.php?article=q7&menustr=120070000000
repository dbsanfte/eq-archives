      <span class="headers">Rivervale Warrior (Proudfoot Platemail) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>This is one of several youngling armor quests in Rivervale. The resulting
armor is lore (other than bracer), no drop and HFL/WAR only. The smithing
combines are no-fail, and do grant some minor skill increases. It is a dull gold
in color when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the
bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts
for a second one</i></p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Dalorio Blistbobble'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Zonkers! You scared me! Well it is good to meet you
nonetheless young _____. Many young Guardians of the Vale often come to me for
guidance. If there is something I can help you with in your training you make
sure you let Dalorio know! In the meanwhile I will be working on my [trade]. '</p>
<p>You say, 'What trade?'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Well you see _____, I have been an aspiring blacksmith
for quite sometime now. I have spent mostly all of my spare time since I was
just a wee whipper snapper like yourself collecting different materials and
trying to craft anything and everything of value in our town forge.
Blacksmithing has always interested me and that interest is exactly what led to
the creation of my [special recipes]. '</p>
<p>You say, 'What special recipes?'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Well its funny that you ask _____, I have just
recently perfected my smithing recipes for Proudfoot Platemail. I would be
willing to part with my recipe along with a mold for each piece of this fine
platemail to any apprentice willing to [collect the necessary items] to craft
it. '</p>
<p>You say, 'I will collect the necessary items.'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'You will eh _____? I am happy to hear of an upcoming
Warrior of the Vale willing to collect the items necessary to craft their own
armor. I must admit that you could really use some armor because it can get
quite dangerous out in the thicket! Now back to business! To craft your own
Proudfoot Platemail you will need my magical assembly kit that you will combine
the items I ask you to gather for specific recipes. After you have done this you
will use the pattern I give you along with the material you have fashioned and
combine it in a forge to yield your armor piece. Now are you [ready to get
started]? '</p>
<p>You say, 'I am ready to get started.'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Very well _____, let's get to it! Here is my personal
Platemail assembly kit. Inside this magical assembly kit you will combine
certain items collected both from the thicket and our great city of Rivervale.
It is my hope that while you progress in your training and through the different
armor pieces that you will be able to learn of your surroundings both inside and
outside the Vale. If you are ready to start fashioning your items simply tell me
what armor piece you [want] to make. I have the recipe for Proudfoot Platemail
[Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and
[Breastplates]. As a side note, make sure you craft your Breastplate last due to
the difficulty of collecting the items for it. '</p>
<p><i>(You receive a Dalario's Assembly Kit, LORE, NO DROP, 10 slot container,
wt10.0)</i></p>
<p><i>(As you name each armor piece, you receive an Enchanted xxx Mold, LORE, NO
DROP, wt0.4)</i></p>
<p>You say, 'I want to make a helm'</p>
<p>Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Ok _____, for your helm material you will need to
collect 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Large Yellowjacket Tarsi, 1 Ruined Wolf
Pelt and 1 Jumjum Juice then combine them in your assembly kit. Once you have
crafted your Proudfoot Helm Material combine it with this mold in the forge to
create your Proudfoot Platemail Helm. '</p>

Tibia . '</p>

<p>You say, 'I want to make a greaves'<br>

important armor piece in any Halfling Warriors arsenal. If you wish to make the
material necessary for these Greaves then gather 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2
Ruined Mossy Rat Pelts, 2 Thick Grizzly Bear Skins and 1 Bixie Parts then combine them in your kit. After you have your Proudfoot Greaves Material combine it in the forge with this mold to create your Proudfoot Platemail Greaves.</p>

Dalorio Blistbobble says 'So you feel the time has come and that you have the
skills necessary to collect and fashion together all the items necessary for the
Proudfoot Breastplate Material? Well I don't think you would ask if you were not
ready, so please collect 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Fruit Bat Wing, 1
Giant Fruit Bat Rib Cage, 1 Giant Yellowjacket Thorax, 1 Large Yellowjacket
Tarsi and 1 Deathfist Slashed Belt then combine them in your kit. Once you are
finished, take this mold along with your material to a forge to create your
Proudfoot Platemail Breastplate. Also return to me after you are finished with
your Breastplate for I might have some [small assignments] for you. '</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what small assignments?'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Well you see we have been invaded by the Runnyeye
goblins many times before _____. However lately there have been more and more
attacks on our homeland with every attack being that much more brutal and savage
then the attack before. I need a brave halfling who is willing to [seek
retribution] on these goblins and show them who is boss once and for all. '</p>
<p>You say, 'I will seek retribution'<br>
Dalorio Blistbobble says 'I knew I could count on you young _____. As each day
goes by more and more bloodthirsty orcs set up camp in the thicket. They are
working together with the goblins of Runnyeye through some twisted alliance
brought forth by Lord Pickclaw to mount an attack on Rivervale. I strongly feel
that this attack may be more then we can handle. If we are able to find out how
they plan to attack us we can make sure that their plan will not be carried out.
Once you have obtained 4 pages of war documents from these monsters return them
to me and I will reward you greatly for your efforts. '</p>
